JAMAICA
Technical Assistance Loan Project
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Jamaica
Beneficiaries:        Ministries, other agencies of the Government and
publicly owned enterprises.
Amount:               US$6.1 million equivalent, including a capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms:                Payable in 17 years including four years of grace at
11.6% interest.
Project Description:  The project has been conceived to help the Government
implement and monitor its structural adjustment
program as endorsed by the Bank under a Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL).
The use of the resources provided by the loan will be
closely linked to the requirements of the proposed
SAL. The following priority areas have been
identified:
(a) Measures to increase current savings of major
public enterprises.
(b) Support in establishing new medium-term
development lending institutions--the
Agricultural Credit Bank and the National
Development Bank.
(c) Assistance in establishing a system for the
preparation and monitoring of a rolling
three-year Public Sector Investment Program.
(d) Measures to promote domestic savings.
(e) Measures to improve the efficiency in the
allocation of foreign exchange.
(f) Development of programs for better utilization
of agricultural lands.
(g) External marketing organizations and price
incentives to farmers.
(h) Rehabilitation of production and exports of
bananas.



- ii -
(i) Studies and assistance related to the
strengthening of agricultural sector
institutions.
(j)  Preparation of an Action Program to increase
non-traditional exports.
(k) Study of a phased eliminiation of quantitative
restrictions to imports and their replacement by
increased tariff protection.
(1) Studies on the rehabilitation of selected
industrial subsectors.
(m) Technical assistance to the Ministries of
Industry and Commerce and Agriculture.
The technical assistance loan would finance
recruitment of high level experts for key advisory
positions within the public sector, experts and
consultants for short-term studies and activities,
and training to develop local management
capabilities. A degree of flexibility will be
maintained through the use of unallocated funds to
cover unforeseen technical assistanceneeds that may
arise during the implementation of the Structural
Adjustment Program by providing unallocated loan
resources.
Risks:                 The main risks of the project are in possible delays
in the recruitment of consultants and specialists by
the ministries and agencies involved and in not
attracting and retaining adequate counterpart
staff to work with the specialists.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$6.1 million to Jamaica for a technical
assistance loan. The loan which includes a capitalized front-end fee of
1.5% would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 11.6% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
A. Introduction
2.        An Economic Report entitled "Development Issues and Economic
Prospects" was distributed to the Executive Directors in February 1982.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.        After almost a decade of sustained decline, the Jamaican economy
is beginning to resume growth. A new government, elected in October 1980,
is following policies designed to bring the economy out of its long
depression, and to correct serious structural weaknesses. According to
preliminary data, the Government has halted the deterioration and the
economy may have registered some growth in 1981.
4.        The fact that the Jamaican economy deteriorated over nearly a
decade is particularly striking as the country is endowed with natural
resources, has well-educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the advantage of
proximity to the large North American markets, and possesses a relatively
developed financial system. By the same token, however, it also suffers
from considerable disadvantages. The openness of the economy makes it
highly sensitive to international price and demand changes. In particular,
the lack of domestic energy resources makes the economy very vulnerable to
increases in the prices of oil; imports of this fuel provide about 99% of
Jamaica's commercial energy consumption. Its labor and capital are
internationally mobile, and massive outflows of both have occurred.
Recently, the burden of the external debt at variable rates has also made
the economy more vulnerable to increases in interest rates in international
capital markets. In the face of these external pressures, the careful
management of the country's resources simultaneously to promote short-term
economic recovery, financial stability, and structural reform, is the
central challenge to the new Government.
1/   Parts I to IV are the same as those appearing in the President's
Report for the Jamaica Structural Adjustment Loan.



- 2 -
B. The Jamaican Economy to 1980
5.        The economy of Jamaica was affected by severe disturbances during
the 1970s. The first years of the decade had repeated the brisk growth
performance of the 1960s, but the trend was abruptly reversed as a result
of external shocks and the impact of domestic policies. As a result, per
capita GDP declined every year from 1973 to 1980 and the cumulative decline
reached 26% by the latter year. On the external front, the increases in
energy costs in 1973-74 and 1979-80, the mid-decade recession in the
industrial countries that provoked declines in export volumes and in the
price of sugar and aluminum, and the increase in interest rates in
international capital markets, all affected Jamaica negatively. On the
domestic front, the Government's programs to tackle unemployment and
redistribute land coincided with the deterioration in the external
environment and eventually led to an overextended public sector and the
disruption of production; at the same time an increasingly populist image
of the Government destroyed the confidence of the private sector, both
domestic and foreign, contributing to reduce productive investment and to
increase the outflow of capital and skilled migrants.
Output, Unemployment and Inflation
6.        In 1980 total GDP stood 18% below the 1973 peak.  The expenditure
components of GDP (for which estimates only date back to 1974) show the
impact of the policies pursued; consumption expenditures increased their
relative importance at the expense of investment expenditures.   The share
of public consumption expenditures increased every year, from 18% in 1974
to 25% in 1980; the share of private consumption expenditures also
increased initially, from 68% in 1974 to around 74% in 1976 and 1977, but
it declined thereafter, fluctuating between 63% and 65% in 1979 and 1980;
on the other hand, the share of investment expenditures decreased from 22%
in 1974-75 to 12-15% in 1977-80.
7.        The agricultural sector was one of the few sectors whose output
did not decline during the decade. Overall agricultural production
increarcd at a trend growth rate of .7% per annum from 1970 to 1980. The
r tjor components, however, showed contrasting trends: while export
agriculture (sugar, bananas, citrus, coconuts, coffee, cocoa, and spices)
declined at a rate of 4.0% per annum, domestic agriculture (other crops)
increased e.t 3.8% per annum; these trends, to a large extent, reflected a
shif- in the use of agricultural land: while between 1970 and 1979 the area
de.vced to export crops decreased 27%, the area planted with domestic crops
increased 56%. The remainder of the agricultural sector (livestock,
fisher- an( forestry) declined at a rate of .4% per year.
8.        The poor performance of the export sector was heavily influenced
by developments related to sugar and banana production. Sugarcane output
declined thro-i',-'!out the decade, from 4.2 million MT in 1970 to 2.7 million
MT in 1980.   _  failure of the 23 sugar workers' cooperatives, created in
197 t; cultivate the land that belonged to the sugar estates purchased by



the Government in 1970 (45,000 acres, or about one-third of the sugarcane
area) was an important factor; these cooperatives were never endowed with
the managerial resources needed to operate effectively, and as time went by
cultivation practices and discipline deteriorated sharply.  Other factors
contributing to the decline were inadequate prices leading to the diversion
of lands to other activities, the deterioration of cultivation practices
leading to the spread of plant disease and reduction in yields and, in
recent years, the unavailability of inputs due to the foreign exchange
shortage. Furthermore, the sugar factories that were bought by the
Government (80% of factory capacity was eventually Government owned) were
managed deficiently and were progressively run down, compounding the
problems of the subsector. Output of bananas fell from 384,000 MT in 1971
to 69,000 MT in 1980. A major reason for the decline was the diversion of
banana lands to agricultural production for the domestic market, also a
result of inadequate prices. In addition, yields fell as a consequence of
the deterioration in the quality of services provided by the state-owned
Banana Company, the scarcity of inputs and equipment due to the foreign
exchange shortage, and-in 1980--the devastating impact of Hurricane
Allen. The problems affecting the production of sugar and bananas were, to
a large extent, similar to those affecting other export crops. Farmgate
prices were regulated by the external marketing organizations and, in an
inflationary environment, they lagged behind farmgate prices for domestic
crops. Besides, productive activities related to export crops took place
in an increasingly regulated environment characterized by the expansion of
the non-marketing functions of the external marketing organizations, that
now include direct involvement in production, supply of inputs, credit,
insurance, extension, and research.
9.        The role of the bauxite/alumina sector as a leading force in the
economic development of Jamaica came to an abrupt end in 1974. Between
1970 and 1974 the sector grew at an average real rate of 9.7%, continuing a
pattern established in the 1960s. Bauxite/alumina real value added fell by
37% in 1975-1976. Output recovered, particularly in 1977 and 1980 but even
in this last year sectoral value added was still 15% below the 1974 level.
Three major factors account for the decline in Jamaica's bauxite/alumina
industry: the tendency of aluminum producers to diversify their sources of
alumina supply, the 1975 recession in the industrial countries, and the
bauxite levy imposed by the Government of Jamaica in 1974.
10.       The most important factor was the imposition by the Government of
Jamaica of a bauxite production levy in 1974. Some--but not all--of the
other major producing countries followed suit; as a result, Jamaica's
competitive position deteriorated while Australia, Brazil and Guinea
improved theirs. Jamaica's share in the world bauxite and alumina trade
declined from 18% and 10% in 1974, to 13% and 7% in 1979. On the credit
side, the bauxite production levy increased more than fivefold the
Government revenues originating in the sector, from an average of US$33
million in 1969-73 to US$170 million in 1974-79. In late 1979, the
Government of Jamaica negotiated an agreement with the companies that
resulted in a reduction of the levy rates.



11.       Total manufacturing production peaked in 1973; by 1980 the
sector's output was 31% below the 1973 peak. The general decline of the
economy caused, and was fed by, the contraction in manufacturing; although
the apparent cause was the unavailability of imported inputs due to the
shortage of foreign exchange, the root of the problem lay in the shocks
undergone by the economy. Frequent labor unrest, unavailability of skilled
manpower (caused by intensified emigration) and the deterioration of the
country's infrastructure, compounded the sector's problems. The
unfavorable investment climate led producers to shelve expansion plans.
Although manufactured exports registered some growth during the period,
they did not compensate for the decline in the domestic economy. The
import-substituting-oriented industries set up in the 1950s and 1960s were
ill prepared to face the challenge of world markets. Besides, the
structure of incentives, resulting from a protective system based on
quantitative restrictions to imports, made sales to extraregional markets
less profitable than sales to the sheltered but limited CARICOM market, and
these in turn less profitable than sales to the domestic market.
12.       The decline in economic activity increased unemployment from 22%
in 1973 to 27-28% in 1979-80. Joblessness is even more acute for some
groups; the 1980 unemployment rates for youths aged 14 to 19 and for women
were, respectively, 60% and 39%. However, Jamaican statistics overestimate
unemployment compared to data from other countries because both the labor
force and the unemployed include non-seekers of work (those persons who
although not looking for work, wanted work and were in a position to accept
work during the survey week.) If this group is netted out, the official
unemployment rate for 1980 would be nearly halved.
13.       Inflation was moderate in 1970-72, but increased to 27Min 1973.
After a period of generally improved price performance, in 1978 the
December to December inflation rate jumped to 50% reflecting the impact of
the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar during that year and the elimination
of subsidies on some consumer goods. In 1980 the inflation rate was 29%.
Public Finances
14.       The financial performance of the Jamaican Central Government was
weak during FY73/74 - FY80/81, deteriorating sharply between FY74/75 and
FY76/77. Large increases in both current and capital expenditure--
associated with the Government's new social programs-- outpaced revenue
growth. As a result, the current account, which had registered a surplus
in FY74/75, showed a deficit equal to 6% of GDP in FY76/77; the overall
deficit increased from 8.6% of GDP to 19% of GDP in the same two year
period. As financial performance declined, the Government relied
increasingly on domestic financing, mostly from the banking system. During
FY77/78 and FY78/79 the Government took a number of measures to increase
revenues and control expenditures in order to correct the fiscal imbalance
and stabilize the economy. By FY78/79 the current account deficit had
decreased to 2.6% of GDP and the overall deficit to a share of 13.7%



15.        In spite of a program which in FY79/80 aimed to improve further
the financial performance of the Central Government, the fiscal position
weakened. The current account deficit rose to 4% of GDP and the overall
deficit increased to 12.4%. Current expenditures were higher than pro-
jected, in part owing to higher interest payments that reflected conditions
in international capital markets but also because of the Government's
inability to restrict wage increases and spending on goods and services,
some of the latter to repair flood damage. The financial performance of
the Central Government deteriorated further in FY80/81. The growth of cur-
rent expenditures was 20%, while revenues rose only 5%. Thus, the current
account deficit increased to 8.1% of GDP and the overall deficit rose to
about 18.1% of GDP.
External Sector
16.        In 1973-1980 Jamaica's balance of payments was under continuous
pressure. The reasons were: poor export performance reflecting
unfavorable conditions in the international economy as well as the impact
of domestic policies; a sharply rising oil bill provoked by higher oil
prices and a lack of exploited domestic energy resources; mounting debt-
service caused by increased recourse to public capital inflows aggravated
by the surge of interest rates in international capital markets; and pri-
vate capital outflows caused by the deterioration in private sector confi-
dence. By 1976, an acute scarcity of foreign exchange became apparent and
in 1977 and 1978, stabilization policies adopted by the Government and the
refinancing of commercial debt eased the shortage, although the situation
remained serious. But in 1979 and 1980 the balance of payments position
deteriorated significantly again, after the stabilization efforts
weakened,and the foreign exchange shortage became ever more serious.
17.        The current account of the balance of payments showed a
deficit every year during the decade. The deficit reached a high of US$335
million, 11% of GDP, in 1976. The principal reasons for this
deterioration were the decline in volume of the major export commodities
and the increase in the oil import bill. The volume of exports of goods
showed a declining trend after 1974. Primarily as a result of the
producers' reactions to the bauxite levy, by 1976 the volume of bauxite and
alumina exports had dropped 25% below the 1974 level, when they had
accounted for about two-thirds of export value. In spite of some recovery,
1980 export volumes of bauxite and alumina were still significantly below
the 1973 levels. In 1980 the volumes of sugar and banana exports were off
by more than one-half and more than three-fourths the peak levels of 1970.
The volume of imports contracted sharply during the decade, reflecting the
poor export performance and the adverse movement in the terms of trade.
Import controls were progressively tightened in an attempt to allocate the
increasingly scarce foreign exchange to priority uses. The volume of
nonoil imports in 1980 had fallen 61% below the 1970 level, and shortages
of imported goods, particularly inputs and spare parts were crippling the
economy.



- 6 -
18.       The large and sustained current account deficits in the balance
of payments were partially offset by inflows of official capital and losses
of international reserves. As a result, Jamaica's external debt increased
from US$349 million (17% of GDP) at the end of 1973 to an estimated
US$1,209 million (46% of GDP) by the end of 1980, of which the Bank held
14%. The debt service ratio increased to 16% by 1979. The ratio dropped
to 12% in 1980, largely because of the deferment of about US$100 million in
payments due. Losses in net international reserves also financed the
current account deficits; at the end of 1980 these stood at US$-532
million, including US$114 million of commercial arrears, compared to US$37
million at the end of 1973. Gross reserves had been reduced to about one
months' imports by the end of 1980.
C. Economic Performance in 1981
19.       In 1981 the Jamaican economy grew for the first time since 1973.
Real GDP growth is preliminarily estimated at 1.3%. Most major productive
sectors increased in response to the general improvement in business
confidence and the increase in the availability of imports. Construction
(6%) was the leading sector, but important gains were also registered by
domestic agriculture and manufacturing. The sectors that did not grow were
export agriculture where output (and exports) of sugar continued to decline
reflecting the lack of easy solutions to the deep structural problems that
affect this crop (paras 58-63); electricity and water, where the frequent
power outages resulted in outputs lower than demands; and Government
services, where a reduction reflected the Government's policy of reducing
public sector employment to the extent of the attrition rate of the labor
force.
20.       Unemployment and inflation have decreased, the former modestly
but the latter dramatically. In April 1981 the unemployment rate stood at
26.2%, that is 1.7 percentage points less than a year before; during the
twelve month period 40,000 new jobs were created.   The inflation rate
declined substantially in 1981 as a result of the increase in the
availability of goods, both imported and domestically produced; the
December to December increase in the All Jamaica Consumer Price Index was
6%, compared to an increase of 29% in 1980.
21.       The fiscal position of the Central Government is improving in
FY81/82. Tax revenues would increase about 20% over the previous year.
The increase would reflect the growth in economic activity and better tax
administration, in particular increased collection efforts. At the same
time, receipts from the bauxite levy are expected to increase
substantially, in the last three months of the fiscal year, as a result of
increased bauxite production related to the US Government's decision to
increase its stockpile. Current expenditures are expected to increase less
than 10%, as a result of the Government's strict incomes policy, the
reduction in real subsidy levels and other expenditure control efforts.



- 7 -
Accordingly, the budgetary deficit would decline from about 8% of GDP in
1980/81 to about 4.0% in FY81/82. Despite some increase in capital
expenditures, largely reflecting an increase in capital transfers to meet
the financial requirements of the nonfinancial public enterprises, the
overall deficit is expected to drop from about 18% of GDP, in 1980/81 to
about 15% in 1981/82. The Government is financing the deficit primarily
through external sources (special balance of payments assistance,
commercial banks, and project-related inflows) and through other domestic
sources.  In keeping with the IMF program the level of banking system
support will have been substantially reduced from J$485 million in FY80/81
to about J$140 million in FY81/82.
22.       In contrast, balance of payments performance has sharply
deteriorated in 1981 with a near doubling of the current account deficit to
US$410 million, or about 14% of GDP. This deterioration had been partially
anticipated, but export performance fell short of the projections made at
the beginning of the year. Exports of goods and non-factor services only
increased by 3% in nominal terms. Exports of bauxite and alumina grew
marginally because of the depressed world market. Production (and exports)
of the two major export crops, sugar and bananas continued the declining
trend of the last decade. Tourism, in spite of some growth, still shows
the continued effects of the adverse climate of 1980 and the depressed
levels of economic activity in most source countries. Imports of goods and
nonfactor services rose sharply, increasing by nearly 20% in nominal terms
and by 14% in real terms. Liberalization of licensing and foreign exchange
restrictions facilitated an inventory buildup, the satisfaction of pent up
consumer demand and the availability of the inputs needed to support
economic recovery. The volume of food and other consumer goods imports
rose by 41% and 35% respectively. Capital goods imports increased by 38%
in real terms and imports of raw material were also up sharply. The value
of fuel imports remained constant at the 1980 level; volume declined mostly
because of continued conservation efforts.
23.       Net capital inflows are estimated to total about US$325 million.
At the March 1981 meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development donor countries and international financial
institutions pledged in special balance of payments assistance for the
Jamaican FY81/82. In addition, foreign commercial banks agreed to
refinance the Government's maturities due in FY81/82 and FY82/83 and made a
new loan of US$71 million to the Government of Jamaica. In spite of a
sharp increase in amortization payments, net public capital inflows are
expected to total US$277 million. Inflows of other capital have also
increased, primarily reflecting the sharp rise in no-funds import
licenses. As a result of the higher capital inflows, the loss in net
international reserves was held to the 1980 level, about US$75 million. At
the end of 1981 net international reserves stood at US-$607 million.

PART II - THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
A. OVERALL STRATEGY
24.       As described in the previous section, the Government elected in
October 1980 faced grave economic problems. The cumulative effects of past
policy decisions and the evolution of the international economy since 1973,
had led to a severe balance-of-payments crisis that reflected serious
structural deficiencies. This situation impeded the utilization of productive
capacity and clouded prospects for its expansion as well as for employment
creation. By late 1980, the crisis had pervaded all areas of the economy.
25.       The main problems that demanded the new Government's attention
included, inter alia, a productive structure which needed to be repaired and
reoriented, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors; a
potentially dynamic tourism sector damaged by social and political unrest, a
decline in service quality, and the international economic situation; an
acute scarcity of skilled managerial and technical personnel, particularly in
the public sector, mainly as a result of massive emigration in recent years;
an unfavorable investment climate for domestic and foreign capital provoked by
a high level of political rhetoric coupled with trade union activism and a
deterioration of law and order; and persistent and large deficits in both
public finances and the balance of payments.
26.       The Government's overall strategy is export-oriented and relies on
the private sector as the main engine of development. The strategy was
designed and adopted in two partly overlapping stages. The first contained
priority actions that could be begun within two or three months and was
supported by an Extended Agreement reached in March 1981 with the IMF. This
program focused on the need to reverse the economy's decline and gradually to
restore financial viability. Total IMF support amounted to SDR 536 million.
The second and longer term program is related to the proposed SAL. It
emphasizes actions to overcome the deficiencies in Jamaica's economic
structure.
27.       The first stage of the strategy is described in the Economic Policy
Memorandum attached to the Statement on Development Policies (Annex V), and
was prepared in connection with the March 1981 agreement with the IMF. The
main objectives of this first stage were:
(a) To promote immediate increases in exports through the fuller
utilization of capacity in the bauxite/alumina industry, steps
toward the rehabilitation of tourism and of the sugar and banana
subsectors, and an increased emphasis on manufactured exports.
These goals were to be achieved by assuring the availability of
foreign exchange; reaching agreement with private sector firms
operating (or interested in operating) in these areas; reaching
agreement with foreign governments in areas such as double taxation
and bauxite stockpiling, and undertaking an active tourism promotion
campaign;



- 9 -
(b) To increase the utilization of existing capacity in industries
producing for the domestic market by providing the foreign exchange
required for importing inputs and replacement capital goods;
(c) To promote private investment, both domestic and foreign, through
the simplification of existing regulations and procedures governing
such investment, and the formation, on a bilateral basis, of joint
business groups with industrialized countries;
(d) To reduce inflation and to achieve financial stability by inter
alia, limiting wage increases; freezing public employment at the
March 1981 level; limiting monetary expansion and following an
appropriate interest rate policy; and maintaining a realistic
exchange rate, adjusting it if and when it becomes necessary to
ensure the competitiveness of Jamaican exports;
(e)  To reduce the Government's involvement in directly productive
activities, except in the field of public utilities. To this end,
the Government has created a Divestment Committee that will seek the
orderly transfer to the private sector of productive enterprises
that are now Government owned.
Section I. C above, described the results obtained in 1981 through the
implementation of this first stage of the new economic strategy.
28.       The Government has also prepared the second, and in many respects
farther reaching, part of its economic strategy, that addresses the structural
reform of the Jamaican economy. As the formulation of the required policy
measures advanced, the Government began their implementation in a number of
areas. By the end of 1981, a substantial part of this second phase, the
Structural Adjustment Program, was already being executed.
29.       The program is described below under two main headings.  The first
-summarized in the following table-concerns aspects of the Program linked
explicitly to the proposed SAL; the second consists of other important planned
measures and objectives not directly linked to the proposed loan.

TO THE PROPOSED SAL
Savings and Investment
30.       As a middle-income developing country with a well-developed
financial system, Jamaica has the potential to generate savings to cover a
substantial portion of its capital accumulation effort. National savings
rates around 20% of GDP were not uncommon in the early 1970s; even in the
depressed conditions of 1977-79, private savings were always about 11% of
GDP. The rate at which the public finances are strengthened and confidence in

economnic management is restored will largely determine whether the national
savings rate increases. Under the aegis of the program agreed to with the IMF
(Annex V-B) the Governmnent is already taking steps to increase budgetary
revenues and limit the growth of public expenditures (para 33-35). Other
measures to strengthen public sector finances and mobilize increased levels of
private savings form part of the structural adjustment program. Under another
action program the Government seeks to increase after tax real returns on
financial assets and to eliminate obstacles to the development of capital
markets (paras 40-41).
31.       Gross domestic investment also faltered during the eight years of
Jamaica's economic decline. Decreasing levels of investment reflected
declining investor confidence, a shortage of domestic counterpart funds and
foreign exchange constraints. As private investment slackened, the public
sector was unable to fill the gaps. Financial, managerial and technical
shortfalls led to project delays which exacerbated cost overruns a
Accordingly, measures to rationalize the public investment effort, and to
stimulate private investment have been included in the Government's program.
(a) Current Savings of Public Enterprises
32.       The Government is committed to improve the savings performance of
the public sector. In connection with the Central Government, the
Government's objective is to turn an estimated deficit on current account of
3.5% of GDP in FY81/82 to a surplus of at least 1% of GDP in FY83/84. There
is also scope to increase the savings performance of public enterprises
considerably, through tariff and price adjustments and cost reduction
measures. In FY80/81, the cash surplus generated by the 16 major nonfinancial
public enterprises was zero; eight ran current account deficits, the aggregate
of which represented over 1% of GDP. At the beginning of 1981 most deficit
enterprises were projected to continue generating dissavings.
33.       Action Program.  The Government is committed to eliminate the
current account deficits. of selected enterprises in FY82/83 and to eliminate
all current account deficits in FY83/84. This will be achieved through the
implementation of specific programs to reduce costs and/or increase prices and
through divestment of unprofitable operations. Some measures have already
been taken. As of August 1, 1981, Jamaica Public Service Company instituted a
tariff increase in electric power rates of about 6% on top of the 1% monthly
escalation. On December 15, 1981 the Government decided to increase the
domestic price of sugar by an average of about 50% and further price action
will take place before the release of the second tranche. Significant
cost-reduction measures were taken in Air Jamaica, including the
discontinuation of unprofitable routes. The Government has prepared specific
actiou programs for Air Jamaica, Jamaica Public Service Co., Sugar Industry
Authority, National Sugar Corporation, National Hotels and Properties, and
National Water Authority.   Prior to the release of the second tranche the
Borrower will have prepared and approved programs for the Banana Company,
Jamaica Omnibus Service, and Jamaica Railway Service. The action programs for
the Sugar Industry Authority and the National Sugar Corporation will be
reviewed then, considering possible changes in the international economy
(mainly the EEC sugar price and the exchange rates of the importing European
countries). In addition, and as part of the program to achieve the financial



- 17 -
rehabilitation of public enterprises, pricing decisions have been left to the
managers of those enterprises (excluding utilities), and the Government has
stated its intention to reduce the relative importance of the budget's
contribution to financing capital expenditures. In this connection, a
quantitative target has been defined: the enterprises will be expected to
generate surpluses large enough to pay cotporate taxes, debt service, and
contribute 30% of the cost of investment programs after 1984. Overall, public
enterprises have been targeted to generate current account savings equivalent
to 2% of GDP in FY83/84.
(b) Establishment of Functional Medium-term Lending Institutions
34.       A major factor limiting the recovery of indigenous private
investment is the lack of medium-term credit. Existing institutions have been
ineffective. The Jamaica Development Bank was created in 1969 as the
successor to the Development Finance Corporation, which had become
decapitalized through poor lending practices. JDB was supposed to be the
Government's principle institution for providing term capital to the private
sector for industry, tourism and agriculture. It was capitalized with
financing from the Government and external sources, including the Bank.
Unfortunately, JDB fared not much better tlhan its predecessor organization.
Its poor record on loan recovery forced the Government to suspend all new loan
commitments in October 1981. JDB's function now is to administer its own
portfolio and that of several smaller moribund Government institutions that
lent for small business like SIFCO, formerly Development Venture Capital
Financing, and SEDCO, which was merged with the Small Business Loan Board.
The record of Government development lending to the private sector indicates a
long standing tendency in Jamaica to treat Government loans as
non-reimburseable financial assistance.
35.       Action Program.  The economic program attaches high priority to the
establishment of lending facilities that will make medium-term credit once
again available to the private sector. The Government has created two new
institutions, the Agricultural Credit Bank and the National Development Bank,
which will operate as wholesalers channelling their resources through the
commercial banking system.  The Government believes that the repayment record
for medium term loans will be improved by placing the credit risk on
commercial banks. The Agricultural Credit Bank will become fully operational
before the National Development Bank. It has taken over the agricultural
operations of the now quasi-defunct Jamaica Development Bank. An operational
program has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Agricultural Credit
Bank. The National Development Bank is at an earlier stage of its
development. A Board of Directors and a general manager have been appointed.
An operational program will be prepared and approved by its Board before the
release of the second tranche. Preparation and adoption and satisfactory
program of operating policies and procedures which allow NDB to function as an
effective financial institution, capable of meeting the term credit needs of
the industry and tourism sectors, will be a condition to the release of the
second tranche. Terms of Reference for the preparation of an NDB operational
program, to be financed under the TA Loan, have been prepared.

(c) Public Sector Investment Program
36.       Public sector investment activities will need to play a
supplementary but critical role in stimulating economnic growth over the next
few years. In keeping with the Government's focus on an expanded role for the
private sector, public sector investment will need to concentrate on providing
services and infrastructure that will facilitate expanded production.
Accordingly, the program aims primarily at stimulating nontraditional
agricultural activities, upgrading agricultural services, promoting the
expansion of industry and tourism through the construction of factory shells
and stepped-up promotional activity, and rehabilitating and upgrading basic
economic and social infrastructure.
37.       If the execution of the public sector investment program is to
proceed satisfactorily, a number of constraints need to be borne in mind.
First, the recent outflow of managerial and technical skills has weakened
project execution capacity in the public sector. Accordingly, most projects
need to contain a significant element of training and institution building,
while technical assistance available from external sources needs to be fully
utilized. In the past, the shortage of counterpart funds has constrained
project execution and contributed to cost overruns. It is therefore essential
that projects be selected against the background of a realistic financing plan
which takes into account the availability of budget resources as well as
likely external flows. In this regard, projects will be identified on a
reserve basis, so that the investment program may be quickly scaled down
should financing not materialize as expected.
38.       Action program.  The Government has prepared a public sector
investment program and financing plan for the three-year period
1981/82-1983/84 (Annex IV). The investment program, which amounts to
approximately J$2.7 billion and averages 14.4% of GDP, is consistent with the
development emphasis on export-oriented, employment-intensive sectors and the
development of domestic energy resources. The Government is committed to
maintain overall public investment expenditures below 15% of GDP in each year
of the program. About 23% of the program is devoted to investment in the
directly productive sectors and 46% to support economic infrastructure. About
25% of the program is allocated to essential investments in the social
sectors. In keeping with the Government's policy of reliance on the private
sector, investment in the mining, manufacture, and tourism sectors will be
left largely to private investors. The year-by-year allocations of
expenditures show the Government's attempts to reorient its investment; while
the proportion allotted to economic infrastructure increases through time, the
proportions devoted to directly productive activities and to social
infrastructure decrease.
39.       Of the total J$2.7 billion required to finance the investment
program, public sector savings 1/ would provide about 16%, or J$429 million;
on an annual basis, the proportion of public investment expenditures covered
1/   Includes capital revenues.



- 19 -
by public sector savings would increase from -8% in FY81/82 to +15% in FY82/83
and to +35% in FY83/84. This projection of savings assumes:
(a)  real GDP growth amounting to about 4% in 1982/83 and about 5% in
1983/84;
(b)  additional revenue measures in FY82/83 and FY83/84;
(c)  nominal growth in Central Government current expenditures of no more
than 13% in 1982/83 and 7% in 1983/84; and
(d)  substant7ially improved performance on the part of the nonfinancial
public enterprises, arising from rationalization of prices and
divestment of certain operations.
About 19% of the program, or J$522 million could be financed from other
domestic sources.  Net external financing would be required to finance the
remaining 65% of the investment program. After taking into account
amortization requirements, gross disbursements of external capital on the
order of J$2.5 billion would be required over the three-year period.
Approximately 70% of this amount has been committed or is reasonably certain.
.The remainder, amounting to about J$750 million, would need to be mobilized
largely in the form of quickly disbursing assistance. The Government has
stated the priorities of the investment program in Attachment "C" to the
Development Policy Statement (Annex V). When the public sector investment
program is rolled over prior to the release of the second tranche, it will be
extended to cover FY84/85 and FY85/86. The Government is also establishing a
monitoring system which will enable it to track project execution and external
inflows and forestall bottlenecks.
(d) Promotion of Private Savings
40.       In addition to the measures described above to strengthen public
sector savings, the Government hopes to increase the confidence of the private
sector and hence its savings rate. Moreover, the economic program provides
for the financing of the Central Government through open market operations;
interest rates, consequently, have increased and are expected to continue
doing so.  In this context, the Government is also committed to ensure that
sufficient bank credit is available for the private sector. Given the
Government's emphasis on the dynamic role of the private sector, it would also
be appropriate to assess the functioning of capital markets, with a view to
introducing the reforms that may be required to strengthen them.
41.       Action program.  Given the high progressivity of the personal income
tax, there is scope for increasing after-tax real returns on financial
assets. The Government has partially exempted from personal income tax the
interest earnings on deposits of maturities of more than one year. In
addition, as part of the comprehensive reform of the tax system, the
Government is undertaking a review of the progressivity of the personal income
tax. The review is scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1982. If such



- 20 -
progressivity were to be reduced, after-tax real returns on financial assets
would increase. The Government will also carry on an assessment of the
functioning of capital markets in Jamaica emphasizing the analysis of factors
that reduce the availability of risk capital. The assessment will be done
through a study, with assistance from IFC, that would be completed before the
end of August 1982; satisfactory progress of this study would be made prior to
the release of the second tranche.
Balance of Payments Management
42.       The Government is aware that the balance of payments is likely to
continue being the binding constraint to economic growth for the next few
years. In this regard, the structural adjustment program addresses the issues
of foreign exchange policy and attracting additional private external
capital.
(a) Efficiency in the Allocation of Foreign Exchange.
43.       It is an already stated government policy to ensure the price
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.   If this competitiveness is eroded
through excessive domestic price increases and a departure from wage
moderation, corrective measures would be called for. Given the acute shortage
of foreign exchange, achieving greater efficiency in its allocation is of
major importance. In this connection, the Government seeks to move to a
market-oriented allocation process.
44.       Action program.  A first step in the Government's policy is to move
towards a general open-license system for imports. The Government has already
taken several measures to increase the efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange. All legal sanctions to transactions in the informal foreign
exchange market have been eliminated, and the Fiscal Intelligence Unit has
been eliminated. In addition, the Government has introduced a number of
modifications to the import licensing system: administrative procedures have
been simplified considerably; the value of no-funds licenses issued has
increased substantially and the issuance of such licenses is automatic for raw
materials, spare parts, and capital goods; a system of special retained
foreign exchange accounts has been established for importers, and those who
operate under this system do not need import licenses; import licenses are
issued automatically for exporters that operate under the Bank-supported
Export Development Fund. The Government wishes to analyze the possible
introduction of an auctioning system for import licenses for certain low
priority goods. A study of two to three month duration will be conducted in
order to analyze ways of increasing the efficiency of the import licensing
system; satisfactory progress in the preparation of this study would be made
prior to the release of the second tranche.

(b) Attracting Private Capital.
45.       Private external capital played an important role in the economic
development of Jamaica during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the last eight
years, direct foreign investment dwindled and capital flight occured. The
challenge now facing the Government is to create an atmosphere conducive to
renewed foreign investment. A further challenge, as well as opportunity for
the Government, is to find ways to induce the large numbers of Jamaicans
living abroad to remit part of their assets and income to Jamaica. Interest
rate differentials, as well as the possibility of providing convertibility
guarantees, will have to be viewed from this vantage point.
46.       Action Program.  In order to attract private capital, the Government
has set out to restore an atmosphere of confidence in the country and in the
quality of its own economic management, as well as to provide appropriate
stimuli. The Government's strategy in this respect should go a long way
towards the restoration of confidence: as to the overall approach, it has
unequivocally defined a leading role for the private sector--domestic as well
as foreign--in the economic recovery process; in connection with the quality
of economic management, the Government has entered into an extended agreement
with the IMF and has adopted a stern attitude in the wage negotiations in
which it participated, contributing to a mood of wage restraint that is
gradually spreading throughout the economy. In order to attract direct
foreign investment the Government has launched a vigorous promotional campaign
through the creation of bilateral groups of businessmen that will identify and
develop investment opportunities in Jamaica. On the domestic front, the
Government has created the Jamaica National Investment Promotion Co., a
"one-stop" promotion agency that centralizes all relations with potential
investors. In order to facilitate the repatriation of Jamaican capital that
flowed out during the last decade, the Government has established a system of
foreign exchange accounts for importers, in addition to decriminalizing the
informal foreign exchange market. In order to attract migrants'
savings--potentially a major source of foreign exchange--the Government has
requested the Bank of Jamaica to analyze the options that are available. The
Bank of Jamaica is conducting a study that will be finished by the end of
March. A decision would be made subsequently and an action program would be
prepared before the end of September 1982.
Agricultural Sector
47.       The agricultural sector of Jamaica has the potential for rapid and
sustained growth. In the short run, the scarcity of inputs resulting from
the foreign exchange shortage is the limiting factor; but, like other
productive sectors, there are structural problems that will have to be solved
if recovery is to be transformed into sustainable medium-term growth.



- 22 -
(a) Land Use.
48.        Several complex issues related to land tenure and ownership
contribute towards the underutilization of Jamaica's agricultural resources.
The title situation of some private lands is unclear, partly as a result of
the inefficiency of the land administration system which is fragmented into
three agencies. Tenant farmers on governmnent-owned lands are uncertain about
their future status and therefore postpone investment decisions. Another
difficulty arises from the fact that free-hold farmers cannot receive
appropriate guidance from the various extension services because land
resources have not been appropriately assessed and classified as to their
optimal uses. As a result, lands lie idle or underutilized. Finally, the
Government needs to announce its intentions with respect to the future
agricultural use of bauxite lands.
49.       Many small farms are located on hillsides.  These lands experience
soil erosion problems which require special cropping patterns and soil
conservation measures. The Ministry of Agriculture has introduced an
intensive soil conservation program, with support from FAO/UNDP. An important
element of the soil conservation program is the annual maintenance work that
follows the initial investment in conservation work. Unfortunately, very
little maintenance work is being done in the Jamaican mountains and
hillsides. Because of the heavy costs of the program and the urgent need to
help small hillside farmers, the entire soil conservation program needs to be
re-evaluated.
50.       The development of water resources is related to agricultural
development not only through its possible impact on agricultural production,
but also through its impact on living conditions in rural areas. Most
households in rural Jamaica do not yet have domestic water supply systems. To
date only some 85,000 acres are irrigated, and most systemns are inefficiently
organized and poorly managed. Although the expansion of irrigation could be a
source of increased agricultural production, expansion of rainfed agricultural
areas would yield higher returns than expansion of the irrigation system. The
Bank's economic mission recommended that water resource development issues be
addressed in the following order of priority: (a) completion of water supply
systems for domestic use; (b) improvement of water management and more
efficient utilization of existing irrigation systems; (c) development of new
irrigation schemes for specific high-value crops where the supporting system
already exists; and (d) sewerage.
51.       Action Program.  In order to achieve a fuller utilization of
Jamaica's agricultural resources:
(i)  The uncertainty faced by tenant farmers on government-owned lands
will be reduced through a program to sell or lease those lands to
producers. The Government has announced that it is preparing an
action program for the orderly sale or lease of government-owned
lands, and has started to implement aspects of it. Satisfactory
progress towards developing a policy for the sale or lease of these
lands to agricu.ltural producers would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche. The program is expected to be in operation
by the end of the year.



- 23 -
(ii)  The lack of information on optimal uses of land is being tackled
through the implementation of a program of land classification.
MINAG has already put in place a work program that includes the
review of previous soil studies (completed), the implementation of a
detailed land resource inventory, and eventually a capability
classification leading to the formulation of land use policy.
Satisfactory progress of the detailed land resource inventory would
be a condition for the release of the second tranche.
(iii)  Regarding the control of erosion of hillside farms, the Government
has decided on the main features of the program, the main thrust of
which is the adoption of lower cost methods; some works have been
stopped, and others are being redesigned. Before the end of
September 1982, the program would be fully developed and approved by
Cabinet; satisfactory progress in the development of the program
would be a condition for the release of the second tranche;
(iv)  In order to increase the agricultural area under effective
irrigation, the Ministry of Local Government in conjunction with the
MINAG is preparing a program to improve the efficiency of water
management and to develop new systems under well defined
priorities. The Ministry of Agriculture has chosen a strategy--in
line with previous Bank recommendations--that emphasizes the proper
use of microdams, and provides assistance to farm communities for
the development of small irrigation systems. The program will be
developed before the end of September 1982; satisfactory progress in
the development of the program would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche.
(b) Inefficiency of monopolistic external marketing organizations.
52.       Medium-term growth of the agricultural sector depends on the
provision of price incentives that make agricultural production profitable
vis-a-vis other economic activities. During the 1970s, agricultural prices
fell; within this declining trend, during the second half of the decade,
prices for domestic crops became relatively more favorable than prices for
export crops and, not surprisingly, export agriculture declined while domestic
agriculture grew.
53.       Two major factors can explain the movement of intra-sectoral
relative prices in favor of domestic agriculture: (a) the foreign exchange
rationing that led to reduced food imports, creating incentives for import
substitution in the agricultural sector, and (b) the differences in marketing
arrangements for export and domestic crops.   Export crops were marketed
through governmental or para-governmental entities that enjoyed monopsony
powers and regulated farmgate prices, while domestic crops were marketed
through a largely private system, in which farmgate prices were unregulated.



- 24 -
54.       Although the external marketing organization (EMOs) may still
have a part to play assuring a minimum return to small farmers, these
organizations seem to have grown beyond their optimal size, and their
dominant role over export crops is not consistent with an export-led
development strategy based on greater reliance on the private sector. The
functions of the external marketing organizations should be reassessed
with a view to: (i) eliminating their monopolistic privileges, including
their monopsony powers for external marketing, permitting competition of
private organizations; (ii) transferring their respective extension
services, to the national extension services; (iii) terminating their
involvement in the provision of credit as soon as the new system chosen by
the Government for this purpose (which includes the recently created
Agricultural Credit Bank as well as commercial banks) can take over this
service; (iv) reducing their involvement in the supply of agricultural
inputs and services, except when these cannot be provided through
commercial channels.
55.       Action Program.  Subject to conditions which are designed to
maintain minimum prices and preserve the quality of Jamaica's premium
export products, the Government has terminated the monopsony powers of EMOs
except those dealing with sugar and bananas, which are considered special
cases, and some specialized products in which Jamaica enjoys a de facto
monopoly. It has ordered management audits of all the EMOs. The
management audits for the coffee, cocoa, and citrus EMOs have been
comnpleted. Since the proposed reduction in the non-marketing activities of
the EMOs must be accomplished in an orderly fashion to avoid
discontinuities in the provision of productive services or supply of
inputs, a series of studies will be undertaken on the sequence and timing
of the reduction of activities. Prior to the release of the second
tranclie, satisfactory progress will have been made with respect to the
studies related to: (a) the orderly reduction of the non-marketing
activities of the EMOs; (b) the external marketing operations of the EMOs
for coffee, citrus, pimento, and coffee; and (c) the management audits of
the EMOs for sugar, bananas, and pimento. The studies of the EM4Os will
take about three months to complete after consultants are engaged. The
management audits are underway and will be completed by September 1982.
(c) Assuring farmers rewards for their work.
56.       Praedial larceny has a long history in Jamaica, but has become
more acute during the last few years. Crops are stolen by large-scale
operators and sometimes productive assets are destroyed in the process.
The issue of praedial larceny is of importance, because the effects of
future incentives on production could be neutralized unless this peculiar
form of crime is reduced substantially. Unless the Government is in a
position to guarantee that the farmer who worked his land will also be the
one reaping the benefits, the production response to economic incentives
will be weak. The solution lies in a general improvement in the
administration of law and order in rural areas.



- 25 -
57.       Action Program.  The Government has launched a program to
eradicate praedial larceny. New legislation will shortly be submitted to
Parliament, introducing stiffer penalties. Measures have also been taken
to simplify administrative procedures and accelerate the process of
recovery of the stolen goods. The Government will also increase the
deployment of security forces in rural areas, including the institution of
a system of agricultural wardens, of which 200 will be operational before
the end of December 1982.
(d) Long-term decline in sugar production and exports.
58.       Sugar production has declined steadily over the last decade.  As
a result, output in 1980 was nearly 40% below the 1970 level. This decline
reflected the inefficient operation of the nationalized sugar factories as
well as falling production in the fields, resulting from the dismemberment
of the sugar estates and the creation of sugar cane workers' cooperatives
that never functioned satisfactorily.
59.       Over the longer term, Jamaica may need to diversify its
agricultural production away from sugar and towards other activities that
are more profitable. Over the short- to medium-term, however, there is
room to increase this subsector's efficiency and output, contributing to
foreign exchange earnings and to the improvement of living standards in
rural areas.
60.       Action Program.  The Government has recently taken two major
policy decisions concerning, respectively, the sugar workers' cooperatives
and the operation of the National Sugar Company's (NSC) factories. These
decisions shape the action program for the rehabilitation of the sugar
subsector.
61.       The registration of the cooperatives (which all were quite
insolvent) was cancelled and their affairs are now being wound up. The
land is now being leased to three sugar factories which they supply with
cane. With regard to the government-owned sugar factories, two are being
closed, one before the start of the 1981/82 crop and another before the
start of the 1982/83 crop. The largest factory will be retained under
management of the National Sugar Corporation. All of the remaining
factories will be leased to private firms. Discussions are already under
way with local and foreign groups. Given the condition of the factories
and cane fields, it may be a year or more before all the negotiations are
completed. There is, therefore, a considerable but unavoidable degree of
uncertainty about any plans for the factories that are the subject of
negotiation, along with the associated cane fields.
62. In line with the Government's objective to eliminate the current
account deficits of all public enterprises by FY83/84, while at the same
time providing greater incentives to farmers, the Government has increased
the domestic price of sugar by about 50% and the guaranteed price
to farmers by some 27%. An additional increase in the domestic price of



- 26 -
sugar is planned, before the end of June 1982, in order to limit the
deficit of the National Sugar Corporation/Sugar Industry Authority to J$25
million in CY82, and is a condition for the release of the second tranche.
Over the medium term, and in line with the desired deregulation of the
economy, the Government's objective is to phase out price intervention for
the sugar industry. By November 1982, the Bank and the Government will
conduct a review of the Government's program for the rehabilitation of the
sugar industry.
63.       Besides these changes in ownership structure, the Government has
prepared an action program to deal with the immediate production problem.
The main objective for the subsector, public and private, is to achieve an
annual production of 330,000 tons of raw sugar. This action program covers
three areas: field operations, including transport and tractors;
factories; and personnel. Its main characteristics are:
(i) Field: The target of 330,000 tons of sugar will require some 3.5
million tons of cane. This will be achieved by farming 120,000
acres to yield some 30 tons of cane per acre; this area would
only be marginally higher than the area under sugarcane in 1979.
Critical components of the action program are: (a) to guarantee
farmers a price that covers their debt service plus a 15 to 20%
profit margin; (b) a program to assure the timely availability of
fertilizer and chemicals in each estate; (c) a program to assure
that estates have their own land preparation equipment or
contractors to assist farmers; (d) a program to assure that
estates have some reaping and transportation equipment available
to assist farmers with their deliveries; (e) a program of road
repairs to improve the condition of cane roads for the harvest
season; (f) a program for the irrigation systems, especially in
Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Bernard Lodge, to be brought back
to their maximum efficiency; (g) a monitoring system by the Sugar
Industry Research Institute of the availability of seed material
to improve yields; (h) a monitoring system by the Sugar Industry
Research Institute of the cultural practices and reaping cycle
for the cane; (i) the implementation of an incentive scheme based
on sugar yield per acre; (j) a program to reduce the heavy
incidence of praedial larceny and also to reduce the destruction
of cane by stray stock; and (k) the availability of spare parts
for field equipment. All these areas are being addressed by the
Government in cooperation with the All Island Jamaica Cane
Farmers' Association, the Sugar Industry Authority, the Sugar
Industry Research Institute, the Sugar Producers' Federation and
other agencies.
(ii) Factories: The key components of the program for the sugar
factories are: (a) to plan the timing of the crop to take
advantage of the best juice period and weather pattern; (b) to
minimize lost time at the mill, through a system of planned daily
quotas, and also contributing to eliminate the use of oil as a
fuel through a more efficient use of bagasse; (c) to establish a
system to monitor the quality of cane; (d) a repair program with



- 27 -
adequate spare parts in place for the repair season; and (e) an
inceitive scheme based on the planned throughput of each
factory. This program's measures will be reviewed within a year,
when the Government expects to have completed the reorganization
of the sugar industry and the subsector will have to find its
equilibrium at world market prices rather than guaranteed prices.
(iii) Personnel: The Government is aware that a sugar estates complex
can only operate successfully with on the spot dedicated and
efficient management. This is already borne out at the privately
owned llampden, and Worthy Park factories. The National Sugar
Company will require some further upgrading in this area.
Regardless of any divestment, offers of assistance in the area of
technical and management personnel have been made by several
multinational corporations and international organizations. The
Government is identifying its requirements and will tap those
sources for assistance.
se) Long-term decline in banana production and exports.
64.       Bananas are the second most important export crop in Jamaica, but
in recent years yields, output, quantity exported, and quality have all
declined. Exports have declined from 136,000 MIT in 1970 to 33,000 MT in
1980 and an estimated 22,000 MT in 1981. This situation has resulted from
mismanagement of the Banana Company, shortage of inputs and materials,
deterioration of cultivation practices, insufficient protection against
plant disease, poor methods of fruit handling, an inefficient and costly
transportation system, and the effects of Hurricane Allen.
65.       Action Program.  The Government has developed an action program
for the rehabilitation of the sector. The objective is to increase output
and exports to a target (for the latter) of 150,000 tons per year,
which coincides with Jamaica's quota in the sheltered UK market (1981
exports will only cover one seventh of the quota). This export target
would be achieved with an increase in the area devoted to bananas of only
3,000 to 5,000 acres, that is about 5 to 8% of the area planted in 1979.
The Bank's Second Export Development Fund Project included a $4.0 million
component to finance inputs for the banana industry. The major components
of the action program are:
(M)  To increase the supply of basic farm inputs:  The Government has
allocated foreign exchange for this purpose. The Banana Company
imported fertilizers, spraying materials, and plastic sleeves.
These inputs are now being sold to farmers through the All Island
Banana Growers' Association.



- 28 -
(ii) To increase the quantity and quality of extension services
provided to banana farmers: Responsibility for the provision of
extension services to farms of less than 2 acres has been shifted
from the Banana Company to the Ministry of Agriculture. This
will allow the extension service of the Banana Company (14
extension officers) to concentrate on 3,000 banana farmers while
the remaining 18,000 banana farmers (most of which have mixed
stands anyhow) will be covered by the Ministry of Agriculture.
(iii)  To reorient the disease control system:  The Banana Company is
reorienting its disease control system emphasizing ground
spraying instead of air spraying.  Ground spraying equipment has
been purchased and made available to farmers.
(iv)  To divert banana output of exportable quality from the domestic
to the external market: There are two components to this
program. First, the Banana Company has increased the price paid
to farmers from J$.09/lb to J$.11/lb and, in addition, it has
instituted a quality premium of J$.02/lb. Second, the Banana
Company has begun to provide farmers plastic boxes, to encourage
cutting and boxing the banana fingers at the farm, thus hoping to
reduce the proportion of export rejects at the packing house
level and creating another incentive to exports as opposed to
supplying the domestic market.
(v) To market export rejects in the domestic market: Under the
existing system, export rejects are dumped. The Banana Company
will start to sell rejects--on an experimental basis--in the
domestic market. If the experience is successful, it will create
an additional incentive for farmers to market through the Banana
Company, while at the same time offsetting upward pressures on
the domestic price of bananas that are likely to be triggered by
the diversion of output from the domestic to the external market.
(vi) To expand planted banana area: The Banana Company has negotiated
an agreement with an international corporation to expand the area
planted with bananas by at least 3,000 acres. Output will be
organized in large farms, and expected yields are 8 to 10 MT per
acre (compared to the current average of 3 MT/acre).
(f) Governmental institutions dealing with the agricultural
sector
66.       The organization of the Ministry of Agriculture both at the head
office and at the regional level is adequate. However, the Ministry's
planning unit needs to be strengthened in order to plan, coordinate, and
monitor development programs. The nucleus of such a unit already exists,
and some of its components have been developed independently with external
assistance. The large number of projects being planned or implemented, as
well as the large number of Government agencies related to the agricultural
sector, suggest the need to reorganize the system. More particularly:



- 29 -
(a) the agricultural extension services should develop methods and systems
to transfer knowledge and information to a larger number of farmers; (b)
the field extension agents, need stronger support from subject-matter
specialists and other senior extension personnel; (c) the multiple
extension services should be merged under the Minister of Agriculture; and
(d) the specialized research units for bananas, coffee, coconut, and
sugarcane should be merged with the research service of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
67.       Agricultural credit in Jamaica has been channelled through a
variety of institutions, including the Jamaica Development Bank. The
comercial banks play an important role in agricultural credit, a role that
could be expanded beneficially. In addition the agricultural extension
service should cooperate more closely with the commercial banks in
implementing the credit programs and a promotion scheme for the credit
programs should be initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and the
commercial banks.
68.       Action Program.  The weakness of agricultural institutions
severely limits Government's capability to design agricultural policies and
execute programs. The Ministry of Agriculture has already taken steps to
strengthen some of its units, particularly the extension service. The
Ministry of Agriculture has prepared an action program to strengthen
agricultural sector institutions; the program includes the provision of
extension specialists, financed under the First Rural Development Project
(Loan No. 1464-JM), to assist in the introduction of the Training and Visit
System; a program, partly-financed under the proposed Technical Assistance
Loan, to assist local agents to prepare demonstration plots and train
extension agents at the local and regional levels; the redefinition of the
non-marketing functions of the EMOs, financed under the proposed Technical
Assistance Loan, possibly leading to the consolidation of their extension
services and research services under the Ministry of Agriculture; an
analysis of the trade-off between domestic crops and export agriculture;
finally, another program financed under the proposed Technical Assistance
Loan, will strengthen the planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Institutional aspects related to the provision of credit will be covered by
the action program to develop the Agricultural Credit Bank into a viable
financial institution
Industrial Sector
69.       The manufacturing sector has large unutilized capacity and can
make a rapid and significant contribution to GDP growth, employment
creation, and foreign exchange earnings. If, in addition, longer term
growth is to be viable, the deep structural problems that beset the sector
will have to be tackled. Measures to achieve the structural transformation
of Jamaica's manufacturing sector can only be implemented over the medium
term, but since an immediate output and export response is also needed,
additional policy measures consistent with the desired transformation of
the sector could asslst the recovery. In addition, the lack of a
source of medium term credit hampers the chances of success of a growth
policy based on the leading role of the private sector.



- 30 -
(a) Lack of dynamism in manufactured exports.
70.       Manufactured exports (as well as other non-traditional exports)
have not performed dynamically during recent years, the main reason being
a structure of protection based on quantitative restrictions to imports
(QRs) that penalizes sales to external markets --particularly those outside
the CARICOM region -- and distorts the internal allocation of
resources. QRs apply mostly to consumer soods; of 364 items subject to QRs,
82% correspond to consumer goods, 7% to intermediate goods, and the
remaining 11% to capital goods. QRs do not affect significantly the
availability of producer's goods for export industries that, by and large,
have access to them at international prices. However, since domestic
production of protected goods can be sold to the domestic market at prices
substantially higher than international prices, the system of incentives is
biased against exports.   Effective protection coefficients, that measure
the extent to which domestic value added can exceed value added measured at
international prices, show that for the manufacturing sector as a whole
effective protection was 50% in 1978. A breakdown of this coefficient
according to the geographical destination of sales shows that sales to the
domestic market had the highest effective protection (68%), followed by
sales to the CARICOM market (19%), while sales to extraregional markets had
negative effective protection (-10%).   Thus, although the existing
industrial structure could possibly supply a rapid output response until
capacity utilization is nearly full, it does not provide an adequate
foundation for longer-term growth, in view of the limited size of the
domestic and CARICOM markets.   The key issue is to undo the anti-export
bias of inward-looking policies while reducing the intersectoral
differences in effective protection.
71.       Action program.  The Government has already taken several
measures in support of the development of manufactured exports, such as:
(a) the creation of the EDF, financed by the Bank and the IDB, that assures
the availability of foreign exchange to finance imported inputs used by
exporters; (b) the creation of the kingston Free Zone, providing economic
infrastructure, in a free trade environment, for the functioning of enclave
type industries; (c) the liberalization of the import licensing system,
including the provision of automatic licenses to EDF users; (d) increased
activity by two effective public sector organizations such as the Jamaica
National Export Corporation (a promotional agency) and the Jamaica Export
Trading Company (a trading house). The Government is also committed to
maintain a competitive exchange rate. The Government has also agreed to
terms of reference to prepare an action program on export incentives, to be
put in place in 1982.
72.       Over the medium term, instilling dynamism to manufactured exports
requires undoing the anti-export bias resulting from past policies. In
Jamaica, this calls for the elimination of quantitative restrictions to
imports--presently the main form of protection--and, instead, making the
CARICOM Common External Tariff fully operational. The Government considers
that the reform of the system of protection is a major component of the
shift to an export oriented development strategy, but wishes to effect it
gradually in order to avoid possible adverse consequences in the short run.



- 31 -
73.       The Government is committed to eliminating the QRs gradually over
a five year period. The following schedule has been agreed to:
Schedule for elimination of QRs
Date                  Number of
Items
February 7, 1982        64
January  1983           61
January  1984           61
January  1985           86
January  1986           46
January  1987           46
Total              364
74.       The Government has announced the policy of gradually phasing out
all QRs, except those related to national security or social reasons. The
Government feels that in order to go beyond the first round of elimination
there is a need to conduct studies to detect which domestic industries
might be severely affected and, in some cases, to introduce temporary
tariff surcharges or excise taxes, as well as to decide on the specific
sequences in which QRs would be eliminated. The criteria governing the
choice of the specific sequence will be: a) to achieve an even distribution
of the short term disturbances that the implementation of the new policy
might cause on production and employment levels; and b) to emphasize during
the early years of the program the elimination of QRs on intermediate and
capital goods. Completion of these studies would take place prior to the
preparation of the list of QRs to be eliminated in January  1983.
75.       The gradual elimination of QRs will only have an impact on
exports over the medium term. In the meantime, the Government of Jamaica
has agreed to the preparation of an action program for the promotion of
non-traditional exports (including agricultural goods), that will be
completed before the release of the second tranche of the proposed SAL.
The action program would include three classes of measures: (a) measures to
increase the availability of foreign exchange to exporters, possibly
through the extension of the system of retained foreign exchange accounts
to all exporters; (b) the provision of fiscal incentives to exports outside
CARICOM; and (c) possible modifications to the export financing systems.



- 32 -
76. In order to create sources of medium term financing for the
development of the manufacturing sector, the Government has created the
National Development Bank, that will function as a second-tier lending
institution. The action program to establish the National Development Bank
was discussed in paragraphs 34-35.
(b) Rationalization of specific industrial subsectors
(garments, footwear, construction materials).
77.       There is a need for the rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors. The Government has selected three: garments, footwear,
construction materials. The first two have been selected by the Government
because the country is believed to possess a comparative advantage in them
and the export drive would thus be reinforced. The construction materials
subsector is considered important in connection with the intensified
investment effort that the country will make over the next few years.
78.       Action Program.  The objective is to develop exports and, at the
same time, reduce the prices of these products for domestic consumers.
These subsectors would operate in a free trade atmosphere as far as access
to inputs is concerned, and would be allowed to compete in the domestic
market under the CARICOM Common External Tariff. The Government is
preparing specific programs for each subsector. Satisfactory progress in
the development of the specific action programs would be made prior to the
release of the second tranche and implementation of the program begun
before the end of the year. Depending on the results obtained in these
subsectors, the scheme might be extended to other subsectors.
C. THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND THE EXTENDED
AGREEMENT WITH THE IMF
79.       The policies and actions related to the proposed SAL are fully
consistent with the objectives and commitments undertaken as part of the
Extended Agreement between the Government of Jamaica and the IMF. The
overall objective is the same in both cases: economic recovery and
sustained growth through the adoption of an export oriented strategy that
emphasizes the dynamic role of the private sector. There is, however, a
difference in emphasis. The Extended Agreement with the IMF places
more emphasis on short to medium term issues, while the structural
adjustment policies adopted as part of the proposed SAL places more
emphasis on medium to longer term issues.
80.       Some of the action programs that make up the proposed SAL refer
to policy areas that were not covered under the Extended Agreement with the
IMF. The remainder are policy areas that were covered under the Extended
Agreement, but are now being defined with greater detail or more
specificity. The action programs that are entirely new under the proposed
SAL are: (a) establishment of functional medium term lending institutions
(paras. 34-35); (b) increasing efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange through the possible introduction of an auctioning system for
import licences (paras. 43-44); (c) attraction of private capital through
the possible establishment of a scheme to attract migrants' savings



- 33 -
(paras. 45-46); (d) fuller utilization of agricultural lands (paras.
48-51); (e) elimination of praedial larceny (paras. 56-57); (f)
rehabilitation of the sugar industry (paras. 58-63)1/; (g) rehabilitation
of the banana industry (paras. 64-65) 1/; (h) strengthening of agricultural
institutions (paras. 66-68); and rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors (paras. 77-78).
81.       In those policy areas that are common to both the proposed SAL
and the Extended Agreement with the IMF, the Government is now undertaking
further commitments, made possible because greater knowledge has been
accumulated, or because it is now possible to focus on longer term issues
and to identify measures with greater detail. For those policy areas the
EFF and SAL may be compared as follows:
(a) Savings of Public Enterprises
EFF. The Government stated its objective of requiring public
enterprises to operate efficiently and its intention to limit
budget support to these entities. The Government also set forth
its intention to divest itself of commecial-type public
enterprises and made reference to programs to rehabilitate Air
Jamaica and the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.
SAL. Action programs for eight public enterprises have been
identified, five of which have already been prepared and are now
being implemented. The Government committed itself to
eliminate the current account deficits of all major public
enterprises and to restrict its share of investment expenditures
of public enterprises to no more than 30% of total investment
costs by its fiscal year 1983/84. Pricing decisions have been
delegated to managers of public enterprises other than utilities.
(b) The Public Sector Investment Program.
EFF. The Government stated that it would prepare a public sector
investment program with the assistance of the Bank.
SAL. A public sector investment program was prepared as part of
the SAL, a monitoring system is being put in place and the
Government is committed to rolling over the program annually.
1/   The objective of increasing output of this crop was stated under the
Extended Agreement, but no detailed action program was spelled out.



- 34 -
(c) Promotion of Domestic Savings.
EFF. The Government agreed to a thorough review of the tax
system, with a view to increasing revenues, as well as to remove
possible disincentives to savings.
SAL. An analysis is to be made of the obstacles to the
development of capital markets, particularly those that might
hinder private savings.
(d) External Marketing Organizations.
EFF. The Government agreed to the termination of the monopsony
powers of the external marketing organizations.
SAL. Provision is made to make six management audits of the
external marketing organizations, three of which have been
completed. In addition, a program of studies will be undertaken
to reduce the non-marketing functions of the external marketing
organizations.
Ce) Quantitative Restrictions.
EFF. The Government made a commitment not to introduce any new
quantiative restrictions on imports.
SAL. The Government is committed to eliminate all QRs within a
five year period and to prepare an action program for the
development of non-traditional exports.
D. OTHER STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS
Bauxite and Alumina Industry
82.       Jamaica's endowment of bauxite resources, with reserves
equivalent to 130 years' output, permits further expansion of the bauxite
and alumina industry. But, over the medium term, export growth will have
to be mostly in the form of alumina, since international trade is now
geared towards taking alumina rather than bauxite, as a consequence of the
rise in shipping costs that followed the increases in energy prices during
the 1970s. In the short run, however, Jamaica's potential for increasing
the volume of alumina production and exports is rather limited, because the
existing reduction plants are operating close to their effective
capacity utilization limits, estimated at 92% in 1980. Therefore,
increased alumina exports will require substantial investments involving at
least a three-year gestation period. Output of bauxite, on the other hand,
could increase rapidly with only minor investments but the international
marketing of the bauxite might be difficult.



- 35 -
83.       Enhancing the competitiveness of Jamaica's bauxite and alumina
industry is a major Government objective. Presently, Jamaica has three
major advantages over other bauxite and alumina producing countries. One
is its proximity to the United States and Canadian markets, which account
for more than one-third of the world's bauxite and alumina imports. The
second is the ease of mining bauxite, with virtual absence of overburden.
Finally, Jamaica has a good inland transportation system and the mines are
close to ports.
84.       Jamaica's disadvantages--compared to other major producing
countries--are the lack of exploited indigenous energy sources, a higher
production levy, the lower alumina content of the bauxite, and the chemical
composition of the mineral which requires higher temparatures in the
refining process. Energy costs, which in Jamaica move pari passu with the
price of imported oil, are thus a major factor in the economic viability of
the local alumina industry. The bauxite production levy is another impor-
tant factor. From 1974, when the levy was introduced, through 1979, when
the levy was reduced, Jamaica became an unattractive location from the view
point of the industry: production declined and no new investments were
made. In 1980, with a lower levy, alumina production increased and in
early 1981, with a new domestic political and economic environment, new
investments were being planned.
85.       This suggests that, given the level of the levy, cost considera-
tions are of paramount importance for new alumina plants. Minimization of
energy costs, then, becomes a crucial issue; in this connection, the sub-
stitution of coal for fuel oil merits serious consideration. Such a sub-
stitution, if profitable, would enhance the attractiveness of Jamaica as a
location for the alumina industry. If coal is a more profitable energy
option for the new investments, retrofitting to coal the existing plants
could also be profitable, given the economies of scale involved in the
expansion of ports, in loading and unloading devices, and in the inland
transportation system. Preliminary studies comparing fuel-oil versus coal
in the expansion of an alumina plant indicate that at the relative prices
prevailing in early 1981, the coal option would have a payback period bet-
ween 4 and 5 years.
86.       Action Program.  The major objectives of the Government in the
bauxite/alumina sector are: (i) to increase bauxite production and find
suitable markets for it; (ii) to expand alumina production capacity and
exports; (iii) to develop new markets.
87.       Inasmuch as most of the world's bauxite is traded within
integrated companies, and international commitments assumed by the
Government of Jamaica under the International Bauxite Association preclude
an aggressive pricing policy, increasing bauxite exports in the short run
is a difficult task. The authorities are following a four-way approach.
First, they are negotiating with the bauxite companies to use more Jamaican
bauxite for their production of aluminum and also to increase their sales
to third parties. As yet, however, there is no indication that the
companies' policy of geographical diversification of mineral sources will



- 36 -
change, or that the processing capacity of their North American plants
will increase. Second, the Government is concentrating on the EEC Market,
where it benefits from the Lome II Agreement. Third, the authorities are
approaching international brokerage firms to place some of Jamaica's
bauxite. Finally, the Government has sought to sell bauxite to the United
States strategic stockpile. The US Government has agreed to purchase 1.6
million tons of bauxite in its FY81/82.
88.       The Government is holding discussions with the companies on an
individual basis with a view to increase alumina production capacity.
Priority is being given to the expansion of existing facilities as opposed
to new plants, so as to reduce the time lag involved in bringing new
capacity on stream as well as to minimize investment costs. The Government
is offering investment incentives in the form of a rebate on the production
levy to be granted on a case by case basis. Negotiations are now under way
to expand the Jamalco plant from 550,000 MT/Y to 900,000 MT/Y. The
restoration of Alpart's capacity from 1.1 to 1.2 m MT/Y is also being
negotiated. At the same time, the Government has deferred the decision on
a government-owned 600,000 MT/Y alumina processing plant at South
Manchester, until the negotiations with the alumina companies are
completed.
89.       With regard to the development of new markets, the Government is
closely monitoring the possible construction of an aluminum smelter in
Trinidad and Tobago, which could be partly supplied with Jamaican alumina.
In addition, the Government has already signed a seven-year contract with
the USSR for the supply of 250,000 MT/Y from 1984 through 1990. Other new
markets are being sought.
Tourism
90.       The tourist sector has large unutilized capacity and can make a
rapid recovery contributing to foreign exchange earnings and employment
creation. A major issue is the public ownership of hotel properties. It
is the expressed objective of the Government to divest as many of the
currently owned hotel properties as possible, in line with its general
objective of distancing itself from commercial operations.
91. Availability of medium-term credit--at nonsubsidized rates--is a major
factor affecting the growth prospects of the sector. During recent years
medium-term credit was available only from foreign commercial banks, in
small quantities and at high cost, since lenders were reluctant to increase
their exposure in Jamaica and the Jamaica Development Bank was inactive.
The establishment of an operational source of medium-term credit (paragaphs
34-35) is quite relevant from the point of view of the tourism sector.
92.       Achievement of the growth targets defined by the Government will
require a major advertising and promotional effort, particularly at the
beginning, when the negative impact of the turmoil of 1980 will have to be
overcome in the context of a less than buoyant market for international
tourism. The Tourist Board should be adequately funded for this purpose.



- 37 -
93.       Action Program.  The Government's strategy in the tourism sector
is directed at rapidly decreasing the Government's involvement in the
direct operation of hotel properties and creating an atmosphere conducive
to the private development of the sector. The Government is presently
conducting its strategy in two stages; in the first stage, the hotels are
returned to private operation through a lease or management contract;
in the second stage, after a few years, the hotels would be sold. This
approach avoids the sale of properties at a time when the depressed
condition of the tourism market would be reflected in prices. In addition,
the longer period would furnish domestic tourism operators more opportunity
to place competitive bids. The Government has also launched a major
promotional effort through increased funding to the Tourist Board. The
establishment of the National Development Bank should help meet the
sector's requirements for medium-term credit.
Energy
94.       Jamaica's effectiveness in tackling its energy problem will have
a large bearing on the medium-term performance of the economy. Presently,
bagasse is virtually the only exploited domestic energy resource; as a
result, imported oil must cover over 90% of the island's total energy
consumption, or 99% of commercial energy consumption (the remaining 1%
being hydroelectric power). Oil imports are therefore high; in 1980 they
totalled 15.6 million barrels, with a foreign exchange cost of US$470
million, or 39% of merchandise imports and 16% of GDP. Given that the
balance of payments is, and is likely to continue being, the binding
constraint to Jamaica's economic growth, the connection between energy
consumption and economic performance is inescapable.
95.       Jamaica's domestic energy resources have never been fully
assessed. The limited information now available suggests that Jamaica's
energy resources are modest, and even if exploitation turns out to be
economically feasible, long lead times will be involved before commercial
production reaches a substantial scale. Identified or possible energy
resources are: (a) the Blue Mountain hydroelectric scheme, (b) other
(micro) hydroelectric sources, (c) peat, (d), oil, both onshore and
offshore, and (e) non-conventional sources, like biomass, solar energy,
ocean thermal energy conversion, etc.
96.       Energy conservation through a major demand management effort is
the only approach to Jamaica's energy problem that can yield results in a
relatively short period. The Government's program attaches a major role to
energy conservation. The issues involved in a major conservation effort
comprise both pricing policies and other energy conservation measures.
Jamaica has already had some successful experiences in both aspects of
energy conservation.
97.       Action Program.  The thrust of the Government's development
strategy in the energy sector is to reduce reliance on imported petroleum
through the promotion of energy conservation and the development of
indigenous energy sources.



- 38 -
98.       In the area of energy conservation, the Government is pursuing a
policy of realistic pricing for energy products.  All subsidies on
petroleum products have been eliminated, and, with the exceptions of fuel
oil and marine diesel, prices for petroleum products sold in the inland
market are controlled by the Government.  Sales to the international sector
are made at international prices. At the final consumer level, price
differentials between gasoline and medium distillates have traditionally
been high, because of taxation. The Government determines inland prices
through a price fixation formula based on Caribbean quotations that has
permitted full recovery of costs. In order to even out short-term price
fluctuations of crude prices, a "stabilization" levy on all petroleum
products was introduced in 1977.
99.       With assistance of USAID, the Government has developed an energy
conservation plan that seeks to set up lines of credit for energy saving
activities, to assist consumers with energy auditing and retrofitting, and
to strengthen the capability of Ministry of Mining and Energy to plan and
monitor the program. The major sources of increases in energy efficiency
of the Jamaican economy would be in the energy-intensive industries. As
indicated above (Paragraph 85) the bauxite/alumina industry has the option
of converting to coal. The rehabilitation of the cement plant includes
improving fuel efficiency in heating processes and substitution of more
efficient fuels in electricity generation; the feasibility of retrofitting
to coal is also being considered. In addition, through the rehabilitation
and upgrading of transmission and distribution networks operated by the
Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSC), as well as through improved
maintenance, the Government hopes to effect substantial fuel savings. The
Bank is currently considering a loan to JPSC for this purpose. Such a loan
would continue the programs finances under two earlier Bank projects.
100.      The Government is also attempting to develop indigenous energy
sources.  In this regard, an onshore oil and gas exploration project
supported by the IDB is under way; offshore exploration is being supported
through a project that has received Bank financing.  The Government intends
to undertake all oil and gas exploration activities through, or in
partnership with, private oil companies. The feasibility of hydropower
development at various sites, among them the Blue Mountain, is also being
studied. Finally, the development of nontraditional energy sources,
including peat, solar energy and other alternative sources are being
explored.
Tax Reform
101.      Reform of the taxation system would contribute to public resource
mobilization, to reduce inequities, and to increase economic efficiency.
There is scope to increase the buoyancy of the tax system; this could be
accomplished substituting ad valorem tax rates for specific rates (about
half of the revenue generated by indirect taxes results from specific
rates) and introducing periodic reassessments of property values. Some
excise taxes may be increased, particularly for goods whose imports are



- 39 -
effected by QRs. Tax administration could be improved to prevent
reportedly large evasion and arrears, in particular with respect to the
income tax. The income tax system has brought about certain inequities
through evasion encouraged by high marginal tax rates, negligible
penalties, and poor tax administration.
102.      Action Program.  The Government is planning a number of measures
during the next two years in order to increase receipts of tax revenues and
improve the fiscal position. First, a Board of Review has recently been
established with the purpose of overseeing administrative strengthening of
the tax system. In this regard, the Board has already initiated programs
to improve revenue collection and encourage compliance, recruit and train
staff, and to monitor the assessing activities of the Revenue Departments.
Second, steps are being taken to review the property tax sytem through
revaluation of land and revision of rates. It is expected that this
process will be completed by FY83/84. Third, the income tax system, both
personal and corporate, is being reviewed. Among other aspects, the rate
structure, allowances, and means of reducing tax avoidance and erosion are
being assessed. Fourth, the Government is planning to shift to an ad
valorem system of sales tax in order to increase revenues and improve the
efficiency of administration. Fifth, the Government is reviewing the
excise taxes applicable to goods whose imports are limited by quantitative
restrictions. Finally, computerization of the tax collection department
will strengthen the administration of a variety of taxes.
III. PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY, 1982-86
A. Directions of the Jamaican Economy
103       The economic policies of the new Government of Jamaica emphasize
the dynamic role of the private sector in pursuing an export-led
development strategy. They differ substantially from past policies that
stressed the leading role of the public sector and oriented production
towards the requirements of the domestic market.
104.      If the private sector is to become the main engine of growth, a
major effort will be needed in order to reestablish a propitious investment
climate. The Government's positive attitude towards investors, domestic
and foreign, has resulted in the creation of several bilateral business
groups through which numerous investment proposals and enquiries are being
processed. External private capital plays a major role in the Government's
program (paras 45-46). At the same time, efforts to increase the savings
of public enterprises and to rationalize and limit the investment
activities of the public sector (jointly with the increase in savings of
the Central Government) will reduce the public sector's claim on scarce
investible resources (paras 32-33). The creation of medium-term lending
institutions seeks to provide an adequate channel for private sector
financing (paras 34-35).



- 40 -
105.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism are likely to be the main
sources of output growth in the 1980s. The bauxite and alumina industry
also has a role to play, contributing to ease the balance of payments
constraint; such a role, however, is likely to be less important than in
the 1960s and early 1970s because of the lack of domestic energy resources.
106.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism hold the greatest promise
for rapid output growth, employment creation, and foreign exchange
earnings. In connection with agriculture, the Government's program
emphasizes better resource use (paras 48-51), the reconstruction of
commercial agriculture including rehabilitation programs for the sugar and
banana subsectors (paras 58-63 and 64-65), and the deregulation of the
sector through a revision of the role of the EMOs. The factors limiting
the growth of manufacturing production (such as availability of foreign
exchange and export incentives) are likely to be overcome faster and,
therefore, the sector holds the greatest promise in terms of dynamic output
growth and employment creation. However, rapid growth can only take place
if extraregional exports increase substantially; the Government's strategy
emphasizes redressing the balance of the incentives system, reducing the
profitability of production for the domestic market (through the
elimination of QRs) (paras 71-74) and increasing the attractiveness of
nontraditional exports (para 75).
B. Output, Income and Expenditure
107.      The stabilization efforts and the medium-term programs launched
by the Government of Jamaica are expected to put the economy once again on
a growth course. Real GDP growth has been projected at 3.8% in 1982, 4.9%
in 1983, and at rates fluctuating between 4.0% and 4.5% in 1984-1986.
These growth rates, to be attained through the adoption of an export
oriented development strategy, would imply a strong economic performance,
especially in view of the fact that the world economy is projected to grow
relatively slowly during those years. 1/ These projections imply, given
a rate of population growth of 1% per annum, that per capita GDP in 1986,
would reach--in terms of US$ of 1980--a value of $1442, which would be 18%
over the 1981 level, but still 13% below the 1972 peak level.
108.      On the expenditure side, the macroeconomic projections reflect a
shift from consumption to investment; in this framework, private
consumption expenditures would attain modest gains. Measured at constant
prices, the share of investment expenditures in GDP has been projected to
1/   The World Development Report IV, for example, projects "midpoint" OECD
growth at 2.5% per annum during 1980-85; this compares to 5.1%
(1960-70), 3.3% (1970-80), and 1.3% during 1980.



- 41 -
increase from 14% in 1981 to 19% in 1986, reflecting the need gradually
to intensify the capital accumulation effort in order to achieve the growth
targets. The share of total consumption expenditures, private plus public,
has been projected to decrease from 89% in 1981 to 79% in 1986 reflecting
the need to limit the growth of consumption to rates consistent with the
expansion in investment. Public consumption expenditures were projected to
decline 3.5%, reflecting the Governments objectives of reducing public
expenditures relative to GDP and of also reducing public sector employment
to the extent of the labor force attrition rate. On the other hand private
consumption expenditures were projected to increase 15% over the projection
period, permitting some increase in the standards of living.

109.      The financing of the investment effort has been projected to
change its composition, in line with the Government's policies.
Investment--measured at current prices--is projected to increase as a share
of GDP, rising from nearly 17% in 1981 to about 24% in the last two years
of the projection period. Internal saving is expected to finance a growing
portion of the capital accumulation effort, while external saving would
finance a decreasing share. Internal saving are projected to increase from
3% of GDP in 1981 to 16% in 1986.  The expected rise in public sector
saving from -1.2% of GDP in 1981 to 6% by 1984 reflects the Government's
commitment to strengthen the financial performance of the Central
Government and to increase current saving of major public enterprises.
Private sector saving is also expected to show a rising trend.  External
saving, the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, is
projected to decline from nearly 14% of GDP in 1981 to 7.4% in 1986.

a/  Public Sector Investment Program and financing plan have not been

110.      Agricultural output is expected to grow 28% during the projection
period. During the initial years, the'recovery of traditional export
crops--sugar and bananas--would constitute the major source of growth;
later on, other agricultural activities are expected to provide the main
impetus to growth. Sugar output has been projected to increase from
200,000 MT in 1981 to 330,000 tons in 1986, a level consistent with the
productive capacity of the sugar factories that will continue operating.
OItput of bananas has been projected to increase from 70,000 MT in 1981 to
200,000 MT in 1986, a level that would be consistent with the Government's
objective of filling the quota in the UK market. For both products the
projected increases are steep; but in both cases, output is severely
depressed and the targeted levels only imply its recovery to previously
attained levels.
111.      The mining sector has been projected to grow 18% during the
projection period. The annual growth rates vary considerably reflecting
the specific hypotheses that were adopted. In the case of bauxite, output
levels reflect the recent decision of the US Government to purchase
Jamaican bauxite for its strategic stockpile in 1982 and 1983. In the case
of alumina, it was assumed that the existing reduction,plants would
gradually approach capacity utilization, reaching it in 1985, and that the
Jamalco plant will be expanded by 350,000 MT/year with the new capacity
coming into operation in 1986.
112.      The manufacturing sector has been projected to increase by 46%
during the projection period. The projected output value for the terminal
year of the projections would be 2% higher than the peak level reached in
1973. Annual growth rates are higher during the first three years,
reflecting the existence of vast unutilized capacity in the manufacturing
sector, and/or the possibility of restoring productive capacity, degraded
during the last few years, through minor investments. The assumed pattern
of annual growth rates reflects increased availability of foreign exchange,
some expansion of domestic demand, and a substantial increase in
manufactured exports.



- 43 -
113.      Construction activity has been projected to increase 48% from
1981 to 1986; annual growth would be smaller during the first two years
than during the last three, reflecting the gradual pick up in private
investment. Gross Domestic Product generated in the rest of the productive
sectors has been projected to decline in the case of government services
and to increase in the case of the remaining sectors. The decline in
government services was projected at 3.5% with respect to the 1981 level,
reflecting the Government's intention to reduce public employment. The
rest of the productive sectors were projected to increase 25%, following
the increase in economic activity.

C.   The Balance of Payments
114.      The medium-term balance of payments projections are based on the
Government's export-led development strategy. Growth in export earnings
reflects the program's objective to put unutilized capacity to work in order
to generate foreign exchange quickly. The anticipated increase in economic
growth would need to be supported by increased imports, particularly of raw
materials and capital goods.  In nominal terms, the current account deficit is
not projected to begin a gradual decline until 1985. The balance of payments
will continue to be the binding constraint on the economy; the projections
imply continued reliance on public capital inflows, but the estimated
requirements are somewhat lower in the latter three years of the projection
period. Consistent with the Government's objective of relying more on the
private sector, direct foreign investment is expected to be a significant
component of capital inflows, thus contributing to the gradual reduction in
the need for foreign official assistance.
115.      Growth of the volume of exports of goods and non-factor services is
expected to average 7.1% a year during 1982-86. Attaining this projected
rate, however, will entail a substantial effort, particularly if the world
economy only grows modestly as it is now expected to. The volume of exports
of bauxite is expected to attain substantially higher levels in 1982-84,
reflecting purchases by the US Government for its strategic stockpile. The
volume of alumina exports, on the other hand,is expected to decline nearly 12%
in 1982, but after this year, it is expected to grow   gradually to reach full
capacity utilization by 1985. In 1986, alumina exports would increase by 12Z,
reflecting the completion of the Jamalco plant 350,000 MT/year expansion.
Volumes of the traditional export crops of sugar and bananas are also expected
to rise, in line with the Government's objective of exploiting fully its
guaranteed markets in Europe and the action programs for those sectors. Sugar
exports would begin to increase in 1983, rising from the 1982 projected volume
of 100,000 MT to 230,000 MT by 1986. The recovery of banana exports from the
depressed 1981 level of 22,000 tons would start in 1982 and by 1986 exports
would fill the quota in the UK market, 150,000 tons. Reflecting their pivotal
role in the Government's export-oriented program, manufactured exports are
projected to nearly triple from a 1981 nominal value of US$116 million to
US$331 million in 1986, representing an average real growth of 15% a year.
This growth assumes that the sector will undergo significant structural
changes during this period. Tourism is expected to achieve average real
growth of 9% per annum as capacity utilization gradually is increased to a
nearly 70% hotel occupancy rate by 1986. After taking into account projected
changes in international prices, the nominal growth of exports of goods and
non-factor services is expected to average 14.4% a year during the period,
rising from US$1.5 billion in 1981 to nearly US$2.9 billion in 1986.

116.      Growth in the volume of imports of goods and non-factor services
is projected at of about 5% between 1982 and 1986; the nominal increase is
expected to average 12.2% per annum, from US$1.7 billion in 1981 to
slightly over US$3 billion in 1986. Jamaica's fuel import bill would rise
from an estimated US$450 million in 1981 to US$724 million in 1986. Energy
conservation is expected to generate oil import savings in
the non-bauxite/alumina economy of about 20% by 1985, so that the volume of
fuel imports would increase by only 8% over the period. In line with the
expected expansion of output in the mining, manufacturing and construction
sectors, imports of raw materials and capital goods are expected to record
an average real increase of about 8% per year. Outflows of investment
income are projected to average about US$360 million a year given the rapid
increase in public external debt, and also reflecting higher private sector
remittances, particularly in the latter years of the projection period,
from the mining sector and other direct foreign investments.

117.      The share of the current account deficit in GDP is projected to fall
gradually from 14% in 1982 to 7.4% in 1986.  The nominal current account
deficit is projected to peak at US$524 million in 1984; thereafter the deficit
would decline gradually to US$439 million by 1986.
118.      Net external capital inflows averaging about US$520 million, would
be required to cover the current account deficit, external debt amortization
and an increase in international reserves. External capital requirements
would peak at US$544 million in 1984, and would fall to US$469 million in the
last year of the period. About 30% of the requirements would be covered by
private capital flows whose importance would increase from a share of 14% in
1982 to 39% in 1986. A large share of the estimated direct investment
corresponds to the anticipated expansion of the Jamalco alumina plant. In
addition, the Government is trying to attract other foreign investments,
particularly joint ventures, and has set up an organization to manage
promotion efforts and to assist interested businessmen. Of course, the
projections for private direct investment (other than alumina-related) are
highly tentative. If they are less than anticipated, the requirements of
public capital would be correspondingly tigher or the growth targets would
have to be scaled down. The remaining 70% of external capital requirements
are projected to be filled by public capital disbursements averaging US$565
million a year. Disbursements would peak in 1982 at US$642 million, but
decline to lower levels, reaching US$533 million in 1986.

D. Creditworthiness
119.       Because of the rapid increase in public external debt in recent
years, Jamaica's debt service ratio has risen to 20.3% in 1981. The burden
will ease particularly after 1983, and the projected debt service ratio
would reach 16% in 1986.  The continued requirement for public external
capital results in a rising ratio of public external debt to GDP, from a
projected 52.5% share in 1981 to a high of 61% in 1983 before gradually
falling in the following three years, reaching 56% in 1986.   Nevertheless,
the new Jamaican Government is implementing a program to end the country's
long period of economic decline and to initiate economic recovery which is
supported by a three-year agreement with the IMF. The Government has
defined a program for the structural transformation of the economy in close
consultation with the Bank. With the policies adopted by the Government,
the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments would decline
from 14% of GDP in 1981 to about 7% of GDP in 1986; this is a substantial
improvement but Jamaica will need to continue reducing this deficit in
subsequent years. On this basis, provided Jamaica successfully carries out
its economic stabilization and recovery program, it should be considered
creditworthy for continued external assistance, subject to close monitoring
of implementation of the action program described above.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
120.       The Bank has made 25 loansij in Jamaica totalling US$330.2
million after cancellations. Of this amount, US$117.4 million (36%) has
been for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power,
water supply and sewerage; US$98.5 million (30%) for program-type lending
and for a revolving fund for financing of inputs for export industries; and
the remainder has been for agriculture and agroindustry (12%), education
(7%), sites and services (5%), forestry (4%), population and nutrition
(3%), small-scale enterprises (2%), and petroleum exploration (2%). At the
end of 1980, Jamaica's debt to the Bank stood at US$171 million, or 14% of
external debt outstanding and disbursed; debt service to the Bank during
the year amounted to US$16.7 million, or 10% of total debt service. These
shares are not expected to change substantially in the next five years.
The undisbursed amount of Bank loans as of September 30, 1981 amounted to
US$97.3 million. There have been four IFC investments in Jamaica, with the
most recent being a loan in 1981 to a flour mill company.
1/   Including a telecommunications loan made in 1967 to the Jamaica
Telephone Company and cancelled in the same year, but not including a
US$6.8 million Third Education Project for vocational education, which
was approved by the Executive Directors on December 15, 1981.



- 49 -
121.      Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized
Infrastructure investment. Although financing for this purpose continued,
the emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housing and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In
response to the changing economic situation, a further shift in Bank
lending took place in Jamaica in the late 1970s. The priority needs of
this most recent period have been the country's critical short-to-medium
balance of payments and production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending
program contained a US$30 million program loan and an US$18 million loan
for the rehabilitation of sugar factories. The FY79 US$12 million forestry
project and US$31.5 million second program loan were directed at similar
needs. Most of the FY79 program loan proceeds were allocated to the
financing of import needs of export industries through the establishment of
a revolving Export Development Fund. Other FY79 lending operations
included a fourth highway loan of US$16.0 million and a small-scale
industry loan of US$7.0 million. In the absence of a medium-term economic
program no loans were made in FY80. In FY81, the Bank made a second loan
for the Export Development Fund and a loan for offshore petroleum
exploration.
122.      Project implementation difficulties have occurred in Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These difficulties have had three
principal causes: (i) shortage of key personnel; (ii) organizational and
structural problems in the public sector, including inadequacies in the
management systems used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii)
budgeting restraints resulting in shortages of local financing. The
difficult economic conditions of the last several years have affected and
intensified the problems in all areas. The Government has committed itself
to deal with these problems through the structural adjustment program that
it has undertaken, which includes specific measures for improved project
management, monitoring and financing.
123.      The Bank's lending program for FY82 includes--in addition to the
proposed structural adjustment loan--an already approved US$6.8 million
loan for vocational education, a US$6 million technical assistance loan
which would help support the structural adjustment program and a US$14.7
million loan to expand the Kingston Free Zone, directed at encouraging
additional foreign investment for export industries. Other projects
under consideration for Bank financing are a third power project, aimed at
rehabilitating the electric power system, and agricultural and industrial
credit projects, which would support new credit institutions and provide
medium- and long-term capital for private sector investment, particularly
in those areas which will result in increased exports. If the proposed SAL
is a success, i.e. if the Government Program is executed as projected and
has the expected results, a follow-up SAL may also be considered for FY83.



- 50 -
124.      Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies
has been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending
strategy. The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort
for the Caribbean called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development. The Group has met annually in Washington since 1978. The
Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries and the
recipient countries.  Within the framework of the Group, individual country
subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative group meetings, have been
held. The subgroup meetings for Jamaica have provided an opportunity to
examine jointly the country's economic situation and policies, to consider
a country project list, and to coordinate overall assistance efforts. As a
result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of related donor
activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank and IMF
assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing of US$225 million in FY81 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. This assistance financed inter alia the local cost requirements of
several Bank-assisted projects. The Caribbean Group has also provided a
basis for cofinancing foreign exchange costs with the OPEC Special Fund in
the Bank-assisted Second Power Project. In addition to the close
relationship established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican
problems, the Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of
the Caribbean Group--the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean
Development Bank--as well as with bilateral aid agencies in several major
donor countries.
PART V - THE PROJECT
125.      The proposed project was identified in January 1981 following a
request by the Government. The project was appraised in March 1981 by a
mission composed of Messrs. Meyer and Lilliehook. Negotiations were held
in Washington from January 29 to February 1, 1982 with a Jamaican
delegation led by Mr. Horace Barber, Financial Secretary in the Ministry
of Finance and Planning. A Loan and Project Summary is at the front of
this report. There is no separate appraisal report but further details on
the activities to be financed by the project are presented in Annex IV.
126.      Agreement has been reached with the Government of Jamaica on a
Structural Adjustment Program which will form the basis of an SAL which has
been processed jointly with the present loan. The Government recognizes
that the implementation and monitoring of this program in many areas will
require external support as the necessary manpower is not available in
Jamaica. The technical assistance loan has been designed to help the
Government overcome this shortage and is closely linked to the commitments
made by the Government with respect to the SAL.



- 51 -
127.      The deteriorating economic climate in Jamaica from 1973 to 1980
led to a serious loss of skilled manpower on all levels. This was
compounded by growing political violence as well as a general deterioration
of law and order resulting in a rising level of violent crime. The loss of
professionals was felt throughout the economy. The situation in the public
sector was even worse as it, in addition to the loss by emigration, also
lost a large share of its skilled manpower to the private sector as a
result of the very restrictive wage policies made necessary by the
deterioration of the public finances.
128.      In spite of the change of government in October 1980 and the
visible improvement in morale of many professionals and middle class
persons, it appears unlikely that any considerable number of the highly
educated Jamaican emigrants would be willing to accept managerial positions
in the public sector, at the levels of renumeration now prevailing. Once
the Government has proven its capability and gained the confidence of the
middle class, the flow back could conceivably grow. The short-run
improvement of the absorptive capacity of the Jamaican economy requires an
infusion of key experts that at present are not available to the
Government. This however must be regarded as a temporary measure. A
lasting improvement will only be achieved if (a) Jamaican emigrants are
induced to return on a permanent basis, and/or (b) new people are trained
and the relative attractiveness of emigration is reduced. Some temporary
relief may be gained by using the services of local consultants. A
reduction of the scope of the public sector, for example through the sale
of public enterprises that the Government is now undertaking,. could also
ease the problem.
Project Objectives
129.      The use of the resources provided by the loan will be closely
linked to the requirements of the proposed SAL. The following priority
areas have been identified:
(a) Measures to increase current savings of major public enterprises.
(b) Support in establishing new medium-term development lending
institutions--the Agricultural Credit Bank and the National
Development Bank.
(c) Assistance in establishing a system for the preparation and
monitoring of a rolling three-year Public Sector Investment
Program.
(d) Measures to promote domestic savings.
(e) Measures to improve the efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange.
(f) Development of programs for better utilization of agricultural
lands.



- 52 -
(g) Measures to make external marketing organizations more effective
and to provide price incentives to farmers.
(h)  Rehabilitation of production and exports of bananas.
(i)  Studies and assistance related to the strengthening of
agricultural sector institutions.
(j)  Preparation of an Action Program to increase non-traditional
exports.
(k)  Study of a phased elimination of quantitative restrictions to
imports and their replacement by increased tariff protection.
(1)  Studies on the rehabilitation of selected industrial subsectors.
(m)  Technical assistance to the Ministries of Industry and Commerce
and Agriculture.
130.       The technical assistance loan would finance recruitment of high
level experts for key advisory positions within the public sector, for
periods in most cases of up to two years each, experts and consultants for
short-term studies and activities, and training to develop local management
capabilities. It would also finance recruitment costs and the purchase of
vehicles necessary to implement the project.
131.      Flexibility will be maintained to cover unforeseen technical
assistance needs that may arise during the implementation of the Structural
Adjustment Program by providing unallocated loan resources. The table
listing the monitorable action programs under the SAL indicates other
possible needs for technical assistance (para. 29).
132.      It is not the objective of the present project to design a new
improved administrative structure. Time is of crucial importance and a
more sophisticated and ambitious approach would require a measure of prepa-
ration work that could seriously delay those reforms and improvements of
the administrative structure that have already been identified. The objec-
tive should be to focus on solving concrete identified problems and remove
obstacles to a more efficient management of the economy. If, in the light
of the experience gained the Government expresses an interest in more
extensive structural reform, such assistance could be considered at a later
time.
133.      Providing internationally recruited experts with direct oper-
ational responsibility at a level of renumeration several times higher than
that of similar level Jamaican civil servants could create friction and
problems of morale. It is crucial that all experts provided be considered
as temporary advisers and not as a new layer of specially privileged civil
servants. In this regard it is important that the Government appoints
qualified counterparts to work with the consultants and experts financed by
the Loan. The Government has agreed to the appointment of such personnel
before hiring persons under the Loan (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).



- 53 -
134.      The Government has decided to give the responsibility for the
administration of the project to the Project Analysis and Monitoring
Company (PAMCO) which comes under the authority of the Ministry of
Finance. The managing director of PAMCO has been appointed project
coordinator. He reports directly to the Minister of Finance who is at
present also the Prime Minister. This arrangement and the reinforcement of
PAMCO to be financed through this loan should ensure that PAMCO also
can serve as an effective coordinator of all external technical assistance
and that the Prime Minister and Government can be provided with up-to-date
information on the demand for technical assistance from different sectors,
the resources available and their present use. The Government has
requested that three experts be provided for a period of two years to
reinforce PAMCO. One of the experts, the management specialist, will
assist the Project Coordinator in coordinating and managing the technical
assistance program financed by the loan. This expert will have a key role
in helping assure the successful implementation of the project. He will
provide assistance in recruiting other experts and in contracting for the
studies financed by the loan .
135.      Timely recruitment of experts to be financed by the proposed loan
is likely to be a difficult task for the Government, unless appropriate use
is made of the scarce expertise available for that purpose. During the
last two years, the Management Services Division of the Jamaica National
Investment Company, MSD, has developed some of the required capabilities.
It has a full time recruitment officer, and has developed a Professionl and
Executive Registrar with well over 400 registrations. It also receives a
steady flow of enquiries from expatriate professional Jamaicans primarily
from UK and Canada. MSD will, along with the management specialist
assigned to PAMCO, provide recruitment assistance to the Project
Coordinator. If necessary a short-term consultant should be engaged to
assist with recruitment, financed through the loan, working either with MSD
or directly with PAMCO.
136.      Jamaica is currently receiving substantial amounts of technical
assistance from other sources. USAID gave a US$1 million grant for FY1981
(October 1, 1980 to September 30, 1981) to be followed by a grant of US$3
million for FY82. USAID has financed short-term assistance in the areas of
export development and promotion, investment promotion, investment
management, accelerated project development and implementation and skills
training. IDB is currently studying a possible technical assistance grant
to be concentrated in the areas of agriculture, water supply and construc-
tion. Technical assistance from UNDP is estimated at US$6.0 million over
the years 1982-1986. The European Development Fund, FAO and several
bilateral donors also provide technical assistance. During project prepa-
ration, discussions have been held with representatives of AID, IDB, UNDP,
European Development Fund and FAO to coordinate planned programs and avoid
duplication. It is conceivable that for some of the priority areas,
identified below, other sources of technical assistance, normally on a



- 54 -
grant basis, will be available in which case such items will be deleted and
the funds reallocated. As a rule, technical assistance from the
institutions mentioned above is primarily project oriented and, in the case
of AID, oriented towards assisting the private sector. The emphasis
placed by the proposed project on strengthening the economic and financial
management of the public sector should thus complement the efforts of other
donors. The Bank is currently providing technical assistance as a
component of a number of ongoing projects. New requests that fall within
the framework of ongoing projects will, to the extent possible, be
accommodated by using uncommitted funds from those projects.
137.      Based on the commitments of the Government in relation to the SAL
program and taking into account the overall technical assistance resources
available, the following areas have been identified for financing through
the loan.
Measures to increase current savings of major public enterprises
138.      The Government is committed to restore financial viability to the
publicly owned enterprises through cost reductions, revenue increases,
divestment and, if necessary, by closing down unviable enterprises. The
target is to eliminate all current account deficits in FY83/84 and to
decrease the Government share of the financing of their capital expendi-
tures.
139.      The Ministry of Finance has a unit of four professionals respon-
sible for monitoring the public enterprises and preparing data for Govern-
ment decisions on their management, policies and capital investment. This
unit needs to be reinforced by at least one experienced financial analyst
who would have as his primary responsibilities the training of the unit
staff and the introduction of proper and uniform reporting procedures for
the public enterprises.
Support in setting up new Credit Insitutions
140.      During the last few years there has been no effective Jamaican
credit intermediary for medium- and long-term credit. In May 1981 the
Government decided to close down the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) and
replace it with two new credit institutions, the National Development Bank
(NDB) and the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB). While JDB operated by direct
lending the two new institutions will operate primarily as second tier
lenders through the commercial banks with only a small volume of direct
lending. In the case of ACB a number of the People's Cooperative Banks
(PCBs) will be rehabilitated and given assistance to serve, together with
commercial banks and other credit institutions, as outlets for the ACB.
141.      Some technical assistance has already been provided from funds
out of the Second Program Loan (Loan 1715-JM) to ACB to design its organi-
zational structure and its relations with the PCBs. It is expected that
considerable technical assistance will be needed to get the two institu-
tions operational. Some assistance may be received from IDB in connection
with its proposed industrial rehabilitation and agricultural credit loans.
The Bank is considering a possible industrial credit loan, which would



- 55 -
require that the NDB be operational by the time such a loan is approved.
The Government has prepared an operational program for ACB. Preparation
and adoption of an operational program for NDB will be required as a
condition for the release of the second tranche of the SAL. Consultants
amounting to 18 man-months for the NDB and 12 man-months for the ACB would
be financed through the proposed loan.
Preparation and Monitoring of the Public Investment Program
and its Financing Plan
142.      Given Jamaica's financial situation, high priority has to be
attached to ensure that available foreign financial assistance is used
properly and in a timely manner. A related important objective in this
field is to ensure that the public investment program is executed as
planned, and that implementation problems are promptly detected and
solved. Work has been started with funds out of the Bank's Second Program
Loan (1715), on the establishment of an institutional framework for the
preparation and monitoring of the investment program of the central
government. This work will continue and be extended to cover the
investments of the major non-financial public enterprises.
143.      Concerning the disbursement of foreign loans, information on loan
status is dispersed among several agencies and no coordinated reporting
system covering all loans exists to allow prompt provision of information
on debt status and disbursement projections. There are delays in process-
ing claims for reimbursement of project costs financed against the loans.
Among the causes of this situation are a lack of staff, the absence of
adequate reporting procedures and an uneven knowledge within executing
agencies of lenders' requirements. A reporting system to make it possible
to overcome these problems is already being designed by consultants
financed out of the technical assistance component of the Bank's Second
Program Loan. This work will continue with financing from the present
loan.
144.      The need to ensure satisfactory execution of the overall public
investment program, including its monitoring by the country's central
economic authorities, requires a more comprehensive effort. The first
requirement in this respect is to have a firm investment program,
approved by the Government as a whole, with the full support of all
executing agencies as well as of the external financial community. In this
respect, there is an urgent need to allocate sufficient resources to a
point of sufficient authority to be able to collect the necessary informa-
tion on the preparation and execution of public investment projects in a
timely manner. The function was originally carried out in Jamaica by the
Ministry of Finance. Later PAMCO was created to, inter alia, improve this
function.  Creating a separate company allowed hiring qualified staff at
salaries significantly higher than the civil service level of the
Ministry. However, PAMCO was never given sufficient resources to be effec-
tive, and was overburdened with a number of other assignments.



- 56 -
145.      Assistance in setting up an effective monitoring system must
assure that duplication is eliminated and that existing resources are effi-
ciently utilized. It will be necessary to ensure that the information
collected through monitoring activities is processed and that such informa-
tion that requires action is passed on without delay to the high level
officials responsible for expediting project execution. Moreover, the
internal organization of executing agencies is often inadequate and,
because of lack of domestic financial resources, the institutional frame-
work for new projects is often only established after approval of external
loans. Interagency cooperation is in most cases badly managed, delaying
the provision of inputs such as land titles, foreign exchange, and utility
connections. Shortage of project managers and trained personnel affects
virtually all projects. Training is generally phased in too late to allow
the staff trained for the project to participate effectively in its imple-
mentation. Shortages of counterpart funds frequently cause serious
delays. Many of the problems mentioned and other similar problems reflect
not only physical scarcity, but also inadequate management of existing
resources. Managerial techniques such as network analysis and critical
path analysis should be demonstrated to managers and training in their use
should also be provided.
146.      The Government has now decided to concentrate the task of prepar-
ing and monitoring the Public Sector Investment Program in PAMCO. To
enable PAMCO to assume this responsibility three experts will be financed.
To continue the work, previously funded by UNDP, of establishing an
effective and permanent consulting capability within MSD two management
advisers will be financed. To improve the statistical data required to
prepare the investment program the Department of Statistics will be
strengthened through the financing of an Adviser to the Director. A
specialist in management accounting and reporting and a specialist in
accounting systems for the Ministry of Finance will also be financed.
Short-term consultants will be engaged to review proposals for joint
ventures. The Government has adopted a policy of increasing the role of
private industry, both local and foreign, and an endeavor will be made to
attract private interests to such projects that are considered commercially
viable and thus remove them from the Public Sector Investment Program.
Measures to promote domestic savings
147.      IFC has recently discussed with Jamaican private and public
institutions the development of Jamaica's capital markets.  In this context
it has been agreed that a study, to be financed through the loan, should be
made of how to develop Jamaica's capital markets, with the objective of
proposing reforms designed to promote an increase in the supply of risk
capital.
Measures To Improve The Efficiency In The Allocation Of Foreign Exchange
148.      Presently a large share of the imports of non-essential goods is
financed through the parallel market. The Government has agreed that a
study be made, to be financed from the proposed loan, of a system whereby
the Bank of Jamaica would auction import licenses for such imports. The
benefit for the Government would be that BOJ would capture the premium over
the official exchange rate, now paid to private holders of foreign
exchange, without thereby giving the parallel market any official status.



- 57 -
Development of programs for better utilization of agricultural lands
149.      Considerable areas of arable land are presently either idle or
underutilized. The Government has decided on a program of land
classification to stimulate a better pattern of land use. The program will
include a review of previous soil studies, a detailed land resource
inventory and capability classification. Assistance will be received from
USAID in the land resource inventory and from the Netherlands in the
capability classification. Additional assistance will however be required
to formulate, implement and monitor the land use policies and incentives
that will be based on the findings of the studies. Progress in the
execution of the studies will be required prior to the release of the
second tranche of the SAL.
150.      The Government has decided in principle to sell or lease to the
tenants the land under the land lease program. It is also considering the
sale or lease of other Government owned land to private producers.
Progress in developing a program in this respect will be required before
release of the second tranche of the SAL. Technical assistance to the
Ministry of Agriculture to formulate and implement land use policies will
be financed by the proposed loan.
External markeing organizations and price incentives to farmers
151.      A strong disincentive  to an expansion of agricultural production
is the monopolistic power of the official external marketing organizations
(EMOs) for export crops. The two major problems are that their
monopolistic position has allowed them to keep farmgate prices at
unprofitable levels and that in many cases the marketing boards do not have
the capacity to transport, process and export the crops for which they are
responsible. The Government has now decided that producers of agricultural
crops, with the exception of sugar and bananas, should have greater freedom
to organize their own export marketing, or use private commercial channels,
if they so desire. The loan will provide financing for consultants to
prepare a study and plan of action for reducing the non-marketing
activities of the EMOs and improving the quality of the activities that are
to be retained, for example non-marketing functions such as extension and
research are expected to be merged with the Ministry of Agriculture
services to reduce overlap and unnecessary duplication of effort. The loan
will also finance a study of the external marketing activities of the EMOs
for pimento, citrus, coffee and cocoa to determine what additional measures
may be necessary to maximize export earnings for these commodities.
Rehabilitation of banana production and exports
152.      The Government is committed to restore banana production to
earlier levels to allow Jamaica to benefit fully from the UK quota. In the
Extended Fund Facility program agreed with the IMF the objective of exports
of 150,000 MT by 1983/84 is established. Financing for the rehabilitation
program is expected from IDB and EEC. A consultant to the Banana Company
and a banana extension specialist will be financed out of the proposed
loan.

Strengthening of agricultural sector institutions
153.      The reform of industrial and agricultural policies and the
strengthening of the institutional capability required to carry out such
reforms is recognized by the Government to be a high priority task.
However, the Government cannot at present assign sufficient skilled man-
power to elaborate in the near future the desired policy changes without
outside assistance. It should be noted in this respect that the public
administration of Jamaica has been overburdened in the last few years with
tasks for which it was ill prepared. The recent economic mission to
Jamaica identified a large number of government agencies and public
enterprises belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture. The organizational
network that has been created to supervise these agencies is complex,
fragmented and uncoordinated.
154.      At present the Jamaican agricultural sector receives substantial
technical assistance coming from all over the world, financed through loans
and grants from bilateral and multilateral aid organizations, including the
Bank. It appears that the Ministry of Agriculture has difficulty coordin-
ating and supervising the assistance provided and ensuring that its results
are made available to the sector. Many experts have been criticized for
not working with local counterparts, for displacing local personnel, and
for concentrating in Kingston and not performing field work.
155.      A review has been made to assure that the experts financed by the
loan would not duplicate any services that are available from other
sources. The Ministry of Agriculture has requested the services of a
policy adviser to the Minister, a project analyst and a specialist on
agricultural extension methods.
Preparation of an Action Plan to increase non-traditional exports
156.      The Government has decided to prepare an Action Program with the
assistance of consultants, financed through the loan, for the promotion of
non-traditional exports (including agricultural goods). The action program
would include: (a) measures to increase the availability of foreign
exchange to exporters, possibly through the extension of the system of
retained foreign exchange accounts to all exporters; (b) the provision of
fiscal incentives to exports outside CARICOM; and (c) possible modification
to the export financing systems.
Study of a phased elimination of quantitative restrictions to imports
157.      Over the medium term sustained industrial growth can only take
place as a result of a reorientation from import substitution to production
for export markets. A major obstacle to encourage a reorientation is the
present system of quantitative restrictions for imports. The Government
agrees that a reform of the system of protection must be a major component
of an export oriented development strategy. It has accepted to eliminate



- 59 -
the QRs over a five year period starting in February 1982 when QRs for 64
items weres eliminated. In order to cushion the strains of readjustment
for local industries, the tariff levels set out in the Caricom Common
External Tariff, which in the case of Jamaica to a large extent have not
been applied, owing to the existence of QRs, will now be made fully
operational.
158.      The tariff reform would be linked to the introduction of a system
of tax rebates for exports to reduce further their prevailing overall
anti-export bias.   Such a system has never been tried in Jamaica and a
study of experiences of other countries should first be made followed by an
analysis of the potential benefits and risks of applying different systems
in Jamaica. These studies as well as such studies that may be required for
the program of gradual elimination of QRs will be financed by the proposed
loan.
Studies on the rehabilitation and restructuring of selected industrial
subsectors
159.      The Government has recognized a need for rationalization of
certain industrial subsectors. It has decided to start by studying the
garments, footwear and construction material industries with the objective
of developing exports and reducing costs to the domestic consumers.
Consultants will be financed through the loan to carry out these studies.
Technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
160.      A need has been identified for an expert to help the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce analyse and formulate industrial policies and to
coordinate the work undertaken by the various sectoral institutions. A
consultant, to be financed from the loan, will be provided. The Government
has also requested financing for a study to analyse the present
institutional framework in the sector and prepare proposals for its
rationalization. A short term consultant may also be required to identify
and analyze the need for technical assistance of the private industrial
sector if the Government should decide to use a part of the unallocated
share of the loan for technical assistance to the private sector.
Other potential areas for technical assistance
161.      The Government has indicated an interest to use funds from the
loan to provide technical assistance to the private sector. The Government
has agreed to submit within six months of loan signing an assessment of the
needs for such technical assistance and the resources available from other
sources (Section 3.02 b of the draft Loan Agreement). The Bank will
then consider financing out of unallocated funds such technical assistance
for which no other source is available and which falls within the general
framework of the present loan and of the Structural Adjustment program.



- 60 -
162.      A high degree of flexibility should be maintained to be able to
provide resources to cover unforeseen needs that may arise during the
formulation and implementation of the structural adjustment program. The
table (para. 29) listing the monitorable action programs under the SAL
indicates other possible areas where technical assistance may be required.
The final allocation will also depend on factors beyond the control of the
Government such as the availability of other sources of technical
assistance which is often provided as a grant or on highly concessional
terms. A further uncertainty relates to the fact that the return to a path
of economic growth could lead to an increased demand for skilled personnel
and managers from the private sector and a risk that the public sector with
its significantly lower renumeration could be even more depleted.
Project Implementation and Organization
163.      The project is expected to be implemented over a three year
period. Each ministry involved would be responsible for the implementation
of its components. Overall administration of the project will be
coordinated by the Project Analysis and Monitoring Company (PAMCO), whose
managing director has been appointed Project Coordinator (Section 3.01 of
the draft Loan Agreement). He will report to the Prime Minister. In
administering the proposed project, as well as in coordinating all external
technical assistance, he will coordinate his work with the Financial
Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and will also keep in close liaison
with the concerned departments and agencies. For supervising the proposed
technical assistance project, the Bank will require the Coordinator to
submit quarterly progress reports.
164.      Consultants to be financed through the proposed loan could assist
the Coordinator in designing the required administrative procedures and
reporting systems to improve the coordinating function. Presentation of
procedures satisfactory to the Bank for the selection and recruitment of
consultants and advisers will be made a condition for effectiveness of the
loan (Section 5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Role of the advisors, their recruitment and contracting procedures
165.      Given the urgent need to improve the institutional capabilities
in the areas to be covered by the project, and the limited ability of the
Government to elaborate a detailed specification of the technical assis-
tance it requires, it will not be possible at this stage to define in
detail the roles, functions or responsibilities of all the consultants and
advisors to be provided.
166.      MSD will be requested to provide a substantial part of the
required recruitment services, working closely with the Technical
Assistance Coordinator, the Finance Ministry and the other Government
agencies which will be involved in the proposed project. For this purpose,
it may be necessary to complement temporarily MSD's current capabilities
with internationally recruited consultants, who could be financed through
the proposed loan.



- 61 -
167.      The functions, responsibilities and selection of individual
advisors and their terms and conditions of employment as well as terms of
reference and awards of contracts for studies will be decided by the
Government, subject to the Bank's concurrence. All consultants should be
recruited in conformity with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers of August 1981 (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement). Procurement of goods would be in conformity with local
procurement procedures requiring competitive shopping and quotations from
at least three suppliers (Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost, financing and disbursement
168.      The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is
estimated at US$7.2 million equivalent--including an unallocated amount
which would cover changes in the scope of work, additional services and
price contingencies--with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$6.0
million (83% of total project costs). The proposed loan of US$6.1 million
would finance the entire estimated foreign exchange component of the
project, including US$100,000 to finance the front-end fee. The Bank loan
will finance 100% of estimated costs for consultant contracts and studies,
and the foreign exchange costs of vehicles and recruitment. Disbursements
will be made against full documentation. The Government will either
provide or finance the cost of office space, local travel and back-up
services. Retroactive financing of US$200,000 is recommended to meet
the costs incurred after January 1, 1982, in order to accelerate project
implementation and to cover costs of some urgently needed experts on whose
terms of reference agreement has been reached with the Government.
(Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement). Cost estimates for identified
advisers, consultants and studies are contained in Annex IV.
169.      The cost of externally recruited short-term advisors and experts
has been estimated at US$10,000 per man month. Costs for longer term (one
to two years) experts are estimated at US$100,000 per man year. Costs for
locally recruited experts would be lower and the savings can be used to
increase the number of man months envisaged. A price contingency of 10%
has been used for second year costs. The cost estimates are based on the
assumption that the bulk of the technical assistance personnel will be
recruited during the first year.
Accounts and Audit
170.      The Ministry of Finance would establish and maintain consolidated
project accounts for all expenditures financed under this loan in a clearly
identifiable manner (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). These
accounts and supporting records pertaining to the services financed under
the loan would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank and the audit reports would be submitted to the Bank promptly
(Section 4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 62 -
Benefits and Risks
171.      The technical assistance loan would help strengthen the key
public sector institutions of Jamaica and assist with the formulation,
implementation and monitoring of economic policy reforms that have been
agreed between the Bank and GOJ as a basis for the structural adjustment
loan. Technical assistance will be urgently needed in order to live up to
the conditions for release of the second tranche.
172.      Institutional development is also urgently required to improve
the country's absorptive capacity and to enable it to derive maximum
benefit from presently available and possible future financial assistance
from bilateral and multilateral sources.
173.      Risks in project execution could arise from (a) delays in
recruitment of consultants and specialists by the ministries and agencies
involved and (b) lack of adequate counterpart staff. Given the
Government's commitment to promote structural adjustment as rapidly as
possible, it is likely that it will assign a high priority to timely
decisions and appropriate staffing to carry out the project.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
174.      The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately along with the Report of
the Committee provided in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
175.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
176.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Ln. No. 1003-JM: Sites and Services: US$15.0 million Loan of June 13,
1974; Effective date: September 9, 1974;
Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Project implementation is about 4-1/2 years behind schedule due
to delays in establishing and staffing the project unit and problems with
contractors. These delays resulted in a substantial cost overrun of the
original project. In view of the Government's budgetary constraints the
project has therefore been restructured to allow for some reduction in the
number of lots to be developed and for a significant reduction in housing
standards. The Government has recently proposed additional changes
involving the provision of shell houses on uncommitted lots and the
conversion of one site into an industrial estate. The Bank will study
these proposals but has not yet taken a position. The revised project is
expected to be completed by mid-1982.
1/   Loan of $11.4 million for Jamaica Flour Mills Ltd. approved, but not
signed.

Ln. No. 1032-JM: Third Highway Project:  US$13.5 million Loan of July 26,
1974; Effective date:  September 27, 1974; Closing date:
September 30, 1981.
Construction has been delayed due to shortages of engineering
staff, reliable equipment, cement and asphalt. The project is now
b           completed, about four years later than the appraisal estimate.
Ln. No. 1146-JM: Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project: US$15 million
Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective date: June 24, 1976;
Closing date: December 31, 1981.
Project implementation is more than 3 years behind the appraisal
schedule but is now proceeding satisfactorily. The Borrower's financial
position has, however, continuously deteriorated. A 45% tariff increase
took effect August 1, 1981 but additional measures will be required of the
Borrower in order to comply with the Loan Agreement.
Ln. No. 1284-JM: Second Population Project: US$6.8 million Loan of June
12, 1976; Effective date: August 30, 1976; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation has progressed reasonably well. The civil
works on health center facilities are expected to be completed by the end
of 1981. Disbursements are however lagging behind. Completion of other
project components is expected to be delayed until early 1982.
Ln. No. 1464-JM: Rural Development Project: US$15 million Loan of June 29,
1977; Effective date:  October 14, 1977; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation had initially been slow due to shortage of
funds, manpower problems and the difficult general economic situation.
Recent progress has however been encouraging; most project components are
now under implementation and are advancing satisfactorily. The first group
of settlers has been placed and a large share of the farm homes have been
completed.
Ln. No. 1516-JM: Second Power Project: US$20 million Loan of March 6,
1978; Effective date: June 1, 1978; Closing date:
September 30, 1982.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily after
considerable delays during the initial phase of project implementation, and
most of the loan proceeds have been committed. JPSC's operations have been
seriously affected by the limited availability of its most fuel efficient
generating units due to poor maintenance and operating procedures and a
lack of spare parts. The Government has requested a Bank loan for the
rehabilitation of these units, and for improvements to JPSC's transmission
and distribution system. Although JPSC's financial position has improved,
an increase in tariffs will be required to meet the agreed covenant.

Ln. No. 1517-JM: Sugar Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million Loan of March
6, 1978; Effective date: June 1, 197 ; Closing date:
June 30, 1983.
Although some progress in the rehabilitation of factories has
been made, implementation slowed down during the last two years due to the
extremely difficult financial position of the National Sugar Company,
executor of the project. The Government is now planning the divestment of
most of the sugar mills owned by NSC and has recently dissolved sugarcane
cooperatives that supplied a large share of the cane. The future of the
project will be decided in negotiations with the Government.
Ln. No. 1609-JM: Small Scale Enterprise Development Project: US$7 million
Loan of August 2, 1978; Effective date: December 27,
1978; Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Implementation of the program for modern small scale enterprises
executed by the Premier Investment Corporation (PIC) is proceding
satisfactorily. Implementation of the sub-program for very small scale
enterprises has been adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning the
institutional arrangements. Subject to Government confirmation remaining
uncommitted funds from this project would be reallocated to PIC.
Ln. No. 1715-JM: Second Program Loan: US$31.5 million Loan of June 8,
1979; Effective date: August 27, 1979; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Loan proceeds allocated to the Export Development Fund to finance
imports of raw materials and components for expansion of nontraditional
exports have been fully disbursed.  Implementation of the technical
assistance components financed with loan proceeds is proceeding
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1716-JM: Forestry Project: US$12 million Loan of June 8, 1979;
Effective date: December 11, 1979; Closing date: June
30, 1985.
Project implementation is behind schedule but is proceeding
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1740-JM: Fourth Highway Project: US$16 million Loan of July 10,
1979; Effective date: September 20, 1979; Closing date:
March 31, 1983.
The project has encountered serious delays caused primarily by
extraordinary rains and floods in 1979, a hurricane in 1980, shortages of
key staff and of budget resources. In view of the Government's difficult



- 73 -
ANNEX II
Page 5
budgetary position and the need for urgent rehabilitation, the project has
been restructured to allow utilization of loan funds for essential
maintenance work by reducing targets for more expensive types of periodic
maintenance.
Ln. No. 1978-JM: Second Export Development Poject: US$37 million Loan of
May 15, 1981; Effective date: August 6, 1981; Closing
date: December 31, 1983.
The loan includes US$22 million for financing of imports of raw
materials and spare parts for expansion of nontraditional exports. In
addition US$10 million are allocated to provide medium-term financing to
exporters and their suppliers for capital equipment and working capital.
US$4 million are to be used for financing inputs of imports for the banana
industry and US$1 million is for technical assistance to JECIC and JNEC.
Ln. No. 2017-JM: Offshore Petroleum Exploration Project: US$7.5 million
Loan of June 16, 1981; Effective date:
Closing date: June 30, 1985.
The project is directed at promoting exploration of Jamaica's
hydrocarbon potential by strengthening the Petroleum Company of Jamaica
both as a partner of private international companies and as an independent,
investor. This loan is not yet effective.
