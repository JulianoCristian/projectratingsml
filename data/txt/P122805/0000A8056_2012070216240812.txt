                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The proposed operation aims to support the authorities’ efforts to boost real growth through improved country competitiveness and increased private investment, and
                         the reduction of poverty. This operation also supports the authorities to implement a continuation of reforms under the PRSP-II and the new poverty reduction strategy
                         which aims to facilitate faster growth and sustainable development (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable or SCADD). The development
                         objectives of PRSG-11 are to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports with six intermediate results: (a) private investment in strategic sectors through
                         public-private partnerships; (b) export facilitation; (c) liberalization of trucking industry; (d) competitiveness of the cotton sector; (e) increased private sector
                         participation in formerly state-owned companies in the mining, transport and tourism sectors; and (f) transparency and certainty of rural land tenure, and (ii) promote
                         efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources. The proposed operation is an integral part of the World Bank Group’s Country Assistance
                         Strategy for FY10-12 and remains aligned with the overarching principle of aid harmonization as defined in the joint donor framework known as CGAB.
