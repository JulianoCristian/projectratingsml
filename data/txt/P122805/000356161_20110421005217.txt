Program Development   The proposed operation aims to support the authorities' efforts to boost real
Objectives and        growth through improved country competitiveness and increased private
Contribution to the   investment, and the reduction of poverty. This operation also supports the
CAS:                  authorities to implement a continuation of reforms under the PRSP-II and the
                      new poverty reduction strategy which aims to facilitate faster growth and
                      sustainable development (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de
                      Développement Durable or SCADD). The development objectives of PRSG-
                      11 are to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports with six
                      intermediate results: (a) private investment in strategic sectors through public-
                      private partnerships; (b) export facilitation; (c) liberalization of trucking
                      industry; (d) competitiveness of the cotton sector; (e) increased private sector
                      participation in formerly state-owned companies in the mining, transport and
                      tourism sectors; and (f) transparency and certainty of rural land tenure, and
                      (ii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public

                 resources. The proposed operation is an integral part of the World Bank
                 Group's Country Assistance Strategy for FY10-12 and remains aligned with
                 the overarching principle of aid harmonization as defined in the joint donor
                 framework known as CGAB.

Risks and Risk   Macroeconomic risk. The recent rebound in gold and cotton price has helped
Mitigation:      Burkina Faso recover from the global economic crisis. However, the country
                 remains heavily exposed to swings in the terms-of-trade and weather-related
                 shocks. Agriculture, cotton and mining remain vulnerable to adverse
                 exogenous shocks and fluctuating international commodity prices. In 2011,
                 growing import demand consistent with economic activities, coupled with
                 higher global food and oil prices, higher transportation costs, supply
                 disruptions, and temporary refugee migration that could result from the
                 political unrest in Côte d'Ivoire could have negative effects on the external
                 position, entail higher expenditure and hamper fiscal performance. Other
                 potential risks include lower foreign direct investment that could delay
                 needed investments in public infrastructure and in strategic sectors identified
                 for export diversification. Inadequate collection and use of anticipated mining
                 revenues would further hinder growth in fiscal space.
                 Political economy risk. Burkina Faso held presidential elections on
                 November 21, 2010. This has generated some delays in the implementation
                 of key reforms included in the CGAB/CSLP matrix as well as in the adoption
                 of the new matrix for 2011-2013, which is to be aligned with the new
                 SCADD. Some social unrest has also taken place in March 2011, which might
                 delay the reform process, if it continues for a prolonged period of time. In the
                 area of cotton reform, and freight liberalization, resistance from some sector
                 stakeholders may be too politically sensitive to overcome in the short term.
                 Lack of willingness to pursue the implementation of the rural land law may
                 hamper the delivery of land certificates. Increasing rents from the mining
                 sector may raise the stakes for control of public revenues and undermine
                 progress in improving transparency in public financial management.

                 Inadequate multi-sectoral coordination and communication. PRSC
                 implementation relies on good coordination between the MEF and line
                 ministries. Full implementation of all the prior actions requires early
                 planning processes, smooth communication and reporting lines. This becomes
                 even more complex when entities outside of direct Government control are
                 directly involved in the implementation of the program, such as the Court of
                 Accounts, the cotton producers' association or truckers' council, or private
                 sector and financial institutions. In addition, good communication and
                 coordination on specific reforms among members of dedicated multi-sectoral
                 task forces is essential, as in the case of the establishment of a PPP
                 framework.

                 Risk mitigation. The PRSG-11 will mitigate some of these risks. This
                 operation includes actions in the cotton, transport and tourism sectors, as well
                 as the promotion of public-private partnerships (PPP) and securing rural land
                 tenure with the objective of facilitating development of the private sector.
                 This will help increase the country's economic opportunities and improve its
                 resilience to exogenous shocks over time. Improved VAT credit


                                            x
                reimbursement mechanisms will facilitate exports through timely cash flows
                for export operations. The completion of the rural land legal framework
                provides the legal means for addressing rural land disputes through a
                progressive mechanism, from local consultations to initiating litigation as a
                last resort. Improving transparent budgetary reporting in general and on
                mining revenues in particular, and strengthening the efficacy of internal
                control institutions by promoting a risk-based approach, will provide
                additional safeguards against the political economy risk. Strengthening
                external accountability and oversight mechanisms (Court of Accounts, ASCE,
                the commercial courts) together with social pressure through the media and
                NGOs can limit to some degree the power of special interests or influencing
                decision-making. This operation is supported by significant TA and analytical
                work. The PAPSA project is accompanying cotton sector reforms, and the
                CEDP project supports the development of a PPP framework and the state
                divestiture program. The 2010 CEM explains the PPP principles and export
                facilitation measures, such as the role of the VAT credit reimbursement
                mechanism in creating timely cash flows for companies. The recent financial
                sector strategy developed with assistance from the Bank explains how to
                consolidate development financing funds. The new approach for DCIM
                derives from the recent PER, while IDA provides TA to disseminate risk-
                based approach in auditing. The forthcoming PER review will provide an
                analysis of national transport quotas, the queuing system, axle-load
                restrictions and a simulation of the redistributive impact of their
                suppression/enforcement. Technical support to the Ministry of Transport and
                on the PPP issues will also enhance multi-stakeholder sensitization and
                consensus-building around the new reforms. In order to address weather-
                related risks, the comprehensive DRM Country Plan, developed with the
                support of World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
                (GFDRR), aims to strengthen the capacity of Burkina Faso to reduce disaster
                and climate risks. The CGAC strategy, which is supported by an internal
                governance taskforce, provides additional safeguards. Efforts are being made
                to ensure regular and close monitoring of critical governance issues at a
                country and sectoral level and to improve the Bank's understanding of
                particular political economy contexts through analysis. The adoption of this
                program and assessment of progress through the joint donor framework
                known as CGAB/CSLP provide additional assurances that implementation of
                these policies remain closely monitored by the group of donors, as the CGAB
                provides several advantages notably (i) ownership; (ii) alignment; (iii)
                predictability; and (iv) result-based approach. Reform implementation unfolds
                under the close watch of civil society.

                ELEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT

                                    1.    INTRODUCTION

1.1.    This program document proposes a single-tranche Eleventh Poverty Reduction
Support Grant (PRSG-11) for SDR 78.9 million (US$125 million equivalent) to Burkina
Faso. It is the fifth of a programmatic series of five PRSC/Gs, covering the period 2007-2011, to
support the implementation of Burkina Faso's Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-
II). This operation aims to support the authorities' efforts to boost economic growth and
diversification. In addition, this operation supports the authorities during the start of the
implementation of the third generation of the country's poverty reduction strategy, aiming at
faster growth and sustainable development (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de
Développement Durable or SCADD), which was adopted on March 16, 2011. The current series
is a significant component of the World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for FY10-12.
The proposed operation accounted for over 30 percent of general budget support provided to
Burkina Faso in 2010 by Development Partners (DPs). In 2011, the IDA share in the general
budget support is expected to attain around 36.5 percent, as the global budget support by the
European Union, the AfDB and Denmark are expected to be lower than in 2010.

1.2.    The proposed PRSG-11 aims to support the acceleration of real growth through
improved country competitiveness and increased private investment, and the reduction of
poverty. Specifically, the PRSG-11 supports key actions to: (i) improve the investment climate
and promote exports; and (ii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of
public resources. The PRSG-11 would support private sector development by (a) facilitating the
establishment of a public-private partnership (PPP) strategy which clarifies stakeholders' risk-
sharing responsibilities, (b) the adoption of a clear mechanism for VAT credit reimbursement to
companies, (c) long-term land tenure security through the adoption of a fully-fledged legal
framework, and (d) the finalization of the state divestiture plan in the mining, transport and
tourism sectors. The PRSG-11 would further support the liberalization of freight transportation
to improve competitiveness throughout the economy, while tightening controls on truck
overloading to protect road infrastructure. It would also support competition in the cotton sector
through the readjustment of cotton growing areas between ginning companies. By ensuring that
over 50 percent of the `joint inter-ministerial expenditures' is broken down by administrative and
functional classification in the 2010 budget execution data, the PRSG-11 improves budget
management efficiency, increases transparency and prepares the transition to program budgeting.
Accountability will be enhanced by supporting the implementation of a risk-based audit
approach by administrative oversight institutions.
1.3.    Burkina Faso has a reasonably sound macroeconomic position, but remains
vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks and debt distress. Economic recovery in Burkina Faso
has gained momentum in 2010 after a period of slowdown during the previous years, due to
prudent macroeconomic management and favorable world prices for its two principal exports,
cotton and gold. Despite increasing revenues from cotton and gold exports, the country remains
vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks as its export base remains narrow, while its currency has
strengthened due to its peg to the Euro, affecting export competitiveness and increasing
competition from imports. Over the next few years, the country is facing potential challenges that

                                                1
threaten to weaken its macroeconomic performance. First, the rising oil and cereal prices may
again put pressures on the domestic economy and inflation. Given that international oil prices
have risen above US$100 a barrel at the beginning of 2011 due to growing world demand and
uncertainty in the Middle East, Burkina Faso faces a steeper bill given that more than 70 percent
of its energy requirements are met via imports of oil and gas. At the same time, the ongoing
political unrest in Côte d'Ivoire may cause a negative fiscal shock on the budget, if emergency
spending is required to mitigate the effects of temporary return of migrants. Moreover, the
current turmoil in Côte d'Ivoire may increase the costs of transit trade. According to the Burkina
Shippers' Council, about 20,000 tons of merchandise destined for Burkina have recently been
trapped in the port of Abidjan. Fiscal space in 2011 is expected to remain at the 2010 level
following the increase in revenue collection due to enhanced administrative capacity, and
significant revenues from gold mining activities. Nevertheless, fiscal space could be offset if
emergency expenditure associated with the Ivorian crisis materializes, in parallel with higher
international oil and food prices.
1.4.    The low level of foreign direct investment is not sufficient for investment in strategic
sectors and infrastructure development, but official transfers are expected to increase in
2011 compared to 2010 also reflecting an increase in the IDA allocation. On the other hand,
as the country's external financing does not rely on private capital flows, the rise in world
interest rates is unlikely to affect the country's external debt dynamics. Official transfers are
expected to increase from an estimated CFAF 170.2 billion in 2010 to CFAF 222.4 billion in
2011. Together with IDA, the IMF has been the most responsive in increasing its lending to the
country. On June 14, 2010, the IMF Executive Board approved Burkina Faso's three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) totaling 76.6 percent of quota (SDR 46.15
million). The AfDB contribution to the global budget support was CFAF 20.8 billion in 2010.
Assistance from the EU and the Netherlands accounted for 30 percent of general budget support
to the country in 2010. In 2011, the contribution to the global budget support from the EU is
expected to fall to around CFAF 40.5 billion, as crisis-related financing instruments were phased
out and are not going to provide additional financing in 2011. The Netherlands is expected to
maintain the same level of budget support in 2011 (CFAF 11.8 billion), while the AfDB
contribution is expected to fall to around CFAF 15.6 billion.
1.5.    The proposed operation seeks to meet the Government's budgetary financing needs
to support the implementation of growth-enhancing strategic priorities under the PRSP-II
and the SCADD, mainly in relation to public investment, service delivery, and job creation,
while providing resources as the country may begin to absorb the effects of the Ivorian
crisis and the surge in the international oil and food prices. The proposed size of PRSG-11
(US$125 million equivalent) is larger than initially envisaged for this operation mainly because
some resources were reallocated within the Burkina Faso IDA envelope (US$20 million) while
the country also qualified to receive unused IDA resources from the Regional envelope (US$35
million) 1 due to its economic performance and good standing vis-à-vis its regional IDA
recipients. The PRSG-11 allocation will support the continuation of reforms included in both the

  The authorities are discussing an amendment to the 2011 budget law to anticipate the risks and unexpected
spending associated with the ongoing crisis in Côte d'Ivoire and the surge in the international oil and food prices.
The Government investment programs in 2011 aim at securing energy in the rural areas through solar sources,
strengthening of multifunctional platforms and endowing women with technological means, supporting endowment
with agricultural equipment, and enhancing water, sanitation and IT infrastructures. Annex 2 includes the letter of
development policy and its objectives.

PRSP-II and the SCADD, which aim at improving private sector development and public
financial management. These areas were considered strategic under the PRSP-II and the
SCADD. The additional resources will also help close the financing gap for the SCADD,
estimated at US$620 million (2011-2015), while providing a cushion against potential negative
effects devolving from macroeconomic risks. In particular, they can be helpful in mitigating the
fiscal impact of higher oil prices and of the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. To date, Government
estimates of unplanned expenditure due to the interruption in energy supply from Côte d'Ivoire
indicate around US$16 million required for the acquisition of electricity generators for
productive activities. In addition, the spike in the international oil prices has generated an
unexpected bill for SONABHY estimated at around US$17 million, as the gasoline pump price
was capped for social reasons.
1.6.   Finally, the proposed operation aims at consolidating development outcomes
achieved throughout the current PRSC/G series. The main themes of the series focus on: (i)
improving the investment climate and promoting exports; (ii) protecting access to decentralized
basic services; and (iii) promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of
public resources. Development outcomes are most noticeable in relation to the third theme,
notably with regard to strengthening budget management and oversight, and audit institutions.
Good performance was also achieved in relation to the first theme, particularly the recovery and
competitiveness of the cotton sector and institutional reforms to promote private investment,
though there has been limited impact on export diversification to date. Support to the
Government's decentralization program has been less successful and has been dropped from this
operation.

                                 2. COUNTRY CONTEXT

                          A.    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.1.    Economic recovery in Burkina Faso has gained momentum in 2010, after a period of
slow growth during the previous year. After a deceleration of GDP growth to 3.2 percent in
2009 from 5.2 percent in 2008, fuelled by the impact of the international financial crisis on the
country's economic performance, real GDP growth attained 7.9 percent in 2010 (Table 2.1).
Severe floods hit the country again in July 2010, causing damage and casualties in 5 regions out
of 13, affecting more than 100,000 people.
2.2.    Agriculture and mining have been the main sources of growth, though the economy
is now less reliant on the cotton sector. Measures taken in recent years to support the
agriculture sector (a growth rate estimated at 15.6 percent in 2010) contributed to higher
production, especially for cereals (an increase of cereal production of 26 percent in 2010
compared to the previous campaign). Similarly, the use of genetically modified (GM) cotton
seeds, almost unique amongst West African cotton producers, should increase productivity in the
medium term, though production still dropped by 19 percent in 2010 due to poor rains. On the
other hand, the rebound in the global cotton price and the recent increase in the producers' price
should have led to higher incomes in 2010. In the mining sector, gold production is estimated to
have increased by 50 percent in 2010 with the beginning of operations of a fifth mine. Since
2009, gold exports have surpassed those of cotton, and are projected to generate gross revenues




                                                3
of CFAF 440 billion in 2010 compared to CFAF 107.8 billion of cotton exports.2 Cotton exports
revenues increased compared to 2009 (CFAF 96.8 billion) despite a drop in production, due to
higher cotton prices. There are good prospects for developing other minerals, such as manganese,
copper, iron ore, and zinc. Five gold mines are currently in operation and a new gold mine is
expected to become operational, which would lead to a further increase in gold exports from 5.6
tons in 2008 to more than 25 tons in 2011.
2.3.     The 2009/2010 cotton campaign has not produced the expected results. During the
2009/2010 campaign, 418,170 hectares were sown, out of which 31 percent with GM cotton
seed. The lack of rainfall at the beginning of the campaign and lower productivity related to
insufficient use of fertilizers resulted in a drop in production (361,120 tons) by around 19 percent
compared to the 2008/2009 campaign (447,180 tons) and by around 13 percent compared to
initial projections. On the other hand, a bonus of CFAF 8 per kilo was paid to the producers from
the price-smoothing fund, reflecting the rise in world prices, and has encouraged higher planting
for the 2010/11 season.
2.4.    A rebound in the international cotton price and increasing gold prices have
contributed to a rebound in economic growth. After a drop by more than 20 percent in US$
terms between August 2008 and October 2009, cotton prices have been rising since the fourth
quarter of 2009. The Cotton A Index indicated an increase in the international cotton price from
US cents 62.8/lb during 2009 to US$1.03/lb in 2010, though it is expected to average US$1.36/lb
in 2011. Gold prices have continued to rise from an annual average of US$973/toz in 2009 to
US$1,224.7/toz in 2010 and are expected to remain at US$1,426/toz in 2011. The combined
effects of high international cotton and gold prices should compensate for the strong import
demand fuelled by the growing economy and increasing international oil prices towards the end
of 2010.
2.5.    Some developments in the financial sector took place in 2010, although increasing
access to finance, especially for SMEs, remains a priority for private sector development.
The banks mobilized around 70 percent of all financial assets, with a relatively large share of the
financial assets held by the Social Security Funds or in the postal network. Some progress has
been achieved regarding the rehabilitation of two problematic banks, Banque Commerciale du
Burkina (BCB) and Banque de l'Habitat du Burkina Faso (BHBF). With regard to the BCB, the
board of directors decided to increase its capital to CFAF 18 billion, out of which CFAF 6.5
billion was already released and the remainder is expected to be raised in 2011 to comply with
regional regulations. In the second case, the International Financial Corporation (IFC) has
initiated discussions for its participation in the BHBF's capital. Microfinance mobilizes a large
share of all assets and manages as many accounts as the banks. However, low efficiency in the
banking sector translates into a high level of non-performing loans, and wide interest rate
spreads. Hence, it is important to increase the efficiency of the banking system by improving
financial intermediation and access to finance to support the private sector led growth agenda,
particularly in areas such as SME, rural, housing, and long term finance.

    Note, however, that the domestic value added in cotton is relatively higher due to its much lower import content.

2.6.    Inflation has been low. The twelve-month inflation rate is estimated at -0.6 percent in
2010 (annual average), mostly reflecting increased local cereal production. Money supply
increased by a projected 19.1 percent in 2010, in line with the substantial increase in foreign
assets. Credit to the economy has strengthened (estimated 8.9 percent increase in 2010 compared
to 1.2 percent in 2009). The inflation rate is expected to rise moderately to a projected 4.2


                                                                 5
percent in 2011, above the 3 percent WAEMU convergence criterion, in the context of higher
international oil and food prices.
2.7.    The government fiscal policy was consistent with macroeconomic stability, but the
fiscal deficit remained significant. The authorities' medium-term fiscal strategy aims to
improve fiscal sustainability through continued revenue-enhancing measures and public financial
management reforms. In 2010, the authorities adopted a tax reform. In the formal sector, income
taxes for individuals vary between 10 and 27.5 percent of income, according to three income
brackets, while corporate income tax is now 27.5 percent of company profit. In the informal
sector, a tax is applied based on the size of the community where the business is located (i.e.
Ouagadougou or a small city) and on the activity performed. The VAT is set at 18 percent. Total
revenues in 2010 increased by 1.9 percentage points to an estimated 15.6 percent of GDP, as a
result of continued tax administration improvements, new tax policy measures, receipts from
renewal of mobile phone licenses, and higher revenue from the mining sector.
2.8.    Total expenditures increased by 1.3 percentage points in 2010. They were estimated
at 25.7 percent of GDP because of higher domestically financed investment. Investment
expenditure increased to 12.2 percent in 2010 compared to 11.6 percent in 2009 led by
investments in infrastructure following the floods. Current expenditure slightly decreased from
12.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 12.2 percent in 2010, while wages and salaries
marginally decreased to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2010 from 5.8 percent in 2009. Emergency
assistance totaling US$8.2 million to mitigate the effects of the floods from July 2010 was also
deployed, without putting undue pressure on the 2010 budget. Budget execution was exceptional
during the first half of the year as expenditure carried over from 2009 appropriations, 3 equivalent
to 1.5 percent of GDP, were committed and paid in January-April 2010. Nevertheless, as
signaled by the IMF, the closing of the 2009 budget in April 2010 was not in compliance with
legal procedures, which set December as the end of the fiscal year. Despite the late closing of the
2009 fiscal year, all expenditures, including those committed in 2010, were recorded in the 2009
budget execution law transmitted to the Audit Court. Low administrative capacity and
procurement system inadequacies continue to hamper the overall implementation of the
investment budget.
2.9.    The overall budget deficit (including grants) was estimated at 5.6 percent of GDP in
2010, higher than its 2009 level (4.8 percent). The IMF First Review of the Three-Year
Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) signaled a minor breach of the overall
fiscal deficit (including grants) ceiling as of June 2010 (0.9 percent of GDP), which was mainly
due to the delayed disbursement of budgetary aid. However, the second half of 2010 has seen
higher budgetary aid. The final fiscal deficit is estimated to be in line with the ECF program and
congruent with the IMF conditionalities.
2.10. Burkina Faso's external position slightly improved in 2010, but is expected to
deteriorate in 2011. The current account deficit (including official transfers) has improved from
4.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 3.5 percent in 2010 but is projected to widen to 5
percent in 2011. However, this remains above the pre-crisis level of about 11 percent. The
external position benefitted from higher global cotton and gold prices. It also reflects strong
import demand, which is consistent with the level of economic activity driven by the need for

  The outlays were related to programs designed in 2009 to mitigate the impact of the global economic downturn and
the September 2009 floods.

infrastructure rehabilitation following the 2009 and 2010 floods, and increased agriculture and
mining production, along with the higher global oil and food prices. On the financing side, a
large increase in project grants and loans offset the decline in the FDI associated with the
completion of initial large investment projects in the mining sector. The overall balance of
payments remained in surplus, but declined from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 1.8
percent in 2010.
2.11. According to the most recent IMF - World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
(July 2010), risk of debt distress remained high, while some outstanding domestic arrears
from 2008 are still to be cleared. As indicated by the latest DSA, the net present value (NPV)
of external debt in 2010 was equal to 109.6 percent of exports, below the 2009 rate of 124.6
percent, reflecting positive export performance. External debt grew in 2010, to an estimated 21.5
percent of GDP, a 2.9 percentage point increase compared to the 2009 level. Under the 2010
DSA projections, the present value of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to breach its indicative
threshold starting in 2015. However, the DSA shows that the risk depends on a variety of factors
and can be mitigated by stronger export performance and more favorable financing terms.
Regarding domestic debt, in 2009 the authorities accelerated the settlement of audited domestic
payment arrears to the social security fund (CNSS), estimated at CFAF 22.9 billion at end-2008,
using a BCEAO loan related to the new SDR allocation from the IMF. Payments amounted to
CFAF 16.7 billion, with the remaining balance of CFAF 6.2 billion to be paid in 2010. The IMF
is undertaking a final assessment after all cash payment transactions on the 2010 budget were
completed at end-February 2011. The authorities committed to maintain a prudent borrowing
policy to preserve debt sustainability and to seek only concessional financing for their projects.

                    B.   ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.12. Burkina Faso's economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2011, but continues to
be driven by agriculture, mining, and services. GDP growth is projected at 5.2 percent in
2011, 5.6 percent in 2012 and 6.0 percent in 2013. Cotton production in the 2010/11 season has
decreased by 6 percent compared to the preceding season. On the other hand, producers may
benefit from the timely payment planned for the current crop season, the clearance of internal
arrears between producers and the increase of 14 percent in producer prices. Gold production is
expected to increase by around 40 percent and gold exports by 31 percent (in value terms) in
2011 as a result of higher production anticipated by the largest gold mine (Essakane) and driven
by prospects of high global gold prices. Expansion of the secondary sector would also boost
demand for services. Following the 2009 and 2010 floods, investment in infrastructure
rehabilitation will continue, and measures are being taken to improve public investment
execution.
2.13. The 2010/2011 cotton season yielded lower-than-expected results, as a consequence
of the lack of rainfall at the beginning of the campaign and sub-optimal use of fertilizers as
a result of informal marketing practices. 419,254 hectares were sown, using GM cotton seeds
for 66 percent of the cultivated areas. Production of seed cotton reached 338,000 tons. The floor
producer price of seed cotton for the 2010/2011 crop was set at CFAF 172 per kilo. Given the
positive outlook of the international cotton price, the AICB announced a premium of CFAF 10
per kilo, which sets the ceiling producer price of seed cotton for the 2010/2011 crop at CFAF
182 per kilo. Input prices remained at the same level as in the two preceding campaigns, thanks
to the subsidies granted. At the same time, the Government has begun to clear the internal arrears


                                                7
of village cotton producer groups. Since the ginning companies have mostly sold the 2010/2011
campaign fiber production through forward contracts, locking in favorable prices, the results are
expected to be positive in value terms.
2.14. Diversification opportunities exist in onion, mango, maize, cattle/beef, local poultry,
and sesame value chains. Value added has increased in poultry, cattle feedlots, onion
production and storage, and mango processing and exports. Increased productivity in food value
chains, including local cereals (maize, rice, sorghum and millet) will reinforce horizontal and
vertical diversification with development and adoption of post-harvest technologies and
management practices (initiatives supported by the World Bank's PAPSA and WAAPP). The
World Bank-supported Bagré Growth Pole Project under preparation is also expected to develop
a viable model of agribusiness development, with greater control of water resources and a more
conducive business environment. The Bagré pilot initiative will be extended to other areas as
part of a broad-based growth pole strategy across the country.
2.15. The Government intends to maintain its efforts for fiscal consolidation. In 2011,
fiscal policy will support economic recovery and address the impact of the 2009-10 floods, and
preserve medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. Revenue-enhancing measures and improved
public financial management are key priorities. Within a prudent fiscal framework, the
Government intends to allocate resources to: (i) support agriculture and livestock-raising; (ii)
rehabilitate infrastructure; (iii) consolidate poverty-reducing measures; and (iv) promote
employment.
2.16. In 2011, the fiscal position is expected to improve thanks to the continuation of
revenue collection efforts, but some pressure on expenditure is likely to arise following
spillovers from a prolonged Ivorian crisis, and increasing international oil and food prices.
The overall budget deficit (commitment basis, including grants) is expected to decline from 5.6
percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.4 percent in 2011 and 2.9 percent in 2012. Total revenue is
programmed to slightly decrease from 15.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 15 percent in 2011,
mainly because nontax revenue is expected to drop from its 2010 level which benefitted from the
renewal of three mobile phone licenses, while tax revenue remains almost at the same level in
2010 and 2011. Total revenues in 2011 are also expected to include revenues from a fourth
mobile phone license and higher revenues from the mining sector, while revenue collecting units
will continue monitoring of revenue performance. Expenditures are expected to account for 25.3
percent of GDP in 2011 falling to 24 percent in 2013. The wages and salaries are expected to rise
to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2011 compared to 5.6 percent in 2010. Preliminary Government
estimates indicate that the unplanned expenditure due to the interruption in energy supply from
Côte d'Ivoire is estimated at around US$16 million for the acquisition of electricity generators
for productive activities. In addition, according to the latest Government estimates, the spike in
international oil prices has generated an unexpected bill for SONABHY estimated at around
US$17 million, while the gasoline pump price 4 was capped for social reasons. Pro-poor spending
is expected to increase by about 10 percent to reach 6.5 percent of GDP in 2011. Capital
expenditure is projected at 12.9 percent of GDP, with a significant share allocated to
infrastructure. The Government plans to set up an investment fund financed, among other
sources, through the 2010 revenues from the renewal of mobile telephone licenses. The fund is

 Regarding the petroleum products, a study was finalized at the end of 2010. The draft provides for a new pricing
and taxation system that is to be implemented by end-June 2011. Consultations will be organized to finalize and
adopt the study and its recommendations.

                                                       8
going to support investments in energy, water and sanitation infrastructures, agriculture
equipment and disaster management. According to the IMF, in 2011, the budget deficit is fully
financed, including through the additional IDA allocation, and will be covered with program
grants (US$267.4 million), expected ECF disbursements (US$19.4 million), and net borrowing
from the regional bond market (US$54.2 million). The 2011 program takes into account
contingency expenditure of 1 percent of GDP aimed at mitigating the impact of potential shocks
on vulnerable groups.
2.17. Burkina Faso's external position is expected to deteriorate in 2011. The current
account (including official transfers) deterioration (see Table 2.1) may be explained by lower
cotton export volumes and higher international oil prices, which largely offset the effect of the
increase in gold export volumes. In addition, the service balance is expected to deteriorate further
by about 29 percent in 2011. Considering other net flows in the balance of payments, the overall
balance is expected to record a moderate surplus (1.4 percent of GDP) in 2011.
2.18. Rising international oil and food prices and the spillover effects from the Ivorian
crisis are the main risks to the macroeconomic outlook. Higher global food and oil prices,
higher transportations costs, supply disruptions, and temporary refugee migration generated by
the political unrest in Côte d'Ivoire could generate higher expenditures and hamper fiscal
performance. Inflation is projected to exceed 3 percent, reflecting the current international
context. Secondary risks in the medium-run may relate to a stagnating international financial
market that may require domestic financing, especially in the cotton sector; this might then
further affect an under-diversified banking sector. In the cotton sector, an under-capitalized
smoothing fund may not provide enough resources to mitigate the effects of any reversals in the
current favorable international cotton prices. In addition, the low level of foreign direct
investment could delay needed investments in public infrastructure and in strategic sectors
identified for export diversification. Inadequate collection and use of anticipated mining
revenues would further hinder growth in fiscal space. In addition, slow implementation of
growth-enhancing reforms, especially the medium-term rehabilitation of the cotton sector,
weather shocks and the lack of progress towards export diversification, would further hamper
economic growth.
2.19. Several measures may be taken to mitigate these risks. The combination of a
sufficiently capitalized price-smoothing fund and the creation of an "input fund" will moderate
the impact of potentially lower cotton prices or an appreciation of the euro on cotton producers.
Moreover, acceleration of reforms in the cotton sector and improved short-term price prospects
would lessen the sector's burden on public finances, while the introduction of weather-risk
management instruments could mitigate impact of weather shocks on agriculture production.
Ongoing public financial management reforms are also expected to help improve the fiscal
balance and the efficiency of public spending. In addition, the authorities intend to accelerate the
implementation of the public investment program to support productivity gains, and sustain
growth. With regard to the country's vulnerability to exogenous shocks, the authorities continue
to diversify economic activities, notably in the mining sector. Moreover, the current land reform
is expected to stimulate private investment in the agricultural sector and boost diversification
prospects over time.
2.20. Burkina Faso's external position continues to remain fragile, although the risk of
debt distress may lower in the context of favorable international cotton and gold prices.
Although the latest debt sustainability analysis (July 2010) indicates that the NPV of debt to

                                                 9
export ratio is expected to breach its 150-percent threshold by 2015, there have been some
developments in recent months. The 2010 DSA assessment shows that by 2022, Burkina reaches
its peak at 180 percent, before declining to 135 percent in 2030 as the improvement in the fiscal
position and export diversification efforts start to affect the debt dynamics. However, due to the
strong rebound in international gold and cotton prices which impact Burkina's export earnings,
the NPV of the debt-to-export ratios might decrease (see Table 2.1). A new DSA exercise is
planned in September 2011, which will take into account changes in the 2010 CPIA performance
(to be officially released mid-June 2011). All other debt indicators remain comfortably below
their policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline scenario. In light of the deteriorating debt-
to-GDP ratio, from 17 percent in 2010 to 21 percent in 2012, the Government is committed to
select investment projects based on clear positive economic rates of return. While the NPV of
public external debt increases in the short term, according to the 2010 DSA it stabilizes at about
24 percent of GDP in 2015 and declines thereafter, reaching about 17 percent of GDP by 2030.
The current high risk of debt distress based on the 2010 DSA underscores the importance of
continuing to limit external borrowing to grants and concessional loans, implementing a prudent
fiscal policy, and making continued efforts to diversify and increase exports. Sensitivity tests for
the 2010 DSA revealed that the debt outlook was vulnerable to world commodity prices and
persistent large fiscal deficits as well as export performance.
2.21. Seeking to lower its risk of debt distress, the Government continues to rely on grants
and highly concessional loans for its financing needs, and to strengthen its debt
management capacity. Although the increase in domestic and external financing to cope with
the impact of exogenous shocks in 2009 did not lead to a significant permanent deterioration of
debt service indicators, debt sustainability continues to guide the authorities' expenditure policy,
particularly its public investment program. The Government is committed to continue with its
prudent borrowing policy and to strengthen its management capacity through increased
equipment and training for the debt department. 5 Overall, Burkina's macroeconomic framework,
which encompasses progressive fiscal consolidation and sustained growth from the agriculture,
cotton and mining sectors, forms the basis for its IMF-supported ECF program and provides an
adequate basis for the proposed operation.

                       C.    POVERTY REDUCTION AND PRO-POOR SPENDING

2.22. Less than one year after the heavy floods of 2009, unusual rainfalls were recorded
again in 2010, affecting the living standards of many households. However the high level of
cotton prices may have mitigated some of the consequences of this natural disaster. The
rainfall in July 2010 caused at least 16 deaths, and left 84,395 people homeless corresponding to
13,193 households. People experienced considerable material damages and loss in livestock. In
parallel, historically good prices recorded for cotton in 2010/2011 should improve the conditions
of about 3 million people and offset the reduction of well-being of some of those affected by
floods. The good prices recorded for gold might also benefit some households involved in
traditional mining.
2.23. The overall poverty rate seems to be decreasing, but it is rather unevenly distributed
over the population. According to one simulation, the share of the population in poverty
decreased by around 7.9 percent between 2003 and 2007 (according to Wodon and Nouve,

5
  A new debt management assessment (DeMPA) with the World Bank was performed. Its results are expected to be
released by end-April 2011.

                                                    10
2008). However, provisional results based on the 2009 household survey are less encouraging,
and suggest only a very modest improvement of a few percentage points and a poverty rate of
43.9 percent in 2009. A poverty assessment is currently under way to try to reconcile differences
in methodology, clarify poverty trends, and update the poverty data. According to the provisional
results, poverty was reduced in rural areas but increased in urban areas over the period 2003-
2009. While this will have reduced inequality, the government will have to tackle a growing
phenomenon of impoverishment in the urban areas. With the rebound in economic growth
expected with the implementation of the new strategy, the government has retained its objective
of achieving a poverty rate of 35 percent by 2015 in the framework of the MDGs.
2.24. In order to achieve the objectives of the poverty reduction strategy, a Priority
Action Program (PAP) was defined and budgeted in 2010. The 2010 PAP was based on a
public investment plan amounting to CFAF 593 billion (around US$1.2 billion), which
represents an increase of 20 percent in comparison to 2009. Of that amount 21.4 and 23.2 percent
respectively were allocated to: (i) improve the access of poor to basic social services and to
social protection (Pillar 2 of the former PRSP); and (ii) enhance employment and income
generating activities opportunities available to poor people (Pillar 3 of the former PRSP). 6
2.25. Burkina Faso has prepared an annual Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), which is consistent with the poverty reduction priorities. Under the MTEF, the
priority sectors are rural development, environment, justice, health and basic education. Since the
adoption of the MTEF in 2002, a large share of the budget envelope is devoted to basic education
and primary health care. The priority sectors receive 60 percent of overall additional resources,
with basic education and health receiving 50 percent of resources allocated to priority sectors.
However, tracking expenditures exclusively allocated to vulnerable groups remains a challenge,
mainly because these groups are not clearly identified through a good targeting. The first report
on poverty spending which covers the year 2009 expenditures was made available in 2010, while
the authorities publish yearly data on expenditures for primary education, health, women's
welfare and other poverty-reducing social expenditures.
2.26. Access to basic services has improved thanks to increased public expenditure and
targeted social service provisions. The total budget for poverty-reducing spending increased
from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to an estimated 6.4 percent in 2010 (see Table 2.2). The share
of such spending in total public expenditures rose from 22.3 percent in 2006 to an estimated 25.4
percent in 2010. This reflects the steady increase in Government spending on education, health,
water and sanitation. The share of expenditure dedicated to basic education in total expenditure
increased slightly from 9.4 percent to a projected 10.1 percent over this time period, while the
share allocated to health care services rose from 7.4 percent to 7.7 percent. The share of
expenditure dedicated to women's welfare and other poverty-reducing social expenditure (water)
in total expenditure increased the most ­ from 4.9 percent to 7.1 percent. In the area of
education, good progress has been made in the implementation of the Ten-Year Basic Education
Development Plan (PDDEDB, 2001-2010), notably in the area of school infrastructure. The
number of schools rose from 8,182 in the 2006/07 school year to 10,198 in 2009/10, an increase
of 25 percent. During the same period, the number of classrooms grew from 28,925 to 38,269, a
rise of 32 percent. The national gross enrollment rate in primary education increased from 66.6
percent in 2007 to 85.8 percent in 2010. In contrast, progress made under the 2001-2010
National Health Development Plan has not led to reduced morbidity and mortality rates. Infant

6
    The disbursement rates achieved at the 2010 mid-term review of the PAP were 30 and 41 percent, respectively.

                                                          11
mortality rose from 77 to 79.6 per thousand over the period 2006-2008. However, the HIV/AIDS
program received an enormous boost following a Presidential decree that made access to ARV
treatment free of charge since January 2010. As a result, the number of people on ARV has now
exceeded 30,000 compared to just 8,000 in 2005. Controlling and treating epidemic diseases also
had good results, thanks to prevention and public awareness efforts and improved hygiene.
2.27. Nevertheless, there is still significant scope for improving the efficiency and equity
of public spending and the quality of services, especially the social safety nets targeting the
poorest groups. Public finance management reforms, stronger sector policies, and a new focus
on social protection and safety nets will all be crucial to further underpin human capital
development and poverty reduction. The recent Social Safety Nets (SSN) Review (2010) has
shown that the scope and coverage of the existing social safety net is too limited and that most
interventions are fairly small in scale and designed as temporary programs. On average,
excluding fuel subsidies, spending on social safety net programs was about 0.6 percent of GDP
from 2005 to 2009 and estimated at 1 percent in 2010, while about 20 percent of the population
is food insecure and lives in chronic poverty. Universal fuel subsidies are expensive (0.7 percent
of GDP in 2007) and have a very limited impact on the poorest decile (84 percent of the benefits
go to the non-poor). Among the remaining programs, food transfers are the main form of social
safety net programs in Burkina Faso, accounting for 69 percent of total SSN spending and over
80 percent of all estimated SSN beneficiaries in 2009 (excluding fuel subsidies). However, most
of the financing for social safety net programs comes from external and ad hoc resources.

2.28. Despite progress in social indicators, Burkina Faso remains near the bottom of the
Human Development Index. Burkina Faso ranks 161 out of 169 countries in the UNDP Human
Development Index (HDI) 2010, despite steady increase in social expenditures and institutional
reforms. This is the same position it held in 2005. Some explanatory factors are the overall
education level of the population remaining low, with mean years of schooling of 1.3 years per
person whereas the average in the low HDI countries is 4.1 years. In addition, the demographic
pattern is characterized by a high fertility rate of 6.2 children per women, a population growth
rate of 3.1 percent per year and an increase in life expectancy, making it difficult for government
to respond to the human development needs of a young population.
2.29. It is unlikely that the country will reach several important MDG targets by 2015,
such as halving the proportion of people with income less than US$1.25 a day, ensuring
completion of the primary education cycle for all children, and eliminating gender disparity in


                                                                    12
primary and secondary education. In education, the adult literacy rate was only 28.7 percent in
2007, and the quality of education remains low. Health outcomes for children and women have
not shown any improvement: only 41 percent of births were attended by trained medical
personnel, the maternal mortality ratio was estimated at a very high 700 per 100,000 child births,
and infant mortality remained at around or slightly above 100 per 1,000 child births between
2000 and 2008. Some progress has been made in other areas, specifically those related to HIV
prevalence, and environmental sustainability. The SCADD highlights important delays in
designing and implementing sectoral programs and allocating adequate public resources,
including at the local level, which are critical to help achieve the MDGs, especially the ones
where progress has been slow (literacy rates, health and sanitation). In order to help improve
Burkina Faso's human development indicators, an education DPO series is targeting improved
quality and equitable expansion of the education sector, while other IDA activities target
reproductive health and improved social service delivery.

               3.      THE "SCADD", BURKINA FASO'S NEW POVERTY
                              REDUCTION STRATEGY

3.1.    Burkina Faso has developed a new strategic vision for poverty reduction and
economic and human development, as expressed in the five-year Strategy for Faster
Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD) for the period 2011-2015. The SCADD was
finally adopted on March 16, 2011, replacing the second poverty reduction strategy (PRSP-II).
The PRSP­II aimed to maintain real GDP growth above 4 percent per annum, halve poverty to
35 percent and increase life expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015. The four pillars of the
PRSP strategy consisted of: (i) raising growth and equity in a stable macro-economic
environment to reduce poverty; (ii) increasing access to and quality of basic social service; (iii)
improving employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv) improving governance
with a particular emphasis on public sector management and budget management reforms.
3.2.    The SCADD will guide the next PRSC series through four broad strategic
orientations, notably: (i) promotion of growth poles and reduction of economic
vulnerability; (ii) development of economic infrastructures; (iii) investment in human
development; and (iv) promotion of sustainable development. Under the first two pillars, the
SCADD focuses on the promotion of productive sectors, in particular agro-pastoral (cotton,
cereals, sesame, fruits and vegetables, animal breeding), agro-industry and tourism development,
export diversification and economic infrastructures, such as industrial zones, technological parks,
airport construction, interconnection with the electricity network in Côte d'Ivoire, irrigation,
transport, telecommunication, and urban development. The third pillar aims at promoting
literacy, technical and professional education programs, tertiary education, delivery of water and
sanitation services, delivery of health services and the fight against HIV AIDS and the STDs,
and social protection. The fourth pillar focuses on reinforcing political, administrative, economic
and local governance, gender equality, demographic management, environment protection and
civil protection. The SCADD aims at achieving a double-digit GDP growth rate (10.3 percent)
by 2015, reducing poverty to 35 percent by that time, supporting increased public and private
investment, and tackling the high pace of demographic growth.
3.3.  The PRSG-11 will support a continuation of reforms under the PRSP-II and the
SCADD. Both PRSG-11 themes - private sector development and strengthening public financial
management - are key priorities of the PRSP-II and the SCADD. The SCADD builds on the

                                                13
PRSP-II strategic orientations and identifies specific development models that are sought to be
implemented. Both strategies put an emphasis on the development of productive activities and
related infrastructure, but the SCADD identifies more targeted means, such as growth poles,
clusters and PPP projects to reach these strategic objectives. The PRSG-11 support to the
development of a PPP strategy is therefore timely. While the PRSP-II emphasized agricultural
development and the reduction of production costs, the SCADD identifies other potential sources
of growth, such as tourism. Within the SCADD, environmental protection and gender integration
are high on the agenda, while service delivery is integrated within the broader agenda to improve
human capital. In the public financial management area, the SCADD focuses on strengthening
budget management oversight, a key reform supported by the proposed operation, which also
builds on the governance and budget management measures of the PRSP-II. Acknowledging the
lack of progress on the decentralization process under the PRSP-II, the SCADD provides actions
that aim at promoting decentralization, the acceleration of responsibility and resources transfer to
the local collectivities, the elaboration of local development plans, the coordination of the
decentralization process and capacity building for all the actors involved in this process.
3.4.     The SCADD identified an additional financing gap estimated at around US$620
million. The total cost of implementing the SCADD objectives is estimated at CFAF 7,496.2
billion, which represents around US$16 billion during 2011-2015 or around US$3 billion per
year. At the same time, the investment costs are estimated at around 57 percent of the total costs
­ that is around US$9 billion during 2011-2015 or on average US$1.8 billion per year. To
finance the SCADD implementation costs, the Government identified two main financing
sources during 2011-2015: (i) domestic resources - estimated at around US$2 billion per year;
and (ii) external resources (budget support, grants and loans) ­ estimated at US$1 billion per
year. Additional financing needed to support the Government's growth objectives was estimated,
on average, at around US$124 million per year. The Government expects to finance the SCADD
priorities through resources provided by the financial sector, improved effectiveness, efficiency
and productivity of public expenditure, improved access to microfinance and other instruments
targeting SMEs, remittances, better use of development assistance (notably by continuing
financial sector and taxation reforms and improved public investment that would increase access
to global budget support), and using other sources of international finance (multilateral financial
institutions and international donors interested in financing sectoral programs).

        4.   BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                     A.    LINK TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

4.1     The latest CAS (FY10-12) is in line with the Government's strategy for growth and
sustainable development. It aims to assist Burkina Faso in beginning to transform its economy,
supporting equitable and shared growth and making progress on human development, while
providing flexibility to address the impact of the global recession. The strategy supports the
Government's commitment to improved governance and enhanced public participation and aims
at improving social service delivery. It adopts new ways of doing business, which involve better
positioning the country's development in a regional context; strengthening analytical support and
developing results-focused approaches to the emerging issues of environmental preservation and
demography. The proposed PRSG-11 is an integral part of the CAS and a key IDA instrument to
continue supporting the Government's implementation of the country's economic and social
policy priorities. To enhance development impact, the PRSG-11 is designed to directly support

                                                14
objectives in two key policy areas of the PRSC series: (i) promoting economic growth; and (ii)
strengthening public financial management. Since effective decentralization of fiscal resources
under the PRSG-9 and PRSG-10 has not produced adequate results, the PRSG-11 does not
directly support specific measures under the third theme of this series, which was designed to
implement decentralization. However, a forthcoming World Bank technical assistance project on
decentralized development (FY12) will address capacity and accountability constraints at the
local government level which have, to date, created caution on the part of the Government to
proceeding with the effective decentralization of fiscal resources. The project will also support
the Government in improving the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal systems to pave the
way for future resource flows. The PRSC closely complements the IDA investment lending
program by supporting policy reforms needed to create enabling environments for effective
implementation of major investment operations in the area of economic and agricultural
diversification and strengthening decentralization and social services delivery.

                         B.    RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER PRSG 7-10

4.2     The Government made significant progress in reform implementation during 2007-
2010 (the implementation period of this third series, notably PRSC/Gs 7 to 10). The
PRSC/G series supported its efforts to improve: (i) the investment climate and promote exports;
(ii) the system for decentralization to enhance access to quality services; and (iii) the use of
public resources through enhanced public financial management. A comprehensive assessment
of the results attained since 2007 was included in the corresponding section of the program
documents for PRSG-9 and PRSG-10. Progress continued in a number of areas under PRSG-10.
Key results achieved over the past year are detailed below. Progress on specific reform measures
and related quantitative indicators are summarized in Annex 3.
4.3     Good development outcomes were achieved in relation to the first theme under the
previous operations (PRSC/G 7-9), notably the recovery and competitiveness of the cotton
sector. The price-setting mechanisms to calculate the farm gate price for cotton are in place, and
a credit rating agency is providing rating advice to the main ginning company, SOFITEX.
Nevertheless, cotton exports have fluctuated during 2007-2010 (Annex 3), mainly because of
weather conditions, fluctuating world cotton prices and international demand.
4.4     During the period covered under the PRSG-10, the Government continued the
reforms to restructure the cotton sector and to improve its financial sustainability in order
to mitigate the effects of the financial and economic crisis. After many challenging years,
prospects in the cotton sector have improved. Most difficulties were due to climatic shocks, the
decline in global cotton prices, the rise in the value of the Euro, and the weak rate of
transformation of seed cotton into fiber. In consultation with the key cotton stakeholders, the
Government adopted a two-year Action Plan (2009-2010) to address the effects of the global
economic downturn on the cotton sector. The Action Plan included measures to: (i) increase
productivity by scaling up of the use of GM Bt cotton from 20 percent in 2009 to 80 percent of
the total cultivated area, and implementing the UNPCB productivity program; (ii) improve input
access by reducing producers' debts; (iii) restructure financially SOFITEX; and (iv) strengthen
the company's performance.
4.5    Significant progress was made in scaling up the use of GM cotton seeds to increase
productivity during the 2010/2011 campaign. To this end, 66 percent of the cultivated areas
were sown with GM cotton seeds. This measure has reduced labor costs through fewer pesticide

                                               15
applications, while raising yields, thereby enhancing productivity levels, and reduced the risks to
farmers' health.
4.6     In line with the 2009­2010 Action Plan, the Government pursued SOFITEX's
restructuring. The company's latest recapitalization was an increase in 2010 of the State's
holdings by CFAF 16.4 billion, following the adoption by the Government of a financial
restructuring plan for the company. This, coupled with the expected increase in export earnings,
should contribute to the strengthening of the company's financial position. In this context, the
Government initiated discussions with SOFITEX to sign an agreement between SOFITEX and
the Treasury for the repayment of the company's obligations to commercial banks, which were
paid by the Treasury since 2009. In addition, SOFITEX carried out the revaluation of its fixed
assets and finalized the recapitalization in accordance with regional regulations. It also pursued
cost-cutting measures and a series of actions to strengthen its operations. In particular, the
company: (i) updated staffing plans, effective as of July 2010, based on recommendations from
the 2009 audit; (ii) created two new departments that will operate under international standards
(the internal audit and the management oversight departments); (iii) prepared a procedure manual
to strengthen management practices; (iv) set up a new information system; and (v) prepared a
five-year business plan.
4.7     Several other steps were taken to reduce the producers' debts, to enhance the price-
smoothing fund mechanism and to establish an input fund. The reduction of producers'
internal group debts from 2007-2008 started in July 2010 in the SOFITEX area through a pilot
payment operation in the Tuy province. Other payments are underway in the Balés province
(SOFITEX area) and the areas covered by the other two ginning companies, Faso Coton and
Socoma. Overall, this operation advances slowly. It is expected that the total reduction of
producers' debts before the start of Local Credit Committees at the end of October 2010 will
have a very positive impact during the 2011/2012 campaign. Following consultations with the
main donor representatives, the terms of reference for a study aiming at revising the mechanism
of the price-smoothing fund with the support of AFD were approved in 2010 and preliminary
results were discussed in early 2011. Terms of reference for a study on an input fund were also
finalized and the study is proceeding in 2011.
4.8     Business environment reforms and private sector support institutions were
consolidated throughout the series, but in some cases, success was less impressive. This led
to a reduction of processing time and the number of procedures for starting a business (from 16
days in 2007 to 14 days in 2010, and from 6 procedures in 2008 to 4 in 2010). CEFORE, the
business registration centre, opened regional offices for Northern and Central-Eastern regions.
The number of foreign investors attracted decreased though from 214 in 2007 to 146 in 2010, in
the context of the international financial and economic downturn, but the number of newly
established firms in Burkina increased from 3,264 in 2008 to 4,750 firms in 2010. Regarding
export diversification, the limited success is reflected by almost flat exports of processed meat
during 2007-2010 (2,000 tons in 2007; 2,200 tons in 2010), and the predominance of cotton and,
most recently, gold, in the export basket.
4.9     In 2010, the Government's sustained reforms of the business environment earned
the country an improved position in the Doing Business ranking. Burkina Faso ranked 151st
out of 183 countries in the 2011 Doing Business report issued in October 2010 (up from 154th in
Doing Business 2010). This was mainly due to reforms related to dealing with construction
permits, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and closing a business. The 2010 tax reform

                                                16
included the reduction of the corporate tax (27.5 percent of company profit), the increase in the
excise tax rate for alcoholic beverages from 25 to 30 percent, the introduction of an electronic
system for import valuation at customs, and the setting up of a Medium-Sized Entreprises Unit in
the Tax Department to strengthen monitoring and compliance. In addition, a new investment law
was adopted in January 2010. In other areas, progress has been slower. To improve financial
intermediation and increase access to finance for SMEs, the Government adopted a financial
sector strategy in 2010, but its implementation has been delayed. In the electricity sector, the
Bobo ­ Dioulasso - Ouagadougou transmission line was commissioned at the end of year 2009.
However, Burkina Faso experienced load shedding during the period of February-June 2010,
partly because of shortages in energy supplied from Côte d'Ivoire. Burkina Faso is benefitting
from cheaper energy when both countries are out of their peak load period, but unless generating
shortages in Côte d'Ivoire are dealt with, electricity costs will remain high.
4.10 With PRSG-10 support, some improvements in the management of the refrigerated
slaughterhouse in Ouagadougou and of the Maison de l'Entreprise of Burkina Faso
(MEBF) were achieved. With regard to the management of the slaughterhouse, the Government
launched a public tender in January 2010, but expressions of interest lacked the desired technical
qualification. The lack of international marketing for the Ouagadougou refrigerated
slaughterhouse and vested interests from butchers opposed to higher servicing fees seem to have
explained the relatively limited interest for this contract. To sustain the activity of the MEBF (a
private sector promotion agency), a decree awarding MEBF public utility status was signed on
April 19, 2010, and MEBF was delivered land titles for the real estate it currently utilizes.
Furthermore, a directive from the Ministry of Economy and Finance establishes funding of the
MEBF through the general budget, for capacity building of the private sector.
4.11 The PRSG-10, as for the entire PRSC/G series, had difficulties in achieving tangible
results in support of decentralized social services. The Government adopted in 2010 a three-
year strategic plan to implement decentralization reforms. Three major areas of weakness in the
existing local government system were identified: (i) lack of basic administrative systems; (ii)
nontransparent intergovernmental fiscal systems; and (iii) underdeveloped citizen participation
mechanisms. The share of the State's total financial resources transferred to local governments
has risen from 2.7 percent in 2007 to 3 percent in 2010, but low administrative capacity
continued to create resistance to further decentralization of fiscal resources.
4.12 Some progress was achieved regarding the Government's policy for the
decentralization of school construction, health services and improved transparency in the
use of municipal budgets, supported by the PRSG-10. Throughout the series, the
decentralization of other public services, notably water and sanitation services was less
successful, as indicated, for example, by the decreasing trend of access to drinking water in rural
(64 percent in 2007 and 56.6 percent in 2009) and urban areas (76 percent in 2007 and 73
percent in 2010). Access to adequate health services improved as shown by the increase in the
share of health centers respecting the staff norms (76 percent in 2007 and 84.3 percent in 2010).
In addition, vaccination rates for DTC/HEP/HB3/measles exceeded 100 percent during 2007-
2009 (102.4 percent in 2007; 103 percent in 2009). In the education area, the Government
transferred to territorial collectivities the fiscal resources recorded in the 2009 Budget Law to
enable 49 urban municipalities to carry out their mandate for school construction. However,
disbursement on a quarterly basis was difficult to assess. The 2009 and 2010 budget allocation
data of all 49 urban municipalities and 2008 execution data of all 302 municipalities were


                                                17
published on the Government website and broken down to the level of sections and chapters, but
execution data were released only for 2008.
4.13 Significant development outcomes of the series are most noticeable in relation to
strengthening budget management and oversight, and audit institutions. During 2007 ­
2010, the following outcomes can be noted: (i) a functional budget classification with a marker
for poverty spending is in place; (ii) the share of procurement through open tender increased
from 77 percent in 2007 to 89 percent in 2010; and (iii) the number of procurement contracts
audited by the internal control institution increased from 30 in 2007 to 87 in 2010. Furthermore,
the Court of Accounts undertakes and publishes public audits (2006, 2007, 2009), while the
Autorité Supérieure du Contrôle de l'Etat (ASCE), created in 2007, investigates corruption cases
and has a statistical reporting system on pending and closed corruption cases, as evidenced in its
annual report (2007, 2008). In addition, information on budget execution and transfers to local
governments is now available on the government website.
4.14 Acknowledging the benefits of focusing budget management performance over the
medium term on outputs and outcomes, during the period covered by the PRSG-10 the
Government centered its reform program on: (i) the deconcentration of budget authority from the
MEF to the line ministries; (ii) allocation and classification of expenditure in the budget
execution phase; and (iii) strengthening the chain of internal and external oversight. With regard
to the last point, significant progress has been made along the oversight chain over the past few
years, partly with support from this PRSC/G series. Nevertheless, there is still a need to
strengthen the legislative oversight and prosecution phases of the oversight chain.
4.15 To support the simplification and strengthening of internal controls in the
expenditure chain, the Government deconcentrated the Directorate-General for
Procurement (DGMP) in three more ministries and three more regions, with the PRSG-10
support and building on lessons from the recent PER (FY10), the 2010 PEFA and ongoing IDA
technical assistance. More specifically, it took several practical measures in this respect, namely:
(i) the appointment by decree of procurement experts in these ministries and regions; and (ii) the
definition of thresholds under which public contracts are reviewed by the deconcentrated
procurement experts (PRSG-10 prior action). On August 12, 2009, a decree appointed
procurement specialists for three ministries (Ministry of Infrastructure or MID, Ministry of
Agriculture, Hydraulics, and Fish Resources or MAHRH, and Ministry of Secondary and
Tertiary Education and Scientific Research or MESSRS) and three poor regions (the Sahel, the
Mouhoun Loop and the East). Another decree adopted on February 2, 2010, defined a series of
thresholds from CFAF 50,000 to CFAF 200,000 for each category of public contracts, under
which reviews are systematically done by the deconcentrated procurement experts. By the end of
2010, the Government intended to further deconcentrate DGMP in other ministries (MEF,
Housing, Transportation, Defense), and 3 other regions (Cascades, South West, West and
Central) bringing deconcentrated DGMP branches to 9 out of the 13 regions.
4.16 The General Directorate for Financial Control (Direction Générale du Contrôle
Financier, DGCF) intensified its oversight of the delivery of goods, works and services by
an increase in the proportion of physical spot-checks of contracts subject to competitive
bidding. Insufficient accountability of budget managers and limited capacity of the Prior Review
Department (Contrôle Financier) were identified as obstacles to monitoring of service delivery.
To remedy this constraint, the Prior Review Department has set up a Unit in charge of service
delivery control. On December 31, 2009, DGCF conducted physical spot-checks of 124

                                                18
procurement contracts (against an annual target of 100 contracts) in excess of CFAF 20 million
for a total of CFAF 19.4 billion, covering eight regions (Cascade, Center, Central East, Central,
South Bend Mouhoun, High Basins, Central Plateau and Sahel). Delivery of goods, works and
services was also monitored for 64 orders and 104 "lettres de commande" due to the risks arising
in these types of procurement contracts.
4.17 Finally, the procedures to hold budget managers accountable were strengthened,
with the support of the PRSG-10. The Court of Accounts has the legal competency to render
disciplinary judgments against budget managers. As it had no dedicated Chamber in charge of
this task, nor had it ever exercised this competency, the PRSG-10 supported the Court of
Accounts in taking several measures to address these insufficiencies. In particular, the Court of
Accounts adopted a report that describes the process of revising the organic law, which creates
the Budget and Financial Accountability Chamber, and provides an overview of the situation
with initiated instructions and judgments given. The Parliament approved the Revised Organic
Act to establish this Chamber and the status of financial magistrates in December 2010. However
the enactment was annulled by the Constitutional Court on technical grounds in February 2011.
While this represents a significant set-back for the Court of Accounts, it has already undertaken
the training of judges for the evaluation of budget managers and the assessment of cases has
started based on the existing legal framework.
4.18 Overall, the PRSG-10 supported program was implemented in a satisfactory
manner. However, the pace of structural reforms has been uneven during the PRSC/G 7-10
period. In particular, progress in achieving tangible results in support of decentralized social
services has been slow. Notwithstanding a slower pace of reform in the previous year, progress
in implementation of reforms in the cotton sector has been positive with regard to increasing
cotton productivity, restructuring financially SOFITEX and strengthening the company's
performance. The pace of reforms in public financial management was sustained, particularly
with regard to the strengthening of internal controls in the expenditure chain and the oversight of
budget execution, which should reduce corruption risks and enhance accountability of the
executive and controls on expenditure over the medium term. With regard to private sector
development, progress was made in enhancing the capacity of MEBF and launching a public
tender for the management of the Ouagadougou slaughterhouse. Overall, the broadly satisfactory
progress made in the advancement of structural reforms warrants continued IDA support through
the proposed operation.

                                  C.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED

4.19 Success factors for achieving development outcomes through PRSC/Gs include
ownership by the government, support by the donors, work across sectors and adequate
government capacity. Donor harmonization offers benefits if carefully managed. Budget
support in Burkina Faso is strongly integrated into an advanced Paris-Accra aid harmonization
framework. Benefits of the existing system and adjustments needed to preserve ownership and
country systems are detailed below.
4.20 Typically, it takes two or three PRSC/Gs in a row to build consensus on difficult
reforms that affect vested interests and reach development results. Several reforms such as
the strengthening of the Court of Accounts, basic transparency in budget allocation and
execution (both at the central and local levels), and the adjustment of the domestic cotton price to
world price fluctuations or cost reduction measures for SOFITEX to enhance its competitiveness,

                                                19
have all required more than one PRSC/G to be completed. The time needed to reach consensus
among key stakeholders on the benefits expected from a given reform has required the support of
a succession of intermediary steps until the ultimate reform can be achieved.
4.21 Timely and coherent technical assistance and ESW have greatly helped the PRSC/G
instruments to achieve results. They provide a technical analysis of the constraints and also
constitute a forum for dialogue and consensus building, both with donors and Government, to
explore medium-term policy priorities. In the PFM area, the complementarities between TA in
IDA's PFM program and the measures supported by this PRSC/G series have certainly made a
difference. Technical assistance to support the development of the PPP strategic principles,
financed by the PPIAF, has facilitated the elaboration of the PPP strategy supported by the
PRSG-11. The World Bank also supported the preparation of the truckers' census study. The
extended dissemination of both the CEM on Growth, Competitiveness and Export
Diversification and the programmatic PER has proved particularly helpful in this context.
Moreover, the launching of the second PER with a focus on transport and energy sectors will
support the freight liberalization reform included in PRSG-11. On the other hand,
decentralization reforms need to be appropriately phased as the increasing flow of fiscal
resources did not create expected results in the context of low capacity and ineffective
architecture for fiscal transfers. This suggests the need for operational support to build the
foundations of capacity, before fiscal decentralization can effectively be achieved.

         D.    COORDINATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND THE IMF

4.22 IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification of the respective
institutions' areas of focus. The IMF finalized the First Review under the Three-Year
Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility on December 3, 2010. IMF and IDA staff are
assisting the authorities in the implementation of the country's PRS, providing them with
technical assistance as regards resource mobilization and budget management.
4.23 Twenty-seven donors currently support the implementation of the Government's
PRS through various modes of assistance: general budget support (GBS), sector programs,
investment projects, capacity building projects and technical assistance. Investment projects
account for two-thirds of external aid, while budget support accounts for approximately one-third
of total donor support.

4.25 Harmonization of donor activities within the CGAB provides several advantages as
it focuses on: (i) ownership; (ii) alignment; (iii) predictability; and (iv) result-based approach.
The group of donors organized in the CGAB support reforms as outlined in the poverty reduction
strategy and which are updated and further specified in the annually revised Priority Action Plan
(PAP). The PAP combines planned policy objectives and actions with a medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) and a monitoring framework. Furthermore, the CGAB monitors
and evaluates reform implementation permanently but has three mandatory sessions each year,
with a formal performance session held at the time of the annual review of the PRSP progress
report. All these sessions are chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance, supported by a
secretariat made up of a representative of the administration and two representatives of the
donors. Joint missions are planned to reduce administrative transaction costs.
4.26 The Government will continue to work with development partners, including the
World Bank, to simplify the coordination process, and enhance the quality of the joint
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
of the poverty reduction strategy, in operation since 2009, is currently being revised and will
entail the adoption of a new M&E system, the elaboration of an internal regulation to ensure its
adequate functioning, and the revision of the CGAB/CSLP protocol. In order to establish a more
focused and flexible approach to budget support, the principles of a new Memorandum of
Understanding that will be adopted in 2011 are under discussion. This will accompany the new
SCADD for 2011-2015 and facilitate support to reforms under its key strategic pillars. The PAF
matrix for 2011-2013 (a draft is presented in Annex 8) is currently finalized to align it with the
new SCADD priorities.
4.27 Based on the CGAB/CSLP process some aspects can be improved: (i) transaction
costs remain relatively high with a long formal review process to produce an excessively large
policy matrix (Annexes 7 and 8); (ii) difficulties in reaching a consensus by April/May among all
nine donors contributing untied budget support as well as other donors and UN agencies not
contributing such resources - on policy measures to be completed by end-year - decreases the
scope and ambition of the policy discussions beyond this short time horizon, limiting the
programmatic scope of the adopted PAF; (iii) monitoring and evaluation of policy actions jointly
determined in a given year is weakened by an assessment of progress made on an overall
satisfactory basis as the disbursement condition of several key donors. One solution might be to
continue to reduce the scope of the policy matrix by retaining only critical reforms rather than
process oriented actions, while improving monitoring of the agreed triggers.
4.28 Consensus is yet to be built among donors on the new Memorandum of
Understanding. Nevertheless, during a meeting among the main donors providing budget
support (January 19, 2011), consensus on several principles was reached: (i) need to have room
for dialogue around the issues specific to budget support within the SCADD framework, while
maintaining a single performance matrix; (ii) need to deepen the dialogue around reform
indicators; (iii) need to carefully consult on the choice of performance indicators, in order to
facilitate an in-depth dialogue on the main stringent issues; (iv) need to focus on clarifying the
content of the sectoral policy frameworks, rather than on their functioning; (v) need to maintain a
simple monitoring and evaluation system to ensure Government ownership; and (vi) need to
ensure adequate representation of all the donors in the sectoral dialogue.

                  E.    COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

4.29 PRSG-11 is providing direct support to several key IDA operations and AAA. As of
October 31, 2010, the portfolio consists of 15 active projects in addition to the PRSC/G series for
a total commitment of approximately US$657 million. Also, Burkina Faso is participating in five
regional projects.
4.30 PRSG-11 continues to support productivity and quality enhancement in the cotton
sector in Burkina Faso in the context of a broader agriculture diversification agenda. The
program complements objectives of the ongoing Agriculture Diversification and Market
Development Project (ADMDP) towards the development of selected agricultural and livestock
value chains. Because of the interdependency between the cotton and cereals value chains, a
viable cotton sector is also key to the achievement of the country's food security and overall
agricultural productivity growth objectives. As part of its CAS, the World Bank approved in
2009 the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project (PAPSA), with the objective to
increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets
through increased storage and access to credit under the inventory credit system. In the aftermath
of the global food price crisis, cotton will continue to play a key role in the country's food
security strategy, not only through the strengthening of the purchasing power of cotton farmers
who earn direct incomes from cotton, but also through the complementarity of cereals and cotton
in the cropping system and the positive effects of access to fertilizer for cotton on maize
production.
4.31 The PRSG-11 complements the IDA-financed Bagre Growth Pole Project in FY11
by promoting private sector investment through its support to a PPP policy framework.
The Bagre Growth Pole Project will attempt to harness economies of scale and synergies
between sectors and promote the crowding-in of private sector investment by identifying and
starting to develop a critical mass of investments in selected growth poles, for the development
of spatially concentrated value chains in which Burkina Faso has a comparative advantage to
promote diversification, commercialization of agriculture and livestock. Technical assistance
through the PPIAF will support the authorities in developing the PPP policy framework.
4.32 The PRSG-11 supports the liberalization of freight transportation, improving
competitiveness in the sector and reducing pressure to overload trucks which affects road
infrastructure. The CAS and the CGAC strategy identify this issue as a critical governance
constraint to be addressed over the CAS period. This action would directly complement the
ongoing West Africa Regional Transport and Transit Facilitation project as well as the Transport
Sector Project (PST), which drew on the Second Transport Sector program (Programme
Sectoriel des Transports ­ PST-2). The Transport Sector Project (PST) was adopted in 2003 and
closed on March 31, 2011 while the Second Transport Sector program was adopted in 2000 and
ended in 2010. The PST has three components: (i) institutional support and sectoral reforms,
including through training and support to the elaboration of various sectoral studies and pieces of
legislation and agencies (the law on land road transport, the setting up of a road maintenance
fund, the creation of the National Agency for Civil Aviation and of the Agency for Public
Infrastructure Management, the virtual freight market, the creation of leasing company,
conditions for vehicle importation, etc.); (ii) improvement of rural (dirt) roads (3,500 km) by
promoting road construction in critical locations and maintenance contracts, including through
the participation of local communities; and (iii) project administration and coordination.


                                                22
4.33 Although the PRSG-11 does not support decentralization reforms, the preparation
of the forthcoming Burkina Faso Decentralized Development technical assistance (FY12)
has launched a process whereby the government and the development partners are
working on developing a clearer analysis of the state of decentralization (Vision Prospective)
and improving harmonization of interventions. The Vision Prospective exercise has already been
launched and a high level meeting of ministers is planned for April 2011 to discuss critical policy
issues. Donors are also increasingly harmonizing their interventions and direct
complementarities have been built into the projects and programs being prepared for support by
the World Bank, the European Union, the GIZ, and the French embassy. This process will help
to appropriately target and sequence support for decentralization reform in the next PRSC series.
4.34 Finally, the PRSG-11 supports the implementation of a restructuring plan for
BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel, and the adoption of implementing decrees for
the law on rural land tenure. The restructuring plan for the three entities is part of the
objectives of the ongoing Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP). The
land tenure legislation has been developed with support from the World Bank, AFD and the
Millenium Corporation Account. The PRSG-11 will also complement other initiatives, such as
the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF)-funded initiatives which aim at strengthening the
Bank's understanding of the political economy context, with focus on the mining sector.

                              F.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.35 The PRSG-11 is underpinned by considerable analytical and fiduciary work
undertaken by the World Bank. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY10) on
promoting growth, competitiveness, and diversification was designed to inform policy choices in
relation to the Government's SCADD. The report proposes to invest in productivity-led growth
to overcome the country's low initial level of human capital, overall capacity, and regulatory
constraints. To help define Burkina Faso's new development model, the CEM explores
productivity-led growth at the macroeconomic, the sectoral levels as well as at the micro and
institutional levels. It also assesses growth sustainability on the human, demographic, physical
infrastructure, financial, and fiscal dimensions. The CEM provides an overview of the key
constraints on overall investment climate and export promotion (including the VAT credit
reimbursement mechanism), explains the PPP strategic principles, and identifies constraints
related to access to land in the rural areas. It is based on recent and ongoing analytical work
produced by the World Bank, notably the 2007 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, as well as on
relevant operational work on agricultural intensification and on the development of growth poles.
In addition to the CEM, the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic for Burkina Faso provides
a solid analytical basis for the PRSG-11. Fiduciary arrangements were reviewed by the Bank in
the context of the PRSG-11 preparation based on: (i) the outcomes of the national and sub
national PEFA completed in June 2010; (ii) the IMF safeguard report issued in March 2010 on
Central Bank (BCEAO) governance structure including its National Agency in Burkina Faso;
and (iii) the audit report of the flow of funds from donors support between the Central Bank and
the Directorate of Public Treasury. The conclusion of these analyses is that the overall fiduciary
system is deemed appropriate to meet the PRSC requirements. Yet, some weak areas need to be
reinforced that the authorities are committed to address through the PFM strategy reforms
(SRFP, Stratégie de Renforcement des Finances Publiques).




                                                23
4.36 The PRSG-11 also builds on previous analytical work by the Government and other
partners. Specifically, the CEM findings build on a compendium of earlier strategic work
produced by the Burkinabè Government, local think tanks, and donors, including a broad
prospective study on "Burkina 2025", the 2009 National Scheme for Territorial Planning (SNAT
­ Schéma national d'aménagement du territoire), sectoral policies produced by the Ministerial
Departments, and 2005 research from the Centre d'Analyse des Politiques Économiques et Sociales
(CAPES) on competitiveness and diversification.
4.37 The PRSG-11 continues to benefit from the programmatic Public Expenditure
Review, both its first review completed in FY10 and its planned second review that will be
finalized in FY12. The first review tried to explain the supposed Burkina paradox, characterized
by good macro-economic and PFM performance coupled with limited progress in poverty
reduction and human development. It recommends that the country: (i) increases spending on
productive sectors to reinforce the impact of public expenditure on growth; (ii) improves tax
collection practices to enhance budget revenue and meet the Government's investment needs;
(iii) breaks down operating and one-off expenditures in line with the functional budget
classification to increase transparency and improve budget management; (iv) streamlines the
expenditure chain and introduces risk-based internal audits to prepare the move towards
performance budgeting; (v) reduces the proportion of non-teaching teachers to reduce unit costs,
and enhances the effectiveness of investment in health; (vi) introduces both an expenditure
monitoring system based on regions and on communes and a unique method to transfer resources
among different communities to reinforce equity in the geographical distribution of public
expenditure; and (vii) develops a road-map for decentralization that links fiscal transfers to
progress in capacity building at the local level, in order to reap benefits from decentralization as
a tool to fight poverty. The objective of the planned second review, a deliverable for FY12, is to
provide the government with a set of evidence-based policy options to help Burkina Faso
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its public expenditures in the energy and transport
sectors. The review will focus on: (i) the level and composition of public spending in transport
and energy; (ii) the value-for-money of spending in the two sectors, or the extent to which past
spending has led to improved supply, quality and lower production costs for transport and energy
services; (iii) the relationships between production costs and prices (issues of market structures,
subsidies and tariff structures, including connection fees); as well as the extent to which higher
supply and better quality of transport and energy networks translate into greater actual access and
higher quality of services; and (iv) cross-cutting issues of capacity, institutional incentives, as
well as transparency and accountability mechanisms.

                               5.    THE PROPOSED PRSG-11

                               A.    RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

5.1    The proposed operation is the final one in a series of five annual PRSC/Gs
(PRSC/Gs 7 to 11) to support the Government's PRS implementation. The proposed
operation aims to assist the authorities' efforts to boost economic growth and diversification.
This operation also supports the authorities to implement reforms under the PRSP-II and the
Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable (SCADD). The PRSG-11
provides resources to accompany key reforms that are required to achieve sustainable growth and
competitiveness, and lower the country's vulnerability to various exogenous shocks. These
reforms target higher cotton sector competitiveness through increased private sector

                                                24
participation, and the liberalization of freight transport, which should entail lower transport costs
and better transport services for all sectors, as well as better enforcement of regulations to reduce
truck overloading that damages road infrastructure. The implementation of the restructuring plan
for BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel should make public sector participation in the
mining sector more effective through the divestituture of BUMIGEB's water drilling activities
while retaining its responsibilities for the exploration, testing, and laboratory activities, improve
technical control of vehicles which should have positive effects on the transport sector security
and road degradation, and increase competitiveness and quality of tourism services. The
completion of rural land tenure legislation should increase transparency and certainty regarding
rural land tenure, which should help increase private investment in farm and non-farm activities,
facilitate access to finance and contribute to poverty reduction. The definition of a strategic
policy framework for public-private partnerships should facilitate increased private sector
participation in infrastructure and other strategic sectors, where public resources are insufficient.
Finally, PRSG-11 would continue PFM reforms pursued over the entire PRSC/G series by
further supporting the efficiency of budget execution, to increase transparency and to prepare
transition toward program budgeting, and strengthening administrative oversight of public
spending. The Government's Letter of Development Policy provides details on these reforms
(Annex 2).
5.2          The development objectives of PRSG-11 are to:
      (i)     improve the investment climate and promote exports with six intermediate results:
              (a) private investment in strategic sectors through public-private partnerships; (b)
              export facilitation; (c) liberalization of trucking industry; (d) competitiveness of the
              cotton sector; (e) increased private sector participation in the formerly state-owned
              companies in the mining, transport and tourism sectors; and (f) transparency and
              certainty of rural land tenure;

      (ii)    promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources
              with two intermediate results: (a) improved administrative and functional classification
              in budget execution data; and (b) a risk-based audit approach implemented by
              administrative oversight institutions.

                                      B.    RESULTS FRAMEWORK

5.3     Government development objectives and outcome indicators for all budget support
operations have been jointly selected by members of the General Budget Support
Framework (CGAB) in Burkina Faso and the IMF. All performance and monitoring
indicators for PRSC/Gs 7-11 are presented in Annex 3. In light of the harmonization process,
these indicators may aim at outcomes that are broader than those that can be strictly expected
from the policy measures supported by this operation. As the PRSC/G series progressed over
time, additional indicators have been adopted with broad donor consensus to improve the link
between measured outcomes and development objectives and/or intermediary results sought by
the most recent operations in this series. Statistics are computed on a yearly basis and reviewed
thoroughly by the group of donors monitoring PRSP implementation or by the IMF during its
program reviews.

                                       C.    POLICY AREAS

5.4     This section discusses the Government's policy reforms supported by this third
PRSC/G series and presents the rationale for the selection of prior actions for PRSG-11,
the last operation in the current series. Although it was originally envisaged to conclude the
current series with the PRSG-10, the series was extended by one more operation in order to take
into account the Government's timetable for the SCADD adoption. This will allow the next
series of PRSC/Gs to fully align itself with the development objectives of the newly adopted
SCADD and carry over support to the Government's strategy for the whole time period of the
new country strategy, which is planned to cover the period from the establishment of a new
Government following the November 2010 Presidential elections, until 2015. Given that policy
actions are defined a year in advance through an extensive consultative process of the joint donor
framework, prior actions for potential future budget support (PRSC/G-12) would be based on
milestones adopted in the PAF for end-2011. Hence, the PRSG-11, the last operation in the
current series, will not include triggers for a potential future global budget support operation. All
performance and monitoring indicators for PRSC/Gs 7-11 are presented in Annex 3.
5.5     Since progress in the implementation of decentralization reforms has been slow, the
PRSG-11 will not support prior actions in this area. A World Bank technical assistance
project on decentralized development is currently being prepared. It will take a programmatic
approach to provide continuity and long-term support for a realistic phasing of decentralization
reforms. In the initial phase, the key aspects of the intervention will include (i) strengthening
systems to support local government systems; (ii) designing an effective intergovernmental
system; and (iii) addressing organizational, institutional and individual capacity issues. This
technical assistance will help identify and shape triggers for a potential future PRSC/G series.
5.6     The prior action encompassing reforms in the mining sector has been dropped due
to delays in reaching consensus on the draft bill amending the 2003 Mining Code, and
delays in the finalization of the first EITI report. Regarding the prior action in the mining
sector, although the 2003 Mining Code was revised and a report on the new draft mining
legislation clarified governance aspects to take account of socioeconomic and environmental
impacts, the final bill was not submitted to the Parliament. This is due to the fact that the new
Minister of Mines requested a review of the fiscal incentives included in the proposed draft
mining legislation. The draft is currently going through the final internal review process before it
is submitted to the Parliament for approval. Furthermore, despite the fact that a first draft EITI
Report covering revenues generated by the mining industry during 2008-2009 has been prepared,
following consultation with the stakeholders, the report had to be amended. The consultant
contracted for this task, has responded with a new draft, which is currently being reviewed, but
has not yet been finalized. The government's initial request for an extension of the validation
deadline was turned down by the EITI International Secretariat, as the reasons advanced by
Burkina Faso were not found satisfactory. The country was urged to show more dynamism in
EITI implementation. The Government has since announced that it would be possible for the
report to be finalized within the original timetable. The need to request an extension and the pace
and quality of EITI implementation on the ground will both be reassessed by the EITI
International Secretariat closer to the validation deadline of May 14, 2011.
5.7     Finally, the definition of one prior action has been modified and two other prior
actions have been added to this operation to strengthen its private sector development
pillar. Due to the lack of progress on adopting a PPP law and the need to build greater consensus

                                                 26
on the PPP agenda, this prior action was redrafted to promote the adoption of a detailed PPP
strategy. In order to strengthen the private sector development pillar of the operation, two other
prior actions were added: (i) the implementation of a restructuring plan for BUMIGEB, CCVA
and the Silmandé Hotel; and (ii) the adoption of decrees for the implementation of the law on
rural land tenure of June 16, 2009 (the sections below provide a detailed description of the
rationale and the prior actions).
Improving the investment climate and promoting exports

5.8     The PRSG-11 supports the development of strategic policy framework on public
private partnerships (PPP) to boost private sector participation in strategic sectors,
including foreign direct investment. The original PRSG-11 trigger called for the Council of
Ministers to submit to Parliament a bill for the establishment of a legal framework on PPP,
which clarifies stakeholders' risk-sharing responsibilities. Initially, it also envisaged to establish
a new Directorate for the effective management of PPP contracts, with building, staff, equipment
and budget allocated to the new administrative structure. Due to the lack of progress on the
adoption of a PPP law and the establishment of a PPP unit, the lack of consensus on the PPP
strategic orientations, the lack of expertise and the change in the leadership of the working group
in charge of the PPP agenda, the prior action was revised. The PRSG-11 calls for the
Government to approve a strategy on public-private partnerships (PPP). This strategy will help
build consensus among all stakeholders. It will also present actions towards the adoption of the
PPP law and any future institutional arrangements, including capacity building.
5.9     The delivery of infrastructure services may be improved in Burkina Faso by
considering PPP. In Burkina Faso, the authorities are considering PPP arrangements for several
projects (airport, railway construction, hospital, irrigation, development of the Bagré growth
pole). However, the country lacks a fully-fledged PPP policy regime, which would provide for
the development of specific PPP legislation and a PPP unit. Encouraging private sector
participation should reduce costs and improve the quality of infrastructure service for consumers.
Moreover, it would enable determining a sustainable pricing level for services, with or without
subsidy to different classes of consumers, attracting new technologies and reducing regulation
costs for the Government and private investors. The role of PPP arrangements is twofold: (i) to
address the lack of public capital necessary to build infrastructure; and (ii) to compensate for the
lack of institutional capacity for the development, the management and the operation of
infrastructure. However, if PPPs have been found to overcome the capital constraints of the
public sector, their impact on institutional capacity is less clear. This may be partly explained by
the fact that the public sector plays a crucial role in ensuring PPP success, notably with regard to
the preparation of clear specifications for infrastructure development, the organization of a
competitive procurement process and the monitoring of the contractor's performance. Where
competition does not exist and there is a potentially monopolistic operator, regulation is needed
to ensure the fair treatment of customers.
5.10 The Government took several steps towards designing a PPP strategic framework.
The Council of Ministers adopted a report on the prospects for PPP development on June 18,
2010. Acknowledging the strategic role PPP can play in facilitating foreign and domestic private
investments, the Prime Minister instructed the Cabinet members to take the necessary measures
in order to have a draft law on PPP submitted to the National Assembly in March 2011. To this
end, a technical committee in charge of drafting the PPP law was set up through decree,
including representatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Commerce,

                                                 27
the Chamber of Commerce and the MEBF. The National Committee for Public Debt and the
Program on Public Investment were also invited to join the Technical Committee. A preliminary
version of a draft law on the general regime for PPP contracts was produced, but has not
generated the necessary consensus for its validation, mainly due to divergent opinions among
key stakeholders regarding the objectives of a PPP law and the lack of adequate PPP expertise.
Given these delays, and the need to ensure a broad consensus, the prior action now focuses on
approval by the Council of Cabinet of a PPP strategy. With the support of the World Bank, the
technical committee drafted the Terms of Reference for the recruitment of an international
consultant that supports the elaboration of the PPP strategy. The international consultant
performed a preliminary audit of the existing legislation (the draft PPP law and the links with the
public procurement law) and the projects that might benefit from PPP arrangements in Burkina
Faso. The international consultant submitted to the Government's Technical Committee a
detailed report on the PPP concept, a comparative PPP analysis based on the experience in
France, Senegal, Cameroon and international good practices, and recommendations on the
principles of a PPP strategy.
5.11 The Council of Cabinet adopted the PPP strategy on March 22, 2011. The PPP
strategy is considered appropriate and includes five strategic pillars: (i) the endowment with
financial and human resources: (ii) the legal and institutional framework for PPP; (iii) the
elaboration of a program for PPP projects; (iv) the launching of pilot projects; and (v) experience
building based on the pilot projects and elaboration of a PPP guide. An action plan for its
implementation will be designed separately. The strategy was finalized during a working session
of the Government's Technical Committee in early March 2011 and was approved by the
Council of Cabinet on March 22, 2011. The work will also need to proceed beyond this prior
action. In particular, in designing the legal and institutional framework, the objective of the PPP
program, including the roles and the responsibilities of various actors (the Council of Ministers,
the PPP unit), the use of revenues generated by the PPP program, and the management of the
PPP projects will need to be clarified.
5.12 The PRSG-11 supports the reduction of delays in the reimbursement of VAT
rebates to exporters. Delays in the VAT credit reimbursement were well underlined by the
2007 DTIS and the 2010 CEM. While a directive indicated in March 2007 that 70 percent of
VAT must be reimbursed within 40 days, the delays on the import rebates continued. A
significant part of the problem is that there are several checks along the way in order to reduce
fraud. For example, when the activity in the mining sector began to grow rapidly in the early
1990s, there was an extraordinary increase in exploration permits, many of which were likely
obtained in order to fraudulently receive VAT exemption for other businesses.
5.13 The original trigger is retained, that is that the Minister of Finance has signed an
administrative order that clarifies modalities for reimbursement for VAT credits to
companies. This order, signed in June 2010, replaces the preceding administrative order on
reimbursement of VAT credits from 1995 and specifies the eligibility criteria, the procedure, and
the modalities for such reimbursement. Reimbursement of VAT credits poses major problems for
exporters because they do not collect VAT on their sales and therefore cannot directly recoup
VAT payments they have made on their inputs. It is a particular problem for mining companies
who must also pay VAT related to expensive exploration activities which can last for several
years before there are any sales. The failure to promptly reimburse VAT credits to exporters is
widely observed in developing countries and has been described as "the Achilles heel of the
VAT system".

                                                28
5.14 The PRSG-11 supports the design of freight transport liberalization reform. The
original PRSG-11 trigger calls for the Council of Ministers to adopt an action plan to liberalize
trucking. This plan would be informed by a study identifying truckers and documenting their
income from this economic activity, and include: (i) a deadline to conclude negotiations
consultations with transport unions; (ii) a target date for the complete removal of the queuing
system coordinated with other hinterland countries, and establishment of a monitoring and
evaluation system based on sampling several times a year; and (iii) the promotion of the
elimination of regional trucking quotas on the basis of consultations with coastal countries.
PRSG-11 also supports the establishment of a system of tighter enforcement against axle
overloading by trucks.
5.15 Both the Shippers' Council and professional trucking unions acknowledge the
benefits of reform of the trucking industry, especially its contribution to improving the quality
of the transport services and to reduce overloading. The transportation of containerized cargo is
already liberalized and is mainly provided by large freight forwarding companies, which provide
shipping and transport services and normally own their containers and trucks. The freight
forwarding companies located in the ports of the main coastal neighbors (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Togo or Benin) ensure transportation until the final destination in Burkina Faso. By contrast, the
transportation of `break-bulk' merchandise (such as food products and agriculture fertilizers) is
usually done by small trucking companies or individuals. Bilateral agreements between coastal
and land-locked countries split the movement of this type of cargo one-third/two-thirds
respectively, either through official agreements or, in the case of transit through Ghana to
Burkina Faso, informally between truckers' unions in the two countries. A queuing system (tour
de rôle) is then used to allocate this cargo according to the principle of "first come, first served".
This system has removed competition, protected inefficient truckers, and reduced the number of
trips per truck. This in turn has encouraged overloading, while discouraging investment in new
equipment, by rendering it impossible to pay off the cost of new trucks. The queuing practice
and the existing bilateral agreements (one-third/two-thirds) have encouraged the emergence of
intermediaries, which contribute to increasing transport costs. Both the tour de rôle and the
regional quota system mostly affect the small individual truckers.
5.16 The Government has taken several steps in supporting the design stage of the
planned freight liberalization. Acknowledging the direct impact of freight liberalization on
small truck operators, the Government launched at the beginning of November 2010 a study to
evaluate the functioning of the current transit regime and to assess the economic and social
impact of freight liberalization. The Shippers' Council led this study, which was financed by the
UN Economic Commission for Africa. The study, finalized in February 2011 underlines: (i) the
poor quality of the domestic fleet, which hampers the capacity to transport merchandise from the
transit ports to Burkina Faso and increases the import costs as importers have often to hire
truckers registered in other countries from the region; (ii) the limited impact of the tour de rôle
system and the one-third/two-thirds rule on transport costs since containerized movement of
cargo is liberalized and the forwarding companies in the transit ports can refuse to use a truck
which does not observe technical standards, even if this is allocated through the tour de rôle
system; (iii) the need to tackle the quota system at the regional level (CEDEAO and WAEMU);
and (iv) the number of controls on the main transit corridors which increase transit costs through
unofficial payments, the cost and the time spent in the ports, and at the borders, the lack of
professionalism of transporters, the need to revisit the role of the shippers' councils and the poor
quality of road infrastructure. The study also notes that Niger has already officially abolished the


                                                 29
tour de rôle practice but the practice still exists for the freight carried through corridors involving
Niger. The study also recommends deepening the analysis of the whole transport management
system to find solutions regarding transport costs. The conclusions of this study were discussed
within a consultation committee (set up in February 2011) during a workshop with all domestic
stakeholders, such as the Shippers' Council, the truckers' and drivers' unions, and the Ministry
of Transport. The authorities intend to discuss the study with neighboring countries on the
occasion of a sub-regional workshop (currently scheduled to take place in May 2011). This will
help build consensus among the coastal and other hinterland countries on the mutual abolition of
the regional transit agreement, including the quota system. The consultation committee will also
follow up on the implementation of reform. The Council of Ministers also decided on the
implementation of a program to allow duty-free importation of merchandise vehicles.
5.17 The Ministry of Transport commissioned a second study to provide a census of all
truckers. This study is designed to document the truckers' population and improve knowledge
on the structure of small/individual truckers' operations, including the basic characteristics of
their business and equipment. On February 24, 2011, the final draft of this study was discussed
during a workshop and was subsequently adopted. The study underlines the overcapacity of the
truckers' fleet for the break-bulk transportation, and estimated the gap between supply (around
11,000 trucks) and demand (2,200 trucks). This overcapacity reflects the queuing system and
now constitutes the main argument among truckers for its maintenance, otherwise many could
not survive. Typically, the small truckers are not professional transport service providers and
often use trucks that are obsolete, do not meet current safety regulations, and could not compete
in an open market. Given that the gradual removal of the tour de rôle system will primarily affect
the small/individual truck operators, the design of compensatory measures will have to be part of
the action plan. Such measures may include a training program to make small truckers
competitive in terms of quality of their transport services and provision of low interest credit
schemes to facilitate fleet modernization, but will also require mechanisms to assist some
operators to exit the sector.
5.18 The action plan on freight liberalization has been adopted through a decree (no.
2011-60) signed by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of
Commerce. The action plan is appropriate and provides for the elimination of the tour de rôle by
the end of June 2011 and the quota system within five years and includes several accompanying
measures, which focus on training for transporters, the redefinition of the role of the Shippers'
Council, improvement of the weighing system in the ports, management of costs and fiscal
aspects, the elaboration of a reference price calculation, and the carrying out of a comprehensive
transport sector study. The action plan builds on the two studies mentioned above, includes
specific dates for national awareness building events (including domestic truckers) and regional
consultations to discuss the removal of the tour de rôle and the elimination of the quota system,
and provides for measures to reinforce the rules against axle overloading by trucks (set up by
decree in 2010), such as the extension of controls to all customs points, and the installation of
weighing platforms on all inter-state roads. Going forward, some of these measures could benefit
from improvements, such as considering the removal of the quota system within a shorter
timeframe; and additional measures should be envisaged to support the small truckers exiting the
market following these reforms. ONASER has published a periodic statistical report (August
2010 ­ March 2011) and has implemented a control system (contrôle du poids total autorisé en
charges) since March 2009, which was further strenghened in 2010. This has facilitated a
reduction of the overloading rate from 75 percent to 34 percent (at the end of December 2010).

5.19 The PRSG-11 supports a critical structural reform in the cotton sector to enhance
competitiveness of cotton companies. To improve the viability of the cotton sector, the
Government is expected to finalize a plan for the readjustment of cotton ginning concession
areas, in consultation with the cotton sector professional organization (AICB), and in order to
start its implementation, the Government has made an offer of cotton growing areas to be
transferred from SOFITEX to Faso Coton which has had inadequate access to seed cotton in its
current concession area to be viable.
5.20 The authorities finalized a proposal for the readjustment of cotton growing areas
and requested Faso Coton to submit a technical and financial offer. A technical committee
including the Prime Minister's cabinet, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Commerce, the National Union of Burkina's Cotton Producers
(UNPCB) and SOFITEX, was established to finalize the plan for the readjustment of the cotton
growing areas. A proposal regarding the transfer of the Koudougou growing area from SOFITEX
to Faso Coton was finalized and transmitted to Faso Coton. The Koudougou area holds two
plants: the older Koudougou plant and the Leo plant, a new unit with significant potential for
cotton production. The proposal was also discussed with the AICB, including Socoma during a
workshop on January 17-19, 2011. Faso Coton was invited to submit a technical and financial
offer. If concluded, the readjustment of the cotton growing areas would result in an adjusted
concession structure, whereby Faso Coton will control cotton growing areas accounting for 15
percent of production, as opposed to the 5 percent it currently has. SOFITEX's share would fall
from 80 percent to 70 percent, while that of Socoma would remain unchanged at 15 percent. A
response by Faso Coton is still pending and the Koudougou region will therefore temporarily
remain under the SOFITEX administration at least until after the impending 2011/2012
campaign. Since the current exclusive zoning arrangement ends in 2012, the cotton ginning
companies will also require a new arrangement to provide a predictable environment. The
Government envisages renewing the arrangement for a period of 10 to 12 years, which should
facilitate acceptance of a zoning change by all parties. The authorities announced that they would
continue dialogue with Faso Coton on a possible transfer of cotton growing areas. The
finalization of the studies on the price smoothing fund and the input fund, respectively, will also
provide a new framework for engagement in the sector.
5.21 Reducing the share of the state in the cotton sector remains part of the
Government's strategy. The most recent recapitalization of SOFITEX by the Government was
completed in 2010 as a temporary measure, after the departure of the previous private operator,
but the long-term goal of the Government has always been to sell a majority ownership share to
another experienced private partner. This could bring valuable managerial and strategic skills to
SOFITEX. However, this outcome has been delayed by a succession of exogenous crises hitting
the sector since 2006 and the combined impact of the global economic crisis that has weakened
potential interest from foreign investors.
5.22 The PRSG-11 supports the implementation of a restructuring plan for BUMIGEB,
CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel to rationalize public sector participation in the mining,
transport and tourism sectors. As described in the original trigger, the Government is expected
to implement the restructuring plan as evidenced by: (a) approval by the Council of Ministers to
restructure BUMIGEB under the following terms: (i) divesting it of its water drilling activities;
(ii) auctioning off the water drilling equipment; (iii) an administrative act by the Council of
Ministers to restructure the national mining and geology laboratory, BUMIGEB as a public-
owned enterprise in charge of mining and geological exploration and testing; (b) an agreement to

                                                31
transfer the majority shares of Centre de Contrôle des Véhicules Automobile (CCVA) to a
strategic private operator; and (c) a management agreement for the Silmandé Hotel concluded
with a strategic partner.
5.23 By implementing a state divestiture plan in the mining, transport and tourism
sectors, the Government rolls back its involvement in the market and promotes private
sector development. This plan is part of a comprehensive privatization program in the
commercial and productive sectors launched in 1990. The restructuring program included 59
state companies, out of which 51 were privatized through various types of contracts (selling of
shares and assets, concessions, management contracts). The Government took steps to improve
management of the mining sector, in line with its increased commitment to export development
and economic diversification. It is essential to strengthen management capacities in the mining
sector, including policies, quality control, licenses, revenue management and sector governance.
In particular, improving the monitoring and control capacities of mining projects, strengthening
the capacity of the Ministry of Mining, particularly the national directorate of mining and
geology, and the national laboratory - BUMIGEB - were identified as key priorities. The
retention of responsibilities for exploration, testing and divestiture of water drilling activities
would ensure that laboratory activities and quality control of mining projects remain a public
policy attribute. In the transport sector, improving control of quality norms for automobiles
would contribute to preserving road infrastructure. As noted in the 2010 CEM, the overall quality
of Burkina Faso's road network remains poor. The participation of a private sector operator in
the CCVA would facilitate increased investment in the company's technical equipment, and
capacity building for technical diagnostics and control. This would contribute to better
management of road degradation and transport security, and stricter observance of technical
norms by automobiles. In the tourism sector, private sector management of the Silmandé Hotel
would attract the necessary investment to renovate and expand the hotel, ensure better training of
employees, and position the hotel to compete as a tourism service provider through better quality
services.
5.24 The restructuring plan for BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel has been
implemented. The Council of Ministers approved the restructuring of BUMIGEB, paving the
way for BUMIGEB's transformation to a state-owned enterprise in charge of geological
exploration and ensuring control of the implementation of mining norms. The auctioning of all
drilling equipment was realized and the authorities decided to allocate the revenues obtained
from this transaction to BUMIGEB. With the support of the World Bank, the new BUMIGEB
will be able to benefit from assistance for: (i) laboratory (technical and scientific) equipment to
carry out the necessary analyses; (ii) staff training and capacity enhancement; and (iii)
international technical assistance, including training, for the laboratory accreditation process.
The BUMIGEB statutes are being revised to reflect the elimination of the water drilling function.
The authorities signed the agreement to transfer 51 percent of the CCVA shares to a private
sector entity. Finally, the authorities signed a management contract with a private operator for
the Silmandé Hotel.
5.25 The PRSG-11 supports the completion of the legal framework for securing land
tenure in rural areas. The Government is expected to set up guidelines for securing land tenure
in rural areas as evidenced by the adoption of decrees for the implementation of the law on rural
land tenure of June 16, 2009.



                                                32
5.26 Absence of clear legal recognition and legally valid documentation of land rights
generates uncertainty about land tenure in Burkina, with potential negative consequences
for both private investment and existing owners and users of land. Four-fifths of Burkina
Faso's population of 14 million lives in rural areas, and the majority of those live in poverty.
Agriculture is the major source of revenue for rural inhabitants, but farm incomes have stagnated
due to productivity constraints and other factors. A major objective of the Burkina Faso
Government is therefore aimed at increasing crop production to achieve food security, expand
exports and raise rural incomes. A key element of this strategy is land tenure reform, which is
expected to increase incentives for rural investment, boost productivity and help reduce social
conflict. The SCADD's emphasis on growth poles (such as Bagré and Samandeni) and support to
agribusiness also requires that tenure issues are clarified for producers. Traditional and
communal land (customary) ownership is the rule, although in theory all land belongs to the
state. 7 The uncertain relationship between formal and customary ownership contributes to
confusion and insecurity, potentially inhibiting medium or large-scale commercial agriculture or
intensive livestock production.
5.27 The Government adopted a major land law reform 1984 and has undertaken
subsequent revisions in 1991, 1996 and 2002. In 2002, Government requested support from the
World Bank, and consultants provided technical support under the first phase of the PNGT
project to establish a land inventory system. Subsequently, the Bank financed the elaboration of
land policy using a participatory process. The 2006 national policy on securing access to land in
rural areas aims at: (i) addressing inter alia issues related to increasing agriculture productivity
and livestock-raising; (ii) expanding irrigated areas; and (iii) resolving land-related conflicts.
5.28 Law 034 on rural land law 8 was adopted on June 16, 2009, after a long, transparent
and inclusive process. The new law represents a major advance in terms of adapting national
land law to better reflect local patterns of land tenure and governance, and creating a clearer
enabling framework for private investment. Crucially, it includes a mechanism for settling land
disputes. A key feature of the law is that it devolves authority over land management to local
levels, and legitimizes customary rules and practices over land use and ownership. The goals of
this law include: (i) ensuring equitable access to rural land; (ii) promoting investments in
agriculture, forestry and pastoralism; (iii) reducing poverty in rural areas; and (iv) promoting
sustainable management of natural resources. In addition to the goals above, the Rural Land
Tenure Law is meant to protect property rights, prevent and manage land conflicts, and build a
framework for ensuring rural land tenure security. The law furthers decentralization in Burkina
Faso and codifies principles of customary rights by enabling communities to draft local land
charters, which are local conventions based on the customs and land uses. These land charters
contain rules relating to conservation of shared natural resources, the process of giving and
receiving land loans, and managing land disputes. The law provides the governing framework for
the land charters, which vary according to local needs and customs to reflect the diversity of

  The World Bank DTIS 2007 recommended a program whereby the government would: (i) identify appropriate
parcels of land that are relatively free of customary claims; (ii) clear these parcels of any remaining claims; and (iii)
define the legal and operational modalities under which these parcels could be set aside as reserves to be leased to
strategic investors for a period of 30 years or more. This would support private sector investment in agriculture,
irrigation and intensive livestock-raising activities.

  Pastoralism is governed by the 2002 Pastoral Policy Act in addition to the 2009 Rural Land Tenure System Law.
There are also national orders which govern regulation of disputes between farmers and pastoralists, decrees on
national transhumance, and a 1998 agreement by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on
transborder transhumance (Cotula 2006; UNDP 2006; Kagone 2001).

Burkina Faso's people and ecosystems. Local land charters are created at the village level in a
participatory manner that includes a representative group of stakeholders (including women,
forest users, pastoralists, and youth), and is aided by the state. They are adopted at the village
level, validated at the municipal court, and recorded in the register of local land charters.
5.29 The 2009 law also enables legal recognition of individual and collective land rights,
the transfer of certificates of rural land possession through inheritance, both oral and written
rural land leases, and local land management institutions. These local land management bodies
include the Rural Land Service in each community, the Village Land Commission in each
village, and "local consultative bodies for land-related matters" in rural municipalities. The law
also sets forth the framework for addressing land disputes, stating that parties should first attempt
to resolve the situation with local authorities, per procedures in the local land charter. The Law
gives local authorities a 45-day period, which may be extended once, in which to reach
conciliation between the parties. Addressing the courts and initiating litigation should be the last
response. Nonetheless, it is important that efforts to address land disputes and assist with conflict
resolution be carefully designed with a thorough understanding of local power relations, as
outside efforts by NGOs to "map" land have at times led to conflict escalation. It is also
important to build capacity in Burkina Faso for relevant institutions ­ including those at the
national, local, village and community levels ­ to resolve conflicts. 9
5.30 Eight decrees for the implementation of the law on rural land tenure were adopted
in June 2010 and published in the following month. The decrees provide guidance on the
organization and the functioning of the rural land registers, the modalities of elaborating and
validating the local land charters, the piloting of the rural land plan in the Ganzourgou region, the
procedure for the certification of rural land ownership by individuals, the criteria governing the
transmission of rural land rights (tenure), the attribution, the composition, the organization and
the functioning of local land management administrations, the procedure for certifying rural land
ownership at local community level, the modalities of issuing certificates for the temporary
exploitation of rural land and the conditions for land restitution to its rural land owner. A well-
functioning land register is also required for adequate implementation. Implementation has
started with the support of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and is expected to provide
land owners, including private investors, with long-term land tenure security, facilitating
enhanced private investment. The MCA implemented a pilot phase in 17 rural communes with
the aim to scale up to 30 other rural and urban communes. A total of 11,200 certificates of land
tenure ("proces verbaux de constatation de possession foncière"), recognized by the new law,
have been delivered to date. The MCA project is now seeking to help municipal councils to
validate these certificates. Although certificates have been delivered, it is still a challenge for
people having this certificate in rural areas to get a loan from the banking system, as the latter
does not recognize this certificate as sufficient collateral. Technical capacity in delimitating land
in rural areas needs also to be improved. The Government is now seeking more financial and
technical assistance to scale up implementation to the national level. With the Bank's support, an
action plan for the law's implementation has been elaborated for the coming five years. A Round
Table for raising additional funds is planned.

Promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources

5.31 Consolidating the achievements of the current PRSC/G series in public financial
management, the PRSG-11 supports improvement of budget execution performance, and
effective implementation of budget management oversight. This focus builds on lessons from
the recent PER (FY10), the 2010 PEFA reports (national and sub-national) and ongoing technical
assistance provided by IDA. The Government has been at the forefront of the push within
WAEMU to shift the focus of the PFM directives towards performance budgeting given that the
basics policies and institutions are mostly in place as evidenced by the outcomes of 2010 PEFA
which ranked Burkina Faso among the top performers in the Francophone area. This new key
challenge and its implications are well defined and sequenced given the limited capacity to
implement the Government PFM reform agenda, SRFP. 10 (Stratégie de Renforcement des
Finances Publiques) which benefited from Technical Assistance from donors community. As a
result, the Government is undergoing a change in its budget framework over the medium term in
order to shift the focus from inputs towards outputs and outcomes.
5.32     The PRSG-11 supports the phasing out of the "joint inter-ministerial expenditures"
and the proper allocation of expenditure by Ministry, broken down into existing functional
codes. As a first step in this direction, the PRSG-11 trigger requires that over 50 per cent of the
'joint inter-ministerial expenditures' ("dépenses communes interministérielles" or DCIM)
executed credits of the 2010 budget be broken down by administrative and functional
classification in the 2010 budget execution data, in order to improve the efficiency of the
management of these expenditures, increase transparency and prepare the transition toward
program budgeting.
5.33 The recent PER highlighted the high proportion of operating expenditures which
escape careful scrutiny due to their inclusion under DCIMs. It analyzed the composition of
DCIM in the budget using the functional classification and revealed a preponderance of general
operating expenditures. The main expenditures included in DCIMs cover: (i) the executive's
expenditures for water, electricity, telecommunications, vehicles and fuel purchases; (ii)
subsidies to the cotton producing companies; (iii) sector budget support for education under the
Education For All program; and (iv) election spending. In the 2010 budget, DCIMs also include
on a provisional basis a spending plan reflecting the fiscal stimulus in response to the global
economic crisis.
5.34 The high proportion of operating expenditure in the DCIMs generates risks in the
transparency and oversight of general operating expenses. This is also an obstacle to the
empowerment of cost centers, as well as to the transparency and quality of financial information
clear presentation of fiscal statistics. Clearly, political economy considerations play a role in the
choice of this budget vehicle, which is under direct control of the Minister of Economy and
Finance rather than sector ministries. However, the phasing out of DCIMs and the proper
allocation of expenditure should be encouraged in order to improve the scope of the functional
analysis of public expenditure, the accountability of cost centers, to ensure transparency and
improve financial reporting.

10
  Elaborated in late 2007 based on the first PEFA outcomes, the SRFP aims at piloting in progressive manner the
PFM reform agenda. This is supported by a 3-year action plans divided into 9 programs (monitoring of the reform,
budget, revenues, internal control, accounting, external control, capacity building, procurement, etc). A joint
evaluation (by the donors and the Government) of reform progress is undertaken on annual basis.

                                                      35
5.35 A 50 percent reduction in the proportion of reported DCIMs has been achieved.
Regarding the 2010 budget, the Ministry of Finance reallocated the operating expenditures
associated with the fiscal stimulus in response to the financial crisis (CFAF 7,949 billion) to the
relevant line ministries. Election-related expenditures have also been allocated to line ministries.
As the conditions that would allow for an effective transfer of the responsibility for the payment
of tax refunds, utilities (water, electricity, telecommunication) and vehicle purchases to line
ministries are not yet in place, these expenditures remain under the authority of the Ministry of
Finance. The authorities should report on these expenditures on the basis of statistical
information provided by the directorates in charge of their payment. The equivalent of CFAF 60
billion obtained from the recent renewal of mobile telephone licenses were not included in the
original 2010 budget and, hence, they are not covered by the PRSG-11 prior action.
5.36 The authorities also validated the methodology for monitoring the classification of
executed credits according to the actual consumption of each line ministry. A technical
committee composed of the Directorate General of Budget (Ministry of Economy and Finance),
the Directorate General of Public Domain and the Permanent Secretariat for Financial Policies
and Programs (Ministry of Economy and Finance) was established to monitor the breakdown of
2010 budget execution data. The monitoring methodology was validated during a workshop on
January 27, 2011. The World Bank and other donors provided comments on the methodology
report. The validated methodology certifies the 50 percent reduction in the proportion of the
reported DCIM.
5.37 The PRSG-11 also supports the development of risk-based audit under the aegis of
the Autorité Supérieure du Contrôle de l'Etat (ASCE). Administrative oversight institutions are
expected to start following a risk-based approach, as evidenced by the production of a "risk map"
and the undertaking of at least three audits using this methodology.
5.38 The ASCE was created in 2007, in part to coordinate the work of all sector
inspectorates. This body's work program used to be determined without due consideration to
where the real risks are - for instance, the education inspectorate had no idea whether it should
look in priority at teacher absenteeism, school construction, procurement of textbooks or teacher
deployment. This warranted the introduction, within the context of a regional technical assistance
program to ASCE, of a more methodical and professional approach to the selection and
performance of audits. This risk-based approach is derived from international best practice and
has been successfully introduced in countries such as Kenya, Mauritius and South Africa. It aims
to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of internal audit, and help ministers to identify weak
spots and areas for improvement.
5.39 A more methodical and professional approach to the selection and performance of
audits was adopted based on a risk map methodology. In addition three pilot audits were
finalized. The ASCE inspectors and line ministries participated in a workshop on June 3-4,
2010 regarding the risk-based audit methodology. This methodology was designed to counteract
and manage uncertainty in the use of public resources and ensure oversight based on well-
grounded information. The pilot phase for the implementation of the risk-based audit
methodology was launched at the beginning of November 2010, involving three pilot ministries,
namely the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Basic Education and Alphabetization, and the
Ministry of Infrastructure. Seminars to present the risk-based audit methodology to the three
Ministries were organized. The implementation of the risk-based audits started with the
identification of three functional processes exhibiting the highest risk within the three Ministries

                                                36
identified above. Moreover, inspection teams were identified in each case. They finalized three
internal audits based on the new methodology, whose results were presented during a workshop
on February 2, 2011.
5.40 The reforms in the public financial management area related to improved internal
control and external oversight, transparency in budget allocation and execution and a shift
toward program budgeting and fiscal decentralization have laid important foundations for
ongoing governance initiatives in the country. While the country's governance indicators
(including the Corruption Perception Index and Open Budget Index) have yet to reflect the
impact of these institutional reforms, the reforms have created openings for broader governance
reform. On corruption, for example, the strengthened role of the ASCE has provided an
institutional anchor for constructive dialogue on the development of an effective and
disaggregated national tool to monitor corruption and governance trends in a consolidated and
comprehensive manner. The World Bank is leading a development partner technical group to
support the ASCE in developing such a tool. On decentralization, the PFM reforms have also
brought into focus the ongoing challenges related to fiscal decentralization and prompted
targeted Bank support for a high level policy and decision-making process (the Visions
Prospective) and for substantive technical support on fiscal decentralization at national and local
levels (through the Decentralized Development project under preparation).

                        D.     PRIOR ACTIONS FOR THE PROPOSED PRSG-11

5.41 PRSG-11 would support selected reforms in the Government's program and in its
Letter of Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 2) that are deemed essential to its successful
implementation. The rationale for their selection has been discussed in the previous section,
and all are characterized by government commitment and feasibility. This list is aligned with the
joint performance matrix of the budget support group for 2009/2010 11 (Annex 7). The early-2010
version of the matrix for 2009 served as a basis for the selection of the prior action on the
implementation of a restructuring plan for BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel. Since the
Government was in the process of finalizing the restructuring plan for the three public entities as
part of a larger privatization program, this action was not included in the final signed version of
the Performance and Disbursement Criteria. Compliance with these prior actions forms the basis
for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation.
5.42 The eight prior actions for the PRSG-11were completed as of April 8, 2011. Six prior
actions were derived from triggers identified during the preparation of PRSG-10, and two were
added to strengthen the private sector development pillar of the operation. Table 5.1 shows that
all the prior actions were fully met. One prior action encompassing reforms in the mining sector
was dropped because of lack of consensus on the fiscal section of the draft law amending the
2003 Mining Code and the delays in the finalization of the EITI report. Difficulties in
implementation related to the current low capacity and expertise on the PPP issues, independent
of the authorities' commitment to reform, suggest the need to revise the prior action related to
the PPP trigger. The prior action on the PPP law and the PPP unit was modified and now
provides for the adoption of a PPP strategy. Overall, the program supported by PRSG-11 will be

 substantively similar to the program negotiated under PRSG-10, and encompass two additional
 prior actions.
 5.43 A new programmatic series of PRSC/Gs would focus on supporting key strategic
 areas within the SCADD. The new series will continue to be thematic, and possibly have
 rotating management between PREM and the sectors, in order to improve the sense of ownership
 and commitment by sectors, thereby strengthening the policy dialogue. The themes will seek to
 support the SCADD implementation, while the prior actions will be part of the Government's
 broader reform agenda and emanate from dialogue with the authorities. Sectoral budget support
 (such as in education sector) and investment lending instruments will continue to complement
 the PRSC-type instrument. Building on some reforms already initiated would ensure appropriate
 support to a sequence of reforms.

                                    6. PRSG-11 IMPLEMENTATION

                                     A.     PARTICIPATION PROCESS

6.1    The design of PRSG-11 is benefiting from broad stakeholders consultations,
particularly in the context of Government's preparation of its new country strategy for
faster and sustainable growth (SCADD). The Government led several meetings in which
experts from central and line Ministries and top officials, including Ministers, consulted local
Governments officials, private sector representatives and civil society organizations. The
preparation of the PRSG-11 benefitted from meetings with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, the Ministry of Transport, the Shippers' Council, the truckers' unions, the PST-2, the
Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Mines and the EITI national focal point, the MEBF and
the Chamber of Commerce. Among the consultations, one can note:
     a. The three CGAB-CSLP annual reviews, which represented the last stages of a
        consultation process involving Government experts, private sector and civil society
        representatives, working together in the nine 12 established sector and thematic
        commissions (Commissions Sectorielles et Thématiques ­ CST), allowed candid
        discussions of the challenges that Burkina Faso faces;
     b. A newly established cotton stakeholders' consultation framework that has enabled
        substantive exchanges with the authorities, the producers' association, private sector
        representatives and other donors on the reform agenda in the sector and a review of the
        draft strategy and medium term road map to be approved by the Government;
     c. Intensive engagement through ESW and AAA to improve appropriation of analytic
        findings by all actors involved. Several workshops and consultations took place,
        including during the dissemination of the Country Economic Memorandum on growth
        and competitiveness, during the preparation of the second phase of the programmatic
        Public Expenditure Review in the transport and electricity sectors, and of the
        employment and skills development technical assistance, on the conduct of ongoing
        technical assistance in the agricultural sector and proposed support in the mining sector
        (Mineral Development Support Project), in the preparation of the growth pole project and
        in the design of a new decentralization technical assistance project, as well as in the
        conduct of consultations with the IMF on their First Review under the Three-Year
        Agreement under the Extended Credit Facility;
     d. A grant awarded by the Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable
        Development (TFESSD) to implement a local government competition (Competition
        pour l'Excellence dans la Gouvernance Locale - COPEGOL) to increase the visibility of
        home-grown transparency and citizen participation practices at the municipal level. The
        initiative will be implemented jointly with the CDD project (PNGT2) and the Municipal


12
    Economic Infrastructure; Education - Vocational Training; Governance, Institutional Reforms and
Decentralization; Health, Nutrition and HIV / AIDS; Private Sector and Competitiveness of the Economy; Rural
Development and Food Security; Social Protection; Public Finance and Resources Allocation; Water, Sanitation and
Living Conditions.

       Association of Burkina Faso (AMBF). The good practices will be evaluated based on a
       detailed framework that was developed to score and rank governance practices.

6.2     External accountability mechanisms exist to ensure oversight of policy making. The
internal audit mechanisms include the Supreme State Audit Institution (Autorité Supérieure du
Contrôle d'Etat -ASCE), the Finance Inspectorate (IGF), and Technical Inspectorates at line
ministry level. ASCE is operating in a more transparent environment and significant efforts have
been made to strengthen the institution's capacity, albeit with limited resources. Furthermore, the
Court of Accounts is invested with jurisdiction to control public finances. The Court of Accounts
now publishes on a regularly basis a Yearly Audit Report, the quality of which has improved
according to the 2010 PEFA results. Public access to key fiscal information has been
progressively improving as a result of government continued efforts to make this information
available in time. The government has translated the budget in six local languages and NGOs
have helped to inform the population on the budget key features. Certain parts of the media
operate outside the influence of government and powerful business interests and media publicly
provides some deterrent against unethical behavior. Burkina ranks above the regional average in
Freedom House's Freedom of the Press Index. The State has a relatively well designed
communication policy, while the Cabinet decisions are published in newspapers and are
available on the internet. The government organizes periodic press conferences during which the
members of the executive have exchanges with the media on government decisions and social
events.

                             B.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

6.3     The PRSG-11 is expected to have a positive direct impact on poverty reduction. The
cotton readjustment plan will help ensure the viability of cotton production in the zone
managed by Faso Coton and promote efficiency in all three ginning companies. The
readjustment plan prepared by the government in order to improve the viability of the cotton
sector will contribute to increase the income of cotton producers and their dependents. In the
framework of the plan, the government in coordination with the association of cotton sector
professional organizations (AICB) has identified cotton growing areas to be transferred by
SOFITEX and made an offer to an existing private operator (Faso Coton). Without the
readjustment, Faso Coton might eventually be forced to shut down, jeopardizing the livelihoods
of cotton producers in its area. Instead, the proposed reform will help ensure that there are three
viable ginning companies, creating the opportunity to compare performance across the three,
establish benchmarks, and put pressure on the weakest companies to do better. This in turn
should contribute to increasing the share of the world price which goes to the producers. The
cotton producers in the transferred areas should reap benefits in the form of better technical
support and financial services resulting in an increase in productivity, competitiveness and
income. The existence of a national price-setting mechanism should ensure that the readjustment
will not have a negative impact on the farmers moving from one company to another. In the past,
the cotton producers under the control of SOFITEX have been complaining about delays in
receiving payment. Such delays may be disruptive for the farmers, hampering their decision
making and consumption, including school enrolment of their children. The readjustment plan
may reduce such delays through better management.




                                                44
6.4      The liberalization of freight transportation is the prior action that is most likely to
entail some negative social impact. While the prior action only consists of the adoption of an
Action Plan, its implementation over time is expected to affect the least profitable truckers who
will lose market shares to more competitive ones, either local or from coastal countries, once the
quotas and queuing system have been abolished. The effect of freight liberalization on small
truckers may be negative due to a reduction or cessation of activity. At the same time, a more
efficient transport system should lead to lower import costs for millions of consumers, and
greater competitiveness for export activities. Hence, the whole population may benefit from
lower prices, higher purchasing power and higher consumption. According to household survey
data from 2009, 12,977 individuals are involved in road transportation of merchandise. This
number includes not only big and small truckers, but also transporters using other types of
vehicles. Most of the individuals operating in the transport sector are the main income source of
their households. The poverty rate in the transport sector is much lower than the situation
observed nation-wide, (a difference of 28 percentage points), while the household size is lower
as well, counting on average 3 persons. If all road transporters were to lose their job or part of
their income in the aftermath of the reform, around 39,000 people would experience a reduction
in their welfare. The most pessimistic scenario, Scenario 1(a), simulates a loss of per capita
consumption of 100 percent for the truckers and their families, and no change in per capita
consumption for non-trucker households. This results in an increase of the poverty rate by 0.38
percentage point. Scenario 1(b) is a more optimistic version of Scenario 1(a) and assumes a 5
percent increase in per capita consumption for non-trucker households. This scenario results in a
reduction of the poverty rate by 1.3 percentage points. Scenario 2(a) and 2(b) are less pessimistic
that the first two ones in terms of negative effects of the reform. They consider a loss of per
capita consumption of 10 percent for truckers and their families and an increase in consumption
of either 0 or 5 percent for the non-trucker households. Scenario 2(a) based on these assumptions
results in a marginal increase of the poverty rate by 0.05 percentage points whereas Scenario 2(b)
indicates a reduction of the poverty rate by 1.64 percentage points. Scenario 2(b) is probably the
most realistic one, though the increase in assumed consumption may be a little high. These
simulations suggest that the liberalization of the trucking industry will be broadly beneficial
while requiring compensatory measures to upgrade small truckers' competitiveness or reallocate
employees to more efficient firms.
6.5      The adoption of decrees for the implementation of the 2009 law on rural land tenure
is unlikely to have major negative poverty and social impacts, but implementation should
be carefully managed to avoid displacement. The adoption of implementation decrees will
complete the legal framework in the field and increase transparency regarding the acquisition of
formal land rights. Overall, this is expected to enhance equity in access to land for rural actors,
help promote investments, increase productivity in the agriculture sector, create the premises for
poverty reduction in the rural area through better and more secure access to land, consolidate and
preserve social peace, and favor sustainable management of natural resources. Furthermore,
higher investment through securing land tenure may also enhance development of nonfarm
activities and job creation in rural areas. Nevertheless, implementation of any land reform law is
likely to create some winners and losers. It is therefore critical that the dispute resolution
mechanism be robust and clearly understood by stakeholders and effectively and transparently
applied, and that measures for mitigating potential negative impacts are in place. The new legal
framework will also require support at multiple levels, including training of local government
representatives and local government institution-building to properly implement rules, as well as


                                                45
with potentially vulnerable groups such as women, youth and migrants to enable an
understanding of their rights in the new system. Because the new law supports the participation
of customary actors and institutions in implementation, follow-up, and evaluation of land policy
and the new features of land legislation, it is vital that public education occur widely at the very
beginning. It is also important to build institutional capacity to implement and sustain usage of
the new land rights management and land administration tools provided by the new law. Large-
scale public engagement campaigns were undertaken in the process of drafting the new law, but
these should continue through implementation and evaluation.
6.6     With reference to the restructuring plan for BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé
Hotel, the poverty and social impact is not expected to be significant. For the two
transactions involving BUMIGEB and Hotel Silmandé, the compensations associated with the
workers' legal rights pertaining to their lay-off have been paid. In the case of the Silmandé
Hotel, an agreement has been concluded to ensure reemployment of the former workers by the
new manager of the hotel and additional job creation might occur as service quality improves
and occupancy rates increase. For the CCVA, the first step of the privatization, as provided by
the prior action, does not allow for a full analysis of its poverty and social impact as
compensation that will be offered to workers is not agreed on at this stage. However, it is
planned that staff and the public will get 4 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the shares of
the new enterprise.

                                C.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.7     The activities supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant
negative effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. Nevertheless, with
regard to three prior actions, namely the plan for the readjustment of cotton growing areas, the
action plan to liberalize trucking industry, including tighter enforcement against axle overloading
by trucks, the restructuring of BUMIGEB and CCVA, and the setting up of guidelines for
securing land tenure in the rural areas, better monitoring of rule enforcement is warranted in
order to minimize any negative impact on the environment.
6.8      In the cotton sector, the PRSG-11 continues to support Government's efforts to
improve the sector's competitiveness. The action plan on the transfer of cotton growing areas
from SOFITEX to Faso Coton is not expected to have negative impacts on environment. The
Government's broader strategy is anticipated to have a number of environmental effects which
are being tracked. In particular, the Government has authorized the scaling up of GM cotton
seeds, which accounted for 66 percent of national plantings in the 2010/11 crop campaign.
Expansion of this seed technology is resulting in a reduction in pesticide use, which is positive
for the environment and for human health. Fertilizer use in aggregate and per hectare is not
anticipated to increase as a result of the PRSG-11 supported actions. Input provision is being
conducted with better planning, so it is anticipated that actual fertilizer application will stay
within technical norms. In the new configuration, the development of cotton growing areas is
expected to take into account the existing ecosystems, and continue the implementation of
environmental-friendly techniques, including through the protection of water sources, land, soil
fertility and sustainable land management. To this end, the IDA-financed West Africa Regional
Biosafety Project is enhancing regulatory capacity to manage environmental aspects of this
activity. The Government is also encouraged to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment



                                                46
(SEA) of the proposed cotton sector's to identify those regulatory and other reform measures that
would be necessary to improve its competitiveness and sustainability. In fact, such SEA would
provide the needed analytical and participatory tool needed by the government to make the
strategic decisions aiming at integrating environmental considerations into cotton-related
policies, plans and programs and evaluate the inter linkages with economic and social
considerations.
6.9     In the transport sector, the tighter enforcement of axle load regulations is expected
to have some positive impact on environmental protection. Strict control of truck
overloading is expected to reduce road degradation and to limit the negative impacts of accidents
which often result from overloading. Transport liberalization will also lead to the replacement of
old trucks with new vehicles which are less polluting.
6.10 The restructuring plan involving BUMIGEB, CCVA and the Silmandé Hotel, is
expected to have some positive impact on environment protection. In particular, the
BUMIGEB restructuring will ensure better exploration activities, quality control and oversight of
the respect of norms. Improved technical control by Burkina Contrôle SA would contribute to
emission and pollution control and reducing accident risks, with positive effects on the
environment. Finally, the new management of the Silmandé Hotel is expected to have strong
incentives to observe environmental standards.
6.11 The environmental impact of the decrees for the implementation of the law on rural
land tenure is difficult to estimate at this stage. Nevertheless, the completion of the legal
framework on rural land tenure will ensure better land management. Private ownership of land is
also expected to contribute to better input management and use of fertilizers for agriculture
production. Regarding pastoralism, transhumant pastoral routes are expected to adjust as climate
and land-use patterns shift. This could lead to more conflicts between pastoral communities, and
between herders and farmers, but conflict-transformation projects and dialogue on how natural
resource and social issues connect to climate change could mitigate some of the potential
negative effects. The rural land tenure law and increasingly decentralized land management have
created legal and institutional frameworks whereby shifting land uses can be more effectively
planned or managed. In particular, the 2009 law provides for the creation of local land charters to
manage natural resources and ensure participatory management of shared resources.
6.12 Tighter enforcement of environmental regulations will be facilitated through the
recent creation of thirteen regional centers for environment protection. A National
Environmental Policy was adopted in January 2007 and a National Environmental Action Plan
exists. Most environmental policies and practices in Burkina Faso are based on the Environment
Code enacted in 1997. A Forestry Code was also adopted in 1997. Articles 17 to 24 of the
Environment Code describe the situations in which an environmental assessment of development
activities is required, as well as the procedures to be followed for its preparation. Typically, the
law requires that any development activity likely to produce major adverse environmental
impacts should be the subject of an environmental assessment, which must be endorsed by the
Ministry of the Environment. The law also requires that a public consultation should be
organized with the affected parties/communities to discuss potential impacts and ways to
mitigate them. In 2010, the main pieces of legislation, the Environment Law (1997) and the
Forestry Code (1997) were revised and await adoption by the Parliament. The main revisions
reflect: (i) the evolution of international environmental law and the emergence of new


                                                47
environmental problems; and (ii) the new national institutional shift towards decentralization,
which has created new actors in the field of environmental protection (such as the communes)
which need to be incorporated into the legislation. The revisions of the laws were finalized. The
revised laws await adoption by the Parliament in 2011. Burkina Faso has the necessary
regulations pertaining to environmental assessment, but compliance with such regulations is
weak because of lack of technical capacity and inadequate awareness within the Government for
applying environmental assessment to development operations. Environmental assessment (EA)
cells have been created in twelve technical ministries, with the objective to achieve
environmental compliance. EA requirements and inclusion of environmental and social concerns
in sectoral investments are used as criteria for environmental pre-selection of public investments
in all sectors. In addition, the Ministry of the Environment, through the EIA review process, is
empowered to make more detailed recommendations and prescribes follow-up measures for each
investment that would be subject to prior EIA. The new institutional framework for environment
protection which covers both the national and regional levels, will provide more incentive for the
implementation of all required environmental protection measures and compliance with
environment protection rules in the implementation of the prior actions identified within the
PRSG-11. IDA is providing technical assistance to the Burkinabè authorities on climate change
in the context of the new country strategy. Should significant policy actions be identified by this
work that could usefully alleviate some of the country's environmental constraints, the next
series of PRSCs could focus some of its actions on the promotion of sustainable growth, for
which the preservation of the environment constitutes a key criteria.

                                   D.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.13 Overall, the Bank has judged implementation performance of the PFM reform
program to date and Government's commitment to PFM improvements as exemplary.
Fiduciary arrangements were reviewed by the Bank in the context of PRSG-11 preparation.
6.14 PRSG-11 builds on the achievements of the previous PRSCs by supporting
measures to enhance policy-based budgeting and budget transparency. The 2001 CFAA and
CPAR, and the 2004 HIPC AAP, were key inputs in the preparation of the Government's budget
management reform program (Programme de Réforme de la Gestion Budgétaire, PRGB). The
Government has also used the findings of the 2005 CPAR and the 2007 PEFA assessment to
update the PRGB and transform it into a PFM reform strategy (Stratégie de Renforcement des
Finances Publiques or SRFP). The SRFP is supported by most donors providing budgetary
support, and is a core element of the MOU for budget support. Under PRSC-1 to PRSG-10, most
recommendations of the CFAA and CPAR have been successfully implemented, including the
implementation of annual audit procedures recommended by the CFAA.
6.15 Outcomes from the latest PEFA, completed in June 2010, have confirmed progress
made so far by Burkina Faso in the PFM area. Improvements are noted on budget credibility
(indicators 1-4). Confirmation of adequate arrangements has been highlighted for the remaining
indicators (comprehensiveness and transparency, policy based budgeting and predictability and
control in budget execution). To complement the national PEFA, a sub-national PEFA for the
Ouagadougou municipality was completed on June 2010 with major outcomes fairly similar to
the national PEFA. Meanwhile, the MEF is working on a new sectoral strategy (Stratégie
Sectorielle du Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances) that will merge both SRFP and PRGED



                                                48
(Programme de Renforcement de la Gestion de l'Economie et du Développement) and include
objectives to implement the WAEMU PFM Directives recently issued.
6.16 Progress in the implementation of public procurement reforms and the fight against
corruption has also been realized. As regards public procurement management, the focus in
2010 was on: (i) developing the legal framework in accordance with international and
community standards (WAEMU); (ii) strengthening the institutional framework and institutional
development capacities; (iii) strengthening the interface between the operations for the award of
public procurement contracts and the performance of the private sector and (iv) ensuring the
integrity of the public procurement award system. As regards the control of and the fight against
corruption, the following progress was made during 2010: (i) strengthening the control of the
department in charge of public procurement through the General Directorate of Financial Control
(DGCF); (ii) the audit of the Department of Financial Affairs (DAF) and the Person Responsible
for Procurement (PRM) by the General Inspectorate of Finances (IGF); (iii) concluding an audit
of public procurement during 2008 and 2009 by the Government Procurement Regulatory
Authority (ARMP); (iv) examination by the State Audit Office for cases of mismanagement
liable for penalties and detected during inspections prior to 2010; (v) the reassessment of the
national policy document for the fight against corruption and the development of an action plan
by the ASCE; and (vi) the development of a risk map for the supervisory bodies (see Annex 2).
6.17 The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of
francophone West African countries, including Burkina Faso, continues to improve its
governance structure. The updated safeguards assessment of BCEAO issued by the IMF in
March 2010 revealed that the institution continues to have controls in place at operational level.
However, the IMF noted that the overall governance framework should nonetheless be
strengthened by the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors
exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanism and
financial statement. The upcoming implementation of the institutional reform of the West
African Monetary Union (WAMU) and the BCEAO should help correct that situation. In
addition, efforts to fully implement International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) should be
pursued as adopted internationally by other central banks.
6.18 Bank financial management specialists reviewed the flow of funds arrangement
between the Central Bank (BCEAO) and the Treasury (DGTCP), based on an audit funded
by the multi-donor Budget Support Group. The team concluded that current arrangements are
adequate, with fiduciary risks within acceptable risk tolerance levels. However, the team
recommended that the information systems of these two institutions be linked, so as to minimize
delays and discrepancies in flows reporting, thus eliminating cumbersome reconciliations. The
last audit report on the flow of funds, which was produced in September 2010, included an audit
opinion with some disclaimers due to delays by two donors in disbursing budget support
operations.

                              E.   DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.19 The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche of SDR 78.9 million
(US$125 million equivalent, on grant terms) against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy program. The operation would follow IDA's disbursement procedures for
development policy operations and would not be linked to specific purchases. Once the


                                               49
Financing Agreement becomes effective and upon receipt of a withdrawal application to that
effect, the grant proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a Government account at the Central
Bank (BCEAO) which forms part of the country's foreign exchange reserves provided the
Association is satisfied with the program being carried out by the government and with the
appropriateness of the country's macroeconomic policy framework. As a due diligence measure,
the Government will be required to provide the confirmation that an equivalent amount in CFAF
has been credited to the government Treasury account (DGTCP) in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank. The confirmation will be provided within 30 days of disbursement and it will include the
exchange rate applied to convert the foreign currency to CFAF and the date of the transfer. If,
after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of the operation are used for excluded
expenditures, as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to refund
directly to IDA, an amount equal to the amount of said payment, promptly upon notice from
IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. No dedicated account
is required. The closing date of the operation will be June 30, 2012. An ICR of the series will be
done in FY13. At its own request, the Government annually contracts an external auditor to
provide assurance on the flow of funds of budget support operations between the BCEAO and
the Treasury. The Bank will continue to rely on this arrangement deemed satisfactory rather than
request a specific audit for this operation.

                              F.   SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS

6.20 The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed PRSG-11. The Permanent Secretary of the Permanent
Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Programs and Policies (SP-PPF) in the MEF will lead
the Government's technical team with representatives of the Ministries of Economy and Finance;
Commerce, Enterprise Development, and Artisanship; Transport; Livestock and Animal
Resources; Agriculture, Water and Fisheries; Mining and Energy; Social Affairs; Public
Administration and Decentralization; road transport trade unions, and representatives of the
financial sector.
6.21 IDA's supervision effort will be aligned with the Government-led multidonor
monitoring and evaluation system underpinning the PRSP-II and upcoming SCADD, the
Priority Action Plan, and the General Budget Support Framework (CGAB). The specific
benchmarks and outcomes to be monitored under PRSG-11 (see Annex 3) are extracted from the
Government overall development program, thus providing significant benefits in reducing
transaction costs for the Government. They are included in the joint performance matrix under
the CGAB (2009/2010). IDA staff has been working with the authorities and the other donors
under the CGAB to ensure that coordination of the supervision efforts will increase predictability
and aid alignment with the budget cycle. In assessing the implementation of the PRSP-II and the
SCADD, the CGAB will take into account factors outside Government's control that may alter
the underlying assumptions for a successful PRSP implementation. Such factors include
declining terms of trade, weather-related shocks, and shortfalls in external assistance and
regional instability.

                              G.    RISKS AND RISKS MITIGATION

6.22 Macroeconomic risk. The recent rebound in gold and cotton price has helped Burkina
Faso recover from the global economic crisis. However, the country remains heavily exposed to
swings in the terms-of-trade and weather-related shocks. Agriculture, cotton and mining remain
vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks and fluctuating international commodity prices. In 2011,
growing import demand consistent with economic activities, coupled with higher global food and
oil prices, higher transportation costs, supply disruptions, and temporary refugee migration that
could result from the political unrest in Côte d'Ivoire could have negative effects on the external
position, entail higher expenditure and hamper fiscal consolidation. Other potential risks include
lower foreign direct investment that could delay needed investments in public infrastructure and
in strategic sectors identified for export diversification. Inadequate collection and use of
anticipated mining revenues would further hinder growth in fiscal space.
6.23 Political economy risk. Burkina Faso held presidential elections on November 21, 2010.
This has generated some delays in the implementation of key reforms included in the
CGAB/CSLP matrix as well as in the adoption of the new matrix for 2011-2013, which is to be
aligned with the new SCADD. Some social unrest has also taken place in March 2011, which
might delays in the reform process, if it continues. In the area of cotton reform, and freight
liberalization, resistance from some sector stakeholders may be too politically sensitive to
overcome in the short term. Lack of willingness to pursue the implementation of the rural land
law may hamper the delivery of land certificates. Increasing rents from the mining sector may
raise the stakes for control of public revenues and undermine progress in improving transparency
in public financial management.
6.24 Inadequate multi-sectoral coordination and communication. PRSC implementation
relies on good coordination between the MEF and line ministries. Full implementation of all the
prior actions requires early planning processes, smooth communication and reporting lines. This
becomes even more complex when entities outside of direct Government control are directly
involved in the implementation of the program, such as the Court of Accounts, the cotton
producers' association or truckers' council, or private sector and financial institutions. In
addition, good communication and coordination on specific reforms among members of
dedicated multi-sectoral task forces is essential, as in the case of the establishment of a PPP
framework.
6.25 Risk mitigation. The PRSG-11 will mitigate some of these risks. This operation
includes actions in the cotton, transport and tourism sectors, as well as the promotion of public-
private partnerships (PPP) and securing rural land tenure with the objective of developing the
private sector. This will help increase the country's economic opportunities and improve its
resilience to exogenous shocks over time. Improved VAT credit reimbursement mechanisms will
facilitate exports through timely cash flows for export operations. The completion of the rural
land legal framework provides the legal means for addressing any land disputes through a
progressive mechanism, from community consultations to initiating litigation, as a last resort.
Improving transparent budgetary reporting in general and on mining revenue in particular, and
strengthening the efficacy of internal control institutions by promoting a risk-based approach,
will provide additional safeguards against the political economy risk. Strengthening external
accountability and oversight mechanisms (Court of Accounts, ASCE, the commercial courts)



                                                51
together with social pressure through the media and NGOs can limit to some degree the power of
special interests or influencing decision-making.
6.26 This operation is supported by significant TA and analytical work that supports the
Government in delivering these reforms. The PAPSA project is accompanying cotton sector
reforms, and the CEDP project supports the development of a PPP framework and the state
divestiture program. The 2010 CEM explains the PPP principles and export facilitation
measures, such as the role of the VAT credit reimbursement mechanism in creating timely cash
flows for companies. The recent financial sector strategy developed with assistance from the
Bank explains how to consolidate development financing funds. The new approach for DCIM
derives from the recent PER, while IDA provides TA to disseminate risk-based approach in
auditing. The forthcoming PER review covering the transport and the electricity sectors will
provide an analysis of national transport quotas, the tour de rôle, axle-load restrictions and a
simulation of the redistributive impact of their suppression/enforcement. Technical support to the
Ministry of Transport and on the PPP issues will also enhance multi-stakeholder sensitization
and consensus-building around the new reforms. In order to address weather-related risks, the
comprehensive DRM Country Plan, developed with the support of World Bank's Global Facility
for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), aims to strengthen the capacity of Burkina Faso
to reduce disaster and climate risks. Activities include devising an early warning system,
capacity building for response institutions and investment in climate adaptive development
projects. The CGAC strategy, which is supported by an internal governance taskforce, provides
additional safeguards. Efforts are being made to ensure regular and close monitoring of critical
governance issues at a country and sectoral level and to improve the Bank's understanding of
particular political economy contexts through analysis. This work will support the operation by
helping to identify and predict potential difficulties in promoting targeted reform and by
identifying appropriate entry points and champions of reform. The GAC work also involves: (i)
support for the government in developing a system for monitoring governance and corruption
trends; (ii) support to strengthen civil society capacity to demand good governance in certain
sectors, including the mining sector; and (iii) support for improved multi-stakeholder
coordination in certain areas, including the trucking sector and decentralization.
6.27 The adoption of this program and assessment of progress through the joint donor
framework known as CGAB/CSLP provide additional assurances that implementation of
these policies remain closely monitored by the group of donors, as the CGAB provides several
advantages notably: (i) ownership; (ii) alignment; (iii) predictability; and (iv) result-based
approach. Reform implementation unfolds under the close watch of civil society.
6.28 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

  Subject: Letter of Development Policy


  Mr. President,

  The present Letter of Development Policy (LDP) covers developments in Burkina Faso's economic
  and social situation in 2010 and the outlook for the coming years. It is predicated mainly on the
  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the unified matrix of the 2010 PAP-PRSP and
  CGAB-PRSP measures, jointly validated by the Government and its technical and financial partners
  on 02 June 2010.
  The 2010 implementation report features all the details on the implementation of the program. This
  report will be issued at the end of the next assessment of the implementation of the Poverty
  Reduction Strategy Paper, which will officially mark the transition to the Accelerated Growth and
  Sustainable Development Strategy (SCADD) adopted by the Government at the end of 2010. The
  letter focuses mainly on the execution of the priority reforms of the Government supported by the
  World Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC).


  1. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION
  STRATEGY PAPER
  1.1. The implementation status is presented according to its four strategic axes : i) Accelerating
  equity-based economic growth; ii) Ensuring access of the poor to basic social services and social
  welfare; iii) Increasing job opportunities and income generating activities for the poor in an equitable
  way and iv) Promoting good governance.




                                                    55
1.2. The country experienced further flooding in July 2010 which, unlike the flooding that occurred
in September 2009 that was limited to the city of Ouagadougou, affected several parts of the country
leading to significant loss of life and property. According to estimates, around 173 226 people were
affected. The cost of humanitarian emergency response is estimated at around 4 billion CFA francs.
The combined requirements for the rehabilitation and upgrading of the hydro-agricultural
infrastructure (dams, dikes) destroyed or damaged by the flood cycle could rise to over 48 billion,
according to estimates by the Department in charge of water resource mobilization.

   A. Accelerating equity-based economic growth
1.3. In a sub-regional context marked by uncertainty, Burkina Faso's economy was able to resume its
trend growth rate of the past decade owing to the dynamism of the agricultural and mining sectors.
Economic activity experienced an improvement in 2010 and inflation remained moderate, just below
the Community standard of 3%. The real GDP growth rate exceeded 7% in 2010, compared with
3.2% in 2009. As regards agriculture, grain production estimated at 4 560 574 tons would be up by
26% compared with the preceding agricultural season, due to relatively favorable climatic conditions,
as well as Government actions taken during the past few years to support the productivity of the
sector through increased use of organic fertilizer and making available improved seeds to the
producers. Cottonseed production however dropped compared with the 2009 season.
As regards the mining sector, the coming into production of the fifth gold mine (ESSAKANE), a
world class mine, resulted in a 90% increase in production. It was against this backdrop that the
Government reviewed the mining code in order to improve on good governance and the socio-
environmental impact of the sector. The authorities have also been doing their utmost to achieve
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant status, preparing the procedure to
that end with the assistance of an independent facilitator.
1.4. The State budget remains the preferred financing framework for the priority actions of the
PRSP which integrates the Millennium Development Goals. The 2010 budget guidelines are
aligned with the main objectives of the economic and social development benchmarks, as well as
the consolidated action plan adopted by the Government as part of mitigating the effects of the
financial and economic crisis and the floods. This action plan includes in particular: i) boosting
agricultural production; ii) putting into place a special program for youth employment; iii)
restructuring businesses in difficulties and promoting small and medium enterprises; iv)
monitoring the price structures of consumer goods and services; v) infrastructural development;
and vi) implementing safety net programs and innovative mechanisms for easing the burdens of
vulnerable households. As regards the guidelines of the 2011 budget, these are coherent with the
consolidation of the objectives of the 2010 budget and pave the way for implementing the large
SCADD programs, notably support to the productive sectors.
1.5. Reconstruction work on the facilities, works and infrastructure damaged by the floods also
represented a concern to the Government. Following intense humanitarian support and
rehabilitation, efforts are now focused on reconstruction activities. To maintain consistency and
effectiveness in its recovery actions, the Government decided to consolidate the mitigation plan of
the effects of the economic and financial crisis and the reconstruction plan following the 2009
floods.
1.6 At the conclusion of budget-related activities in 2010, the measures undertaken using recovery
units, expanded computerization and enhancing awareness for improved civic fiscal responsibility,
have made it possible to reach astonishing new levels of mobilization of domestic revenues of 681
billion CFA francs with a lower limit of 667.8 FCFA. On the issue of the expenditure sector, total


                                                 56
expenditure and net loans come to 1,123.6 billion including social spending, which amounts to 297
billion with a lower limit of 274 billion FCFA. On average, the budget implementation rate of the
priority sectors for the 2010 financial year reached 99.66%, which bears testimony to the concrete
securing of funds made available to these sectors for achieving their respective priority action plans.
Releasing the Inter-ministerial Expenditure (DCIM) enabled the effective transfer of at least 57.11%
of the total 2010 DCIM to the beneficiary structures and the statistics were subsequently
disaggregated to reflect this state of fact.
1.7. As regards cotton production, 338 000 tons of cottonseed were harvested during the 2010/2011
crop year. This production is down by 6% compared with the 2009 season which recorded 361,120
tons of cottonseed. The positive price effect brought about by an improvement in international
market prices resulted in improved turnover and financial returns for the three cotton companies
operating in the national cotton basin. Insofar as the restructuring and support of the cotton sector
is concerned, the Government began implementing the action plan that it had integrated as a
component of the action plan against the effects of the financial and economic crisis. Accordingly, it
undertook the recapitalization of SOFITEX for an amount of 16.4 billion FCFA, put in place the
clearance of outstanding domestic payments of the Group of cotton producers for an amount of 4.3
billion FCFA and subsidized inputs for an amount of 3 billion FCFA. Furthermore, it initiated the
adjustment of the cotton zones to make them more viable by, in particular, the offer of the cession
of the Koudougou cotton zone exploited by SOFITEX to Faso Cotton, whose production weight
could thus rise to the 15% level. The cotton zone proposed for the cession includes two ginning
factories. Moreover, consideration is being given to experimenting with climate risk insurance in the
cotton sector and establishing an input fund, as well as updating the smoothing mechanism.
1.8. Within the scope of improving the business climate, the Government issued decree no.
2010/284/MEF/CAB in June 2010 pertaining to reform of the VAT reimbursement mechanism to
strengthen the competitiveness of export-driven businesses through improving their cash flow.
1.9. As regards the liberalization of the road transport sector, the Government undertook two
studies, the first of which aimed at establishing a diagnosis of road freight management systems in
the West African sub-region and proposed a scheme to bring about the liberalization of access to
the said freight. In this way, it is demonstrating its determination to work together with all the
countries of the sub-region and with the participation of the sub regional integration organizations
like WAEMU and ECOWAS for eliminating quotas and the rotation system practiced alternately in
the ports for increased competitiveness in this sector. The second study lists the haulage contractors
and documents the income they receive from this activity to ensure better targeting of
accompanying measures to be envisaged. The process is inclusive by nature and the Government
therefore took on board all the players in the sector (haulers, public administration, unions of all
kinds, forwarding agents etc.) through the signature of a decree creating a steering committee for the
liberalization process of the sector. Government action also focused on road infrastructure
maintenance through the effective application of the laws on axle loads. The monitoring and
awareness activities carried out in the field by the National Office for Road Safety (ONASER) led to
a significant decrease in incidences of overloading, dropping from 70% to 40%.
1.10. The public enterprise privatization program which aims at increasing the role and the
contribution of the private sector in the development process, was successful as regards the
conclusion of the leasing/management agreement of the Hôtel Silmandé to the Société Hôtel
SPLENDIDE, the transfer of 51% of the shares held by the State in the capital of the Automobile
Vehicle Control Centre (CCVA) to Burkina Contrôle S.A. as well as the restructuring of the Bureau
of Mines and Geology of Burkina (BUMIGEB), which implied liquidating the drilling component


                                                  57
whilst maintaining the State-owned enterprise but with the renewed objective of geological and
mineral exploration and the management of industrial, mining and environmental safety.
1.11. In view of the search for alternative sources of development funding, the Government set to
work in putting in place a public private partnership (PPP) implementation strategy in Burkina Faso.
To this end, an inter-ministerial committee has been created for defining the legal and institutional
framework of the PPP, notably the administrative structure that will be equipped with the financial,
material and human means to develop and ensure the implementation of the action plan.

    B. Ensuring access of the poor to basic social services and social welfare

1.12. By virtue of the objectives pursued by this second pillar of the PRSP, namely the development
of human resources for sustainable economic growth and job creation, this component emphasizes
the basic social sectors, notably basic health and education, social welfare (including the safety nets),
drinking water and sanitation. The sectoral reform initiatives carried out within this framework seek
to include the disadvantaged groups.

B.1. Access to basic education services
1.13. At the level of education, the efforts agreed to in the implementation of the Decennial Plan for
the Development of Basic Education enabled the achievement of satisfactory outcomes concerning
the offer and quality in the basic education sector.
    ·    an increase in the number of pupils from 1,906,279 in 2008/2009 to 2,047,630 in 2009/2010
    ·    a book/student ratio of 1.1 for reading and of 1 for arithmetic during the 2009/2010 school
         year.
As regards infrastructure, the Government established an inter-ministerial committee for the
monitoring and control of the delivery of educational infrastructure. The key role of this committee
is (i) to implement the monitoring strategy of the delivery of educational infrastructure; (ii) to
supervise all the technical monitoring and maintenance activities concerning the educational
infrastructure; (iii) to monitor the implementation of construction standards, compliance with the
contractual clauses and the maintenance of educational infrastructure and lastly (iv) to gather
information on the monitoring and control of the building sites.
To consolidate the efforts concerning the implementation of reforms in the sector, significant
institutional changes were carried out at government level through the creation of a national
Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA), thus recognizing the effectiveness of the
extension of basic education to junior secondary level.
As regards the primary and secondary items, the Government has set to work on finalizing the
school map.

B.2 Access to health services
1.14. In order to increase health cover, efforts were made by the Government to build and equip
health care facilities, to recruit health care personnel and to improve the vaccination coverage rate.
During the period considered, the proportion of Health and Social Promotion Centers that comply
with the staffing standards has reached 84.3%, this sets the scene for better quality service delivery
to the public. The rate of professionally-assisted childbirth was 75.3% compared with an annual
target of 72%.


                                                   58
At the level of strengthening sectoral dialogue, the first assessment of the health sector was
organized in March 20120 and the second National Health Development Plan (PNDS II) was
finalized and adopted.

B.3 An efficient social welfare system
1.15. In order to improve the national social welfare system and to develop a coherent and effective
safety net system for vulnerable populations, the Government, together with the support of its
partners, is tackling the definition of a strategy on the subject that will strengthen capacities for the
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the programs.

C. Increasing job opportunities and income generating activities for the poor
in an equitable way

1.16. The third axis of the PRSP and its program of priority reforms focuses on strengthening the
capacities of the poor to generate income through fostering their participation in the production
process. As regards reform, law no. 034-2009/AN pertaining to land tenure security in rural areas
was adopted in 2009 after a lengthy participatory process entered into following the adoption of the
land tenure security policy in rural areas in 2007. This law seeks to promote productive investment
in the agricultural sector and to establish the bases for the modernization of agriculture and its
insertion in the market economy. The full set of implementing texts were adopted and focus
respectively on i) the methods of organization and management of rural land registers; ii) the
methods for developing and validating the local land maps; iii) the designation of the Ganzourgou
rural land plan as the pilot operation for rural land tenure security; iv) the procedure for establishing
rural land ownership of individuals; v) the specific conditions applicable to the cession of rural land
ownership; vi) the responsibilities, composition, organization and functioning of local land
management structures; vii) the procedure for fulfilling the operations for establishing rural land
ownership initiated by the local authorities; viii) the methods for issuing authorization for the
temporary exploitation of rural land and the conditions for the restitution of this land to the owner.

D. Promoting good governance

1.17. Significant progress has been noted in the field of governance. In this respect, improvement in
public finance management mechanisms and in the process of decentralization have remained at the
top of the authorities' priorities throughout 2010. The main actions carried out for this axis aimed at
consolidating achievements.
1.18 As regards public finance, the activities carried out fall within the framework of the
implementation of the Three Year Sectoral Development Plan (PAST) of the Public Finance
Strengthening Strategy (SRFP), under the supervision of the steering mechanism put in place in early
2008. Those responsible for this mechanism functioned in accordance with the provisions governing
them with, in particular, the convening of periodic sessions of the Steering Committee and the work
of the 6 technical groups. The 2010 report examined at the assessment held on 25 February 2011
highlighted an overall satisfactory implementation of the annual 2010 section of the PAST-SRFP,
notably in the areas of i) budgetary forecasting and planning; ii) the mobilization of resources; iii) the
optimization of budget execution procedures; iv) control; v) devolution and decentralization and vi)
the strengthening of capacities.


                                                   59
1.19. As regards public procurement management, the focus in 2010 was to pursue the following
reforms: i) developing the legal framework in accordance with international and community
standards (WAEMU); ii) strengthening the institutional framework and institutional development
capacities; iii) strengthening the interface between the operations for the award of public
procurement contracts and the performance of the private sector and iv) ensuring the integrity of
the public procurement award system.
1.20 As regards the control of and the fight against corruption, the following progress was made
during 2010, i) strengthening the control of the department in charge of public procurement
through the General Directorate of Financial Control (DGCF); ii) the audit of the Department of
Financial Affairs (DAF) and the Person Responsible for Procurement (PRM) by the General
Inspectorate of Finances (IGF); iii) concluding an audit of public procurement during 2008 and
2009 by the Government Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP); iv) examination by the State
Audit Office for cases of mismanagement liable for penalties and detected during inspections prior
to 2010; v) the reassessment of the national policy document for the fight against corruption and the
development of an action plan by the Superior Authority of State Control (ASCE); vi) the
development of a risk map for the supervisory bodies. As regards the last mentioned major activity,
three ministerial departments were selected to experiment with this approach. These are the Ministry
of Basic Education and Literacy, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Infrastructure and
Disenclaving. The mapping was carried out in accordance with a participatory approach coordinated
by the ASCE to guide the supervisory effort. Three audits were carried out in addition to the
mapping. At the level of the MEBA, the audit focused on the strategy and the monitoring and
control mechanism for the management of resources transferred to the local authorities for the
rehabilitation of school infrastructures. As regards the Ministry of Infrastructure and Disenclaving,
the audit involved the management of maintenance projects along the roads, as well as the
execution, control and supervision of the work. As regards the Ministry of Health, the audit focused
on the organizational aspects of the said Ministry. The recommendations resulting from these audits
will enable an improvement in the delivery of educational, health and transport services respectively.
1.21. Significant progress was also noted in 2010 in the implementation of the public finance
reforms, signaling more extensive use of the national systems and procedures, which is crucial to
strengthening aid effectiveness.

    2. OUTLOOK FOR 2011-2012
2.22. The Government will embark on an important new course in 2011 with the effective
implementation of the new development strategy (Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable
Development: SCADD) through the operationalization of its monitoring and evaluation strategy.
This policy will enable it to fight poverty more effectively whilst strengthening dialogue with the
partners involved; the development process having been largely participatory with five (5) levels of
dialogue, namely the sectoral and thematic consultations, regional consultations, the consultations of
representatives of the private sector and civil society, the consultations of the Republican institutions
and the national conferences.

2.23. Focusing on the priorities of economic growth and the aspirations of the public for improved
quality of life, the vision of the SCADD by 2015 is that of a productive economy which accelerates
growth, raises the standard of living and improves and preserves living environments by means of
informed and efficient governance.



                                                   60
Its overall objective is to achieve strong and sustained economic growth, taking into account the
sustainable management of natural resources which has multiplier effects on the improvement of the
income levels of the population and its quality of life. As regards its objectives by 2015, these include
among others: i) achieving an annual average growth rate of 10% for the period 2011-2015; ii)
reducing extreme poverty and hunger in the country; iii) ensuring education for all; iv) promoting
gender equality and the empowerment of women; v) improving the health of communities through
reducing child mortality amongst those under the age of 5, improving maternal health and the fight
against HIV-Aids, malaria and other illnesses and vi) ensuring a sustainable environment. To achieve
this, the SCADD has been structured around the following four axes.

A. Axis 1: Development of the pillars of accelerated growth
2.24. This axis concerns the identification of the sectors and areas needing support in the production
of high value-added goods and services with potential: regional poles, manufacturing industry, agro-
industry, culture, tourism, and environment.

B. Axis 2: Consolidation of human capital and fostering social welfare
2.25. During the period considered, great strides have been made as regards human capital
development and social welfare. These two issues remain essential in a country which stands at a
critical juncture on its path towards development, laying its foundations which will in the long run
ensure its place amongst prosperous emergent nations. The Government has also agreed to place an
emphasis on increasing income and employment, developing education and training, health - notably
women's health, social welfare, population issues, urbanization and, generally speaking, the access of
populations to basic services.

C. Axis 3: Strengthening governance
2.26. The Government is staying the course in building virtuous governance at an economic,
political, administrative and local level.

D. Axis 4: Taking into account the transverse priorities in the development policies and
programs

2.27. Taking into account the transverse issues such as gender, population, environment and land-
use planning is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the SCADD. These issues will
thus constantly be presented at all levels of policy dialogue and during the process of formulating
policies and sectoral programs.
2.28 The Government considers using the additional financing resources to increase the budget
available for productive investments, in accordance with the objectives of the SCADD, as part of
the adjustments to be brought to the original Finance Law of 2011 by means of an Amending
Finance Law. The said law will take into account the immediate consequences and will also
anticipate uncertainties related to both the recent developments in the Ivorian crisis and the market
in petroleum products (the latter being likely to be severely disrupted by events currently taking
place in some producing countries). The Government's programs will apply mainly to: securing
energy (including using solar energy for rural electrification), strengthening multifunctional
platforms, equipping women with the necessary technology, mechanizing agriculture, upgrading
sanitation and hygiene and strengthening the information system.



                                                   61
2.29 The Government remains convinced that, with the support of its partners, notably the World
Bank through its Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), the satisfactory implementation of the
priority actions of the SCADD will contribute to consolidating the macro-economic framework and
to underpinning strong, sound and sustainable economic growth that is necessary for significant and
sustainable poverty reduction.

Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Statement by an IMF Staff Mission to Burkina Faso

Press Release No. 11/121
April 7, 2011

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission visited Ouagadougou during March 24­April 7,
2011 to conduct discussions for the second review of performance under the program supported
by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The mission met with Mr.
Lucien Bembamba, Minister of Economy and Finance; Mr. Francois Zoundi, Deputy Minister in
charge of Budget; Mr. Bolo Sanou, the National Director of the Central Bank of West African
States; and other senior officials. The team also met with representatives of the private sector,
and the donor community.

At the conclusion of the discussions, Mrs. Kabedi-Mbuyi, IMF mission chief for Burkina Faso,
issued the following statement:

"Macroeconomic performance improved in 2010 compared with 2009. The real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth is estimated at 7.9 percent compared with 3.2 percent in 2009, supported
by a significant expansion in the agriculture and mining sectors, as well as higher public
investment. Inflation remained moderate mainly on account of a good harvest. Cotton and gold
production, as well as prices increased in 2010, strengthening Burkina Faso's external position.
The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) narrowed from 4.2 percent of GDP in
2009 to 3.5 percent in 2010.

"Revenue performance strengthened further in 2010, reflecting the authorities' continued efforts
to improve tax administration, and thanks to the collection of revenue from the renewal of
mobile phone licenses. Total revenue rose to 15.6 percent of GDP, up from 13.7 percent in
2009. Expenditure amounted to 25.7 percent of GDP, rising by 1.3 percentage points of GDP
compared with 2009, partly reflecting an increase in investment spending. Consequently, the
overall budget deficit widened from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 5.6 percent in 2010.



                                               83
"There was good progress in the implementation of policies and structural reforms under the
ECF-supported program. The authorities met all quantitative targets and structural benchmarks
for end-December 2010. Structural reform measures focused on public financial management,
civil service, financial sector development, and cotton sector rehabilitation.

"Prospects for 2011 are marked by uncertainties due to downside risks. Real GDP growth is
projected to decelerate to 5.2 percent, with agriculture and mining sectors remaining the main
sources of growth. With the increase in global oil and food prices, inflationary pressures may
intensify despite the high level of stocks for cereals following a bumper crop in 2010. The
external position is likely to deteriorate compared with 2010, because of the increase in imports
linked to investment and higher oil prices, as well as lower cotton export volume. In the fiscal
area, the authorities' efforts to strengthen revenue collection and contain nonpriority spending
are expected to continue. Revenue mobilization will particularly benefit from the effective
implementation of the tax reform measures adopted in 2010­11. Downside risks to this outlook
are related mainly to increasing global oil and food prices. They are expected to increase costs in
the productive sector, and generate additional expenditure.

"Strengthening medium-term prospects requires continued fiscal consolidation and structural
reform efforts. An efficient implementation of the authorities' Strategy for Accelerated Growth
and Sustainable Development (SCADD), adopted in December 2010 will be crucial to reduce
the economy's vulnerability to exogenous shocks and support broad-based growth and poverty
reduction.

"The authorities and the IMF mission reached understandings ad referendum on macroeconomic
and structural policies for 2011-12 that are consistent with the ECF-supported program, and
could form the basis for completing the second review under the program. The IMF Executive
Board consideration of the review could take place in early June.

"The mission wishes to thank the Burkinabè authorities for open and frank discussions during
the mission and for their hospitality".

                                 The review of the penal code is part of the constant quest for a
                                 balance between the protection of individual freedoms and the
                                 efficiency of repression. Thus, provisions applicable to minors
                                 will be drawn up and some crimes will be committed for trial.
                                 This is the case of some aggravated thefts, with the most frequent
                                 crimes, especially, being considered as misdemeanors and tried
                                 by courts sitting in criminal matters, with heavy penalties meted
                                 out. In addition, attendance at the hearing will be made optional
                                 to allow judgments to be handed down on the basis of documents
                                 submitted. This reform will help to reduce the number of
                                 adjournments for failure of parties to appear in court and,

                                 Finally, the penal code review will help introduce other
                                 alternative measures such as the reminder to abide by the law and
