support the\n            authorities' efforts to boost real growth through\n            improved country competitiveness and increased private\n            investment, and the reduction of poverty. The development\n            objectives of the Eleventh Poverty Reduction Support Grant\n            Program is to improve the investment climate and promote\n            exports with six intermediate results; and promote\n            efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of\n            public resources. The operation is an integral part of the\n            World Bank Group's country assistance strategy for\n            FY10-12 and remains aligned with the overarching principle\n            of aid harmonization as defined in the joint donor framework\n            known as General Budget Support Framework (CGAB). The\n            operation seeks to meet the Government's budgetary\n            financing needs to support the implementation of\n            growth-enhancing strategic priorities under the Second\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) and the Strategy\n            for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD),\n            mainly in relation to public investment, service delivery,\n            and job creation, while providing resources as the country\n            may begin to absorb the effects of the Ivorian crisis and\n            the surge in the international oil and food prices. Finally,\n            the operation aims at consolidating development outcomes\n            achieved throughout the current Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit /Grant (PRSC/G) series. The main themes of the series\n            focus on: 1) improving the investment climate and promoting\n            exports; 2) protecting access to decentralized basic\n            services; and 3) promoting efficiency, transparency and\n            accountability in the use of public resources."}, "docdt": "2011-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
