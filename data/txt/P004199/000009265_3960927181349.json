        Government's implementation efforts over the 1989-91\n            period. Specifically, the credit will: (i) assist the Lao\n            PDR to improve state enterprise management; (ii) stimulate\n            private sector activities; (iii) assist with formulation of\n            fiscal measures to ensure increased revenues; (iv) assist\n            with Bank reform measures aimed at an increase in savings\n            mobilization; and (v) support measures to achieve greater\n            efficiency in the use of resources. The objectives are to be\n            achieved in part through support to the balance of payments\n            by the First Structural Adjustment Credit, partly by support\n            to the budget provided by the counterpart funds generated by\n            the sale of imports purchased under the credit and, partly\n            through ongoing dialogue on policy issues."}, "docdt": "1989-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
