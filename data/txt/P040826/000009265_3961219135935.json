PROGRAM I/PSDPS", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3878", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Because of past mismanagement and\n            ongoing deposit losses, the equity of provincial banks has\n            turned sharply negative and their liquidity has become\n            precarious. These banks are now draining already weak\n            provincial finances and present a systemic risk to the\n            banking system. Thus the provincial as well as the federal\n            authorities have asked for urgent financial assistance in\n            pursuing privatization as a way to restructure and sell the\n            remaining sound assets and liabilities to the private\n            sector. The Provincial Bank Privatization Loan adjustment\n            operation is directed at assisting the national government\n            to provide an orderly framework in which federal financial\n            support for costs associated with privatization/closure is\n            provided, subject to: (i) legislative authorization of\n            privatization at the provincial level; (ii) intervention of\n            the Superintendency of Banks; (iii) change of management;\n            (iv) a time-bound, transparent privatization process; (v)\n            timely resolution of residual assets and liabilities; and\n            (vi) bank closure in the event of failed privatization. The\n            loan is expected to support the privatization of some\n            fifteen provincial banks, representing about 10% of total\n            banking or 40% of provincial banking assets."}, "docdt": "1995-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
