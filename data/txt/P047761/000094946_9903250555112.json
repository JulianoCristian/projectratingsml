macroeconomic stability is critical for a\n            sustained growth in Tanzania, and specifies the need for\n            strengthening tax administration. Revenue performance will\n            be improved and domestic resources increased on a\n            sustainable basis to finance budgetary needs, through the\n            support of the Tax Administration Project. The main\n            components will: a) improve the legal system to enact laws\n            and regulations in taxation, and will introduce regulatory\n            taxpayer frameworks, to further establish appeals\n            mechanisms; b) increase the number of registered taxpayers\n            contributing to a broadened tax base, thus creating a\n            rationalization for deductions, exemptions and concessions\n            granted by tax laws, to further identify sources of revenue\n            for tax base expansion; c) strengthen the Tanzania Revenue\n            Authority (TRA), through a re-engineering process,\n            computerization of three revenue departments, and improve\n            the tax arrears recovery and the control of tax evasion; d)\n            improve the administrative infrastructure, with the\n            rehabilitation/construction of needed facilities; and, e)\n            include a Project Preparation Facility to finance project\n            coordination and implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
