Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The project accounts will be integrated into the TRA accounting system
and Accounting Unit of TRA reporting to the Commissioner of Finance who will coordinate project accounting, maintain overall
records, manage disbursements, and produce the project management reports, annual project accounts and ensure their timely audit.
The audit will also include a separate opinion on the eligibility of expenditores disbursed on the basis of Project Management Reports
(PMR). The external audit of Tax Administration Project (TAP) is to be conducted by the Auditor General or professional auditors
approved by the Auditor General. Auditing arrangements were agreed upon at negotiations. The Bank's Financial Reporting and
Auditing Handbook would be used by the auditors in accordance with the Bank's auditing guidelines. Audit reports will be furnished
to the Bank within six months after the close of TRA's financial year. There are no audits of other IDA funded credits outstandfig in
the sector.
Assessment of Project for PMR-based disbursement: A detailed review of the proposed financial management arrangements was
conducted during the appraisal to assess adequacy and readiness of the project to operate the revised disbursement procedures under
the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI). This review was based on the Bank's guidelines for "Review of Financial
Management System", and focused on the assessment of TRA accounting system as well as the format and contents of the PMRs to be
submitted by the TRA in support of withdrawal applications. TRA has in place adequate financial management systems that can
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the project, consistent with the Loan
Administration Change lnitiative (LACI) disbursement (i.e. periodic disbursement based on regular submission of project management
report) required by the Bank/lIDA. A separate report of this review has been prepared and made available. The project Operational
Manual with details of the PMR financial reporting format and the initial deposit to the Special account were finalized and agreed
upon at negotiations. The main features of the financial assessment are detailed in Annex 5, financial summary.
Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements: Monitoring of project execution will be undertaken by the PCU. The Bank will monitor
implementation through periodic supervision missions and review of quarterly implementation progress reports prepared by the PCU
based on LACI Project Management Reporting format. The PCU will provide to the Bank an Annual Work Plan no later than
February 28 of each year, beginning in 2000. Thepreparation ofthefirstAnnual Work Plan covering July 1999-June 2000,
satisfactory to IDA is a condition of effectiveness. Annual Reviews of the project will be conducted by the PCU no later than March
31 of each year, starting in 2000. In addition, TRA will submit to the bank monthly revenue collection reports, quarterly performance
reports and special reports such as progress on the customs reform program.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project                                   Document number and date of latest
CAS discussion:
Report No. 16554-TA, June 20, 1997
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) recognizes that macro-economic stability is critical to attaning the GOT's goal of rapid and
sustained growth. The CAS emphasizes the need for building much needed capacity in areas critical for sound economic management,
specifically in TRA. Furthermore, by strengthening tax administration, the project would improve revenue performance and increase
domestic resources, on a sustainable basis, to finance budgetary needs. The additional resources would also contribute to more
sustainable public investment and social sector expenditures. Finally, the project is expected to facilitate tax policy reforms aimed at
eliminating provisions that create distortions in economic decision making.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Issues:
Macro: Since 1992, Tanzania has faced serious fiscal problems arising from the gap between stagnant revenues and public
expenditures swollen by large outlays on administration. The fiscal deficit, after grants, was 5% of GDP in FY94. It rose to 7.9% of
GDP in FY95 and remained at these high levels until the first half of FY96. The large budgetary shortfall, together with the quasi-
fiscal deficit have been the main forces driving inflation and the growth of domestic debt The former, fueled by the deficit-induced
expansion of money supply has averaged 25% between 1994-96. The latter is now equal to 11% of GDP.
Tax Revenue collection reflects both the structure of the tax system and deficiencies in tax administration. Tanzania's tax revenue
ratio at 12.4%' percent is among the lowest in the region.
Structure: Notwithstanding the introduction of several recent measures (including a new investment act in 1997 and the
' Averages of the latest two years (1996/97 and 1997/98). Comparable ratio for some other countries in the region are: Kenya 24.1,
South Africa 26.2, Uganda 10.8, Zambia 17.5 and Zimbabwe 25.5.

Country: Tanzania                                                                    Project Title: Tax Administration Project
introduction of VAT in 1998), further reforms to simplify and rationalize the tax regime are necessary. This includes reforming
the complex (11 band) rate structure of personal income tax, rationalizing and closing loopholes in the area of corporate income
taxes including exemptions, and simplifjing the excise system.
Administration: Tax evasion is endemic mainly as a result of: (i) institutional weaknesses in the TRA including
technical/managerial competence, lack of equipment, poor infrastructure, antiquated business processes, weak tax audit and
investigative functions; and (ii) virtually no incentives for voluntary compliance or sanctions (e.g. criminal prosecution) for non-
compliance.
The Customs Service continues to suffer from: institutional weaknesses related to poor management; weak human resources;
cumbersome documentary requirements coupled with bureaucratic and discretionary paper-based procedures; ineffective enforcement
practices which rely largely on physical inspection despite the presence of Pre-Shipnent Inspection (PSI); lack of physical
infrastructure and equipment, and an outmoded legislativelregulatory base with inadlequate authority and penalty structures
contributaing to widespread under-reporting and evasion. In addition, significant rev enue leaks take place along its many porous
borders and especially due to the lack of a comprehensive PSI in Zanzibar. While tie GOT is also taking steps, such as considering
steps to impose control of transportation of transit fuel by road, using tax stamps for cigarettes, and negotiating means of border
control with neighboring countries, much more remains to be done.
Government Strategy:
The GOT has initiated an ambitious program of public sector reform focusing on, inter-alia, civil service reform, public expenditure
reform, and private sector development. Together with expenditure control, reform of tax administration is perhaps the single most
important macro-policy issue facing the government. Tax administration is thus a key element in the Government's strategy for
increasing tax revenue as well as decreasing economic distortions and promoting the transparency oftax and customs collection. It is
also a requirement for successful implementation of the International Monetary Fund (DIF)-supported Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF), as well as for continued donor balance of payment support.
While the Government has taken several initial steps (see section 11) towards strengthening tax administration, much remains to be
done. On the policy framework the Government continues to consult actively with the IMF and is in the process of addressing many
weaknesses in both tax and customs. It is also consulting with the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FLAS) on redefining the role
of the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC) and rationalizing the benefits offered to investors which are recognized to be the single
largest source of revenue loss. Onthe administration side, the Government has been receiving support from the World Bank and
several donors on various aspects, including recommendations for creating and organizing TRA, implementation and expansion of
Automated System for Customs Data Management (ASYCUDA), introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT), incorporation and pilot
testing of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), development of an InformationL Systems (IS) strategy, and preparation of an
institutional strengthening needs and plan. Implementation ofthe proposed program over the next five years constitutes a key element
of the Govermment strategy in this area.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project objective of increasing Govermnent revenues is central to Tanzania's development objectives and consistent with the
Bank's CAS. The project will simultaneously contnbute to a strengthening of Tanzania's prevailing weak public sector institutions
and management. It would address major shortcomings in tax administration by expanding the tax base, amending and consolidating
the legal framework, modermizing collection and audit procedures, and strengthening the institutional framework for enforcement.
Priorities for the first year include improving the taxpayer registry, strengthening tax collections through re-engineering the process
and automation, review of the TRA organizational structure, review and consolidation of the relevant tax laws, conducting a baseline
taxpayer survey, and begin capacity building efforts.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The main strategic choice considered by the Government was to continue reforms through incremental measures as opposed to a more
fundamental and fast-paced strategy. The GOT, with the establishment of TRA as a quasi-autonomous executive agency, opted for the
more radical, higher-risk strategy, in part because serious doubts were expressed early about the ability of TRA to retain qualified
personnel within the government bureaucracy. In addition, the need to increase revenues on a sustainable basis is urgent
The other main strategic choice considered was to be all-inclusive and cover the tax administration of the local government. However,
it was felt that this would not only delay much needed reform, but it could also undermine its effectiveness because of its ambitious
nature. Local govemment reform is in its infancy and discussions on inter-governmental fiscal relationships have yet to begin. In
addition, a strong central agency to support future efforts of local governments would still be necessary.

Finaly, privatization of customs was considered, but it was thought to be too radical a change at this point. It was felt that any more
changes to TRA could increase resistance to change, which would operate to the detriment of the entire tax reform effort. In addition,
Pre-shipment inspection (PSI) is currently in operation and negotiations for extending PSI for another 2 years have been completed.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lessons learned from previous tax administration projects which are reflected in the project design include: (i) need for political
commitment to the reform and active support for its implementation; (ii) appropriate emphasis on organization, business process,
human resource selection, pay and training issues and avoidance of an overemphasis on information technology; (iii) competent
leadership in implementation and close supervision by GOT; (iv) focus on voluntary compliance through improvements in legal
framework, administration and the quality of services, and fair grievance redressal; and (v) mechanisms to enhance the transparency

Country: Tanzania                                                                      Project Title: Tax Administration Project
and accountability of tax administration such as taxpayer registration number, prioritization of assessment, investigation and collection
activities, and an effective public relations campaign to educate taxpayers regarding their legal obligations.
Lessons leamed from other operations in Tanzania include: (i) the need for close project supervision which is facilitated in this case by
the transfer of project preparation and supervision to the Resident Mission; (ii) the need to assure adequate counterpart funding,
which is facilitated by instituting advance payment of a portion of the Government's contribution in the project account and institution
of an appropriate revenue retention scheme.; and (iii) close donor cooperation which has resulted in the donors working towards a
program approach and focusing on a conceptual framework within which interested donors can contribute.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The strength of the Government's commitment is demonstrated by: (i) creation of TRA in 1996; (ii) introduction of VAT; (iii)
preparation of several strategic plans with Donor and Bank support, such as a comprehensive TRA corporate plan, an Information
Systems Strategy, Customs Reform Plan; (iv) continued restructuring of TRA -- more than 1100 staff (about 27%) who did not meet
standards of integrity were laid off; (v) preparation for introduction of Taxpayer identification numbers; (vi) introduction of a
computerized system (ASYCUDA) in the Dar Es Salaam airport and seaport; (vii) h armonization of tariffs between mainland and
Zanzibar; (viii) continuation of Pre Shipment Inspection (PSI) for at least 2 more years; (ix) institution of "hot-lines" and other
mechanisms focusing on customer service; and (x) strengthening of the internal investigation unit.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The Bank is centrally involved, both because of the Government's desire to benefit from the Bank's international experience in tax
administration and because the GOT has, in the past, relied heavily on the Bank's advice in the steps undertaken so far. The Bank is
playing a key role in helping TRA develop the framework within which the anticipated donor-financed efforts will be agreed. Finally,
Bank participation will play a catalytic role in initiating and supporting the reform which involves wide-ranging organizational
changes.

Impact
Fiscal impact:
The project is expected to have a positive fiscal impact resulting from administrative reforms aimed at improving effectiveness in tax
administration. While some improvements may be expected from the start-up phase of the project in FY2000, it is conservatively
estimated that the reforms will result in a permanent increase in tax revenues of about 1% of GDP by 2002 and more than 2% of GDP
by 2004. These projections reflect increases due to overall economic growth, adminirstrative and policy changes in VAT, customs
measures (such as tightening of the borders, harmonization of tariffs), and the impact of reforms in income tax including reduced
collection of arrears, TIC exemptions, petroleum windfall taxes and increased efficiency of collection.
14. Financial Assessment: Not Applicable
15. Technical Assessment:
The project will finance institution building, physical infrastructure, vehicles, computers, telecommunications equipment and software.

Strategy, which includes hardware and software architecture standards to ensure con sistency with the re-engineered processes and
eventual dovetailing of software across the revenue and non-revenue departments.
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: The TRA will be the executing agency. A Steering Committee chaired by the Commissioner General and
composed of heads of the major departments (Human Resources and AdministratiojnL Finance, Information Technology, Income Tax,
Director of Research and Policy) and the Project Coordinator will report to the TRA Board at least quarterly. The Steering Committee

20. Sustainability:
By supportig a comprehensive tax and customs administration reform in conjunction with improved enforcement and voluntary
compliance, the project will help the GOT establish a sustainably higher and more predictable level of revenues. The strong institution
building component of the project is aimed at ensuring sustainability over the medium-term; Government commitment to on-going
strengthening is necessary for long-term sustainability, specifically with respect to assuring full funding of TRA's operational budget,
thus pennitting TRA to hire, motivate and retain qualified staff and, in particular, senior management

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The Bank has initiated discussions on integrity in Tanzania at the highest level of goivermment Integrity is an issue which may prove
controversial for several projects in Tanzania. Activities under this project will follow guidelines to be formulated and adopted by the
GOT, with Bank support
The TRA, with the firing of more than 1100 staff in 1996, has established a reputation in Tanzania for aggressive action on corruption.
In response to the Warioba Report, a TRA Action Plan to combat corruption was prepared and implementation is monitored by the
TRA Board. An internal investigation unit has been established in the Internal Audit Department. One of the functions of this
department is to ensure integrity amongst its staff. There is a media campaign in the press and on television, supported by telephone
hotlines and the provision of rewards to informants. Nonetheless, the TRA is well aware of the invasive nature of the problem,
especially in the Customs. A recent (August 1998) survey confirmed continued public concern with integrity in the TRA and the
Customs in paricular.
Private sector and other beneficiaries of the existing tax regime may mobilize and begin to oppose the proposed reforms.

Annex 2
Tax Administration Project
Detailed Project Description
Background:
Prior to 1995 revenue collection was done by the Tax department under the Ministry of Finance. Weaknesses and problems in the
previous tax administration such as inadequate revenue collection, inadequacies in tax policy, poor tax administration led to the
establishment of an autonomous tax administration body, the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) operating outside the traditional
Civil Service framework. The TRA act was effective on August 1995 and TRA started operations a year later as an Executive Agency
responsible for assessing, collecting and accounting for revenue on behalf ofthe GOT, administering as well as enforcing tax laws,
providing advice to the government on fiscal policy and its administration and developing an efficient and fair tax regime.
TRA Performance:
TRA has made considerable progress in improving and strengthening efficiency in revenue collection since it was established. Various
measures taken by both the government and TRA after the establishment of the authority have made a signifficant impact on revenue
collection over the past two financial years (1996/97 and 1997/98). Actual revenue collected in FY 97 was 97% of the estinated target
and 26% higher than revenue collected in the previous FY. Similarly, actual revenue collected in FY 98 was 88% of the target and
12% higher than revenue collected in the previous year. Apart from increased revenue collection, TRA introduced VAT on July 1,
1998 which has resulted in exceeding revenue collection targets and also fulfilling ESAF benchmarks.
Project Component 1 - Improved Legal Framework, US$0.8 million
TRA administers about 20 revenue related laws. Most of these were enacted many years ago and have not been revised. Over the
years amendments have been made but these have not been consolidated. Tax statutes are not easily available to both tax payers and
collectors. There is a need to review the laws to ensure that they reflect the socio-economic and other changes that have taken place in
the country. In addition, the current tax appeals system is ineffective and non-transparent and needs to be revised.
This component will help:
* update and modernize tax/customs laws and regulations;
*  improve compliance by rationalizing the laws and simplifying procedural requirements;
* facilitate enforcement, including reviewing the adequacy of enforcement provisions; and
*  the establishment of harmonized tax appeals machinery.
Subcomponent A: Review and consolidation of tax laws
The following laws have to be updated, revised, harmonized and some of them will be consolidated:
*  The Income Tax Act, 1973
*  The Customs Tariff Act, 1976
*  The Excise Tariff Ordinance (Cap.332)
*  The Stamp Duty Act, 1972
*  The Road Toll Act, 1985
* The Hotel Levy Act, 1972
*  The Car Benefit Tax Act, 1991
*  The Port Service Charges Act, 1973
*  The Airport Service Charge Act, 1973
*  The Motor Vehicle (Tax on Registration and Transfer) Act, 1972
* The East African Customs Management Act, 1976
*  The Traffic (Foreign Vehicle Rules) Act, 1973
*  Customs and Excise Management Act, 1997
* East African Excise Management Act, 1970
*  The Housing Levy Act, 1985
*  The Customs and Excise Management Act, 1977
*  East African Community Mediation Agreement Act, 1987
*  The Value Added Tax Act, 1997
*  Business Licensing Act
*  Foreign Vehicles Transit Charges Act, 1995

Subcomponent B: TIN regulatoryframework
Since there is no TIN system in place at the current time, the existing framework does not provide for a TIN concept The relevant
laws will be amended to provide for mandatory use of the TIN.
Subcomponent C: Establishment of Harmonized Tax Appeals Machinery
* Review the appeals provisions in the tax laws with a view to harmonize them.
*  Support the creation and operation of harmonized tax appeals machinery includling the creation of harmonized Appeals Tribunals
and Commercial Courts.
Project Component 2 - Broaden Tax Base, US$1.8 million
Tanzania has a relatively small number of taxpayers, and collects a disproportionately large share (75%) of its tax revenues from the
Dar Es Salaam region. The TRA intends to broaden the tax base through:
*  the introduction of a taxpayers identification number system and strengthen its presence and revenue perfornance outside of the
capital;
*  rationalize the number of deductions, exemptions and concessions granted by the tax laws;
*  introduce taxes (where appropriate) in areas of economic activity currently not taxed.
SubcomponentA: TiN -PPF Design, testingandproduction
Subcomponent B: Review of potential new sources of revenue and areas for tax base expansion by RPD together with MOF.
Undertake surveys to collect and utilize information available with GOT agencies and third parties to detect potential taxpayers and
introduce cross-agreements on the transfer of infonnation.
Subcomponent C: Printing of drivers licenses
Project Component 3 - Strengthen Institution, US$37.7 million
TRA's resources are thinly spread over a large number of activities. This component will help strengthen the management and
operating procedures of TRA through the introduction of modemn management and operations systems and training. It will help:
*  streamline, sinplify and modernize current processes and procedures;
-  computerize integrated revenue systems to permit increased efficiency, compliance and verification of records; and
- improve recovery of tax arrears.
To realize these objectives will require improvement in the caliber of its staff (throuigh training, remuneration and other incentives
including, inter alia, performance contracts). The strengthened TRA systems will also facilitate greater voluntary compliance by
improving the transparency, equity and efficiency of the tax system, and reducing the cost of compliance, inter alia, through increasing
the availability of information to the taxpayer and by removing distortions within thLe system. In addition to the simplification of tax
laws and the tax procedural requirements (Component 1 above), this will include a review of the tax rates with a view to rationalizing
and, where possible, reducing the rates to encourage compliance. The TRA intends to reduce evasion by strengthening its
investigation, audit and assessment capabilities through better systems, equipment, improved trainig and both increasing the level and
enforcement of sanctions.
Subcomponent A: Capacity Building and Technical Assistance:
The project will finance long term consultants/advisors with estimated 206 mans months to assist the following departments: Customs
Income Tax, Information Technology, Tax Audit and Investigation, Staff Training and Tax Revenue collections.
Also it will fiance short term consultants with estimated 158 mans months to assist in VAT management control, tax payers
education, research and policy, intemal auditing, communication system and customls and project mid term review.
Subcomponent B: Computerization:
The project will also support computerization throughout the TRA, excepting the VAT (which was successfully introduced on July 1,
1998) and ASYCUDA which is provided for by existing donor support. With the exception of the VAT and ASYCUDA, TRA's
systems are manual.

Subcomponent C: Training:
TRA staff in all departments are in urgent need of technical, systems and management training. The Board has approved a training
strategy, a five year training program and a training plan for the first year of TAP. The training plans underpin the modernization and
improvement efforts documented in each department's PIP. TRA's recruitment policy is to appoint graduates and to provide short,
practical training within the country and whenever appropriate bring external resources to the country to ensure value for money from
international expertise. In addition to job related training, TRA will continue to support a limited number of staff towards the
completion of post-graduate qualifications and professional examinations.
Income Tax Department: The Income Tax Department has recently initiated a project to streamline and computerize the core
procedures. Basic computer training and training in the new processes will therefore be critical. In addition the department is seeking
to improve performance through selecting taxpayers for audit based on risk assessment, and Revenue Officers require further training
in detailed audit techniques, in particular in respect of computerized accounts and records. During the TAP period, a number of
officers will be trained in the administration of VAT in order to support the move to one stop revenue centers, initially at the district
level. (Similar cross training is provided for the plans for the other Revenue Departments). The Department has recognized the need
for some Revenue Officers to develop an in-depth knowledge of certain industries in order to administer the taxes effectively, and the
training plan envisages courses and attachments to achieve this aim.
Customs Department: The Customs department retrenched many staff during the establishment of TRA and after the probationary
period. As a result, there is a significant need for basic training in procedures as the department transfers and recruits staff to build the
necessary complement The Customs plan focuses on large number of staff attending in-country training. The TAP framework
envisages significant levels of technical assistance to the department and the consultant's terms of reference will include the design
and delivery of training. An example of this will be the implementation of Flexible Anti-Smuggling Teams.
A core component of the Customs department PIP is the implementation of the Customs computerized systems, and the roll out of
ASYCUDA. Training for all officers who use the new modules of the system will be critical. The PIP also sets out the plan for major
improvements to classification and valuation procedures which in tun will require all Customs Officers to undergo training
VAT Department: Officers in the VAT Department have received the necessary training for the implementation of the new tax under
the current EU training support. However, a major ongoing training program will be necessary to provide skills in control and
enforcement as such further fiancing will be necessary from TAP. The current VAT systems implementation focuses on the major
regions, and during the TAP period the department will need to provide the necessary training as the systems are rolled out to other
locations. The department is also responsible for the administration of a number of other taxes, and there will be a continuing need to
train staff.
Tax Audit and Investigations Department: A central Tax Audit and Investigations (TAI) Department was set up at the inception of
TRA. To date the department has received no training support, and all staff are in urgent need of traiing in tax fraud and
investigations, preparation and presentation of evidence for prosecution, and conducting the investigations effectively while treating
taxpayers with dignity and respect Many of the taxpayers use computerized system and TAI officers need training to access and
interpret computerized information. Some TAI staff will need to specialize in certain sectors in order to develop the necessary in-
depth knowledge to detect fraud and evasion. These training requirements will be coordinated with other departments which have
identified similar needs.
Information Technology Department: In order to support the implementation of the IS strategy, and to ensure that TRA is not reliant
on external consultants, the deparlment needs to train its staff in all the technologies and software which TRA will be using.
Information Technology is a rapidly changing field and it is important that there is sufficient training to keep staff up to date with
-developments. A particular challenge will be the implementation of a data/telecommunications network and a small number of staff
will receive training in this specialized field.
Human Resource and Finance Department: The needs of this department are diverse and fall broadly in the areas of finance(revenue)
and accounting, human resources and training, procurement and office services. Significant trafiing has already taken place to support
the implementation of the computerized expenditure accounting system. During the plan period training needs to continue to support
the roll-out to the regions. During the TAP period management will review and strengthen the staffimg of the accounting and revenue
function, and inevitably there will be a continuing need for training in accounts & revenue procedures and financial management in
general

Country: Tanzania                                                                      Project Title: Tax AdrrInistrton Project
The Human Resources Division has recruited a number of officers with HR expertise outside the civil service. TRA aims to be a
leading employer in Tanzania, and in order to achieve this there is a need to expose the HR officers to best practice approaches. In
order to ensure value for money the training plan envisages that external expertise will be brought to the country to provide the
training.
Key staff in the Procurement and Officer Services division have already received the necessary trafining to equip them for the
significant procurement tasks under TAP. The training plan recognizes the need for a small number of staff to receive similar traiing,
and also to strengthen the Store function.
Research and Policy Department: This department is currently benefiting from USAID funded training support. A similar program is
envisaged in the latter part of the TAP implementation to consolidate the department's capacity. A small number of staff will require
specialized training in research and corporate planning techniques.
Internal Audit Department: This department is a small, specialized unit, and staff have been recruited extemally to ensure the
necessary levels of competence. Nevertheless there is still a need to train the staff in the focus and requirements of internal audit, and
in particular the audit of computerized systems. Once again the plan for this departmient anticipates that external expertise will be
brought to the country so that the maximum number of staff can benefit from the training. In addition internal auditors will require
further training in tax administration so that they are better equipped to recommend improvements to procedures and systems.
Taxpayer Education DepartmLent: A recent survey of taxpayers illustrated the need for TRA to boost its education program, and to
train Revenue Officers so that they treat taxpayers with dignity and respect The Depiartment is crystallizing its plans to establish a
nation-wide taxpayer education network so tlat these issues are addressed effectively in all offices. The training plan therefore
envisages training for all staff involved which will also provide the vehicle for the design and implementation of a taxpayer education
program for TRA. The department will be responsible for an annual survey of taxpayer perceptions, and therefore staff will require
training in the design and analysis of surveys.
Legal Service Department: The Legal Services Department is a new department. Despite best efforts TRA has been unable to appoint
suitable external staff who would require mfinimal training. The Authority has therefore decided to appoint suitably qualified internal
candidates, and to provide them with training in the areas of litigation and court procedures to which they were not previously exposed
as tax administrators. Much of this training will be provided by external experts who will deliver training courses, followed by on the
job coaching.
Project Component 4 - Improved Administration Infrastructure, US$20.5 million
The TRA inherited a network of tax offices and customs facilities that are in need of major rehabilitation. Of the 26 regional offices,
21 are without water and electricity. The buildings also require substantial upgrading in terms of refurbishment to provide an effective
work environment (including the ability to instal and operate modemn technology) and improved facilities for taxpayers. Customs
border posts are without communications, secure offices or equipment of any kind. There is a need to construct a limited number of
additional buildings in areas where there are no facilities, and in particular, customs border stations.
Subcategory A: Procurement of Equipment:
The project will support the procurement of motor vehicles, office equipment and furniture, power generators, radio communications
and equipment, customs patrol boats and information technology equipment
Subeategory B: Improving Buildings/Infrastructure
The project will support (i) construction of a new regional office in Arusha; (ii) rehabilitation and modernization of Regional Offices
in Kilimanjaro, Mbeya, Morogoro, Mwanza, Tanga, Zanzibar and Pemba; (iii) refurbishment and modernization of Income Tax
Headquarters at Mapato House, Sales Tax Headquarters at Kipata House and Sales Tax Offices at Samora House; and (iv)
rehabilitation and modernization of selected border/transit stations at 25 locations around the country.
Subcategory C: Establishment of Central Library
The project will support the setting up of library at TRA headquarters

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
The fiscal impact of the project is estimated by projecting increases in the effective tax ratios arising from proposed tax
administrative measures. These reflect both the increased efficiency of the TRA to collect and audit, and the estimated impact
of the increases in the tax base. A projected scenario is available on file.

Financial Summary
Accounting responsibility:
TRA will be the executing agency for TAP under the supervision of a Steering Committee composed of heads ofthe major
departments and chaired by the Commissioner General. The Steering Committee will be supported by a Project Coordination Unit
within TRA which will be responsible for the project implementation, overall project planning, accounting, monitoring and reporting.
TAP will operate a Special Account with a reputable commercial bank and all TAP funding will be administered and controlled
through the TRA central accounting system. Project accounting and reporting will be integrated into the TRA accounting system
-under the Commissioner of Finance.
Overview of Financial Management System of TRA
Accounting System and Procedures: TRA has a comprehensive accounting system which captures all key activities of TRA
including donor funds. The expenditure accounting system is on an accrual basis while revenue accounting is on cash basis. The
charts of accounts for both expenditure and revenue accounting are available. The expenditure accounting manual is being updated in
order to accommodate the integrated computerized expenditure accounting system. Revenue accounting, which is done manually, is
not integrated into the expenditure computerized accounting system. The computerized revenue accounting system to be implemented
at a later stage will be able to interface with the current expenditure accounting modules in operation. Periodic accounting reports and
quarterly management reports are prepared and submitted to the TRA Board.
Computerized Accounting System: The Expenditure Accounting System is being implemeated as an Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMS) using Platinum SQL. The system is user friendly and has the following features: (i) ability to account
under aU comprehensive basis of accounting both cash, modified cash and accrual; (ii') data from one module can be linked together in
a database and changes in one application update information/data in other Platinum S QL applications automatically; (iii) the system
has capacity to track the actual data vs. budget, track and search by specific transactions, references; (iv) it has capacity to track report
on multiple projects, capacity to interface with government financial management sysiems and capacity to customize various reports;
and (v) it complies with year 2000 requirements. The computerization of the expendil.ure accounting phase one which cover the four
main cost center in Dar Es Salaam will be completed by March 1999. The second phase will cover computerization and training of the
remaining cost centers. The modules already in operation are the general ledger, cash imanagement, accounts payable and receivable,

Country: Tanzania                                                                   Project Tite: Tax Administration Project
purchase order, inventory management, multi-currency and Platinum publisher (report writer) modules, budget, fleet management,
procurement and fixed asset modules. The reports generated from the expenditure computerized accounting system have been
reviewed by a Bank team and found satisfactory.
System Backup and Maintenance Support and Security: The system has a adequate backup system and intemal security features
which prevent data loss and ensure integrity. Manuals for the individual modules and maintenance support is readily available.
Internal Controls: TRA has satisfactory standards and procedures stipulated in the staff regulation, financial regulation, accounting
and procurement manuals. The Internal Audit departnent is responsible to ensure that all stipulated procedures and systems are
adhered to. There is clear segregation of duties and responsibilities in both the expenditure and revenue sections. As the systems are
computerized, these manuals will be updated.
Fixed Assets: A computerized asset management module accounting for all fixed assets has been installed and details of individual
assets are currently being posted.
Staffing of Accounting and Finance Unit (Expenditure and Revenue) and responsibilities: Both Expenditure and Revenue units
are under the Commissioner for Finance and Human Resources and all activities under Expenditure and Revenue unit are supervised
by the Deputy Commissioners(expenditure and revenue) who are qualified (CPA) accountants. At each regional level there are senior
accountants who are qualified (CPA or Advanced Diploma in Accountancy). All the key positions in the accounting expenditure
section are filled with clear job description responsibilities and clear segregation of duties. There are a few authorized positions which
will be filled after the computerization of the accounting department is fully in operation. Training on the new computerized system is
ongoing.
TRA Audit Report: The audit of TRA under its Acts is to be carried out by the Office of the Controller and Auditor General. The
accounts are supposed to be submitted to the auditor within three months after the end ofthe TRA financial year. The first audit report
for financial year ending June 1997 was unqualified but there were a significant number of serious issues raised in the management
audit report The report together with the management letter was reviewed by the management and the Board, and replies submitted to
the auditors. Most of the recommendations have been implemented. The draft accounts for the financial year ending June 30, 1998
submitted to the auditors in September 1998 and the audit is outstanding.
TAP PPF accounts: Review of the Project Preparation Facility accounts including the special account was carried. The recording,
documentation and authorization of payments are adequate. The audit of the PPF accounts is in the final stage and is expected to be
completed shortly.
The Project Management Reports (PMRs): The Project Management Reports (PMRs) required by the Bank under LACI were
shared with TRA and were incorporated in the TAP Operational Manual. The terms of reference for the annual audit have also been
supplied and was also included in the TAP Operational Manual. Disbursement data from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) will be
used to run the LACI PMR reports.
Conclusion: On the basis of the above review, TRA does have satisfactory procedures for monitoring, approving, recording of
expenditure and qualify for PMR based disbursement.

Disbursement Arrangements
Quarterly PMR-based disbursement procedures using the Special Account facility will be adopted for the implementation of the
project; in cases were country/project circmstances warrant direct payment and/or special commitment procedures may be allowed as
may be agreed by Loan Department prior to negotiations and clearly specified in the Credit Agreement
Disbursements, representing mainly expenditures under short-term technical assistance, will be made over the project life.
The proceeds ofthe IDA credit would be disbursed against 90% of expenditures on adl local expenditures and 100% of expenditures on
all foreig    enditures; for civil works, consultants semvices and traming, and equinpent and vehicles. As projected by Bank's
standard disbursement profiles, disbursements would be completed by four months after project closure. Disbursements would be
made against standard IDA documentation.
Spedcal Account: In order to ensure timely provision of funds available to fimance tie costs of the project, a special account (SA) in
the amount equivalent to the first six months estmated expenditures will be established in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.
Funds in the special account would be available to finance only eligible expenditures, under the project Prior to Credit effectiveness,
the initial amount for six months estimated expenditure wil be deposited into this account Further deposits will be on a quarterly
basis as determined tbrough the LACI Project Management Reportmg System. All disbursement will be channeled tbrough SA and in
lieu of this, the borrower may choose to prefinance project expenditure and seek reimbursement from IDA.
Counterpart Funds: In order to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds, it is proposed that the Goverment establish a
project account at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, with an initial balance sufficient for the first quarter by Credit effectiveness.
The Government will replenish the Project Account at intervals of not less than 3 months, with sufficient funds to meet the
Government's share of expenditures under the project for the ensuing 3 months, and the funds would be applied only to this purpose.
During negotiations, agreement would be reached regarding the arangements for establishing and operating the special and project
accounts as well as an appropriate mechanism (such as revenue retention scheme) to ensure adequate counterpart funds.
