From 1992, Tanzania faced serious fiscal problems arising from the gap between stagnant
revenues and public expenditures swollen by large government expenditures. Despite the
establishment of the Tax Revenue Authority (TRA) in 1996, tax collection revenue remained
dismally low: in 1997/98, Tanzania’s tax revenue of 12.4 percent of GDP was among the lowest
in the region. Tax evasion was endemic as a result of institutional weaknesses in the TRA, poor
infrastructure, and antiquated business processes.




The IDA-financed Tax Administration Project was designed to raise tax revenues without
increasing tax rates by improving the tax collection capacity of the Tanzanian government. It
focused on efficiency improvements in the tax administration, improving the legal framework, and
broadening the tax base. IDA technical assistance formed the framework and strategic direction
for tax administration reforms, which would be the basis for harmonizing donor support in the
sector.




Annual revenue collected by the Tanzania Revenue Authority increased to US$1.7 billion
in 2005/06 from 1.1 billion in 2002/03. US$600 million per year--two and a half times the
total annual IDA disbursement in Tanzania--is now available on a sustainable basis for
poverty reduction efforts. This enabled Tanzania to increase its recurrent budget financing
to about 60 percent, leaving less than half to foreign aid.

IDA continues to support strengthening of the Tax Revenue Authority through a recent Tax
Modernization Project (TMP). Under the TMP, IDA’s support along with donor partners is
provided through a common framework using harmonized procedures consistent with the
country’s systems.
