The\n            Requestors claim that the proposed use of a mechanical\n            method of shredding water hyacinth and letting it sink to\n            the bottom of the Lake will result in ecological decay and\n            environmental degradation that, in turn, will adversely\n            affect communities living on the shores at the Nyanza Gulf.\n            These communities depend directly on the Lake for their\n            livelihoods, since the Gulf is home to fresh water fish and\n            the source of water for domestic use and these, and the\n            ecosystem, will be endangered by the resulting pollution.\n            Management feels that this is a misunderstanding in that the\n            proposed method is only a pilot project and is not a means\n            to solve the hyacinth problem. Measures are being taken to\n            insure more community involvement in the project and to\n            raise awareness of activities. The Panel feels that there\n            are conflicting issues and responses in the Request and the\n            Response and that an investigation would better enable a\n            conclusion.
