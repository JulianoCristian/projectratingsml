Lessons learned from the project: The\n            project provided rich experience and lessons derived from\n            successes and disappointments in implementation. As is\n            fitting for a project supporting acquisition of knowledge,\n            many of the lessons learned are technical in nature.\n            Interlinked national projects are vulnerable to failure of\n            one of the partners, and must build in peer review and\n            assistance, and safeguards in the event that these fail.\n            Scientific research must be targeted, provide usable\n            information for management decisions and be widely\n            accessible. Regional projects necessitate greater emphasis\n            on clarity of project objectives, monitorable frameworks, at\n            multiple levels, and adequate mechanisms for governance. The\n            Basin perspective is critical to address the key\n            environmental issues of Lake Victoria. Capacity Building has\n            to address both current and projected gaps. Implementation\n            in the future can be undertaken through governmental\n            structures. Environmental benefits must be strongly linked\n            to improved livelihoods for local people and communities.\n            Good education of the public and parliamentarians is\n            critical for long term sustainability and success."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
