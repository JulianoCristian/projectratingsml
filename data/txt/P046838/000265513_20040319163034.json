Over-fishing and oxygen depletion at lower\n            depths threaten fisheries and biodiversity. Algae blooms\n            have developed on the surface and water hyacinth have begun\n            to choke waterways and landings. The Lake Victoria\n            Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) planned to reverse\n            the deterioration of the aquatic resources and the\n            environmental conditions of the lake's ecosystem and\n            the maximize the sustainable benefits to the surrounding\n            communities. A Request was submitted by Resources Conflict\n            Institute (RECONCILE), a Kenyan non-governmental\n            organization, that the proposed use of a mechanical method\n            of shredding water hyacinth and letting it sink to the\n            bottom of the lake would result in ecological and\n            environmental degradation which, in turn, would adversely\n            affect communities living on the shores of Lake Victoria.\n            After evaluating the request and examining the claims, the\n            Panel determined that the water hyacinth was a major threat\n            to the livelihood of surrounding communities and that the\n            possible polluting affects of decaying shredded hyacinths\n            was convincing. The Panel finds that program of shredding\n            the water hyacinths has been beneficial to the majority of\n            inhabitants and finds that the Bank is in compliance with\n            their own regulations. Other findings note that alternatives\n            to the mechanical shredders were considered and that\n            although there is no clear path as to how the shredding\n            operations will continue there is no evidence to imply that\n            the shredding process will not be unsustainable in view of cost."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
