F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is the implementation of a sustainable revenue
collection system for Bulgaria through the establishment of an economically efficient
public revenue collection system that facilitates private sector development and complies
with requirements for EU accession. A complementary objective is to assist the



                                                   ii
government in preparing for the separation of central and municipal revenue collection
functions as an integral part of the institutional rationalization and modernization process.

  The project would achieve its developmental objective through a comprehensive
program of reforms focused on:

  1. maximizing community voluntary compliance,
  2. increasing effectiveness and efficiency,
  3. establishing a professional workforce, which will help reduce the opportunity and
motivation for corruption,
  4. improving equity and fairness in the administration of the tax and social contribution
collection system, and
  5. reducing the taxpayer/contributor compliance burden.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
In the course of transition to a market economy, and in reformulating the role of
government, the Republic of Bulgaria confronted mounting evidence that its revenue
collection administration needed a major institutional overhaul to enable it to mobilize
effectively and efficiently revenues, as well as to accede to the EU. This perceived need
for an overhaul applied in particular to the administration of direct and indirect taxes.
This perception was underscored by a joint IMF/Bank mission in 2000, an EU review
based on the EU blueprints carried out by the Intra-European Organization of Tax
Administrations (IOTA), and diagnostic studies on organization, human resources and
taxpayer compliance by the Canadian consultants SOGEMA, financed by CIDA. While
changes had been introduced into the tax administration, such as the introduction of
functional arrangements, a large taxpayer office, and new concepts incorporated in a Tax
Procedure Code in December 1999, the tax administration continued to be characterized
by: (i) a crisis approach to management, with continuous encroachment by headquarters
on the collection activities of the tax offices, resulting in loss of focus by management on
the development and implementation of strategic and future planning, direction, and
control of the organization; (ii) the lack of a credible human resource management
function or strategy. As a consequence the tax administration suffered from limited
workforce planning, poor recruitment, selection, and compensation arrangements, and an
inadequate focus on executive, manager and staff learning, development, and capacity-
building; (iii) an operational strategy that, while having some focus on self-assessment,
lacked the necessary supporting strategies or processes to service and support taxpayers.
Operations were based on outdated business processes with little in the way of cohesive
information technology support, and no credible compliance or risk assessment strategy
or function as support; (iv) a fragmented and dysfunctional national network of offices,
spans of control and layers of management, exacerbated by the need to collect both
national taxes and local taxes and charges; (v) inadequate internal controls, and claims of
taxpayer harassment and internal corruption; and (vi) inadequate information systems and
weak information technology management, systems development, and operational
capacity.
In October 1999 the Government of Bulgaria decided to establish a Unified Revenue
Agency (URA, later renamed NRA ­ National Revenue Agency) for the primary purpose
of modernizing its tax administration. An important part of the modernization effort was
the integration of the General Tax Directorate (GTD) and the collection function of the
National Social Security Institute (NSSI) for the purpose of simplifying tax and social
contribution administration. In so doing, the government realized that the initiative would
be highly challenging and not without some risk. On June 29, 2000, the Council of
Ministers approved a concept paper for a URA and launched the first stage of an
implementation plan. This included: starting joint audit operations, strengthening GTD
and NSSI, especially GTD's information technology systems; improving GTD and NSSI
coordination; and developing a detailed implementation strategy for the subsequent two
stages, including a realistic timetable and cost estimates. The IMF provided a full-time
advisor for 12 months, to October 2001, to assist the Government in this effort.


                                             1
The Government subsequently worked on the implementation plan for the reform.
Launch of the URA was planned for 2003. However, while a reasonable level of
achievement occurred, lack of support by some members of the previous government and
the former GTD executive, coupled with a lack of local experience in major project
development and management, slowed progress. Moreover, the Government could not
build on initial gains from joint activities, because of the lack of a legislative basis for
information-sharing between GTD and NSSI.
At the same time, pressure from the EU to ensure more efficient revenue collection in
order to meet accession standards was increasing. The 2002 progress report monitoring
reforms for EU accession noted that the reform of the Bulgarian tax administration had
made little progress and that tax discipline had scarcely improved. The 2003 progress
report reiterated that Bulgaria needed to improve the capacity of its tax administration
significantly to be able to apply the acquis communitaire in full.
The Government decided to embark on a new initiative for revenue administration
reform. In 2002, the Government passed a law establishing a new agency, the National
Revenue Agency, and asked the Bank to consider a revenue administration reform project
to be executed over six years.
The project was in accordance with the Bank's FY03-FY05 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Bulgaria, which focused on promoting competitive private sector led growth,
strengthening public administration and anti-corruption initiatives, and supporting the EU
accession process. A major part of the CAS structural reform program was directed
towards improving markets' functioning and efficiency, and the implementation of CAS
objectives hinged crucially on the capacity of the administration to sustain
macroeconomic stability. In the context of the CAS strategic objectives, the Revenue
Administration Reform Project was designed to: a) establish the necessary institutional
and regulatory base for sound fiscal performance and sustained macroeconomic stability
through consolidating the collection functions of the tax, social and health insurance
administrations into one agency (NRA); b) eliminate market malfunctions due to
distorted price signals reflecting non-compliance; c) strengthen governance capacity and
reduce corruption; and d) secure more room for further reductions of taxes and non-wage
labor cost through increasing compliance and collection rates.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project's main objective articulated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to
implement a sustainable revenue collection system for Bulgaria through the establishment
of an economically efficient public revenue collection system that facilitates private
sector development and complies with requirements for EU accession. A complementary
objective was the separation of central and municipal revenue collection functions as an
integral part of the institutional rationalization and modernization process.
The project sought to maximize the level of taxpayer voluntary compliance by: (a) further
developing the current system of self assessment and introducing risk management as a
key element of operations; (b) simplifying laws and procedures; (c) establishing a
comprehensive program of taxpayer/contributor education and services; (d)
reengineering, integrating and automating business processes; (e) instituting a
comprehensive compliance strategy and selective audits and investigations; (f) enhancing


                                             2
collection activities; and (g) transforming the thinking and behavior of NRA officials and
taxpayers to one of mutual trust and cooperation in the administration of, and
participation in, the tax and social benefit systems.
The project sought to promote effectiveness and efficiency by: (a) adopting a model for
strategic management as the basis to develop the role and capacity of NRA headquarters;
(b) creating a vision, values, and plans for reform and ongoing revenue administration
improvements; (c) establishing processes and structures for planning, accountability, and
corporate governance; (d) providing mechanisms for external transparency and
accountability, and for input from external stakeholders; (e) redeveloping functional
organizational arrangements, and restructuring and consolidating the national revenue
organization; (f) providing modern accommodations and environment for staff and
taxpayers; (g) perpetuating and continuing to sharpen the special focus on large taxpayers
and contributors; (h) separating and enabling a future transfer of responsibility for the
administration of local taxes and charges to local governments; (i) reengineering business
processes to increase efficiency, transparency, and accountability while reducing
opportunities for rent-seeking behavior; (j) introducing modern, integrated, information
technology business support; and (k) adopting the Bulstat (nationally assigned number)
as the common taxpayer identifier and introducing electronic interfaces with other
government agencies (e.g., Customs and State Receivables Agency).
The project sought to establish a professional workforce and approach by: (a) establishing
a comprehensive human resource management function and strategy; (b) establishing a
modern and relevant code of conduct and ethics; (c) increasing the professional capacity
of the executive, middle managers and key operational staff; (d) establishing a
comprehensive learning, development, and training capacity; and (e) developing the
internal control system to monitor integrity and organizational outcomes.
The project sought to reduce the potential for corruption by: (a) increasing the separation
between taxpayers and tax inspectors; (b) reengineering work procedures to reduce
discretion and opportunities for rent-seeking behavior; (c) simplifying and increasing
taxpayer understanding of tax laws and procedures; (d) carefully directing audit activities
to firms and individuals whose tax returns are questionable; (e) increasing community
participation through taxpayer associations, and (e) developing an internal control system
to monitor integrity and enforce the code of ethics.
The project sought to improve equity and fairness in the administration of the tax and
social contribution system by: (a) creating a modern Charter of Taxpayer and Contributor
Rights; (b) promoting community understanding of the system, laws, administrative
procedures, and rights and obligations; (c) promoting the development of private taxpayer
advisory services; (d) adopting uniform approaches and interpretations throughout the
country; and (e) ensuring that dispute resolution mechanisms are expedient and impartial.
The project sought to reduce the taxpayer compliance burden by: (a) harmonizing and
simplifying tax and social legislation and their respective codes; (b) developing,
simplifying, and integrating to the extent possible, tax and social contributor processes
and services; and (c) maximizing electronic interchange with taxpayers and contributors.
The project sought to indirectly foster economic growth by: (a) enabling a reduction of
tax rates through broadening the tax and social contribution base; (b) enabling a fairer


                                            3
private sector environment by increasing the overall level of compliance, and providing a
more uniform and equitable tax and social contribution system; (c) reducing compliance
costs through easier and more efficient declaration and payment of liabilities; and (d)
reducing taxpayer exposure to corruption and administrative abuse.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
The objectives of the project were not revised.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised
The main beneficiaries identified in the PAD and captured in the PDO, as well as other
target groups benefiting from successful project implementation include:


                                           4
a) Taxpayers: The project was expected to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers in a
variety of ways and to facilitate the interaction between taxpayers and the tax
administration, in particular through improved taxpayer services. Increased compliance
was expected to create the necessary preconditions for reducing tax rates and thus lower
the tax burden. Taxpayers' rights were expected to be strengthened through
improvements in laws and regulations, the preparation of a Charter of Taxpayers' Rights,
and a more effective appeals system. Improved accountability and measures to strengthen
integrity were expected to reduce the risk of harassment and corruption.
b) Businesses: Reduced tax rates and compliance burden were expected to increase the
attractiveness of Bulgaria as an investment location. It was also assumed to contribute to
facilitating the formalization of businesses operating in the underground economy.
Reduced competition from informal sector businesses was expected to enhance the
growth potential of formal sector enterprises. Improvements in tax laws and drafting of
clear implementation regulations and manuals were expected to improve the
predictability of tax liabilities. Businesses also were expected to benefit from quicker
processing of tax refunds and faster registration. Finally, a better targeted tax audit
program, focusing on high compliance risks, was expected to relieve compliant
businesses from the burden of being subjected to an audit.
c) The whole population of Bulgaria: Increased efficiency of social contributions
collection was expected to guarantee sustainable funding for the social security system
and permit the Government of Bulgaria to increase social benefits for the poorer part of
the population.
d) NRA and its staff: NRA was expected to benefit from modernized business processes
and investments in IT infrastructure and applications. Improved capacity to analyze
compliance risks and trends was supposed to facilitate effective compliance management.
Increased efficiency in collecting revenues was expected to put NRA in a better position
to meet collection targets set by the government. NRA staff was expected to benefit from
an improved work environment and a fairer and more efficient career management
system, rewarding good performance and motivation.
e) Other government agencies, in particular the Ministry of Finance and the NSSI: The
government was expected to benefit from more efficient revenue forecasting and
collection, leading in turn to more effective budget planning, budget execution, public
investment planning/programming, fiscal transfers, and delivery of public services. The
NSSI was expected to be able to concentrate better on its core task of administering
social benefits.

1.5 Original Components
The project consisted of six components, which were clearly linked to the PDO and key
indicators. These components were:
Component 1: Policy Support (US$ 1.50 million; 2.4%1)


1
 Figures reflect total costs (Bank and non-Bank financing). Bank financing was affected
by reallocation as needed and by shifting of the financing of some activities to grant


                                            5
This component financed technical assistance to build in-house analytical capacity to
conduct compliance and economic studies, analyze proposed bills, laws, policies and
regulations, review tax laws, improve the legislative and regulatory foundation of the
NRA, and address the policy and legislative aspects of the tax and social contributions
system. Purpose of the component was to seek a simple, supportive, and well-balanced
approach to the collection of direct and indirect taxes, including rates, thresholds,
discretions, and exemptions. This component also supported NRA's strategic and
operations planning as well as quality assurance. The component had three
subcomponents dealing with:

a) Policy analysis and evaluation: The subcomponent financed technical assistance and
office equipment to build the in-house capacity to evaluate proposed bills and policy
changes and recommend program alternatives to policy makers.
b) Legal framework: This subcomponent established a comprehensive legal system to
ensure compliance with tax and social contribution legislation taking into account
taxpayers/insurers/contributor rights and obligations, and, with respect to the issues
related to EC harmonization. It also created and strengthened a legal unit to identify
legislative gaps and prepare recommendations in the form of amendments to ensure the
operational feasibility of tax and social contribution legislation.
c) Strategic planning and quality control: This subcomponent financed activities to
prepare and annually improve NRA's strategic and operational plan. This plan defined all
activities necessary to accomplish the Strategic Planning objectives (specifying duration,
sequence, and resources). Activities, in turn, have clearly defined results and performance
indicators for gauging accomplishment, efficiency, and effectiveness, together with
explicit goals.
Component 2: Organization and Management (US$ 8.05 million; 12.9%)
This component developed strategic focus, created the management structure, built
executive and managerial capacity, strengthened human resource technical and
operational capacity, developed related management information systems, including
customization, and strengthened the integrity of the NRA. An integrated human resource
management system was installed, including modules for payroll, human resource
management, and performance evaluation. The component had two subcomponents
dealing with:

a) Organizational and management development: This subcomponent aimed at
developing an adequate organizational design for the implementation of the NRA and
improving the office infrastructure at headquarters and territorial offices. It also
supported the design and implementation of a Management Information System and
training related to organization and management.



sources, e.g. in case of a number of activities in the area of human resource management
supported by the Know-How Fund.



                                            6
b) Human resources and training: This subcomponent provided the basis for modern
Human Resource Management (HRM) and training systems. Areas included recruitment,
selection, and hiring procedures, compensation policies and practices, performance
incentive systems, workforce strategic planning, management development, and support
for training centers, curricular development to meet short and long term needs, and
training infrastructure for training centers. NRA HRM policies and procedures manuals
were developed and standardized and a Code of Ethics and Conduct prepared and
disseminated to all staff. The subcomponent also aimed at strengthening employee
retention by developing career streams to match the needs of the NRA.
Component 3: Increasing Operational Efficiency (US$18.80 million; 30%)
The Government's decision to create a new agency to be responsible for both social
contributions and tax collections required the definition of new combined and
streamlined business processes as well as business requirements, the design and
implementation of new information systems to support the core business functions. This
included the integration of tax and social contribution collection, the acquisition and
installation of new computer and network equipment, and the creation of a department for
system and technology support. This component has four subcomponents:
a) Business processes: The objective of this subcomponent was to introduce integrated
business processes to support the redesigned business operations of the NRA. The project
supported NRA with technical assistance to: (i) establish a Business Development Office
for the coordination of redesign activities, technical assistance, and training; (ii) review
and document NSSI's existing business processes and review and update GDT's business
processes; (iii) define NRA's uniform business processes based on the previous
activities' results and develop and implement new business processes countrywide; and
(iv) improve specific operational processes.
b) Application software: The objective of this subcomponent was to support the
businesses processes through the appropriate application systems. In addition to the
central operational database, a data warehouse for studies and decision-making
information was established.
c) Information technology infrastructure and implementation: The subcomponent
supported the development of technical specifications, procurement, and installation of
computer and networking equipment, including central and regional equipment, internet
gateway servers, and systems software (including business software and development
tools), and a number of portables for audit work.
d) Organization of information and communication technology department: The
subcomponent supported the creation of an Information and Communication Technology
Department for systems development and technology support, initially to carry out
subcomponents b and c, to support the systems and technology once in place, and to
provide end user support in the future.
Component 4: Outreach and Participation (US$1.70 million; 2.7%)
The process of creating the NRA included shifting the institutional culture towards
engaging with the citizen and noncitizen taxpayers and contributors as stakeholders and
clients of the NRA. The project financed technical assistance and equipment to improve



                                             7
client participation and education, improve assistance and introduce a service orientation,
as well as lower the cost of compliance through uniform approaches, simplified
tax/contribution procedures and payments, and improved appeals mechanisms. The
component had two subcomponents:
a) Taxpayer services: This subcomponent aimed to increase the transparency and
accountability of NRA and to provide assistance to taxpayers and contributors to fulfill
their legal obligations. Activities included the establishment of a Community
Participation and Services Department, the design and promotion of a Taxpayer and
Contributor Charter of Rights, the provision of services through the internet, the
provision of personal and remote assistance, the development of a management and
quality control system and of a permanent taxpayer time and cost-monitoring system, the
establishment of a call center, the design and development of an automated complaints
and suggestion monitoring system, the definition of client service standards, the
promotion of private taxpayer advisory services, and the development of mechanisms for
transparency and accountability.
b) Communication and public relations: This subcomponent promoted community
understanding of the system, laws, administrative procedures, and rights and obligations
of the clients through a comprehensive program of taxpayer/contributor education, as
well as an internal communications campaign, including the establishment and
strengthening of the Public Relations Department in the NRA, the strengthening of
internal and external communications, and the development of mechanisms for
transparency and accountability.
Component 5: Office Upgrading (US$30.80 million; 49.1%)
The objective of this component was to establish an adequate working environment for
the NRA through the rehabilitation and renovation of buildings and workspaces at HQ
and in the Territorial Directorates in Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, and the Large
Taxpayer Directorate. These Directorates together represent 91% of revenue collection.
The component envisaged providing modern facilities for staff and
taxpayers/contributors, with offices linked through information networks, in order to
enhance the efficiency of NRA.
Component 6: Project Management (US$1.80 million; 2.9%)
The component consisted of two subcomponents:
a) Project coordination unit: This subcomponent aimed at establishing the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) for the RARP, including recruiting the project manager and
advisors, in order to ensure financial management and procurement integrity to meet
World Bank Guidelines and international standards of accountability and transparency.
Project audits also were carried out within this sub-component. The PCU office was
trained and provided with the critical skills of project management, procurement, and
disbursement.
b) Change management: The Change Management sub-component was intended to
ensure that all changes that take place to form the new NRA are based on common
understanding of the purposes of the changes. Moreover, the changes would be carried
out using established change management approaches that seek to build commitment of


                                            8
all staff in the change process. Staffing of the Change Management Unit was expected to
include a highly experienced revenue administration expert, a change planning expert
establishing the Unit, and a change management specialist experienced in the field.
Change management software was purchased to assist in the management of change
throughout the project life cycle, which can be used subsequently by the NRA planning
and management team. Training was provided in principles and practices of change
management, including attendance at conferences and study tours.

1.6 Revised Components
The components of the project were not revised.


1.7 Other Significant Changes
The major change in the scope of the project relates to the implementation of project
component five (Office upgrading). The architectural design for the NRA headquarters
building in Sofia was developed and financed from the Loan. It was originally planned
that the civil works contract for the rehabilitation of the building would be procured
through International Competitive Bidding and financed partly with loan funds (Euro 6.5
million). Due to high inflation of construction costs in the country, a repeat of the pre-
qualification procedure was held in 2005 as cost of the building more than tripled
compared to the estimate at time of appraisal. This required a much higher contribution
from the Government budget. Despite optimization of architectural design and bill of
quantities, the actual bids exceeded the allocated budget by more than 70%. The
Management Board of the NRA, headed by the Minister of Finance, took a decision to
repeat the bidding procedure, cancel the unused loan funds (EUR6.7 million, including
civil works and related activities), and finance the building with state funds only. The
Bank has been reassured that the Government is committed to the consolidation of NRA
activities in Sofia and a new procedure will be initiated with the contract financed
entirely by the state budget. The new Government is searching for a new solution to the
consolidation of NRA activities in Sofia in view of the substantial fiscal tightening taking
place in response to the economic recession in the country.
Project component 3 (Increasing operational efficiency) envisaged the design of a
comprehensive Revenue Management System (RMS) as the main information system of
NRA, providing the functionalities required by the Agency to collect taxes and social
security contributions. While the core functionalities of the RMS required by the NRA
were developed under the contract, the development of some more sophisticated
applications such as audit selection, enforcement management, and non-filers control,
was cancelled by mutual agreement in March 2009 because the contractor was unable to
present a final detailed implementation plan for the functionality, and it became
impossible to have such a functionality developed before project closing. To ensure full
IT support for its new business processes, the NRA needs to put in place the remaining
functionalities of the RMS as quickly as possible to maintain the momentum towards
increased efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency.
No formal restructuring has been done of the project. In January 2006, a reallocation of
proceeds from consultants' category of around 5.6% of original loan amount was



                                             9
approved to cover the shortfall on the goods category for costs of software licenses under
ongoing contract.

The project implementation schedule was changed due to delays in loan effectiveness. As
the project became effective only on August 7, 2003, eight month later than the
originally planned, efforts were made to make up for the delay. The procurement and
implementation of project activities was accelerated in years one and two of the project.
Project implementation was extremely efficient. At the time of the mid-term review in
June 2006, most planned project activities were either completed or under execution, with
only three new activities envisaged for the remaining two and a half years of the project.
The project benefited from government commitment and unwavering support and
determination from all ministers of finance involved.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation built on extensive assistance for the development of the reform
strategy provided by the IMF, with a resident IMF expert in place from October 2001
providing full time assistance to the URA project preparation team. The project also built
on previous Bank work in Bulgaria. Since 1996, the Bank had been engaged in a project
to improve the performance of the NSSI, which included strengthening the collection of
social security contributions. This project developed and implemented a modern payroll
tax collection system and audit strategy capable of managing the unified administration
of collection of contributions in the social sector. The collection of contributions and the
collection of information about persons insured for the various social insurance risks was
automated, and a central register was established, including information on all NSSI
clients. The modern audit system installed under the project enabled a complete redesign
of the previous inefficient manual audit selection processes and the development of risk
profiles enabling auditors to target the employers most likely to be in violation of
compliance. The RARP was expected to incorporate concepts and outcomes of the NSSI
project.
The project was designed with clearly defined objectives linked to specific, measurable,
and ambitious indicators. Project design reflected lessons learned from Bank revenue
administration reform projects in ECA and other regions. It also incorporated lessons
from other countries which have integrated the collection of tax and social contributions.
Specific lessons reflected in the project design included:
(i) The need for clear evidence of sustained political commitment and support for the
reform. Government commitment to support the reform process was demonstrated
throughout the project preparation stage and visualized in particular with the
preparation of the NRA law in 2002.
(ii) The administration and project has competent, committed, and dynamic leadership. A
competent reform team had been established which provided excellent support, so that
project preparation could be accelerated. Senior NRA management actively supported
the reform process.
(iii)There is a clear vision of the organization's future state, supported by government,
and there are well-articulated strategies and comprehensive plans to realize this vision.


                                            10
Role and status of the NRA had been outlined in the Government's reform strategy
approved by the Council of Ministers in June 2000 and specified in the NRA law. A
detailed reform strategy was developed with IMF assistance and documented in the tax
administration strategic plan 2004-2008.
(iv) Arrangements are put in place to develop executive, middle management, and
institutional capacities. Management responsibilities were streamlined with the
reorganization of the revenue administration, and project design included an extensive
training program for NRA management and expert staff.
(v) An appropriate legislative basis has been established to support the reform proposals,
or has been modified accordingly to do so. The law establishing a unified revenue agency
had already been passed by Parliament in 2002. Implementation of the reforms required
in addition the adoption of a tax and social security procedural code, which was passed
in 2005.
(vi) All elements of the reform are addressed in an integrated way, including participation
of and relationship with external stakeholders, such as other agencies, and professional
and community associations. External stakeholders have been extensively involved in
project preparation and in the steering arrangements for the modernization process.

2.2 Implementation
The ratings of project performance reflected in Implementation Status and Results reports
(ISRs) demonstrate a consistently successful implementation of the RARP. Overall
implementation progress was rated `satisfactory' from the beginning of project
implementation to 2005 and changed to `highly satisfactory' from 2005 to 2007 and
`satisfactory' thereafter. The rating reflected the high quality of the implementation
progress for the areas of the project which had already reached the operational stage.
Implementation progress by project component was rated `highly satisfactory' for all
components in all ISRs since 2006 except for the office upgrading component.
Project implementation benefited from strong commitment to achieving the project
development objectives by all key stakeholders, in particular the Ministry of Finance, the
NRA, the GTD, and the NSSI. Strong support for project implementation was also
provided by all donors offering technical assistance in the area of revenue administration
reform in Bulgaria, in particular the Government of Japan, the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, UK DFID, US Treasury, and the IMF. Important examples are the IMF
assistance for modernizing the legal framework for revenue administration, and the EU
PHARE support for the establishment of an NRA call center. The Bank team actively
pursued an ongoing dialogue and information exchange with other donor agencies, and
excellent donor coordination contributed significantly to the quick and smooth progress
in project implementation.
An efficient PCU contributed substantially to successful project implementation, and the
change management approaches established were highly efficient. In 2003 a special
Strategic Planning and Change Management Department was established. Thus the
outcome of the change management subcomponent of the project was its full
institutionalization with the strategic planning unit. This exemplifies international best
practice and was the main reason why the transition process occurred smoothly, as
overlapping teams were created and strategic plans developed and followed according to
a mutually agreed blueprint.


                                            11
A major milestone in project implementation was the establishment of the NRA, which
started operating from January 2006. The timely launch of NRA activities was put at risk
due to delays in finalizing the legal framework for NRA operations. The Tax and Social
Security Procedural Code finally was adopted by Parliament on December 21, 2005,
which made it possible to start NRA operations on January 3, 2006.
Mid-term review: The mid-term review of the project took place in June 2006. The
review concluded that the development objective of the project to a large extent had
already been achieved. In particular the collection of taxes and social contributions had
been merged, central and municipal revenue collection functions had been separated, the
structure and operational strategy of the revenue administration had been modernized
with an appropriate focus on ensuring a high level of voluntary tax compliance and
providing high quality services to taxpayers. Tax revenue collection had increased by 4.1
points of GDP between 2002 and 2005, and the efficiency of operations had increased
through streamlining of the office network and revenue administration workforce. The
only pending issue highlighted was the finalization of the arrangements for the start of the
NRA Sofia building renovation. In addition, the mid-term review noted that the
implementation of the new Revenue Management System (RMS) on January 1, 2007
would be crucial for NRA to achieve the next step of improvements in efficiency and
effectiveness. However, both activities were not implemented as originally planned.
Rehabilitation of the NRA Administrative Building: As an exception to all other project
activities, procurement procedure for the rehabilitation of the NRA administrative
building in Sofia became politicized and took much longer than expected, resulting in
substantial increases in civil works costs leading to a repeat of the pre-qualification
procedure and bids exceeding the allocated budget by more than 70%. The Management
Board of NRA, headed by the Minister of Finance, decided to cancel the bidding
procedure under Bank guidelines, cancel the unused loan funds, and finance the building
renovation with state funds only. As a result, this is the only planned project activity that
was not executed.
Revenue Management System: It became clear in mid-2006 that the contractor in charge
of developing the RMS would not be able to deliver the full integrated product by end
2006. It was therefore decided to break down deliverables into two phases, with the
second phase scheduled for the end of 2007. Later in 2006, it became clear that even
phase one had become risky as initial acceptance procedures had pointed to serious
problems with the delivered modules of the RMS. A pilot for modules developed under
phase one started in November 2006 and was completed in December 2006 just in time
for deployment of the core system as of January 2007. The full implementation of all
RMS phase one modules was only completed in 2008, which included all core
functionality required for revenue management. The remaining modules of the RMS will
now be implemented by NRA outside the scope of the RARP.
Project risks: The number of critical risks identified and listed in the PAD is small
compared to other revenue administration reform projects. Project implementation shows
that risk mitigation measures generally have been identified correctly and implemented
properly. The key critical risks and risk mitigation measures were: (i) the risk that the
MOF would retain a level of control over the NRA impeding the required level of
administrative and financial independence needed to implement and sustain the reform


                                             12
was mitigated by soliciting a Letter of Commitment signed by the Minister of Finance
and confirming the commitment of the Government to provide the NRA with sufficient
authority to manage its budget, human, and IT resources. An NRA Management Board
was established acting as the Project Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the
Minister of Finance and consisting of high level and balanced representation of all
stakeholders affected by the implementation of the NRA, including the NSSI and the
NHIF (ii) the risk that the implementation of the NRA would not proceed smoothly
because of institutional incompatibilities and a lack of political will was mitigated by a
highly efficient change management program and early and full involvement of all
stakeholders in the reform process guaranteeing full support for the reform process, in
particular from the MOF and the NSSI; (iii) the risk that internal/external "losers" in the
modernization process would impede progress toward modernization and full functioning
of the NRA was mitigated by managing staff redundancies in a transparent and fair way
and implementing an active outreach communication strategy which contributed to
ensuring a high level stakeholder support for the reform process.

 2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
A detailed results framework was developed during appraisal. The indicators identified
generally proved relevant in monitoring progress during implementation and evaluating
overall performance towards achieving project development objectives. A comprehensive
set of realistic, measurable indicators were clearly linked to project components.
Modification and replacement of indicators during project implementation was kept at a
minimum; however a small number of indicators had to be revised as either monitoring
progress towards achieving the indicator targets proved excessively difficult, or the
relevance of the indicator had declined. Nevertheless, the key PDO indicators remained
unchanged. A revised set of performance indicators was discussed and agreed with the
Bank in July 2008. The revisions aimed at streamlining the number of indicators from
over 150 indicators to a more manageable and meaningful set of indicators reflecting the
changed institutional environment and availability of data, particularly because of policy
changes that affected the ability of the NRA to capture the data, namely: divestiture of the
responsibility for collection of local taxes to local governments; and transfer of the
responsibility for collection of excise taxes to Customs. With the start of NRA operation
in 2006, some of the indicators that were monitored separately for taxes and social
contributions had to be shown on an aggregate basis to reflect the integrated collection of
taxes and social contributions. At the same time, some other indicators ­ mainly based on
surveys of taxpayers and NRA staff ­ were further detailed to better illustrate the
different aspects of perceptions of level of professionalism and integrity of NRA staff.
The monitoring of a third set of indicators was agreed to be discontinued due to the
unavailability of data. Such indicators pertain to performance against agreed standards for
responding to taxpayers' inquiries and the time it takes to identify and notify non-filers
and non-payers. With the introduction of the NRA Call Center the response time was
expected to improve significantly. The information for these indicators was based only on
legal requirements while the existing state of the RMS did not permit gathering
information on actual performance.
A Policy Analysis and Support department was established at NRA headquarters in 2003,
which assumed responsibility for monitoring and updating the results framework.


                                            13
Updates of indicators were prepared regularly and in a timely manner for use in project
supervision.
An important result of the project is that major parts of the results framework have been
institutionalized and are now used for monitoring the performance and developing the
annual plans of the NRA. This is a major change in revenue administration planning and
performance evaluation, as the success and performance of the NRA is no longer based
exclusively on collection results and meeting revenue targets, but on a broad set of
performance indicators including meeting service standards, improving integrity, and
reducing taxpayer compliance costs. Feedback surveys from taxpayers and NRA staff
have been introduced by the project and will continue to be conducted on a regular basis
after project closure.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
The Project triggered no safeguard polices. The project included rehabilitation of tax
office buildings in Varna and Sofia (financed with Loan proceeds) and in more than other
10 locations financed entirely from state budget funds. Rehabilitation of offices was
carried out in compliance with the Bulgarian environmental standards, which have been
aligned with those of the EU. National standards do not require environmental
assessment for rehabilitation works.

There were no fiduciary compliance issues. The project's financial management
arrangements were highly satisfactory considering the very good internal control
procedures in place, disbursement, staffing, reporting and auditing arrangements. The
PCU employed a financial specialist responsible for all financial management, who had
the appropriate skills and abilities to manage the project's financial management and
disbursement issues. All records under the project were kept under a specialized project
management software (PAIS), which was developed and customized by a Bulgarian
company. Quarterly unaudited financial monitoring reports were generated by the PAIS
automatically. The PCU had adequate internal controls for the project, including regular
reconciliation of bank accounts, adequate segregation of duties, and performed monthly
reconciliation of the Bank's disbursement summaries with project accounting records.
The PCU used a comprehensive set of accounting policies and internal control procedures
in accordance with the Bulgarian legislation and the project financial management
manual. The counterpart financing received from the Government has been satisfactory
during the project life.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The key outcome of the project was the establishment of NRA as a modern, client-
oriented revenue collection agency with responsibility for the collection of both national
taxes and social contributions. Strategic management and planning processes have been
introduced at all levels, and NRA is now implementing its second corporate plan (2008 ­
2013). The project supported the development of the plan and the initial phase of its
implementation. NRA is now planning to continue implementing the plan and pursue
initiatives to further increase operational efficiency and reduce the taxpayer compliance
burden. A key element of the next stage of the reform process will be the finalization and


                                           14
full roll-out of the remaining RMS modules. A number of functionalities still need to be
developed with priority, in particular the automatic selection of taxpayers for audit.
The NRA Strategic Plan 2008 ­ 2013 builds on the accomplishments of the RARP and
aims at ensuring the sustainability of project benefits. In addition, NRA benefits from
technical assistance provided by the IMF as needed in order to further advance its reform
process. Major next steps identified by the IMF in a May 2009 technical assistance report
are the strengthening of the Large Taxpayers and Social Security Contributors
Directorate (LTSSCD), improving the risk-based compliance management approach, and
further consolidation of the office network. Attesting to the institutional capacity for
strategic planning and managing change, NRA management has already announced its
decision to pursue these recommendations and plans to increase the coverage of the
LTSSCD to collect at least 60-70% of total domestic revenues, and to further consolidate
the 29 territorial Tax Directorates into 5 Directorates and one LTSSCD. Further reforms
are also envisaged in the HR management area with further staff reductions and the
introduction of a more transparent pay structure. Already during implementation of the
RARP the NRA staffing level has been reduced from 9,975 in 2004 to 7,542 in 2008,
mainly as a result of the transfer of tax administration staff to municipalities and transfer
of staff to the Customs Agency. Further staff reduction will be possible due to continuing
office consolidation and computerization of business processes. There are clear
indications that the NRA has established a solid capacity for continuous improvement
that will serve it well in adapting to ever evolving market challenges. On the
organizational side, the establishment of the Strategic Planning and Change Management
Department as a core department in the NRA headquarters structure ensures that the
planning, change management and reform monitoring capacity introduced by the project
will be maintained to further steer the modernization process.
Performance indicators and the performance monitoring system introduced by the project
have been incorporated into NRA's own strategic planning and performance monitoring
process. Many indicators have been broken down by regions to provide headquarters
management with the ability to compare the performance across offices; and to give
office managers the ability to prepare their own strategic plans considering the
performance of peers. Exchange of successful approaches to collection is stimulated and
apparently are supported by headquarters. This is also true for client and staff perception
surveys, so that it can be expected that the regular collection and analysis of feedback
from taxpayers and NRA staff introduced by the project will continue.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives of the RARP continue to be highly relevant in the context of the Bulgarian
economy. Improvements in voluntary tax compliance and increased efficiency in revenue
collection created the basis for Bulgaria to reduce its tax and social contribution rates in
order to ensure competitiveness as an investment location in the region, which was the
main priority in the government's National Strategic Reference Framework 2007 - 2013.
It also allowed the Government of Bulgaria to address the problem of the size of the
informal economy, which was estimated at over 30% of GDP before EU accession and
which constituted one of the main constraints to investment and growth in Bulgaria.


                                             15
Lower tax and social security rates and increased control intensity introduced by the
Bulgarian government since 2003 in combination with continued credit and FDI-based
economic growth have reduced the share of the informal economy by some 30% between
2002 and 2008. A more efficient revenue collection system has allowed Bulgaria to better
absorb the impact of the global economic crisis on the state budget, and collection results
as a percentage of GDP remained well above the 2005 and 2006 levels (22.2% and 20.7%
respectively) in 2008 with total revenues collected amounting to 23.8% of GDP. The
RARP now serves as a model for further reforms in the revenue collection system, in
particular with regard to the modernization of customs administration. The RARP also
has become a model for similar reform efforts in other countries in the ECA region and
beyond.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objectives were fully met by the close of the project, and results
achieved substantially exceeded expectations in most areas as shown by select indicators
out of close to 150 indicators that were tracked during the lifetime of the project.

Total tax and social contribution revenues more than doubled between 2002 and 2008
and exceeded the target by 40%. VAT revenues almost tripled in six years with tax rate
kept unchanged, while CIT and PIT revenues were in 2008 close to double their levels in
2002 despite significant reductions in tax rates. All of these revenues exceeded the target
by 67% for the VAT, 151% for the CIT, and 37% for PIT. Only social contributions
revenues were 6% below the target reflecting substantial cut in rates (by 9.2 percentage
points between 2002 and 2008) and introduction of social insurance thresholds by
profession and by branch. The share of grey economy declined from an estimated 35% in
2002 to 20% by 2007.

economy, %

The aggregate voluntary compliance rate with tax and social contributions payment
obligations increased by 11 percentage points from 74.3% in 2002 to 85.7% in 2008 and
VAT compliance of 92% now is at the level of advanced EU member countries. The
compliance targets for personal income tax (PIT) and social contributions have only been
marginally missed; however visible improvements have also been realized in ensuring the



                                            16
payment of these taxes. Social contributions and PIT compliance increased from 80.0%
in 2002 to 87.0% in 2008, which is 1 percentage point below the target of 88%.

Major achievements have been made in increasing administrative effectiveness and
efficiency. The successful transfer of local tax collection to local governments allowed a
consolidation of the number of field offices from 340 to 29 (a further consolidation
reducing the number of full-fledged regional offices to only 5-6 is now envisaged as the
next step in the reform process). The start of NRA operations led to significant economy
of scale. Revenues collected per staff member more than tripled in 2008 compared to
2004 (BGN2,277 thousand in 2008 compared with BGN982.9 thousand in 2004).
Administering tax and social contribution collection is currently being done with only
75% of staff that used to collect taxes only with cost of revenue collection declining from
1.4% of revenues in 2002 to 0.8% in 2008.

Progress has been slower in implementing the move to an e-tax system, as more
taxpayers need to be convinced to file their tax returns electronically. Taxpayer and staff
perception surveys reveal some progress regarding the establishment of a professional
workforce, and the overall satisfaction of taxpayers and contributors with the level of
professionalism and integrity of NRA has improved in all taxpayer/contributors groups.
Improvements have also been achieved with regard to public perception of the overall
quality of taxpayer/contributor services; however, not all taxpayer segments benefit
equally from quality enhancements achieved, and large taxpayers/contributors seem
markedly more satisfied with service quality than small businesses and individuals (see
annex 5 for more details). New policies for recruitment, selection, hiring, promotion and
career development of NRA staff, which are in line with international good practice, have
been introduced, and a targeted training strategy has been developed. Regular staff
rotation has been introduced in areas with a particularly high corruption risk, such as tax
audit. Computer-based random selection of auditors is implemented countrywide to
reduce opportunities for corruption. Soundness of NRA decisions, an indicator for
increased professionalism, has been reflected in the marked decrease in percentage of
cases lost in court (13.7% in 2008 as compared with 24% in 2005).

Equity and fairness of the tax system have been increased in particular through the
broadening of the tax net and the reduction of tax evasion by businesses operating in the
informal economy. Revenue gains made possible consistent reduction of the tax burden
and social contribution rates to one of the lowest in the EU. The consistency of the
application of tax laws has been improved as a result of preparing clear guidelines for tax
inspectors and computerizing business processes and making available database of the
appeals results reflecting the corporate interpretation of tax laws, rules and regulations.
Satisfaction rates with administrative improvements have improved for all taxpayer
segments (See Annex 5)--mostly for large taxpayers and contributors for which special
service is provided but also for small business and individuals.
Results from taxpayer surveys (see Annex 5) point to perceived progress in reducing
compliance burden, although a precise measurement of compliance costs has not been
made. A number of reforms have contributed to reducing the time and cost of
compliance. In particular, use of third party information reduced the reporting



                                            17
requirements for taxpayers and reduced the number of visits to tax offices. The
introduction of e-filing and the establishment of the Call Center reduced the necessity for
physical visits to tax offices and eliminated queue time. Simplified income tax
declarations were introduced in 2008 reducing the reporting requirements for taxpayers
by cutting almost by half the number of pages of the declaration. The number of tax
payments has been reduced from 27 in 2005/06 to 17 in 2006/07. Nevertheless, the
"Doing Business ­ Paying Taxes" analysis still rates Bulgaria as a country requiring a
comparatively high compliance time. With a total of 616 hours (40 hours for CIT, 288
hours for labor taxes, and 288 hours for VAT) Bulgaria has one of the highest compliance
time indicators in Europe (average compliance time according to Doing Business 2010 is
194.1 hours for OECD countries, and 336.3 hours for countries in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia). Additional efforts will therefore be required in order to achieve a
noticeable improvement in reducing the taxpayer compliance burden. For example, tax
returns of taxpayers who do not have electronic signature, can prepare their tax return
electronically but need to send a printout to the NRA, which does not fully exploit the
cost savings potential of e-filing.

Finally, the expected improvements in the tax environment for fostering economic growth
have been achieved. Tax rates have been reduced for direct taxes and for social
contributions, the overall level of tax compliance has increased, and the transparency of
the tax system has improved. This supported a steady economic growth of close to 6%
per year between 2002 and 2008 and in 2007 Bulgaria joined the EU. Unemployment
was reduced to record low levels while sizable FDI inflows supported strong investment
growth following a decade of under-investment. Revenue over performance was saved
and fiscal accounts were in surplus of close to 3% of GDP between 2004 and 2008.

3.3 Efficiency
The project contributed to achieving efficiency gains in several areas:
Reduction in the tax burden: The Government was strongly committed to encouraging
investment and employment creation by reducing direct taxation and applying exemption
and depreciation incentives. In this context, fiscal balance depended increasingly on the
capacity of the revenue administration to improve collection and compliance rates. The
tax burden for both businesses and individuals was lowered several times during project
implementation. As a result of these reforms, Bulgaria was listed as one of the top
reformers in the tax area in the Doing Business 2008 report. According to report, the total
tax rate as a percentage of business profits has been reduced from 36.7% (Doing Business
2008) to 31.4% (Doing Business 2010).

Contribution

Increased efficiency of revenue collection by NRA ensured that the impact of rate
reductions on actual revenue collection was curtailed. Net revenues collected by GTD
and NSSI (and from 2006 by NRA) increased from BGN9.78 billion in 2002 to BGN21.1
billion in 2008.
Reduction of informality. Improvements in revenue compliance management was one of
the core elements of the Government's strategy to reduce the size of the informal
economy. The introduction of more efficient risk analysis and collection systems in NRA
has substantially improved tax compliance rates. The aggregate compliance rate
increased from 74.3% in 2002 to 85.7% in 2008, while estimated share of informal
economy declined from 35% in 2002 to 20% by 2007. The combination of a reduction in
the tax burden, simplified compliance procedures, and increased efficiency in detecting
non-compliance has improved incentives for business and labor formalization.
Reduction of compliance costs. No clear estimates can be made about the reduction in
compliance costs achieved. The introduction of e-filing, particularly for VAT, has
significantly reduced the need for physical visits at tax offices. Tax forms have been
simplified and implementation of new taxpayer service programs, such as the operation
of an NRA call center, has facilitated access to information. However, irrespective of
these improvements, the Doing Business 2010 report assumes that the total time required
for compliance with the tax system remained unchanged at a high level of 616 hours per
year.
Reduction of administrative costs. Costs of revenue collection have been reduced from
1.4% (for the tax administration only) in 2002 to 0.83% for NRA in 2008. With such an
efficiency ratio Bulgaria has reached the level of advanced OECD countries. The increase
in collection efficiency can be translated into cost savings amounting to BGN56.2 million
or EUR28.7 million in the first year of NRA operation. Total project costs of EUR42.3
million thus were compensated for in the second year of NRA operation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory.

Project development objectives have been achieved and exceeded. A modern, integrated
revenue collection system has been put in place, which has considerably increased the
efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection. The project has increased the level of
voluntary compliance and created the necessary preconditions for a substantial reduction
in the tax burden for citizens and businesses. In particular:
   ·   Total tax and social contributions revenues have increased by 5.0 percentage
       points of GDP between 2002 and 2008 to 31.6% of GDP, the highest revenue gain
       achieved during this period compared to all other EU10 countries (Figure 1) while
       tax rates in Bulgaria have been reduced to one of the lowest levels in the EU
       (Figure 2). Total tax and social contribution revenues exceed the target value
       (measured in million BGN) by 40%.
   ·   VAT revenues as a percentage of GDP increased by 3.0 percentage points
       between 2002 and 2008 and now account for close to 12% of GDP, which is the
       highest within the EU.
   ·   Municipal revenues increased from 0.8% of GDP in 2004 when the transfer of
       revenue collection to municipalities started to 1% of GDP by 2008.
   ·   Compliance rates have improved for all tax types, supporting an improved level
       playing field for firms. VAT compliance with 92% in 2008 (an increase of 15
       percentage points compared to the 2002 level) exceeded the target under the
       project (83%) and is comparable to best performing countries in the EU.
       Corporate income tax compliance rate increased from 55% in 2002 to 68.2% in
       2008 and exceeded the target by 5 percentage points. Compliance rates for
       personal income tax and social contributions increased by 7 percentage points
       between 2002 and 2008 and at 87% is just 1 percentage point below the target.
   ·   Cost of collection has declined sharply (as targeted) with the start of operation of
       NRA and the transfer of the collection responsibility for local taxes to
       municipalities, which allowed a consolidation of the field office network from
       over 340 in 2002 to 29 in 2008. Combined with additional improvements in
       collection efficiency collection costs have dropped from 1.4% of revenues in 2002
       to 0.8% of revenues in 2008, which is lower than in many other EU and OECD
       countries (e.g. France 0.97%; Italy 1.16%; Netherlands 1.11%; UK 1.10%).
   ·   The percentage of firms that see tax administration as a problem for doing
       business declined from 34% in 2002 to 31% in 2005 and to 15% in 2009
       according to the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
       (BEEPS), one of the lowest now among the EU10 countries.
   ·   A large majority of taxpayers report not facing any significant administrative
       obstacles for tax compliance. This is the case in particular for large businesses
       with 82% of respondents not having identified any major administrative
       compliance problems in 2008; the response rate is somewhat lower, however still
       impressive, for SMEs with 65% and for individuals with 68%.


                                           20
   ·   Bulgaria rates better than most countries in the region in terms of perception of
       corruption--only 6.58% of firms reported that gifts were expected to be given to
       tax officials in Bulgaria compared to 12.85% in the region according to the 2009
       Enterprise Survey.
   ·   The effectiveness of audits and appeals have improved with close to 79% of
       audits leading to additional revenues in 2008 compared to 58% in 2002 (the
       baseline), exceeding the target under the project of 65%. The amount of
       adjustments per audit in 2008 is more than triple the targeted under the project.
       While the number of appealed audit acts was reduced marginally between 2002
       and 2008, the share of appeals lost in court declined markedly during this
       period--from 17.6% to 13.7%.
   ·   Arrears as percent of total revenues collected were reduced to below to 13.7% in
       2008, below the target of 17%.
   ·   Increased provision of electronic services and expanded information to taxpayers
       are contributing to reducing the compliance costs to taxpayers. The e-filing of
       VAT increased from 23% in 2006 to 68% by Jun-09 (Table 8) and saved
       taxpayers nearly 100,000 visits to the NRA offices per month.                Legal
       requirements for e-signature to file online has kept e-filing rate comparatively
       low, especially for PIT filing. Nevertheless, close to 96% of the returns are filed
       in electronic form--online or on a diskette.

As a result of the successful reforms Bulgaria became one of the top reformers in the tax
area according to the Doing Business 2008. The RARP was one of the winners in the
World Bank 2008 competition "Improving the Lives of People in ECA", and the



                                           21
Taxpayers Association of Europe awarded the 2009 Taxpayers Prize to Prime Minister
Borissov, recognizing that the successful tax reform efforts in Bulgaria have increased
the pressure for reform in other EU member countries. Project results supported the
achievement of Bulgaria's requirements for EU accession, and Bulgaria is operating
today one of the most efficient VAT systems in the EU. A highly efficient change
management program contributed to the successful implementation of all major reforms
envisaged by the project and to changing the mindset of revenue administration staff, so
that a service culture and dialogue with taxpayers and other stakeholders could be
introduced. The project had positive impacts beyond NRA, as it improved mobilization of
revenues for social security and contributed to increasing the efficiency of local tax
collection.
 The RARP has become a model for successful integration of tax and social contributions
collection. Strong commitment from the Government and from senior management in
NRA and NSSI in combination with the institutionalization of key reform results, such as
the creation of a permanent strategic planning and project coordination directorate in
NRA headquarters and the introduction of a broad-based performance monitoring system
contribute to guaranteeing the sustainability of the reforms. Project development
objectives were achieved and in most instances exceeded even without the completion of
the rehabilitation of the NRA building in Sofia and the remaining modules of the IT
system. Their completion and the reforms currently undertaken by the Government
(further consolidation of NRA territorial offices from 29 to 6) are expected to solidify the
achievements under the project and ensure additional improvements in effectiveness and
efficiency of revenue administration in Bulgaria.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project did not specifically target poverty impacts or social development. It did,
however, aim at improving the collection efficiency of social contributions, so that a
sustainable resource mobilization would be ensured to finance social benefits distributed
to the poorer segment of the population. In addition, the reduction in the PIT and social
contributions burden should facilitate the formalization of labor and thus the access of
workers to acquiring pension and health insurance rights. Finally, by promoting a
stronger relationship between taxpayers and the revenue administration, the project
would instill more confidence in government, lead to greater social inclusion, and
increase equity and transparency.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project entailed fundamental changes in the organizational structure as well as in the
institutional culture of the revenue administration. Organizational changes have been
initiated and capacity has been created to transform the revenue administration from an
organization focused on meeting current revenue collection targets to a forward looking
government agency with clearly identified strategic objectives and priorities and the
capacity to analyze compliance trends and behavior and respond to strategic challenges in
a proactive way.



                                            22
A key project objective was to transform the administrative mindset and institutional
culture of the revenue administration from a control approach to a modern service-
oriented culture able to master and fully enforce tax laws under a voluntary compliance-
based system of tax collection. A system of full self-assessment of taxes in line with
international good practice is now in place in Bulgaria. Key elements of an efficient
taxpayer service and information program have been put in place, such as the
establishment of a call center and the introduction of e-tax features (in particular the
establishment of a high quality web portal and introduction of electronic filing of tax
returns) as well as the establishment of a dedicated taxpayer services department to
improve client orientation of the NRA and of taxpayer service units in all structures of
the tax administration. The strategic plan 2008-2013 envisages continuing and deepening
the service focus of NRA, which documents the sustainability of changes introduced by
the project.
Restructuring of the revenue administration resulted in major streamlining benefits and
efficiency gains. The network of field offices was reduced from 340 to 29, and revenue
collected per staff member increased from BGN1,915 thousand in 2006 to BGN2,277
thousand BGN in 2008.
The project introduced new accountability mechanisms and strengthened transparency
and integrity of NRA operations. Clear reporting requirements and a key role of the NSSI
in monitoring NRA performance were introduced by placing the NSSI Governor in the
NRA Board. An outreach program targeting the private sector was implemented, and
private sector representatives were invited to participate in the steering committee for the
modernization program, recognizing the important role of the private sector among the
revenue administration stakeholders. The necessary organizational and procedural
changes were introduced to reduce opportunities for corruption, and perception surveys
are being conducted on a regular basis to measure improvements in the level of integrity.
The transfer of the responsibility for collection of social contributions from the NSSI to
the tax administration also resulted in changing and strengthening the NSSI, which was
able to build a stronger focus on establishing individual entitlements and efficiently
paying them out to recipients. The project created the preconditions for NSSI to further
develop its organizational culture and processes aligned to this role. The risk that the
somewhat counter-intuitive responsibility for collections compromises both the collection
efficiency and the provision of benefits has been eliminated.
Finally, the project also had a positive impact on strengthening fiscal federalism and local
governments in Bulgaria. Responsibility for collection of local taxes and fees was
transferred to local governments, which increased the responsibility and accountability of
local governments. Local government administrative capacity was built by transferring
1310 experienced tax administration staff to local government authorities. An additional
contribution to strengthened fiscal federalism was the increase in the collection efficiency
of local taxes, which increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1% in 2008 and thus
equipped local governments with more own-sourced revenues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The remarkable success of the integration of tax and social contributions collection has
now caused the Government of Bulgaria to also consider integrating the tasks of the State


                                            23
Receivables Agency (SRA) into the NRA and explore possibilities of an integration of
tax and customs administration. However, it is questionable whether the integration of the
SRA function into the NRA will increase the overall efficiency of revenue collection and
debt management. Revenues generated from enforced debt collection by SRA are
minimal compared to revenues collected by NRA, and the tasks and collection approach
of SRA differ fundamentally from the compliance management approach of NRA, which
is ­ and needs to be ­ based on enhancing voluntary compliance. There is therefore a risk
that such a merger would actually distract NRA from fulfilling effectively its core
revenue generation tasks. Also international experience with the integration of tax and
customs administration has been mixed, and a careful approach should be chosen to avoid
burdening NRA with tasks not related to revenue collection. However, the government
may wish to consider moving the responsibility for collection of other taxes, such as
excise taxes, to the NRA.

None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

With the accession to the EU, Bulgaria has committed to introducing an efficient revenue
collection system and counteracting corruption in the public sector. All reforms
envisaged by the RARP have been incorporated in the NRA institutional structure and it
is highly unlikely that they would be reversed after the project has closed. The
preparation of a five-year strategic plan has now become part of the culture of NRA
management, and clear accountability mechanisms to all stakeholders have been
developed. Private sector support for the reforms is substantial, as the reforms have
permitted a reduction in the tax burden and resulted in increased fairness of the tax
system. However, there is a risk of negative publicity campaigns against the NRA, as was
the case in early 2009, which could reduce taxpayer confidence in the agency. The
agency continues to be threatened by corrupt social and political groups linked to the
informal economy who have an interest in undermining public confidence in the agency
and on its ability to protect the confidentiality of tax records. The negative publicity
campaign against the NRA, following the resignation of the NRA executive director, in
early 2009 is a good example of such threat. It is important, therefore, that the
government continues to support NRA operations and demonstrates that the agency is
able to operate fairly and efficiently without political interference.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

A detailed analysis of the political, economic and institutional framework for the reform
was carried out prior to project design. Critical risks were identified and addressed



                                           24
appropriately. In particular a major emphasis was put on ensuring support from the NSSI
for the reform process, which was crucial for achieving the results expected. Excellent
analytical capacity, including ability to manage the project indicators, was instituted prior
to project launch. A solid change management program was designed to ensure support
from tax administration management and staff for the reform process. A number of other
donors (in particular the EU and the IMF) were active in the area of tax policy and
administration reform in Bulgaria when the project was designed, and excellent donor
coordination avoided a duplication of technical assistance and ensured that support
provided by the various actors was mutually reinforcing.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly satisfactory.

Several factors contributed to the supervision performance. The composition of the Bank
supervision team appropriately reflected the key project components and implementation
challenges of the RARP. The team assembled experienced experts in the areas of tax
administration, human resource management and training, tax administration IT design,
financial management and procurement. The team composition remained almost
unchanged from the launch until the closure of the project, which contributed to building
an excellent working relationship with counterparts. Supervision missions were
conducted regularly with two missions taking place each year. Supervision missions
always highlighted crucial challenges and core tasks for project implementation and
identified steps to address these challenges and accomplish the task. There were regularly
discussed also with the Minister of Finance and in some cases with Budget Committee in
Parliament. Follow-up was ensured and all team members were available for
consultations with the NRA reform team -- not only during but also in between
supervision missions. Supervision included regular contacts with other stakeholders, and
coordination of RARP activities with technical assistance provided by other donors was
excellent.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory

The project provided a well designed, timely and highly effective contribution to
improved revenue management in Bulgaria. An appropriate analysis of reform
requirements and risks combined with an excellent design of project components
contributed to the results achieved. Project design incorporated a number of best practices
for Bank tax administration reform projects, such as the particular emphasis on
developing capacity for policy analysis and compliance risk monitoring, the
strengthening of private tax advisory services, and the strong focus on efficient change
management. Project design and scope also appropriately reflected the implementation
capacity of the revenue administration, so that delays and implementation problems were
minimal. The Bank consulted and cooperated with the international donor community
throughout project preparation and implementation, and technical assistance provided to
the tax administration and NRA therefore was extremely well coordinated. Also
cooperation with the implementing agency was excellent. Implementation has shown,



                                             25
however, that the inclusion of office building constructions or renovations in revenue
administration reform projects considerably increases the risks for timely and full
accomplishment of all project components and activities, and therefore should be avoided
to the extent possible.



5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the Government provided strong support for the project. The Government had a
clear vision regarding the scope and content of reforms needed in order to establish an
integrated revenue collection authority. The necessary initial step to create the legal basis
for the reforms, the preparation of an NRA law, was undertaken in the second half of
2002, as agreed during pre-appraisal of the project. The Government committed to
guaranteeing the requisite budgetary authority and accountability by the NRA over
essential operational and technical areas and decisions. Required counterpart financing to
implement the reforms was made available as needed and agreed. The Government
demonstrated its support to the reform process throughout the implementation of the
project. The Ministry of Finance played an active role in the NRA Management Board,
overseeing the implementation of the reform program. The mid-term review of the RARP
noted that MOF support to the project was exemplary by providing both guidance and the
necessary resources for project execution. The Minister of Finance was consistently
available to discuss supervision mission findings.
The only project activity where Government support was less than adequate was the
rehabilitation of the NRA headquarters building in Sofia. Following a procurement
plagued with false starts and political and economic attempts to distort the evaluation
process, the Government decided to request the cancellation of the planned rehabilitation
under the project because bids were substantially above allocated funds. A public private
partnership approach for these civil works (bypassing the country's procurement laws)
was agreed with the Council of Ministers in 2008 but recently failed also. The activity,
which is very much necessary to further improve NRA efficiency and reduce taxpayer
compliance costs will now have to be completed, probably using Government funds.
Also, the MOF could have been more protective of its agency when a negative publicity
campaign was conducted against NRA shortly before project closure, which risked
reducing taxpayer confidence in the agency exactly at a time when the taxpayer
propensity to pay taxes is suffering because of the economic crisis. It is therefore crucial
that the Government makes every effort to restore taxpayer trust in the NRA in particular
and on Government's use of revenues in general, by eliminating any reasons for
taxpayers to perceive revenue collection is being used for political purposes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory




                                             26
The overall management of the project has been carried out with the highest standards.
Over the years of project implementation, the project team addressed all project related
issues in a very professional manner. The team built-in and maintained a strong
management capacity and the way the project was managed can be considered as best
practice. The team shared several times their experience not only with other agencies in
Bulgaria, but also internationally. Teams from several countries from within and outside
the region visited NRA to learn and exchange experience on overall project management.
In addition, each team member grew in their area and gained a lot of knowledge and real
life experience in the relevant areas of project, procurement, contracts and financial
management. On June 1, 2009, as part of the changes to the organizational structure of
the NRA and in view of the forthcoming closing of the project, the PCU was renamed to
Projects Coordination department and was integrated into the new directorate Strategic
Planning and Project Coordination. The Project Coordination Department is now in
charge of planning and coordination of all projects being launched in NRA.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Borrower's overall performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The project could
build on a clear and comprehensive revenue administration reform strategy developed by
the Government. Reform management capacity was created early in the process with the
establishment of a unified revenues administration (URA) reform team. All 58 project
activities, with only two exceptions, were completed fully and on time. Contractor
problems and repeated delays in developing the Revenue Management System for NRA
were addressed proactively and efficiently by NRA management leading. Though the
activity was later cancelled, the process to select the contractor for the refurbishment of
the NRA Sofia building was successfully carried out by the NRA under difficult
circumstances, and the integrity of the process was maintained. Project management
structures and performance monitoring systems have been institutionalized and contribute
to the sustainability of project results. Necessary capacity was built and strategies
developed to deal with potential project risks and change management challenges. A
sustainability program was instituted in the Agency's Strategic Plan to ensure project
gains would not be disrupted.

6. Lessons Learned
The project represents the first substantial Bank lending operation focusing specifically
on supporting the integration of tax and social contributions collection in a newly
established national revenue agency. Creating a unified revenue administration for tax
and social contributions collection in recent years has become a popular measure to
increase the efficiency of revenue collection and reduce compliance costs in particular in
ECA countries, but also in other regions. The lessons learned from the implementation of
the RARP therefore are of particular importance to subsequent Bank operations with
similar objectives. They also provide guidance more generally to countries contemplating
or planning a tax ­ social contributions collection merger exercise. Key lessons include:




                                            27
(i) Early confidence building is crucial. With the transfer of collection responsibility to
the revenue administration, the social security agency loses control over its revenue
generation. To avoid resistance from the agency, confidence must be built and
instruments (such as protocols, MoUs and service level agreements) must be put in place
to ensure that social contributions collections will be transferred fully and immediately
and that the social security agency receives appropriate information in a timely manner.
(ii) Integration is a process which involves a multitude of stakeholders. It is important to
involve these stakeholders actively in the design and monitoring and active management
of the reform process. The RARP had strong project management and steering structures,
which involved all relevant government and private sector stakeholders and offered
stakeholders an active role in guiding the NRA in its reform process and reviewing
progress made.
(iii)It is important that strong performance standards are set in relation to collection
performance for both tax and social contributions and early measures taken to collect
and analyze performance data. The RARP defined a list of core performance indicators
with challenging targets for NRA not only with regard to tax administration reform, but
also with regard to improving the efficiency of social contributions collection.
(iv) Transferring the collection responsibility for local taxes to municipalities is a crucial
precondition for achieving substantial efficiency gains in national tax revenue collection.
OECD comparative analysis of tax administration reform has shown that office
consolidation is a core element of a strategy to increase tax administration efficiency.
Such consolidation proves difficult in practice, however, when field offices are in charge
of local tax collection. Under the RARP the transfer of collection responsibility for local
taxes to local governments was accomplished in the early stage of reform
implementation, which created the necessary conditions for a substantial reduction in the
number of tax offices.
(v)Continuity in the leadership of the tax agency provides an important contribution to
successful implementation of the reform process. The implementation of the RARP was
considerably facilitated by the fact that NRA was provided with a stable and efficient
senior management team. In addition to avoiding a leadership vacuum and disruptions in
a period where strong management of the reform process is required, this facilitated
communication and trust building between senior management and the Bank team.
(vi) Tax administration reform and integrating the collection responsibility for social
contributions is a multi-year process. A medium to long-term strategic vision, owned by
the implementing agency, is a prerequisite for the successful completion and
sustainability of the reform process. The development of strategic planning capacity was
one of the core priorities for the first phase of the RARP. A five-year strategic plan 2004-
2008 was prepared and provided a strategic basis for the reform process. The
establishment of a Strategic Planning and Change Management Department (SPCM)
ensured the expertise needed to keep all aspects of the reform on track, on schedule, and
aligned with project development objectives and related activities in all components.
(vii) Business process re-engineering and related automated applications must be fully
(though gradually) integrated throughout the tax administration, with appropriate
management of the organizational transition ­ including human resource and training
aspect ­ as a central part of the process. Business process capacity was properly
integrated into the headquarters functions of the NRA, and plans to sustain the function



                                             28
have been prepared and are being executed so as to guarantee the ongoing quality and
efficiency of NRA's work process and procedures. Simultaneously a change management
process was launched to build commitment of all staff to the change process.
(viii) Moving to an e-tax system is an essential process for reducing the compliance
and administrative burden and the risk of corruption. Increasing the use of electronic
tools, in particular e-filing, by taxpayers therefore is important. This requires, in addition
to providing incentives for e-filing, to eliminate obstacles and create the necessary legal
framework for the use of e-tax. The implementation of the RARP has shown that the
promotion of e-filing through a system of tax incentives does not produce the expected
results as long as legal or practical obstacles hamper the efficient use of an e-filing
system. In addition to offering incentives, priority must therefore be given to early studies
to identify such obstacles and constraints and propose project activities to mitigate them.
This need was not sufficiently recognized in the RARP design.
(ix)     Tax administration reform frequently requires changes in the legal framework.
These changes must be initiated as early as possible in order to ensure a clear and
sufficient legal basis for the reform. In Bulgaria, in addition to input provided by the
RARP, project technical assistance provided by EU Phare and by the IMF have
contributed to a quick and full implementation of a stable procedural legislation and tax
laws with the aim of harmonizing the tax base for integrated revenue collection.
(x) Need for setting realistic, measurable performance targets. The project established a
large number of key indicators at appraisal. These indicators proved to be important for
the NRA to measure its own performance and for NRA to be able to monitor and analyze
the performance of its office network. The NRA established from the beginning an
analytical office that monitored performance during the life of the project. The use of
performance indicators for project monitoring was one of the key features of the project.
Nevertheless, under the RARP a few indicators proved elusive and difficult to achieve
because of external constraints, as it was the case with electronic filing being affected by
the electronic signature law, or the tracking of local taxes after decentralization to local
governments. It is important to avoid the use of key indicators that have fundamental
external dependencies that are not under the control of the implementing agency.

(xi) ii) Avoid construction works/renovations which often contribute to delays in
institutional development projects. Large civil works activities are often difficult to
procure under institutional development projects. Procurement is complex with additional
steps such as architectural design and prequalification which can extend the procurement
for over one year. In addition, national interests and perception of corruption influence,
which seem to be common to this type of procurement, often disrupts the procurement
process. Whenever possible, it is best to avoid this type of activity where the Bank team
and the implementing agency do not have substantial experience in executing the activity.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The PAD had made several assumptions regarding the fiscal benefits of the project. It
was expected that fiscal gains would come through a number of channels. The tax base
would expand with the shrinking of the shadow economy and the increase in voluntary
compliance. On the other hand collection rates would rise due to rising efficiency of
audits, higher staff integrity, and improved enforcement and collection of arrears. The
following comparison of the present value of these revenues against the present value of
the project's cost was made:

Applying a 10% discount rate, the net present value of the project was expected to be
EUR 672 million, resulting in an IRR of 267%.
It is not possible to precisely verify these assumptions, because the tasks and
responsibilities of the NRA have changed fundamentally during project implementation.
In particular the transfer of responsibility of excise tax collection to Customs and of local
tax collection to local governments has had an impact on the overall level of NRA
revenue generation and efficiency ratios. It is possible, however, to analyze individual
results achieved in specific areas contributing to the overall fiscal performance of the
project.
Expansion of the tax base. The estimated share of the grey economy has decreased from a
high level of 35% of GDP in 2002 to 20% of GDP in 2007. While tax reform is not the
only element contributing to increased business formalization, analysis shows that tax-
related factors play a key role for the decision to formalize. Country analysis presented at
the OECD Global Forum on Competition in February 2009 highlighted that among the
core drivers for business formalization were the sizable reduction in corporate and
personal income taxes, as well as social security contributions and the integration and
modernization of tax collection under the NRA (Competition Policy and the Informal
Economy ­ Document DAF/COMP/GF/WD(2008)49).


                                             46
Improvements in tax compliance rates.          Improvements in revenue compliance
management was one of the core elements of the Government's strategy to reduce the
size of the informal economy. The introduction of more efficient risk analysis and
collection systems in NRA has substantially improved tax compliance rates.


Figure 3. Compliance rates with major taxes




The graph shows that substantial compliance increases have been achieved for all major
taxes. The overall compliance rate has increased from 74.3% in 2002 to 85.7% in 2008.
VAT compliance is among the highest in the EU.
In combination with an overall increase in compliance rates efficiency gains in NRA
revenue management have resulted in major improvements in the timeliness of tax
payments, thus creating noticeable cash flow benefits to the government. Taxes paid on
time (excluding old arrears) increased from 80.1% of all taxes due in 2003 to 90.5% in
2007 and 86.7% in 2008 when the global economic and financial crisis affected liquidity
of firms and banks.

Reduction in the tax burden. The Government was strongly committed to encouraging
investment and employment creation by reducing direct taxation and applying exemption
and depreciation incentives. In this context fiscal balance depended increasingly on the
capacity of the revenue administration to improve collection and compliance rates. The
tax burden for both businesses and individuals was lowered several times during project
implementation (see Table 2). As a result of these reforms Bulgaria was listed as one of
the top reformers in the tax area in the Doing Business 2008 report. According to `Doing
Business' analysis the total tax rate as a percentage of business profits has been reduced
from 36.7% (Doing Business 2008) to 31.4% (Doing Business 2010).

Revenue generation. Increased efficiency of revenue collection by NRA ensured that the
impact of rate reductions on actual revenue collection was curtailed. Net revenues
collected by GTD and NSSI (and from 2006 by NRA) increased from BGN9.4 billion
BGN in 2002 to BGN21.1 billion in 2008. This growth in net collections has been

achieved despite the fact that responsibility for the collection of certain taxes has been
transferred to other agencies during implementation of the RARP (in particular local tax
collection to local governments and the collection of excises to Customs). Analysis of
individual revenue performance demonstrates continuous improvements in collection
performance.
Reduction of compliance costs. No clear estimates can be made about the reduction in
compliance costs achieved. The introduction of e-filing, particularly for VAT, has
significantly reduced the need for physical visits at tax offices. Tax forms have been
simplified and implementation of new taxpayer service programs, such as the operation
of an NRA call center, has facilitated access to information. However, irrespective of
these improvements the Doing Business 2010 report assumes that the total time required
for compliance with the tax system remained unchanged at a high level of 616 hours per
year. This indicates that the objective of reducing compliance costs did not receive the
same level of political and senior management attention and support as the objectives of
promoting effectiveness and efficiency of revenue collection and maximizing the level of
taxpayer voluntary compliance. Results from taxpayer survey suggest that there is a
perceived progress in reducing the time it takes to comply with tax and social security
regulations--the share of respondents considering compliance time as significant
declined from 28% in 2006 to 23.5% in 2008 as appeals and audits improved and tax
returns were simplified. Nevertheless, time spent at NRA's offices and travel to NRA
offices seems to be substantial. Personal visits to tax offices in order to get assistance in
filing returns are still frequent, in particular for small and medium sized firms. This
added to the difficulties of carrying out business with 15 different tax office locations in
Sofia (close to 50% revenues), also contributing to the high compliance costs. While
incentives for e-filing have been introduced through changes in tax legislation, the take-
up rate of e-filing remains low. Even a majority of large taxpayers continues to file CIT
returns on paper instead of electronically. The overall e-filing rate for CIT returns (22%)
and PIT returns (4%) is substantially below the rate in most other EU countries.




Administrative efficiency. Costs of tax collection amounted to 1.4% of total collections
for the tax administration in 2002. NRA has achieved an efficiency ratio of 0.8% in 2008.
With such a ratio Bulgaria has reached the level of advanced OECD countries and
compares very favorably with other transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe.


                                             48
Cost savings through increased collection efficiency. Combined collection costs of the
tax administration and the NSSI prior to the creation of NRA were at the level of 1.2% of
total collection. With the creation of NRA total collection costs were reduced to 0.78%
in 2006. This increase in collection efficiency can be translated into cost savings
amounting to BGN56.2 million or EUR28.7 in the first year of NRA operation. With
collection costs remaining at a level of 0.82% in 2007 and 0.83% in 2008, total project
costs were compensated for in the second year of NRA operation.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
Several surveys of stakeholders and NRA staff were conducted during the
implementation period of the RARP. The surveys clearly document improvements
acknowledged by taxpayers in the operation of the Bulgarian tax system and a very high
level of satisfaction with the performance of NRA. Satisfaction rates vary by taxpayer
segment, with large taxpayers generally expressing more confidence with administrative
improvements than small businesses and individuals. Even for individuals and small
businesses the tax system seems to have become substantially more transparent and less
complicated, however.

Taxpayer feedback has been particularly positive in the area of compliance facilitation
and removing obstacles for complying with tax and social contributions obligations. A
large majority of taxpayers report not facing any significant administrative obstacles for
tax compliance. This again is the case in particular for large businesses with 82% of
respondents not having identified any major administrative compliance problems in 2008;
the response rate is somewhat lower, however still impressive, for SMEs with 65% and
for individuals with 68%. The two most frequently cited compliance obstacles by SMEs
and individuals are bureaucracy (listed by 7% of SMEs and 5.6% of individuals) and the
slowness of the NRA software (1.7% of SMEs and 2.1% of individuals).
Collection of feedback specifically on what businesses rate as the biggest obstacle in the
tax and social contributions system demonstrates that some of the major obstacles
taxpayers face in other countries, such as corruption and excessive bureaucracy, do no
longer play a major role in Bulgaria. This is particularly remarkable for corruption with
less than one percent of respondents in all business categories seeing corruption as the
biggest problem in their tax affairs.

Finally, all taxpayer groups consistently acknowledge the quality of NRA services and
the competence of its staff. Dissatisfaction with services and staff is rare and indicates
that NRA has become a model for an efficient, service-oriented public sector
organization.

Similar positive feedback has been received regarding the various aspects of service
provision, such as the variety of services offered and the accessibility of the taxpayer
service function.
In summary, while the feedback surveys still reflect areas, where the performance and
attitude of NRA could be further improved, e.g. further targeted assistance to facilitate
small business tax compliance, there have been no areas identified through the survey
work which risk putting a particular burden on taxpayers and increasing their compliance
burden. Overall the establishment of NRA has had a positive impact on the relationship
between revenue administration and its key stakeholders for both of the areas tax
collection and social contribution collection.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1.     Introduction
As part of broader reforms and in preparation for EU accession, the Bulgarian
Government has modernized its revenue administration. Central to this modernization
program was the establishment and start of operations of the NRA which integrated the
functions of the former GTD and the collection and enforcement functions of the NSSI.

2.     Assessment of Project Development Objectives, Project Design and
Quality at Entry
The development objective of the Revenue Administration Reform Project was to support
the Government of Bulgaria in implementing a sustainable and effective public revenue
collection system (taxes and social security contributions) that facilitates private sector
development and complies with requirements for EU accession. A complementary
objective was the separation of central and municipal revenue collection functions as an
integral part of the institutional optimization and modernization process. The project
aimed at attaining its development objectives through the implementation of a
comprehensive reform program, focused on increasing the share of voluntarily paid taxes
and social security contributions, enhancing revenue administration effectiveness and
efficiency, establishing a team of professionals, reducing the opportunities and
motivation for corruption, and improve equity and fairness in the administration of tax
and social security contributions' collection. At the same time, it aimed at reducing the
compliance burden of taxpayers/contributors as well as reducing the tax and social
security burden.
A core element of the project was to support the establishment of the NRA as the central
institution in the new public revenue collection system, responsible for the collection of
taxes and social security contributions.
Project objectives remained relevant for the entire period of implementation and were not
revised, which demonstrates their adequacy. The project implementation period was from
August 7, 2003 (date of Loan effectiveness) until originally planned project closing
date--June 30, 2009.
Project objectives remain a key part of the NRA Strategic Plan 2008-2013, which lists
four strategic goals for the further development of the Agency:
   1. Collection of tax and social security contributions at high level of effectiveness and
encouraging voluntary compliance.
   2. NRA ­ trustworthy partner in the cooperation with the national and international
institutions.
   3. NRA ­ preferred work place.
   4. Institutional development of NRA.

Annual Operational Plans are prepared on a regular basis to define the objectives, results
and tasks at an operational level for the respective year.

3.     Project Components

The project consisted of six components:
Component 1. Policy Support. This component helped ensured that NRA fully complies
with the tax policy framework developed by the Ministry of Finance including:
·    build in-house capacity for conducting policy and legislation reviews and analyses;
·    development of efficient functions for analyses and revenue estimation;
·    improve NRA's interaction with the court system to efficiently manage the appeals
procedure;
·     preparation of strategic and operational plans.

Component 2. Organization and Management. This component helped develop NAR
organization and reform the HRM function including:
·    development of the organization structure of the NRA and management systems,
including modules governing accountability, internal control, and integrity of managerial
processes;
·    modernizing the HRM function, including training, workforce planning, recruitment,
and selection of professionals, career development, performance incentive systems, code
of conduct.

Component 3. Increasing Operational Efficiency. Under this component the core
business processes of the NRA were reengineered with supporting information
technology and other systems implemented, including:
·    establishment of an Information and Communication Technology Department;
·    modernization of core functions, such as registration, payment and return
processing, audit, appeals and enforcement;
·    implementation of an integrated IT system for the collection of all taxes and social
and health insurance contributions as well as building a Data Warehouse with capabilities
of information sharing among state institutions;
·    integrated business processes for collection of taxes and social contributions;
·    procurement of computer hardware, software and related technical support.

Component 4. Outreach and Participation. Activities under this component supported
the implementation of a range of taxpayers/contributors services, as well as the
development of a Charter of Rights and Obligations. Processes were established for
assuring citizen voice and participation in shaping the NRA with mechanisms in place for
transparency and accountability.

Component 5. Office Upgrading. This component helped NRA establish an adequate
working environment, both for staff and clients by funding rehabilitation of territorial
departments.

Component 6. Project Management. This component put in place the necessary project
management organization, recognizing that the reform project was a large and complex


                                           57
undertaking with many inter-related elements. A change management function was
established to raise the commitment of staff and other stakeholders for the change
process.


4.    General Macroeconomic and Institutional Environment Prior to Project
Start
In the course of transition to a market economy, and in reformulating the role of
government, the Republic of Bulgaria confronted mounting evidence that its revenue
collection administration needed a major institutional overhaul to enable it to mobilize
effectively and efficiently revenues, as well as to accede to the European Union (EU).
This perceived need for an overhaul applied in particular to the administration of direct
and indirect taxes. This perception was underscored by a joint IMF/Bank mission in
1999. While some reforms had been introduced, such as the introduction of functional
arrangements, establishment of a large taxpayer office, and new concepts incorporated in
a Tax Procedure Code, the tax administration continued to be characterized by:
·   A crisis approach to management, with continuous encroachment by headquarters on
    the collection activities of the tax offices, resulting in loss of focus by management on
    the development and implementation of strategic and short-term planning, direction,
    and control of the organization.
·   The lack of a credible human resource management strategy. As a consequence the
    tax administration suffered from limited workforce planning, poor recruitment,
    selection, and compensation arrangements, and an inadequate focus on executive,
    manager and staff development, and capacity-building.
·   An operational strategy that, while having some focus on self-assessment, lacked the
    necessary supporting strategies or processes to service taxpayers. Operations were
    based on outdated business processes with little in the way of cohesive information
    technology support, and no credible compliance or risk assessment strategy or
    function as support.
·   A fragmented and dysfunctional national network of offices spans of control and
    layers of management, exacerbated by the need to collect both national taxes and
    local taxes and charges.
·   Inadequate internal controls, and claims of taxpayer harassment and internal
    corruption.
·   Inadequate information systems and weak information technology management,
    systems development, and operational capacity.
In October 1999, the Government of Bulgaria decided to establish a Unified Revenue
Agency, integrating the GTD and the collection function of the NSSI for the purpose of
simplifying tax and social contribution administration. On June 29, 2000, the Council of
Ministries approved the concept paper for a Unified Revenue Agency (URA) and
launched the first stage of an implementation plan. This included: starting joint audit
operations, strengthening GTD and NSSI, especially GTD's information technology
systems; improving GTD and NSSI coordination; and developing a detailed


                                             58
implementation strategy for the subsequent two stages, including a realistic timetable and
cost estimates. The IMF provided a full-time advisor for 12 months, to October 2001, to
assist the Government in this effort.
While a reasonable level of achievement occurred, lack of support by some members of
the previous government and the former GTD executive, coupled with a lack of local
experience in major project development and management, slowed progress. Moreover,
initial gains from joint activities could not be built on because of the lack of a legislative
basis for information-sharing between GTD and NSSI.
In this situation, the reform strategy was changed and in 2001 a medium to long-term
plan for the establishment of the NRA was launched. On November 14, 2002 the
Parliament enacted the Law for the NRA (LNRA) and the NRA headquarters (HQ) was
established, which was responsible for the further project implementation. The
objectives, scope and benefits for the community and the state from the establishment of
the NRA were specified in detail. The basic strategies for achieving the objectives were
identified and a detailed action plan was developed and the necessary resources provided.
The project received full support of the Bulgarian Government, the business and the
public as a whole. A Loan agreement (Revenue Administration Reform Project) between
the Republic of Bulgaria and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
was signed and ratified by the National Assembly in a Law, enacted on July 16, 2003.



5.       Achievement of Outcomes and Objectives
5.1      Objective Achievement as per the PAD Targets ­ Basic Outcomes and
         Achievements

The basic activities of the RARP implementation and establishment of the NRA were
outlined in the NRA 2004-2008 Strategic Plan, approved by the Managing Board of the
NRA in October 2004. The NRA undertook a number of activities to prepare for the
merger of the GTD and the NSSI structures into the NRA. To centralize revenue
collection, responsibilities for the collection of local taxes and fees were transferred to
municipalities. As a result, 1,310 employees of GTD were transferred to municipalities
and the number of offices was reduced from over 340 in 2003 to 29 in the beginning of
2006. Operational costs were optimized as costs for cash security, rents, security, heating,
and communications fell. The move to collection of Central Government revenues
created opportunities for applying a rotation principle in tax audit function and increasing
the mobility of audit teams, thus reducing opportunities for corruption.
The preparation for the start of NRA operations was done in an environment of
uncertainty:
· Political support was almost missing with the Tax and Social Security Procedural
   Code, legislating the integrated collection of taxes and social contributions, adopted
   by Parliament on December 21, 2005--only two weeks before the start of the NRA
   while the approval was expected to take place in September 2005.
·     Existing resistance and anxiety of employees against the implemented reforms. The
      NSSI management did not allow NSSI employees who were assigned to be


                                             59
    transferred to NRA to get acquainted with their future work places in NRA. These
    employees were physically transferred to NRA on January 3, 2006, the first day of
    NRA operations.
·   The 900 staff transferred by NSSI to NRA was insufficient in view of the volume of
    work transferred to NRA. This led to extraordinary workload of the employees.
Despite of all ambiguities, risks, low motivation and resistance inside and outside GTD
and NSSI, the preparation for the merger continued and the NRA started operating in
January 2006.

The operation of NRA had an extraordinary impact on revenue collection, on efficiency
and effectiveness of the NRA, and on reducing costs of compliance to taxpayers.

Revenue Collection

Revenues from taxes almost tripled in nominal terms between 2002 (the baseline) and
2008, while revenues from social contributions nearly doubled despite significant
reduction in tax and social contribution rates. Tax and social contribution revenues
increased from 27.5% of GDP in 2002 to 31.6% of GDP in 2008. Municipal revenues in
2008 were more than double their level in 2004 when the transfer of responsibility for
municipal revenue collection to local governments started.

In the first year of NRA operation (2006) tax revenues collected were by 8% higher than
in 2005 despite an increase of the income tax exemption threshold and a decrease of
personal income tax rates. Tax revenues exceeded the target set in the Budget Law by
9.1%. Revenues from social contributions grew by 1.7% compared to 2005 despite a
significant cut of social security burden in 2006 by 6 percentage points, which means that
increased collection efficiency fully compensated for the revenue loss due to the rate
reduction. Increased collection efficiency made possible a reduction of the corporate tax
rate to 10% in 2007 and an increase in pension and salary levels from summer 2007.
In 2007 tax revenues (excluding excises) increased by 20% compared to 2006. Legal
entities in 2007 declared a taxable profit which was by BGN3.5 billion higher than in
2006, which for the second consecutive year represented a growth of nearly 50%. Also
income tax revenues grew nearly twice as fast as wage increase, which indicates a
decrease in the level of the hidden economy. Social contribution revenues grew by 13%
year-on-year.
In 2008, tax revenues (excluding excises) increased by 14% year-on-year despite
slowdown in economic activity in Q4 and introduction of flat rate of 10% for personal
income taxes. Social contributions collections increased by 5.5% despite a further cut in
social security burden by 3.0 percentage points from October 2007.




                                           60
Collection Efficiency

Efficiency of revenue collection was enhanced as a result of modernized business
processes, increased use of information technology and optimization of staff. The start of
the NRA led to significant economies of scale--revenues are collected now by 25% less
staff then in 2002, which led to almost tripling of revenues per revenue staff. Since the
start of NRA operations in January 3, 2006 the NRA has undergone a number of staff
optimization programs. In January 2006 NRA merged nearly 8,000 GTD employees with
900 employees from NSSI. In April 2006, following a Government-wide optimization of
staff program, NRA staff was downsized by 10% based on the workload analysis of
territorial departments. Nearly 200 NRA employees were transferred to the Customs
Agency (CA) couple of months later as a result of the transfer of excise collection
responsibility to customs.

Additional responsibilities were assumed by the NRA without recruitment of new staff.
These responsibilities related to Bulgaria's accession to the EU in 2007 or to changes in
tax legislation, e.g. the collection and control of the VAT from intra-community trade,
which previously was a responsibility of the Customs Agency, or the administration of
tax credits for child allowances. In addition, increases in economic efficiency created the
necessary preconditions for decreasing the tax and social security burden and thus
achieving one of the objectives of the Revenue Administration Reform Project.

Note: The difference in the data for revenue collection between this table and the key
performance indicators of the project is due to two reasons: (1) social contributions
revenues collected by NSSI until 2005 are included in the key performance indicators,
while the table above only lists revenues collected by the Tax Administration (NRA since
2006), and (2) revenues from VAT from imports are included in the key performance
indicators--those revenues are collected by the Customs Agency but the NRA is
responsible for refunding of VAT.
Operating and maintenance costs declined and tax and social contributions revenues,
previously collected by two agencies are now collected at lower cost to the state budget--




                                            61
operations and maintenance expenditures of NRA in 2008 were only 88% of the
expenditure allocated in 2005 (in nominal terms), prior to the start of the Agency.

Compliance Costs

Increased use of electronic exchange of information with other agencies and expansion e-
services provided to taxpayers/contributors led to substantial reduction in cost of
compliance to taxpayers/contributors. Both e-payment and e-filing rates increased but
legal requirement for e-signature needed to file online has kept filing of personal income
tax declarations low (the PIT filing rate presented in the table below refers to annual PIT
declarations made by self-employed). Online filing VAT returns saved taxpayers nearly
100 000 visits to the NRA offices per month. As of June 2009 more than 67% of VAT
registered companies filed VAT documents online compared to 23% in 2006. E-filing of
Declaration 6 (monthly declaration by employers on personal income tax and social
contributions) is steadily growing.

Key Performance Indicators

Most of the project's KPIs have been achieved. During project implementation some
indicators were changed, while others were dropped. Main reasons for modifying the list
of KPIs were:
·     To take account of changes in the legal framework for NRA operations (for example
the transfer of collection responsibility for excise duties entirely to Customs Agency);
·     To take account of delays in the development of some modules of the revenue
management software and mainly of establishing the Data Warehouse, which was
supposed to provide data for a number of indicators;
·     To respond to differences in the interpretation of information provided by the NSSI
and by the GTD.

Specific Comments on Individual Groups of Indicator

Indicators related to the establishment of an economically efficient public revenue
collection system
Revenues by sectors have not been reported and will be analyzed regularly once the Data
Warehouse is established. Currently the analysis is limited to sectors with a high risk of
noncompliance.

It is difficult to assess adequately in the objective to reduce the share of gray economy
from 35% in 2002 to 30% in 2008 is fulfilled due to the lack of consistent time series on
gray economy in Bulgaria. There are no official estimates available while estimates
produced by various research institutes and NGOs vary by a large margin. A relatively
consistent set of estimates shows that estimated share of grey economy declined to 20%
in 2007. The shrinking of the grey economy is confirmed by the increase in the
aggregate voluntary compliance (from 74% in 2002 to 86% in 2008). Therefore, a
conclusion can be made that the target has been achieved.
A target value for the aggregate level of voluntary compliance (excluding excises) has
not been set explicitly in the PAD. Combining target values for specific types of taxes
would point to an expected overall compliance level of 83.6%. In this case NRA has
reached the target one year prior to project closing ­ the aggregate level of voluntary
compliance in 2007 was 83.9% and continued to increase in the last year of the project to
reach 85.7%. In particular, the VAT compliance rate is significantly higher than targeted
under the project. Very close, although slightly below the target is the level of voluntary
compliance with the personal income tax and compulsory security contributions
(reviewed together). The reasons for not reaching the target are the delayed start of NRA
operations, and the introduction of flat tax on PIT without non-taxable income, which led
to an increase of tax burden for taxpayers with low incomes. Without these developments
the target probably would have been reached.
Indicators on taxpayer voluntary compliance
An indicator which became obsolete is the percentage of disputes on hand in relation to
total. A legislative change was introduced in 2003, under which all appealed acts were
considered "affirmance of the appeal by default" in case the administration does not issue
a statement in a certain period on the taxpayers' appeal against the audit act.
Indicators on equity and fairness in the administration
The PAD sets a target of 10% for the indicator share of appealed audit acts. The reported
value for this indicator for 2008 is nearly 19%. There are basically two reasons for the
higher value: (1) a higher amount of additional assessments per audit (as a result of the
policy of NRA to conduct an audit in case of suspicions of evasion of large amounts of
taxes or social contributions); and (2) more restricted opportunities for evidence
collection (as a consequence of the rights removed by the legislation in 2005 for NRA
bodies to ransack and seize evidence). The effectiveness of appeals and audits has
improved with amount of appealed adjustment declining from 62% in 2002 to 22% in
2008 and share of cases lost in court declining to 13.7% in 2008.

5.3 Impact of the Project on the NRA Institutional Development.

A number of structural and institutional changes were made during the project
implementation period to achieve the project development objectives. In particular the
NRA was established by law and NRA headquarters were set up as the major structural
unit responsible for the RARP implementation, and the GTD as well as the social security
collection functions of NSSI and the health insurance contributions were merged into
NRA.

6.     Major Factors influencing Project Implementation and Outcomes

6.1. Factors Outside the Control of the Government and the Implementation
Agency

·    Price increases for constructions led to bids unacceptable for MoF for the
reconstruction of the NRA building in Sofia. The bid procedure was terminated, and the
respective amount from the Loan was canceled.
·    Insufficient capacity of the company developing the RMS. The contractor was not in
a position to cope with the task of developing remaining modules of the RMS; due to
expiry of the term of the Loan Agreement the contract was terminated.
6.2.   Factors Controlled by the Government and Implementing Agency
·    Major factor for the successful project implementation was the support of the World
Bank, MoF and the NRA management. MoF provided an important contribution by
ensuring the financial and operational independence of NRA in implementing the project
activities. The NRA Management Board assumed its oversight functions and
responsibilities for taking important project decisions. The support by the MoF with
regard to the timely provision of the necessary funds for the project implementation
played a crucial role for the successful implementation of the project.
·    The decision regarding the provision of a building for the NRA in Sofia is a
responsibility of the MoF. NRA has communicated details with respect to the functional
requirements for the building to the MoF.
·    The bid procedure for developing the remaining modules of the RMS is under
preparation.
6.3. Cost and Financing
·    Original cost estimates for project implementation were in the amount of Euro 58.56
million. Actual implementation cost amounted to Euro 42.30 million.
·    In January 2006 a reallocation of loan proceeds was made to purchase software
licenses under ongoing contracts. The project amount for the category Goods was
increased by Euro 1.8 million on the account of the categories Consultant services (Euro
1.4 million) and Unallocated funds (Euro 0.4 million).


                                          65
·    Euro 10.24 million were canceled from the Loan amount of Euro 31.90 million
effective May 26, 2009. The cancelation resulted from the canceled bid procedure for the
construction of the NRA building in Sofia, the partial completion of the RMS contract
and savings made in project implementation. The cancelation of the funds had no impact
on achieving the project objectives.
·    All contracts were completed on time; there are no pending payments and unsettled
issues. All payments were processed one month prior to project closing.
·    The annual audits of the project were conducted on time, including the final audit,
by independent auditors. No grace period was used.
7. Sustainability of the Achieved Outcomes and Objectives of RARP
·    The establishment of the NRA as an institution integrating the collection of taxes
and security contributions and the transfer of the collection responsibility for local taxes
and fees to municipalities as well as the key outcomes achieved by implementing the
RARP components are an irreversible process.
·    The strategic plan for the further institutional development of NRA for 2008-2013
was based achievements and objectives of the Project. A stable system for the collection
of revenues in Bulgaria has been established, supported by the former and the present
government. This revenue system provides a key contribution to achieving Government
objectives in key social sectors and in upgrading public infrastructure.
·    In May 2009 the NRA headquarters structure was changed with Strategic Planning
and Change Management Department and Project Coordination Unit merged into a
Strategic Planning and Project Coordination Directorate that reports directly to the
Executive Director. One of the responsibilities of the new directorate is to provide
continuity and sustainability of reforms undertaken under the Project and ensure
furthering of results achieved by the RARP in future projects and programs after project
closing.
8. Implementation by the Bank and the Borrower

    The contribution of the Bank team is highly appreciated by the NRA Management
and staff. The constructive dialogue and openness during the supervision missions
helped build team spirit and trust between the two organizations. As a result of this NRA
considers the Bank as a strategic partner. The broad experience of the Bank in project
management and the recommendations made during supervision missions helped
improve project management capacity of the NRA staff. The advice and the technical
assistance provided to the NRA as well as discussions on important decisions in project
implementation, especially in the spheres of IT, financial and administrative
management of the project, played a crucial role in achieving the project objectives.



9. Lessons Learned
9.1 Organization of the Project:



                                            66
It is crucial for successful project implementation to ensure:
·    A clear structure for project management with direct reporting to the authorized
representatives of the organization.
·    Establishment of a Project office for project coordination especially in organizations
with numerous projects with the purpose of avoiding overlapping of objectives and
outcomes, facilitate reallocation of the funds among the particular sub-projects, ensure
regular monitoring of performance.
·   Clearly defined levels of subordination of the key staff in the process of project
implementation
·    Clear systems and channels for reporting and communication
·   Clearly defined roles and responsibilities of staff participating in project
implementation.
·    Establishing of a team with the relevant technical knowledge, with defined
responsibilities, oriented towards result and with a good team spirit.

9.2 Procurement and Contract Management
It is necessary to:
·     Have clear terms of references (ToRs) and selection requirements for contractors
·   Keep a close look on the evaluation committee's progress and assisting them when
needed
·    Prepare scenarios for negotiations
·    Include detailed list of the deliverables due in the payment clauses in the contracts
·    Include unit prices in contracts in order to avoid increase of the price of the contract
through decreasing the volume of the work done
·    Monitor the achievement of implementation results
·    Keep track of the progress in contract implementation.
9.3 Change Management

Early identification of risks and monitoring of implementation is key for ensuring
adequate change management. Keeping an open communication channel to management
and key stakeholders helps address effectively arising issues and provides useful
information to decision makers.


9.4 Project Team

·    To be able to address delays in project implementation it is important to set up
qualified teams with the necessary number of experts.



                                             67
·   Strengthening team spirit and commitment is crucial. Assigning tasks to individual
experts and grouping experts in teams of two might increase team efficiency.
