INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
CENTRAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF MAURITIUS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MAURITIUS
FOPR A POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Central Electricity Board of Mauritius (CEB), with the guarantee
of Mauritius, for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help finance a Power
Transmission Project. The loan would have a term of seventeen years, in-
cluding four years of grace, at an interest rate of 7.45 per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
in Mauritius" (Report No. 268a-MAS) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on March 13, 1974. A Basic Economic Report is being printed and will be
circulated to the Executive Directors shortly. A summary of the conclusions
of the report is set out below. Country data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        Mauritius is a small, densely populated island, with, until recently,
only one significant source of income: sugar. During the 1950s and 1960s,
two disturbing features pervaded the Mauritian economy: a rapidly growing
population, at a rate of about 2.8 percent per year, and economic stagna-
tion. During the 1960s, real GNP per capita, in fact, declined. A successful
family planning program was started in the early 1960s, as a result of which
the population growth was stemmed to a rate of only 1.2 percent a year by
the mid-1970s. However, the children born in earlier years reached working
age by the late 1960s, and, with employment opportunities limited, unemploy-
ment reached alarming proportions. In 1972, sixteen percent of the labor
force was unemployed. The economic stagnation reflected the almost sole
reliance of the economy on sugar. The sugar market was generally depressed
and, in any case, there were physical limitations to a significant further
expansion of the industry.
4.        In its two successive Plans for Social and Economic Development
(the first covering 1971-1975; the second 1975-1980), the Government, there-
fore, made the creation of new jobs its main objective. The Government
embarked on a program of industrialization and the promotion of tourism,
relying, among other things, on generous incentives to stimulate local enter-
prises and to attract foreign investors. This program was supplemented by
some agricultural diversification (tea), and a public works program. Govern-
ment policies have been very successful. Despite a devastating cyclone in
1975, which destroyed almost one-third of the sugar crop, real GNP grew at
an average rate of 8.1 percent a year between 1970 and 1976. In the latter
year, GNP per capita reached US$680. The main stimulus has been the growth of
labor-intensive export industries. Up to 1975, the favorable developments
were greatly aided by the rise in sugar prices, as a result of which the terms
of trade improved by some 30 percent between 1970 and 1975. Gross domestic



-2-
income, therefore, grew even faster than real GDP. The rise in incomes
stimulated a rapid growth in manufacturing for the domestic market, construc-
tion and services industries.
5.        The rapid growth in production was accompanied by a very satisfac-
tory increase in employment. The target of the First Plan was the creation
of 13,000 new jobs annually. Recorded employment in larger establishments
(with more than 20 employees) rose by an annual average of 8,900 between
1970 and 1976. There is evidence that unrecorded employment in smaller
establishments also grew rapidly, and that the Plan's target was virtually
achieved. The unemployment rate had fallen to about 11 percent by 1975.
In certain sectors and for certain types of jobs, in particular those re-
quiring vocational skills, labor shortages are appearing.
6.        However, Mauritius has still a core of unemployment which is proving
hard to eliminate. Almost all new jobs created during the last six years
are located in the urban strip running from Port Louis to Curepipe, which,
despite the small size of the country, is not easily acce3sible from several
of the high unemployment areas. Government is considering better locational
planning of new enterprises and improving the internal transport system to
help solve the problem. Also, a substantial part of the unemployed consists
of young people with some secondary education, but without any specific
skills.
7.        Deficiencies in education and training are a major constraint to
development. Schools do not provide adequate training for the jobs avail-
able. Shortages of trained workers have already slowed down the expansion
of the construction industry, and employers in industry and tourism have
difficulty in finding qualified workers. At present, job training is car-
ried out independently by various employers in the economy and individual
factories without much coordination. In order to raise industrial produc-
tivity and to attract more new industries to Mauritius, in particular those
requiring higher skills, it will be necessary to adopt a more systematic
approach to practical training. The establishment of a Central Training
Office under the Second Education Project is designed to fill this gap.
8.        The rapid increase in real income, combined with the fact that
incomes of enterprises (mostly sugar) rose even faster than those of wage
earners, led to substantially increased savings and investment in recent
years. Savings rose from 14 percent of GDP in 1970 to 24 percent in 1975.
Over the same period, the investment rate rose from 12 percent to 23 percent.
Most of the increased savings accrued in the private sector, and financed
re-equipment and renovation in the sugar industry, hotel and factory con-
struction, and private residences.  The Government's own savings remained low,
but a substantial part of publc investment was financed from domestic long-
term borrowing.
9.        Almost 75 percent of total investment consists of private invest-
ment. Between 1970 and 1976, private investment in real terms grew much
faster than public investment, which was constrained by a limited implementa-
tion capacity. As a result, certain mismatches have occurred between private



- 3 -
investment and supporting public investment, and Mauritius now faces physical
constraints to a continued rapid development. Water and electricity supply
will need to be expanded substantially to meet industrial, agricultural and
domestic needs. Closer planning of land use is necessary to take advantage of
existing infrastructure. Public transport and traffic management are in need
of improvement in the urban areas. The expansion of certain export industries
is hampered by the inadequacy of existing port facilities. The Second Plan
(1975-80), published in May 1976, broadly recognizes the constraints noted
above. It proposes a public investment program amounting to US$358 million
with priority being given to the diversification of agricultural production
and to infrastructure development.
10.       In 1975, the poorest 40 percent of the population shared 14 percent
of total income, while the richest 20 percent had 55 percent. These figures
show that income distribution in Mauritius is somewhat more uneven than in
most developing countries. This, however, is mainly due to the predominance
of the sugar industry, which is to a large extent in the hands of relatively
few people. On the other hand, 1975 is not entirely representative, because
unusually high sugar prices caused windfall profits in the industry that
year. The Government is committed to improving the income distribution in
the country. The principa,l vehicle for this is the creation of new jobs
for the unemployed.  Also, in recent years, when rising profits in the sugar
industry and imported inflation threatened to erode the Government's redis-
tributive aims, the Government acted by allowing wages to increase sharply
and by directing a large part of its current expenditures towards transfers
and food subsidies, which mainly benefited the poorer sections of the popula-
tion.
11.       Thus, the Government's policies with respect to the current budget
have been rather more effective at achieving the social goal of reducing in-
come disparities than at mobilizing domestic savings for public investment.
Up to 1975, the Government: could afford to increase current expenditures
rapidly, as tax revenue a'Lso increased fast as a result of higher sugar
profits. After 1975, however, sugar prices have declined sharply. While
Mauritius had realized US$374 per ton for its 1975 crop, the price is esti-
mated to be only US$285 per ton in 1977. But for the sale of the greater
part of output at well above US$300 per ton under the EEC sugar agreement, the
average export price in 1977 would have been much lower because of the sharp
drop in world sugar prices. Tax revenue started stagnating, and it became
clear that current expenditure had been allowed to increase to a level that
could not easily be sustained in a period of lower sugar prices. The current
budget, which showed a surplus of US$25 million in 1975/76, had a deficit
of US$6 million in 1976/77. For 1977/78, an even larger deficit of almost
US$25 million is expected. As sugar prices are expected to recover only
slowly, restrictive budgetary policies will be necessary.  The Government
has already taken some steps to increase revenue and to dampen demand, but
stronger measures are called for if, as it is the Government's intention,
public savings are to contribute substantially to the financing of public
investment.
12.       Because of the fall in sugar prices and the continued strong demand
for imports, the balance of payments for 1976 closed with a current account
deficit of almost US$50 million, as compared to a surplus of US$21 million in



- 4 -
1975. A somewhat larger current account deficit is estimated to have occurred
in 1977. Consequently, there was a substantial fall in foreign exchange
reserves, which declined from US$166 million (5.4 months of imports) at the
end of 1975 t- US$71 million (2.1 months of imports) in November 1977, in
spite of a compensatory drawing from IMF of US$12.8 million. As a policy
measure to restrain aggregate spending and the demand for imports, the bank
rate was raised by 2 percentage points to 9 percent and stricter credit curbs
were introduced in January 1978. A Trust Fund loan and a standby credit of
US$9.3 million (first credit tranche) were recently approved by the IMF. The
amount of the Trust Fund loan has not yet been determined but is likely to be
about US$11.5 million.
13.       If the Government succeeds in restoring the internal and external
financial equilibrium, the prospects for further long-term growth are good.
With continued industrialization, an annual GDP growth rate of 5 to 6 percent
could be attained. Barring another boom in sugar prices, however, a larger
proportion of investment than before will have to be financed from foreign
capital inflows. Public external capital inflows averaged about US$6 million
a year over the five years ending in 1976, and we estimate that they will
have to average about US$60 million a year over the next five years. Pros-
pects for mobilizing long-term public loans are favorable. Mauritius' Asso-
ciated Membership in the European Economic Community has given it access
to financing from the European Development Fund and the European Investment
Bank. Mauritius is also eligible for loans from the African Development Bank,
the African Development Fund and BADEA.
14.       Mauritius' external public debt is very low.  At the end of 1976,
the amount outstanding and disbursed was US$46.3 million, US$9.7 million of
which was held by IBRD and US$11.0 million by IDA. Total service payments in
1976 were US$3.7 million, of which US$1.3 million to IBRD (35 percent) and
US$0.4 million to IDA (11 percent). The ratio of debt service to exports was
one percent in 1976. On the basis of the present level of commitments and
disbursements, the country's total public debt outstanding and disbursed is
projected to rise to US$105 million by 1985, of which the Bank's share is
expected to be about US$26 million (25 percent) and IDA's US$20 million (19
percent). Total service payments in 1985 are projected to amount to US$8.6
million, of which the Bank's share will be US$2.9 million (33 percent) and
IDA's US$0.3 million (3 percent). If future capital requirements were to be
attracted on non-concessional terms (an average maturity of 12 years with 2
years grace and 10 percent interest), debt service would reach the equivalent
of about 8 percent of export earnings by 1985. In reality, however, foreign
capital is likely to be available on less hard terms, and the debt service
ratio is not likely to be much higher than 5 percent by 1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITIUS
15.       Mauritius has received five IDA credits and seven Bank loans (in-
cluding one loan on Third Window terms) totaling US$64.3 million to help
finance projects in industry (US$27.5 million), infrastructure (US$20.6



-5-
million), agriculture (US$9.2 million) and education (US$7 million).  IFC
made a loan in 1971 for hotel construction and has recently approved a second
project in the same sector. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA ,Credits, and of IFC investments in Mauritius as ofFebruary 28,
1978, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Implementation of the
industrial and infrastructural projects is generally satisfactory. The First
Education and the Smallholder Tea Development Projects initially faced man-
agement problems but these have now been brought under control. The manage-
ment of the Rural Development Project still requires some strengthening and
the matter is being followed up.
16.       A Second Education Project designed to support the Government's
educational reform has been submitted to the Board for consideration at its
March 30 meeting. The program for Bank Group lending to Mauritius will con-
tinue to support the Government's strategy of promoting economic diversifica-
tion and creating employment through the development of industry. We expect
the Development Bank of Mauritius to remain the main channel for Bank Group
assistance to the country's industrialization efforts and will continue to
assist in sustaining its role as Mauritius' leading financial institution.
Growing industrialization has resulted in a heightened need for infrastruc-
tural improvements. In future, we expect to participate in projects aimed
at improving and expanding infrastructure and related institutions. The
Government has been assured of our willingness to consider support for water
resources development as soon as measures can be taken to strengthen the
financial position of the Central Water Authority.  A First Highway Project has
been identified and is expected to be studied by consultants later this year.
PART III - THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
17.       Mauritius has no known fossil fuel reserves.  The main indigenous
sources of commercial energy are hydroelectric power and bagasse, a byproduct
of sugarcane refining, which is burned in generating plants located on sugar
estates.
18.       Although the earliest power generation in Mauritius at the turn
of the century was by hydroelectric plant, there has been in recent years a
substantial program of installing diesel generation sets. Rising fuel oil
prices have now encouraged a further search for hydropower sites. There is
some additional hydroelectric potential in the Grand River South East and
Grand River North West basins, but total indigenous potential is much lower
than present consumption, and Mauritius will continue to depend on imported
fossil fuels.
Energy Policy
19.       The Government: does not yet have a firm energy policy to determine
its objectives and goals for the use of indigenous and imported energy by



-6 -
various sectors. Water resources of the Grand River South East and Grand
River North West are being used both for irrigation and eLectric power genera-
tion but there is no systematic allocation. Electric energy produced with
imported fuel oil has been priced under its cost and the use of electricity
has been encouraged by CEB for many years. As a result of this policy, CEB
is now having difficulty in meeting the daily peak demand for electric power,
nearly half of which is for domestic use. Coal and various petroleum products
including liquified petroleum gas could provide alternative energy resources
for part of domestic consumption because of their higher heating efficiency.
The proposed project would include a comprehensive energy study to reassess
the use and allocation of indigenous and imported energy resources to various
users, based on economic costs and benefits (see paragraph 29 below).
Existing Facilities
20.       CEB has about 88 MW of power generating facilities, of which 62 MW
are diesel and the balance hydro. Further, 16 sugar estates own and operate
private generating plants based on process steam and bagasse, and two small
hydroelectric stations, with a combined capacity of 44 MW. However, only 15
MW of this is available for the use of CEB during each crop season.  Although
the Government and CEB are considering more efficient use of bagasse and
operation of estates plants during the inter-crop season, plans have not yet
been studied in detail.  To encourage inter-crop season operation of plants
in sugar estates, CEB is considering to enter an agreement with one of the
sugar estates soon. Fuel oil would be used for energy production during the
inter-crop season.
21.       CEB has an extensive 66, 22 and 6.6 kV network covering the whole
island. At present, overhead lines measure about 3,500 km and underground
cables about 100 km .
Access to Electricity and Rural Electrification
22.       The Government has for many years given high priority to rural
electrification. At present, more than 80 percent of the population have
access to electricity through about 120,000 domestic connections. Only
a few villages remain to be electrified. CEB's current plans call for
full electrification of the island by end-1978.
Power Market
23.       In 1966 the population of Mauritius was about 730,000.  That year
CEB generated and purchased 112 GWH, giving a per capita usage of about 153
kWH. By 1976, the population had risen to about 840,000 and electric energy
generation and purchase by CEB was 270 GWH, or about 321 kWH per capita.
Thus, an increase of 15 percent (about 1.4 percent per annum) in the popu-
lation was accompanied by an increase of 110 percent (about 7.8 percent per
annum) in per capita electricity use and 141 percent (about 9 percent per
annum) in total power generation. The growth has been particularly rapid
since 1970 with an average rate of 12 percent. The present mix of energy



7
sales is as follows:  40 percent goes for domestic sales, 23 percent for
commercial sales and 20 percent for industrial sales; the balance is used
essentially for irrigation. A discernible trend since 1970 has been the
more rapid growth of commercial and industrial sales which increased their
combined market share from 38.5 percent in 1970 to 46 percent in 1975. The
number of connections rose by about 54 percent (about 4.4 percent per annum)
from 86,000 to 133,000 and average revenue per kWH rose by about 96 percent
(about 7 percent per annum), from M&19.21 to MJ37.84 during the same period.
24.       CEB and consultants have prepared forecasts of energy sales and
maximum demand over the 1977-1986 period based on trend analysis for each
category of consumers. The annual growth rate in domestic sales are assumed
to decline from 14 percent in 1975 to 8.5 percent from 1980 onwards. Annual
growth rate in commercial and industrial sales would gradually decline from
9 percent and 15 percent respectively in 1975 to 7.5 percent and 10.7 percent
from 1982 onwards.
CEB Development Program
25.       CEB's generation program submitted to the appraisal mission included
two 12-MW diesel sets at St. Louis to be commissioned in September 1978, fol-
lowed in 1979 by two additional 12-MW diesel sets, and in 1980 by a 15-MW
hydrostation at Quatre Soeurs and a 5-MW hydrostation at Diamamouve, upstream
of Quatre Soeurs. Development plans between 1980 and 1986 call for three
additional 12-MW diesel sets at Mer Rouge. Bids for the Quatre Soeurs scheme
were received in October 1977 but were substantially higher than CEB's esti-
mates. Government, CEB and external lenders (BADEA and CCCE) are review-
ing the merits of the project to decide whether or not to proceed with it in
these new circumtances. In addition, the Central Water Authority is consider-
ing the development of a multi-purpose irrigation/water supply scheme at
Baptiste/Guibies which could have a power generation component. The merits of
the project are also being reviewed in the light of substantial increases in
the cost estimates (see paragraph 36 below).
26.       To estimate its firm thermal capacity CEB relies on experience,
statistics of availability of generating units, maintenance schedules for
thermal plants and expected future generation sets. On this basis, two
large diesel sets of 6.5 MW each at Fort Victoria and one large set together
with two smaller sets at St. Louis with a combined capacity of 13.6 MW are
considered as system thermal reserve.
27.       A long-range construction program for transmission, primary and
secondary distribution was prepared by CEB's consultants in 1976.  It covers
the future development of the transmission system from 1977 onwards to meet
the steadily increasing demand. With the planned program, the capacity of
the transmission system would by 1981/82 reach a level sufficient to cope
with the anticipated loads until the year 1990.  Thus, after 1982/83 the pro-
gram for transmission is mainly confined to adding transformers and switch-
gears at the proposed 66/22-kV substations.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Mauritius - Power
Transmission Project" (No. 1770a-MAS) dated March 17, 1978 is being dis-
tributed separately. A supplementary project data sheet is given in Annex
III. The project was prepared by CEB and consultants and appraised by a Bank
mission in July 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington, D. C., from
February 8 to 10, 1978. The Mauritius delegation was led by the Hon. Busawon,
Minister of Power, Fuel and Energy, and CEB was represented by Mr. Labat,
General Manager.
Project Objectives and Description
29.       The objective of the proposed project is to provide additional power
transmission and distribution capacity to supply points; increase reliability
of the system operations; and strengthen the organization and operations of
CEB. Transmission lines and substations included in the project area are
located in the western part of the island where about 80 percent of the total
population and most of Mauritius' industry are situated. More specifically,
the project consists of:
(a) construction of 66-kV and 22-kV transmission
facilities (consisting of about 75 km of power
transmission lines, about 8 km of underground cables
and 275 MVA of transformer capacity);
(b) extensions to CEB's distribution system;
(c) construction of a system control center;
(d) consulting services to undertake the comprehensive
energy study referred to in paragraph 19 above,
as well as an organization and management study, an
updating of CEB's development program and a system
control study; and
(e) training.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
30.       The estimated total project cost is about US$18.9 million equivalent,
net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.0 million.
Detailed costs are as follows:

31.       The proposed loan of US$15.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project, which represents about 80 percent of total
project cost. Interest during construction on the proposed loan, about US$2.0
million, and the project's local cost would be financed from CEB's own funds.
The Borrower
32.       CEB, the borrower of the proposed loan, was established inr 1952 as
a statutory body, following the Government's acquisition and consolidation
of several private electricity undertakings. Since 1956, CEB has been the
sole public supplier of electricity and has had the full responsibility for
operating and developing the interconnected electric power system on the
island. The proposed loan would be the second Bank operation in the power
sector in Mauritius. In 1963, before Independence, the Bank made a US$7 mil-
lion loan (Loan 355-MAS) to Mauritius with the guarantee of the United Kingdom
to help CEB to. finance the foreign exchange cost of the first stage of the
Fort Victoria Diesel Station with a transmission expansion component. CEB
completed the project within the estimated construction schedule and cost.



- 10 -
33.       CEB's Board of Directors consists of 11 members comprising a chair-
man, the General Manager, three representatives of government ministries
(Finance, Ministry of Power, Fuel and Energy, and Economic Planning and
Development), a representative of the Central Water Authority, two repre-
sentatives of the respective urban and rural electricity consumer groups and
three representatives from the private sector. The Governor General appoints
all the non ex-officio members of the Board who are nominated by the Minister
of Power, Fuel and Energy. CEB's Board meets once a month. The General
Manager is responsible for day-to-day operations. CEB has seven main de-
partments for planning, construction, generation (thermal and hydro), trans-
mission, distribution and energy sales, and two smaller departments for
administration and internal auditing. The present structure and functions
have evolved on an ad hoc basis over the years. Although the structure is
generally adequate for CEB to conduct its operations, generation and financial
planning functions could be further strengthened. CEB has recognized the need
for a comprehensive organization and management study, which would also
include a review of the existing management information system with a view to
recommending improvements. This study, which is to be completed by July 1,
1979, is included in the proposed project. CEB has agreed to discuss the
study's recommendations with the Bank and implement agreed proposals there-
after (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       CED has had capable general managers since its inception and is
reasonably well-managed. The total number of staff was about 1,600 at the
end of 1976.  The size of the staff is adequate if account is taken of the
scope of CEB's operations and construction undertaken on force account basis.
Operations and maintenance of the power plants and transmission systems are
good. System control and planning need some improvement, particularly in
the areas of system frequency and voltage control, and reactive load supply.
The proposed project provides for the construction of a suitable system
control center with the necessary instruments and telemetering equipment.
35.       CEB's training activities for technical staff are satisfactory.
Electricite de France set up a vocational trainign school with assistance
from the French Government in 1974. However, higher level personnel have
no opportunity to broaden their knowledge and experience to cover areas such
as planning and system control. The proposed project provides US$0.2 million
for short-term overseas training of eight CEB's engineers/managers to meet
the above need. Furthermore, CEB will by April 1, 1979 submit to the Bank for
review a training program for its management staff (Section 3.08 of the draft
Loan Agreement). The training component of the project would be geared mainly
to strengthening CEB's planning and system control capabilities.
36.       CEB's development program described in paragraph 25 above was
developed by consultants in March 1976 and is based on 1975 costs,  Tt does
not give adequate consideration to alternative forms of generation (e.g.
hydroschemes or coal-fired thermal plants) nor does it demonstrate that it
is the least-cost solution for power generation. An updating of the program,
to be completed by July 1, 1979,has been included in the proposed project



- 11 -
(Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement) and CEB's construction program will
thereafter be periodically reviewed with the Bank (Section 3.09 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
37.       CEB's existing system control center at Curepipe is not adequate,
particularly with regard to switching operations, load dispatching and system
safety. Under the proposed project, CEB would carry out and complete by
July 1, 1979 a detailed system control study of the design of load dispatching
and switching facilities, and implement agreed study's recommendations there-
after (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.       CEB's plantsand installations are not insured against fire, floods
or cyclones and at present the company has no reserve against such damages.
CEB has therefore agreed to undertake a study on the merits of an insurance
coverage of its generating plants and transmission and distribution facilities
against major disasters to dLetermine whether commercial insurance is prefer-
able to funded reserve, and subsequently to implement the recommended course
of action no later than July 1, 1979 (Section 3.12 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment).
Financial Aspects
39.       Since 1972, the fiLnancial performance of CEB has not been satisfac-
tory. CEB has failed to meet two important financial objectives previously
agreed under the first IBRD loan, namely to earn a minimum of 8 percent annual
return on net assets based on historical costs and to maintain a debt service
coverage of at least 1.5. 'Chis was brought about mainly by rapid cost escala-
tions, particularly fuel costs, which were not matched by adequate and timely
tariff increases. The cyclone Gervaise which hit the island in February 1975
also caused substantial damage to CEB's interconnected power system and
adversely affected the company's earning capacity. Because of its poor earn-
ings during 1972-76, CEB contributed only 4 percent towards its construction
expenditures during this period. In 1977, CEB's financial condition improved,
following a 30 percent increase in tariffs in June of that year. CEB and
the Government have decided that tariffs will be increased by a further 30
percent as of October 1, 1978. Implementation of this increase would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (Sections 4.08 and 7.01
of the draft Loan Agreement). CEB's tariffs will be adjusted from time to
time to enable it to earn at least 8 percent on its revalued net operating
assets and the revaluation of assets will be carried out annually on the
basis of sound and consistently maintained methods of valuation acceptable
to the Bank (Sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the draft Loan Agreement). The asset
valuation methods will be based on the Cost of Living Index published in the
Government Gazette. Smaller tariff increases are envisaged by mid-1980 and
mid-1982. It is now expected that CEB will contribute about 25 percent
towards its investment program for the period 1977-82.



- 12 -
40.       The existing tariff structure does not adequately reflect cost, and
pricing is highly promotional. Moreover, CEB's future demand would have to be
met essentially from thermal generation, which is costlier. CEB is currently
conducting a tariff study based on the long-term marginal cost of power
supply. This study should be completed for discussion with the Bank not later
than January 31, 1980 and implementation of agreed recommendations thereafter
(Section 3.10 of the draft Loan Agreement).
41.       CEB'S billing and collection record is satisfactory.  The accounts,
which were computerized in 1976, are well kept and reports are prepared rea-
sonably promptly. The accounting procedures and practices are satisfactory,
but the budgeting process and cost control mechanism could be further im-
proved. CEB's accounts are audited annually by a local auditing firm. The
scope of the audit is generally satisfactory. In future, CEB would submit to
the Bank its audited accounts, together with the auditors' report, within six
months after the close of each fiscal year (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
42.       In order to ensure that future borrowings by CEB would be commen-
surate with its ability to service debts, CEB would not incur any debts un-
less internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times its future debt service
(Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Implementation and Engineering
43.       CEB would be responsible for the execution of the project.  The
various studies included in the project, other than the insurance coverage
study, would be carried out by consultants who will be retained on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. The proposed transmission works would be
executed on force account, but CEB would use contractors for civil works,
tower supply and erection to supplement its present capacity when necessary.
The extensions to CEB's distribution system included in the proposed project
would consist of specific, smaller 6.6-kV transformers, switchgears, power
lines and customer connections and would be progressively carried out by CEB
after consultation with and approval by the Bank (Section 3.07 of the draft
Loan Agreement). The installation of substations and extensions to the
distribution system included in the project would be executed by CEB staff.
These arrangements are satisfactory.
44.       CEB staff has had substantial experience in the design and execution
of 22-kV and lower transmission line works. In the development of their 66-kV
network, they have carried out most of the design functions. Therefore,
engineering, construction and construction supervision will be carried out by
various departments of CEB. Concrete steel reinforced transmission poles for
22-kV lines would be produced in CEB's own workshops using imported cement and
steel. The cost of locally made poles is much lower than that of imported
concrete poles.



- 13 -
Procurement and Disburseaent-
45.       All imported equipment and materials for project works would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. Contractors for civil works, tower supply and erection
will be hired in accordance with local bidding procedures acceptable to the
Bank.
46.       Disbursement from the loan would be made against 100 percent of
expenditures for equipment and materials imported for the project, and the
foreign cost of consultancy and training services. Disbursement for these
items will be fully documented and are expected to be completed by the end
of December 1983.
Benefits and Risks
47.       Because of the difficulties in computing the benefits of the items
which make up the project, it has not been possible to calculate a separate
rate of return for the project. The project, however, is the least-cost solu-
tion for the transmission and distribution of electricity for meeting forecast
demand. The economic rate of return of CEB's total development plan includ-
ing the proposed project, is estimated at 15 percent, if benefits are meas-
ured by incremental revenues attributable to the total investment in the sys-
tem at the present tariff level of Mg 49.0 per kWH. When the average tariff
level increases by about 30 percent (Mi 63.0 per kWH sold), the rate of re-
turn would be about 18 percent. In addition, the project is expected to yield
a number of other benefits such as consumers' surplus, the improvement in the
reliability of electricity supply, and reduction in system losses. The pro-
posed updating of the generation program would further optimize and, there-
fore, lower the investment cost of generation and construction, which would
increase the rate of return.
48.       There is no unusual risk with regard to the physical execution of
the project. However, there is a risk that financial targets may not be
reached if CEB finds itself unable to implement tariff increases at times
and of magnitudes requirecl. If this were to affect the 30 percent increase
decided for implementation on October 1, 1978, loan effectiveness would be
postponed.  The design and extent of thie proposed transmission and distri-
bution project is not dependent on the location of future generating facili-
ties, except in respect of the Baptiste/Guibies scheme (see paragraph 25
above).  If the GovernmenlL and Central Water Authority were to cancel the
scheme or to build it witl,out ttie power generation component, 4 km of 22-kV
lines connecting Guibies with the system would not be constructed. This
item, however, represents less thian 2 percent of the project. In the event
of cancellation of the Guibies scheme, the funds allocated to this item
(about US$0.38 million) would be used to finance further extensions to CEB s
distribution system.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CEB, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank, and the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III of this Report. Implementation of a 30 percent increase in CEB's
tariffs would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 239-MAS Smallholder Tea Development Project; US$5.2 million credit
of April 9, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: June 11, 1971;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1978
Project field development experienced problems due to poor soil
and drainage conditions, poor quality of planting materials and the effect
of a cyclone which hit Mauritius in February 1975. These difficulties were
aggravated by general problems facing the Mauritian tea industry, especially
rapidly increasing wage raties in the sugar industry with which the tea sector
is unable to compete. These problems were examined in 1975 by a study group
which included Bank staff members. The recommendations of the study group,
which included suggestions on what the role of the Tea Development Authority
should be, were accepted by the Government and are being implemented.
Project accounts are now in better shape, following the appointment of a
qualified financial controller and a chief accountant. Field work is now
proceeding on schedule and the first project plantations should be ready for
handover to smallholders in 1977-78.  The Government has agreed to provide
additional labor in 1977/78 (through the Development Works Corporation) to
ensure that green leaf is plucked and factories work to new capacity. The
new tea factory has been ccmpleted and has commenced operations.
Credit No. 411-MAS Industrial Estate Project; US$4.0 million credit of
June 29, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 1, 1973;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1980
Construction of the Coromandel Industrial Estate is virtually
completed with the exception of some external works such as street lighting,
telephone installations, etc. Original construction schedule called for com-
pletion by the end of 1978. Occupancy, however, is proceeding slowly. As
of December 1977 only about 45 percent of the available space was occupied,
which reflects the general investment slowdown in the country. The Estate
expects that full occupancy can be reached around mid-1980. As of
February 28, 1978, approximately $3.8 million of the $4.0 million credit had
been disbursed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 419-MAS Rural Development Project; US$4.0 million credit of
July 9, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 11, 1973;
Closing Date: February 28, 1979
The implementation of the rural development project has been mixed.
Several factors caused a slow progress, including procurement difficulties
and the rise in sugar prices which caused land prices to rise sharply, thus
making it difficult for the Government to obtain land for the project. The
February 1975 cyclone also contributed to the delay. Managerial problems
within the Development Works Corporation (DWC) which are now being followed
up, initially prevented prompt execution of the project.
The mid-term evaluation mission that visited Mauritius in August
1977 confirmed that some of the components of the project, such as bench
terracing and fodder planting, have not been successful and have been dis-
continued. The village improvement component, which formed the major part
of the project, was generally satisfactory although the village markets seem
to have been over-designed and are presently underutilized. According to the
mission, the training component is by far the most successful component of
the project. The mission also confirmed that DWC is less than adequately
managed, although this seems to have had a greater impact on operations other
than those included in the IDA-financed project. The project is now expected
to be completed by the end of 1978. To allow for full disbursement of the
credit, the Closing Date has been extended to February 1979.
Loan No. 976-MAS    Port Project; US$10.0 million loan of April 12, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 13, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Loan No. 1339-T-MAS Revised Port Project; US$3.6 million Third Window loan of
December 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 27, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Physical execution of the project is proceeding well. The Mauritius
Marine Authority has been formally established and is now operational. The
Authority has made interim contractual arrangements with one of the dock
companies for lighterage and cargo handling operations and is making good
progress in exercising its responsibilities.
Loan No. 1033-MAS    First Education Project:  US$3.5 million Loan and US$3.5
and           million credit of July 29, 1974; Date of Effectiveness:
Credit No. 501-MAS   October 29, 1974; Closing Date:  March 31, 1980
After a slow start, project implementation is now proceeding satis-
factorily and all major contracts for construction, furniture and equipment
have been awarded. The program unit is fully staffed and operating well. To
reflect the Government's decision to restructure secondary education, changes
in the construction component of the project have become necessary. About
9,120 student places would be created by converting the six four-year lower
