          carrying out its development plan for the period 1977-1982\n            by providing additional power transmission and distribution\n            capacity to supply points; increasing reliability for the\n            system operations, and strengthening CEB's organization\n            and operations. Its major components include: (i)\n            construction of 66-kV and 22-kV transmission extensions\n            (consisting of about 75 km of power transmission lines,\n            about 8 km of underground cables and 275 MVA of transformer\n            capacity); (ii) extensions to the distribution system; (iii)\n            construction of a system control center; (iv) consulting\n            services to carry out various studies; and (v) training. The\n            project is the least-cost solution for the transmission and\n            distribution of electricity for meeting forecast demand;\n            improvement in the reliability of electricity supply and\n            reduction in system losses as well as increased efficiency\n            in the operation of CEB."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
