The lessons\n            learned in this second adjustment operation confirm the\n            lessons learned in the Contractual Savings Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project. The lessons are as follows: 1) In\n            preparing complex sector adjustment operations, the Bank\n            should lead with its comparative advantage which is bringing\n            to bear strong technical capacity and ample cross-country\n            experience. The Borrower must be confident that its dialogue\n            with the Bank will be of added value to its own efforts. 2)\n            In designing a sector adjustment loan, political factors and\n            the legislative needs of the client need to be understood\n            and included in the dialogue with the client, particularly\n            in an election year. 3) Rather than risk delays and failure\n            in the achievement of the program's long term aims by\n            locking the client into an overly ambitious and politically\n            sensitive policy agenda, the Bank should choose to negotiate\n            a medium-term reform strategy, and allocate its reform goals\n            over a series of single-tranche adjustment operations - a\n            lending vehicle designed specifically to protect the\n            integrity of lengthy adjustment operations from significant\n            political shifts in borrowing countries."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
