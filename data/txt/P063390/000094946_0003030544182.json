program aiming at 1) improving\n            competition in the banking sector establishing a more level\n            playing field between public and private banks; 2)\n            strengthening banking regulation, supervision, and\n            inspection; 3) restructuring public banks; 4) assisting in\n            the privatization of a bank under public management; 5)\n            introducing more transparency in the financial sector; and\n            6) assisting in the modernization of the financial\n            sector's legal framework. The loan will be disbursed in\n            one tranche, upon loan effectiveness. The Bank's\n            strategy is to support incremental policy improvements in\n            the financial sector, while continuing the dialogue and\n            technical work needed to ensure consensus on more far\n            reaching financial sector reforms in the future. To\n            accelerate the pace of policy reform in Uruguay, the\n            executive authorities need to be able to present the policy\n            options to the various stakeholders, the public, the trade\n            unions and the Parliament, in a convincing manner. To\n            address this need, the loan also supports the creation of a\n            Technical Unit that will conduct legal and technical studies\n            in key areas of concern in the financial sector which will\n            be the basis of policy reform proposals submitted for\n            discussion among the different interested parties, including\n            members of Parliament."}, "docdt": "2000-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
