                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured in December 2010, as follows:
                         (1) the closing date was extended from 31 December 2010 to 30 June 2011 to allow for completion of civil works;
                         (2) proceeds were reallocated because of an increase in unit costs for construction and the previous unanticipated shifting of some large contracts from one category to another; (3)
                         the Project Development Objective (PDO) outcome indicator and target related to net enrollment of the poorest children has been revised consistent with available statistics. Largely
                         to increase clarity and reduce repetition, revisions have also been made to the intermediate outcome indicators.
