1.      The closing date for the Dominican Republic Early Childhood Education Project,
(Loan 7144-DO, P054937) will be extended from June 30, 2011 to August 30, 2011. The
extension is necessary to allow the Government sufficient time to finalize the remaining
civil works and receipt of goods.

2.      Although the World Bank’s team has met with the Borrower three times since the
last extension in December 2010 and has maintained close contact with the Project
Manager to monitor progress, unforeseen factors arose that could not have been
anticipated at the time of the extension. The Minister of Education was abruptly replaced
in March 2011. The new Minister changed a number of key staff, including the Vice
Minister of Infrastructure and the members of the Procurement Committee. The
Procurement Committee required further review of all pending contracts. Several of the
small works and goods contracts under this Project were affected. Resulting delays in
contracting of construction firms pushed construction into the start of the rainy season. It
rained heavily in the Dominican Republic in May and June, and most works slowed
considerably. Since most are small works, they could be completed in 20 to 30 days. The
two-month extension provides ample margin to ensure their completion, as well as the
final receipt of goods coming from overseas.

3.      Project objectives continue to be achievable. This will be the final extension of
the Project.
