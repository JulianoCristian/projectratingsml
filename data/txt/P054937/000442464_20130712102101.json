Some lessons learned included: lack of\n            attention to country context in project design can lead to\n            considerable delays and inefficiencies. The solutions given\n            by the capacity assessment conducted at appraisal were\n            inadequate to mitigate the well-known shortfall in\n            procurement capacity, particularly in light of frequent\n            staff turnover. Greater proximity to pre-primary education\n            is necessary but not sufficient for poor parents to enroll\n            their children. In the absence of strong selection criteria\n            and explicit mechanisms for evaluating new approaches,\n            learning from innovation funds will be limited. Without\n            strong monitoring and evaluation, there was no way to\n            identify projects worthy of replication and scaling-up, as\n            well as learn from the fund. Providing teachers with\n            training, the necessary classroom supplies, and ongoing\n            support from pedagogical groups, coupled with monitoring the\n            implementation of the pedagogical model can improve quality\n            in pre-primary classrooms."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
