All such restructurings are\n            approved by the Regional Vice Presidents (RVPs). The changes\n            include the following: 1) elimination of one project\n            development objective (PDO) outcome indicator and\n            modification of three other PDO outcome indicators; 2)\n            modification of the PDO output indicators for classroom\n            construction and rehabilitation; 3) formalization of\n            Rincones Tecnologicos as a stand-alone subcomponent within\n            component two; 4) permission for single-source contracting\n            with a teaching training institute; 5) elimination of\n            aggregate limits for the use of various procurement methods\n            and the selection of consultants; and 6) permission for\n            reallocation of funds among categories."}, "docdt": "2008-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
