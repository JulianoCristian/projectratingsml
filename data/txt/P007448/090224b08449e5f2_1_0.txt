          THE CONTEXT OF TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
               AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL - AN OVERVIEW

Curricu lar reform in secondar y educatio n in general, and in
secondar y vocation al educatio n in particul ar, is premised on
the assumpti on that the curriculu m can be improved , modified or
undergo some manner of change so as to enhance curricul ar
~ractices and better achieve the goals that the curriculu m is
intended to accompl ish.     Such a judgment is usually predicat ed
upon an  analysis  of  current   circumst ances, and upon substant ive
evidence that such    reform  initiativ  es are indeed necessar y.
Studies which   have  been done   in  the  recent past do point to
concerns  which  may  warrant  compreh   ensive educatio nal reform.
But  the nature  and  directio n  of  the  reform initiativ e must be
firmly rooted in the context and circumst ances within which
curriculu m efforts are now embedded .

  The purpose of this section of the report is to look at the
. context within which the technica l vocation al curriculu m is
  currentl y administ ered and delivere d, and to examine the
  circumst ances which now affect the impleme ntation of the
  curriculu m. The approach to this analysis is necessa rily brief
  and summativ e since its primary intent is to highligh t some of
  the major issues which may have implicat ions for any form of
  curricul ar change.   It is assumed that if any technica l
  vocation al curriculu m ig to be successf ul, certain
  precond itions must be met: some minimum educatio nal
  infrastr ucture must be in place; and some level of cohesive ness
  must be establis hed.   To ascertai n the degree to which these
  factors affect the   current  delivery of technica l vocation al
  educatio n, a few critical   areas  of performa nce will be
  assessed .  The followin g areas   of performa nce are discusse d
  below:

     a.   The scope of the secondar y technica l vocation al
          educatio n function .
     b.   The national training context of which secondar y
          technica l vocation al educatio n is a part.
     c.   Teachers .
     d.   Materia ls, faciliti es and equipme nt.
     e.   Curricul um content.
     f.   Curricul um specific ation and standard s.
     g.   Certific ation in technica l vocation .
     h.   Secondar y Technica l Vocation al Educatio n in the context
          of the National Labour Market.
     i.   Monitori ng and supervis ion.
     j.   Industry Liaison and particip ation.
     k.   Articula tion.
     1.   Timetab ling.
     m.   The cost of Vocation al Educatio n.
                                                                 3
The Scope of Secondary Technical Vocational Education

Technical vocational education at the secondary level
represents the largest and perhaps the most costly component of
the national system for technical vocational education and
training.  Some type of vocational curriculum is offered in
virtually all secondary schools.  And. in addition to the
agricultural subjects offered as part of the primary and
secondary curriculum there are two secondary vocational schools
offering primarily agricultural courses.

If the incidence of vocational training is used as the key
indicator. opportunities for technical vocational education at
the secondary level abound.  For one reason or the other. all
types of secondary schools offer vocational subjects.  The
technical high school served to generally expand technical and
vocational education and training for the targeted age group;
the comprehensive secondary and the new secondary schools were
part of general thrust to vocationalize the secondary
curriculum; and the traditional high schools are increasingly
incorporating vocational subjects in response to expressed need
and social relevance.  The vocational courses which exist in a
few of the all-age schools are generally intended to assist
students in acquiring marketable skills since their prospects
for further secondary education are discouraging.

The scope of the technical vocatiorial enterprise is as wide as
it is diverse.   A total of 241 schools offer some form of
technical vocational education.   And. while the types of
courses offered by each school may vary. a total of 15 subjects
are offered .. These subjects (and their sub-elements where they
exist) are listed in figure 1 and at the levels at which these
subjects are done are noted in Table 1.   General Home
Economics. Woodwork. Technical Drawing. Metalwork. Agriculture.
and Art and Craft are typically done in grades 7-9. Few
schools off er Electrical or Electronics as subjects at this
level.  Subjects such as Clothing and Textiles. Food and
Nutrition. Home Management. Carpentry and Cabinet Making.
Machineshop and Welding and other courses of a vocational
nature are generally offered in grades ten (10) and eleven
(11).  But other subjects such as Auto Mechanics. Electrical
Installation and Plumbing can be found as part of the
vocational programs in selected secondary schools.

In sum. while there are standard technical vocational offerings
at the secondary level. and while there is a general philosophy
of offering exploratory courses in grades 7-9 and more
specializ~d courses in grades 10 and 11 (although the emphasis
remains exploratory). the scope of courses offered in the
secondary school. although rich and diverse. represents a
significant expansion of subjects based more on history.
tradition. social need and opportunism than on economic
relevance and cost efficiency criteria.  The first column of
Appendix D shows the number of schools by school type which
offer selected vocational subjects.

4
As programs have expanded, so has enrollment.  There is an
average of 25 students in each vocational class while
enrollment in some vocational classes is as high as 39
students.  It appears that many of these classes are
oversubscribed thus placing a significant burden on available
resources.  No analysis was conducted of class enrollment by
school type, but a cursory examination of the data reveals that
classes in the all-age and new secondary schools are, on the
average, larger than classes in other schools.

Another aspect of the scope of technical vocational education
at the secondary level is the geographic distribution of
technical vocational courses. Appendix A presents. by school
type and parish. the name of schools and the type of courses
offered.  An examination of the data reveals two critical
points. First. it will be noted that for some parishes,
Kingston/St. Andrew for instance. there is extensive
duplication of courses.   Schools in close proximity generally
offer the same type of courses.   In light of the expenses
incurred in mounting technical vocational courses. it may not
be necessary to have such a high level of duplication.
Vocational programs can be consolidated so that there is an
adequate representation of courses to more cost effectively
serve the population.   In such cases. a group of selected
schools can use the facilities at one school. or secondary
vocational centers can be established to serve several schools.

The second point to be observed is that across parishes.
especially in rural areas. there is an over representation of
some types of vocational programs and an under representation
of others.  This raises the question as to whether vocational
courses are distributed in a manner that is cost effective.
equitable and relevant to social and economic need.   Perhaps.
there should be a thorough investigation of the availability of
Vocational opportunities (across public and private agencies)
in each parish.   It is only on the basis of such information
that a cost effective training system can be established so
training responsibilities are allocated where they are most
efficiently. effectively and conveniently delivered.   Further,
it is only on the basis of such information that a truly
National Training System can be designed.

An attempt was made by the Technical Vocational Unit to map the
location of vocational programs by parish.   These maps are
attached as Appendix B.  Although the exercise is incomplete,
the effort is commendable and represents the beginning of the
process of rationalization of technical vocation programs
nationally.   It may be worthwhile to include on these parish
maps all public and private training opportunities so that
technical vocational training at the secondary level can be
designed and evaluated within the context of the National
Training System.

The National Training Context

There are many public and private agencies involved in
delivering technical and vocational training.  Although an
attempt will be made here to summarize the activities of these
training entities. such a summary is not considered very
critical at this point since other reports have commented on
the fragmentation of the National Training System. and since it

                                                          7
is generally known that some initiative must be taken to
streamline disparate training institutions into an articulated
and cohesive training function.  What may be more useful at
this point is: (1) to examine probable reasons why the training
enterprise has become so fragmented so that this information
can contribute to an enlightened approach to restructuring the
system; (2) to examine what may be the impediments to
restructuring the system; and (3) to look at the essential
prerequisites for a functional National Training Body.   Each of
these will be addressed in turn.

A large p~rcentage of technical vocational education and
training in the public sector is offered through the Ministry
of Education (MOE). the Ministry of Youth and Community
Development (MYCD). individual companies. association of firms
and through semi public bodies such as JAMPRO. Jamaica Economic
Development Agency.

The Ministry of Education is primarily responsible for training
in the secondary schools.  There are five types of secondary
schools and the structure and emphasis on training in each is
different.  The 11 Technical High Schools (some of these have
been converted only recently to Technical High Schools) are
perhaps the only secondary schools which have been structured
to emphasize a technical vocational type curriculum.   The
Comprehensive High Schools. and to some extent the New
Secondary schools. focus simultaneously on academic and
vocational education. having a major thrust and emphasis on
vocational courses.  The Traditional High Schools have
technical and vocational courses. and. though many do an
outstanding job in some vocational areas. they are structured
in a manner to emphasize the more academic subjects.   Since
these schools were not generally designed to offer vocational
courses. the scope of their vocational offering is not as
comprehensive as that offered in the aforementioned schools.

The All Age schools are the least well prepared to offer
vocational courses.   Of the 498 All Age schools. 25 offer
woodwork. 2 off er metal work. 115 off er Home Economics and
almost all offer some form of Art and Craft.    These schools are
only expected to offer exploratory pre-vocational courses.    The
quality of vocational courses in the All Age schools is poor.
This most certainly has resulted because these schools were not
originally designed as Vocational schools or High schools. and
because they enjoy a very low priority in the allocation of
resources.

College of Arts. Science and Technology (CAST) is the major
post secondary technical vocational training facility.

The Ministry of Youth and Community Development (MYCD) assumes
the responsibility for several training programs.  The most
prominent current provider of training is the H.E.A.R.T Trust.
The program was recently transferred to the Ministry of
Education. and this move significantly consolidates training
programmes within one Ministry.

The H.E.A.R.T. Trust operates the most extensive array of post
secondary non-formal training programmes in Jamaica.  This
includes 8 residential HEART Academies. a School Leavers
programme that provides work experience placement. and the
Solidarity Programme for self employment in small and micro
business. The 8 Academies include Garmet in Kingston. serving
the garment industry. the School of Cosmetology and the Story
Hill Academy for commercial skills in St. Andrew. Runaway Bay
Academy in St. Ann for tourism skills (which is also an
operating hotel). Portmore in St. Catherine for construction
skills. Kenilworth in Hanover for data entry and garment
construction. Ebony park in Clarendon for agriculture (operated
jointly with the Ministry or Agriculture), and Christiana in
Manchester for the Solidarity Programme - currently undergoing
transfer along with solidarity to MYCD.

Although these training facilities have virtually replaced a
national system of Industrial Training Centers (ITC) and a few
Community Training Centers (CTC) which offer training, there
are some ITC's and CTC's that are still operational. For
instance. the ITCs at Boys Town. Glendevon, Above Rocks and
Seaford Town are still in service and, it is anticipated that
another 4 ITCs will be reopened within the next year.  The
vocational programs which are offered at the four ITCs
mentioned are noted in Table 2.

The Jamaican-German Automotive School (JAGAS) and the
Vocational Training Development Institute (VTDI) are also
significant programmes.  JAGAS (operated by MYCD) offers
automotive training on a full-time. day release and evening
basis. and the VTDI offers a variety of training at the
secondary and post secondary levels.  Although its pr1mary
emphasis is vocational teacher training and skill upgrading for
different industries. the VTDI (recently transferred from MYCD
to MOE) offers a one year modular vocational training program
for students who have graduated from secondary school.   These
programs are in the following areas:  carpentry, electrical
installation. machinist/fitter. automechanics and
masonry/steelfixing.




                                                          9
In addition to the aforementioned, MYCD is also responsible for
many other skills training programs.   There is an
Apprenticeship Program which has been in competition with the
HEART School Leavers Programme.   In addition to the
Apprenticeship Program, however, skills training also occurs in
children's homes under the children's services division of
MYCD, in 4 H Centers under the 4H clubs, and in Community
Training Centers under the Social Development commission.   The
4H Centers in Rosehall and Denbigh, for instance, offer
training in Home Economiris, Livestock, farm management and
small business management.

These 4H Centers represent yet another arm in a national system
for agricultural training which spans many ministries but whose
main thrust is orchestrated by the Ministry or Agriculture.
There are three farmers training centers - Twickenham Park,
Eltham and Canaan where the Ministry of Agriculture does
in-house training; and, there are two secondary and one
post-secondary agricultural training facilities operated by the
Ministry of Education.  These represent the core of
agricultural training.

While the ministries of Education. Agriculture and Youth and
Community development represent the primary bodies for the
delivery of Technical and Vocational training. there are other
Ministries and semi-public bodies that offer a variety of
training services. most of which are technical/vocational in
nature.  The Ministries of Labour. Health and Tourism offer a
variety of training programs. as does the Bureau of Standards.
Jamaica Public Service Company and the Ministry of Production
and Planning.   In addition. the Jamaica Industrial Development
Corp (JIDC) offer training programs through the Tool Makers
Institute of Jamaica (recently consolidated within JAMPRO).
These public training programs are complemented by private
technical vocational education and training which is provided
in a variety of private schools (mainly in the commercial
subjects. and more recently in areas related to computers) and
in the private sectors where various industries. association of
industries or professional bodies offer training to their
membership.   And. even this does not fully cover the scope of
the National Training Enterprise.

When one examines the differences in training methods and
certification procedures. the significant differences in the
quality of training. the duplication in training services. the
lack of horizontal or vertical articulation between training
ent4ties. the waste of resources in an environment of scarcity
and the growing training needs. one cannot help but conclude
that such massive fragmentation in technical and vocational
training services constitutes more of a burden than a
contributor to the national economic well being. Naturally. it
is reasonable to suggest the formulation of a cohesive and
streamlined National Training Body. However. before embarking
on the design of yet another organizational structure for
training. it is necessary to understand why the system has
become so fragmented so that experiences of the past can
enlighten present considerations and future action.   It is also
necessary to note the problems which must be overcome so that a
National Training Structure will not be imposed on the type of
organizational circumstances which may impede the operation of
a cohesive National Training Body.

Some of the factors which may have resulted in the
fragmentation of national training services are as follows:

1.   An inherent entrepreneurial spirit; a spirit of
     independence.

2.   The tendency of organizations to try to meet all their
     needs instead of utilizing the services provided by other
     agencies.



                                                           11
3.   Dissatisfa ction with existing training structures and hence
     the tendency to create new training enterprise s.

4.   Creating new training structures without accommoda ting
     existing structures and policies.

5.   Failure of existing training bodies to address the needs of
     all who desire training services.

6.   Increasing obsolescen ce in the content and process of
     training and the non-respon siveness of existing training
     bodies to emerging needs and opportuni ties.

7.   Resource allocation strategies in the public sector which
     promotes isolation rather than cooperatio n.

8.   The absence of a National Training Plan which is closely
     coordinate d with national developme nt strategies .

9.   Philosoph ical and organizati onal difference s among training
     profession als.

10. Tur( protective behavior. inflexibi lity and resistance to
    change.

Problems to be overcome in the realizatio n of a National
Training Body are as follows:

1.   Mediating organizati onal difference s.
2.   Utilizatio n of excess personnel resources.
3.   Equitable and appropria te distributi on of resource~ and
     responsib ilities.
4.   Agreement on common standards and articulati on arrangeme nts.

System is presented in Appendix C.

Teachers

A comprehen sive picture of the current status of teacher usage
and availabil ity will require informatio n on the number of
teachers by vocationa l subject areas and the level of
qualificat ion of teachers within each area.   For each subject
area. it will also require informatio n on:   existing vacancies
and future need. attrition rates. level of production by
teacher preparatio n institutio ns. level of availabili ty of
teachers from other sources. and level of work experience among
teachers.   All these factors will provide informatio n on the
quality. availabil ity and use of vocationa l teaching
personnel. While some of this informatio n is available in the


12
Ministry of Education, it was too time consuming to compile the
data within the time frame of this study.  Notwithstanding,
certain trends are observable among the teaching core.  They
are enumerated as follows:

1.   It is difficult to keep well qualified vocational teachers
     because more attractive opportunities are available in the
     private sector.  Because of the low salaries and the
     frustrating working conditions, many vocational teachers
     are poised to capitalize on employment opportunities in the
     private sector.

2.   Many teachers do not have the level of work experience that
     is desirable for vocational instruction.

3.   Teachers are forced to engage in supplemental income -
     generating activities which may significantly detract from
     their commitment and effectiveness as teachers.

4.   There is an imbalance between the supply and demand of well
     qualified vocational teachers.  This is especially the case
     in some vocational areas where it is difficult to recruit
     and retain competent teachers.

Materials, Facilities and Equipment

No vocational curriculum could be properly implemented without
appropriate facilities and equipment and without an adequate
supply of materials for accomplishing practical assignments. A
proper examination of this situation in Jamaica will require a
complete inventory of facilities and equipment and a survey of
the availability of materials for each vocational program in
each school.  In assessing the availability of facilities and
equipment, for instance, one has to ascertain not only which
program in each school has what equipment (consistent with
curricular needs) but one also has to assess the extent to
which such equipment is available for use. While some schools
may have equipment, these may be unavailable for use for
reasons such as:  equipment in need of repair, unavailability
O[ some item needed to run the equipment (e.g., gas in welding
and in Home Ee.), lack of space to install the equipment and
lack of materials so that the equipment can be used to
accomplish practical exercises.

An indirect survey of the situation was conducted by
interviewing education officers with responsibility for
specific vocational programs.  The result was quite
discouraging.  In·most schools, materials and supplies are
generally unavailable.  Schools are allocated only a small
fraction of the funds requested to purchase materials and
supplies to operate vocational programs.  In one case, a school

                                                           13
requested $15.000 to purchase materials and supplies for a
vocational program. and was only allocated $856.00.   A
comparison of budget estimates in this category with actual
allotment revealed that his situation is not atypical. Many
schools operate by conducting fund raising activities to
purchase materials and supplies or by sharing the
responsibilities among students.   In a cookery class. for
instance. each student will be required to bring some item to
contribute to the meal.

Appendix D presents information on the status of facilities by
school type for each vocational subject.  Here again the
results are discouraging.

In most schools. regardless of school type. facilities and
equipment are inadequate.   Inadequacy here is defined in terms
of the unavailability of the necessary facilities and equipment
to support the curriculum. While many schools have inadequate
facilities because of lack of hand tools. a major problem is
either the unavailability of maintenance or improper
maintenance practices. Hand tools are alleged to have been
stolen by students. and equipment which were commissioned in
these schools more than a decade ago were given little or no
maintenance over the years.   Additionally. there is great
diversity in the nature and the amount of equipment in each
school.  Schools are expected to do the same type of program
with a different complement of equipment.

The situation has reached crisis proportions. A vocational
program cannot be operated without the appropriate equipment
since students will not be able to develop marketable skills.
Not only is there an absence of equipment. but most of the
available equipment is obsolescent with respect to the needs of
industry.

Another problem is the adequacy and standardization of workshop
facilities.  Workshops are designed according to the standards
used in donor countries and hence the structure of a workshop
for the same vocational area will be different based on the
source of financing - CIDA. World Bank. AID. etc. Many times
these designs are done without the ratification of subject
matter specialist in the Ministry of Education. Not only are
facilities different. but the type of equipment placed in these
schools may also vary.

The absence of a central and accessible inventory of equipment
for each school by program type. and the absence of a
centralized mechanism for monitoring equipment needs and
equipment failure in the schools make the situation even more
critical.


14
In the final analysis. if one asks whether the current level of
equipment in the schools adequ~tely meets curriculum needs. the
response is negative. Correcting this situation is expensive.
The resources needed to remedy current facility and equipment
deficiencies and suitably expand such facilities where needed
will far exceed the resources used up to this point to put
those facilities in place.
Curriculum Content
The content of the curriculum is the core of any program of
education or training. In technical vocational education and
training it is essential that the curriculum aligns well with
the needs and practices of industry. This requires a structure
for keeping the content of subject matter areas responsive to
industry needs. Since students must develop an array of
specific skills if they are to perform adequately in the world
of work. it is also essential that appropriate systems exist
for covering the content of the curriculum and for certifying
theoretical and practical competencies.
Course syllabuses (curriculum guides) exist for each vocational
program. Most of these courses syllabuses were developed by
the Ministry of Education in 1977. and. over the years little
modification has been- done. Two questions can be raised
regarding the content specified in these curriculum guides:
whether the content is currently responsive to needs and
institutional changes. and whether the content could be
adequately covered in the time available. While curriculum
content in some areas is still quite responsive. in other
areas. the curriculum seems to focus on the traditional subject
matter. paying little attention to social and technological
changes. and reflecting little cognizance of the expansion of
content in other subject matter areas.
For many of these curriculum guides. the content specified
cannot be reasonably covered within the timeframe available.
This poses a significant problem. Students are unable to
acquire the range of skills necessary; and. since teachers
focus on different aspects of the curriculum over time.
students having taken similar vocational subjects can have
vastly different levels and ranges of competencies.
The major concern in the curriculum area is the extent to which
the content of the curriculum is driven by the need of terminal
examinations. The key curriculum document in the high schools
is not the curriculum guide provided by the Ministry of
Education. but the examination syllabuses available from a
variety of examining bodies. This severely limits the level of


                                                          15
curriculum leadership that can be exercised by the Ministry of
Education .  And, because of the variety of examining bodies
involved in vocationa l certificat ion, the technical vocationa l
curriculum is severely fragmented with different schools in
diif erent subject areas preparing students for examinatio ns
governed by different examining bodies.

Curriculum Specifica tion and Standards

Curriculum specificat ion and standards are intended to enlist
the confidence and support of employers for vocational
programs.   They are also intended to foster uniformity in the
coverage of curriculum content and to guide in the
implement ation and modificati on of syllabuses . From the
foregoing informatio n it is clear that there is an absence of
adequate curriculum specificat ions and standards.   These are
sorely needed, and could be only accomplish ed when all training
entities and major examining bodies get together to decide on a
uniform system of certificat ion.

Secondary Technical Vocationa l Education in the Context of the
National Labour Market

Education and training must be placed within the context of the
economy.   The relevance and efficacy of technical vocationa l
education, in particular , must be determined in relation to its
performanc e relative to the manpower and employmen t structure
of the country.   This area of assessmen t is somewhat complex
partly because of the unavailab ility of valid data, partly
because of the effect of hurricane Gilbert on the economy, and
partly because of the cloudy relationsh ip between a fragmented
technical vocationa l education system and an economic context
that is without effective intermedi aries to interface the
production and utilizatio n of human resources. Nonethele ss, a
survey of the manpower context, using multiple sou~ces of
available data does reveal some implicatio ns for secondary
technical vocationa l education.

In November 1988, the labour force was 1,075,100. The total
number of unemployed persons was 203,300 representi ng an
unemploym ent rate of 18.9%.    Table 3 shows a breakdown or the
labour force by age group with the related population data and
data on employmen t/unemploy ment.   The largest group in the
labour force is the 25-34 age group with an unemploym ent rate
of 17.9%.    Of particular note, however, is the relatively large
group of individual s in the 14-24 age category who are
unemployed .   The unemploym ent rate in the 14-19 age category is
46.7 % and that in the 20-24 age category is 31.6%.     The fact
that this group of individua ls represents those who have
recently been exposed to education is reason for concern.     But

16
sufficient data are not available to make any conclusive
analysis. Many questions do arise.   For instance. what is the
level of education and training among the unemployed in the
14-19 and the 20-24 age categories? What types of schools have
they attended?  Is any school type over represented? What is
the consequence of their unemployment experience on their
feeling about education? What is the effect of the experience
of those who are unemployed on those students who are still
attending school? What is the geographical distribution of the
unemployment in this age group?

1    Census data from ·Demographic statistics 1988. Statistical
     Institute of Jamaica.
2    Data from the Labour force 1988. Statistical Institute of
     Jamaica.

One can infer answers to many of these questions from other
available data. For instance. ir one looks at the training
received by the unemployed labour force who are seeking
employment (Table 4) a significant percentage (over 90%) have
received no training.   If one assumes that a large percentage
of those seeking employment will be in the 14-24 age group.
then it follows that many or this age group have received no
training.   Table 5 shows that an equally significant number or
first time job seekers have received no training.   Table 6
shows that an overwhelming number of job seekers have only a
minimal level of education. Other data on the education system
will lead one to surmise that the high production of minimally
qualified students from the All Age School accounts in large
measure. for the comparatively large number of unprepared
individuals within this age category who are in the labour

                                                           17
force.  In that. the 1985-90 Manpower plan developed by the
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) noted that "statistics
from the Ministry of Education show that between 1980-84 95.6%
of secondary school leavers were not equipped for employment in
specific occupations."  (Economic and Social Survey of Jamaica
1988. p. 143).

These data do engender some level of concern regarding the
contribution of the education and training system to the
economy.  In light of immigration statistics which show the
flight or highly qualified individuals to North America and
Europe. it is critical that the education system continues to
produce highly qualified workers.  Tables 7 and 8 show the
number of highly qualified individuals who have migrated to
Canada and the US respectively.

Tables 9 and 10 show the distribution of employed labour force
by occupation and industry grouping respectively. While these
data are informative their utility for education and training
is questionable.  The lack of specificity of the data leaves
many questions unanswered. For instance. Table 9 notes that
approximately 40% of the employed are in the (self employed and
independent occupations) category. This is quite significant
since it suggests that the education and training system should
in some way prepare individuals for self employment. But there
is no information regarding the distribution of self employed
individuals by occupation or industry.

These data do have significant training implications.
Especially since it is noted that for more than a decade this
self-employed group has contributed signif icant~y to overall
growth in employment (Planning Institute of Jamaica 1988). The
PIOJ also noted that service workers showed the largest
increase in absolute and percentage terms.   In fact, Table 9
notes the importance of service occupations and craftsmen and

production workers in the distribution of individuals across
occupational categories.    Many of the occupations in the
technical vocational education training area fall into clerical
and sales. service. arts and crafts production processes and
self-employment.   The growth in the self employment and service
sectors. coupled with the exedous or craftsmen and technical
workers will imply. in general terms. the demand for workers in
these occupations.
Data from the 1985-1990 Manpower plan of PIOJ is somewhat more
revealing.   Table 11 summarizes the demand for workers in
occupations for which the Technical vocational program at the
secondary level may be able to respond.   As a precaution for
interpretation please note the following (1) these data are
dated and would have been adjusted after hurricane Gilbert.
(2) The technical vocational system at the level or the
secondary school will not provide the precise training for each
of the occupations noted.    However. students may generally be
able to pursue employment in the occupations for. which data are
provided.   (3) The occupations noted do not represent the total
array of relevant occupations in the economy that fit within
the specific technical vocational categories.   The occupations
are those for which demand estimates are available.

The data seem to reveal the following:

    1.   There is a relatively high demand for workers in the
         area of agriculture. This. however. is tempered by the
         fact that there is a variety of educational
         institutions that provide· agricultural training and
         there are many who are involved in agricultural/
         production who do not have formal training or who do
         not pursue this occupation as their primary area of
         employment. While the figures may infer the need for
         agriculture training of a vocational nature in the
         secondary school. there may not actually be such a need
         when all factors are considered.

    2.   Arts and crafts occupations seem to show a moderate
         demand in some areas - Basketry and weaving
         occupations. for instance.  But. since many or the
         individuals in these occupations are generally
         self-employed. these data may have been significantly
         underestimated.

    3.   There may be a higher demand in the secretarial
         occupations than is actually shown in the Business
         Education category.  The clerk typist.figure. for
         instance. represents the number or jobs reported
         unfilled in January 1985.  It should be noted. however.

          which provide training in secretarial occupations.
          While the demand may be high. the supply may also be
          quite adequate.  Precise data are not available tD
          determine with any degree of accuracy the level of
          supply for these or any of the occupations noted.

     4.   The "clothing textiles/dressmakin g" subject area as
          well as "foods and nutrition" and "carpentry and
          cabinet making" represent moderate demand.

One can conclude with a slight degree of hesitance (because of
the quality of the data) that there is demand in occupations
which are related to the technical vocational subjects taught.
It is plausible to surmise (in the absence of specific data)
that with the currently available capacity. the technical
vocational system in the secondary school will quickly create
an over supply of these workers if the system were to operate
~s effectively as it could.  In fact. it may be incorrect to


26
think of the secondary technical vocational system as a supply
system because of the variability in the coverage of curriculum
content. and because of the variability and. in some cases. the
unacceptable quality of its graduates.  Notwithstanding the
technical vocational system at the secondary level has an
enormous potential for production of skilled workers.

A follow up survey of 800 students in the new secondary school
(National Planning Agency) in 1979 ~rovided data on the
employment of graduates from specific vocational programs.
These data may still be pertinent today; or. they can serve as
a model of the type of data needed to ascertain the external
efficiency of various programs.  Then. as now. the high
performing programs (in terms of employment among graduates who
had majored in those programs) were auto mechanics. welding.
food services. business education and child care. On the other
hand. those who had majored in Arts and Crafts. machine shop
and agriculture had experienced less than the sample percentage
of employment (see Table 12). Table 13 shows that graduates
form programs in welding. food services, cosmetology and
machine shop are most likely to be employed in the same field.
while those in child care. electrical installation. agriculture
and clothing and textiles are least likely to be employed in
the same field.

There may be areas with significant demand for skilled workers
for which the training system is not responsive.  Some of these
areas are: electronic data processing. computer programming and
operations. the printing and publication trades and electronics
assembly. repair and service. to mention a few.  In a survey of
employers (Appendix F) many more areas of demand are cited.
There is a dire need to look at the performance of the national
training system (including secondary technical vocational
education) relative to economic demand and labour market
behavior.                  1


Table 14 as well as Table 4 inf er the importance of training to
labour market success.  A relatively small percentage of
individuals with vocational certification were_seeking
employment in November 1988. One can surmise that one's
probability of success in the labour market is enhanced with
the acquisition of specific saleable skills.

Appendix F presents the findings of a survey to assess employer
needs and perceptions.  In sum. the data indicate that
employers. though generally satisfied with the training
received by their employees do express concerns regarding the
responsiveness of the training system, the attitudes of
graduates and in some cases. the quality of training.




28
This cursory analysis of secondary technical vocation in the
context of the labour market does demonstrate that the
technical vocational system may not be functioning in
concordance with the dynamics of the labour market.   It seems
to reveal even further that fragmentation and duplication in
the training system significantly undermines the efficacy of
Secondary Technical Vocational Education.

Monitoring and Supervision

An effective system of monitoring and superv1s1on is essential
if the Ministry of Education is to exercise leadership in the
administration of the technical vocational curriculum.   Such
leadership is essential. not only in resolving problems and
providing guidance and technical assistance. but in fostering
cohesiveness. and in sensitizing the Ministry of Education to
the multiplicity of issues which may impede the effective
implementation of the curriculum.  Supervision capacity and
supervision effectiveness are terms which are used to describe
the status of Curriculum leadership by the Ministry of
Education.  Supervision capacity is defined as the availability
of an adequate number of education officers and the
availability of of traveling resources so that all vocational
programs in all schools could be effectively monitored.
Suppervision effectiveness is the level of influence and
quality of leadership of education officers in ensuring that
curriculum practices are consistent with the plans and
expectations of the Division of Technical Vocational
Education.  on both counts. the monitoring and supervision
function in the Ministry of Educition seems to be lacking.



                                                               29
If one looks at supervision capacity. it appears that there are
not enough education officers nor enough resources to
adequately monitor vocational programs in all schools.   This.
perhaps. is more critical for some vocational courses than
others.  In the area of Home Economics. for example. there are
at least 229 schools offering the subjects. With two education
officers and 190 school days in the average academic year. each
supervisor will assume a very heavy burden if all the schools
are to be visited.   If we estimate. for instance. that two
schools will be visited every week. then each supervisor can
only visit 66 schools.   Even with an unreasonable visitation
estimate of three schools per week each supervisor can visit
only 99 schools weekly.   All schools cannot be visited. if by
visiting we are referring to the concept of looking at
teacher's records. assessing curriculum coverage. noting the
level of performance of students and looking at budget and
facilities. among myriad other responsibilities.

Financial resources to cover the traveling expenses of
education officers are woefully inadequate.  The $200.00 per
officer allocated this fiscal year will not even cover the
expenses for visiting one school in any of the more distant
parishes.  The level or commitment of resources is not
consistent with the preservation of an effective system of
technical vocational training.

There are no visitation plans which details the schedule of
school visits and the planned regularity of visits to each
school.  Additionally. there is an absence of a comprehensive
schedule of the activities that each supervisor should
accomplish on each site visit.  The result is the lack of a
centralized knowledge bank that keeps the Unit Technical
Vocational Unit abreast with the circumstances in the schools.

It appears that the job of an education officer is quite
discouraging.  Though very competent and fully committed. they
have become civil servants rather than instructional leaders.
Most of their time is spent on matters that promote
administrative efficiency instead of instructional excellence.
There is a sense of discouragement on school visits.   Since the
education officer has little control over resources. he/she can
do little to provide assistance. consolation or advice to
school personnel on issues such as the unavailability of funds
that are urgently needed or the disrepair of essential
equipment.

If the curriculum in the schools is to be more effectively
delivered. than it is essential that the supervisory system in
the Technical vocational Unit be restructured and enhanced.



30
Certification in Technical Vocational Education and Training

Certification is intended to provide assurance that individuals
have acquired a certain level and range of competencies in the
area for which certification is given.  In technical vocational
education certification is particularly important since
students are expected to obtain employment and perform their
work responsibilities effectively in the areas for which they
are certified.  Any deficiency in the certification system will
serve to misinform the employment community about the abilities
of students. and hence undermine the level of confidence in the
certification system and the quality of education.

A few critical observations can be made regarding the nature or
certification in Technical Vocational Education. First. there
are many uncoordinated systems of certification.  In the
Ministry of Education. for instance. there are several
examining boards involved in Technical vocational Education
AEB. GCE. CXC. and Guilds, ULCI. and RSA.  In addition. the
Secondary School Certificate (SSC) is used as a certifying tool
for vocational subjects in the New Secondary School

Similarly. the Ministry of Youth and Community Development also
has sever.al means o( certification for different training
function in the Ministry.   For example HEART has its own system
of certification and so does the Board of Apprenticeship.   The
result is not only curriculum fragmentation. but lack of
uniformity in the quality of graduates who are qualified in the
same vocational areas.

Secondly, the performance of graduates on Technical vocational
exams is somewhat discouraging - especially is one examines
performance by school type (See Appendix E).   Questions can
also be raised about the quality of the curriculum. the
appropriateness of facilities and equipment and the level of
support materials for doing practical work.   Questions can also
be raised as to whether some of these exams do an appropriate
job of assessment.  The SSC, for instance, has a
multiple-choice question format. and no practical assessment is
required.

What should be the vision for effective certification?
Certainly. in the long term one can assume that CXC could be a
comprehensive certifying body for all technical vocational
courses.  Accordingly. mechanisms should be put in place to
expand the role of CXC in certification.  In the short term.
CXC could adopt some method of endorsing or accrediting local
certification systems thus assuring that methods of
certification are commensurate with designated standards of
performance.  There could be a range of certification
categories from pretechnology and prevocational certificates to
craftsman and technicians• dipolmas.
                                                           31
The Cost of Vocational Education

It is not possible to ascertain the effectiveness and
efficiency of Technical Vocational Education and Training
without precise data on the levels of expenditure on various
aspects of training programs.  To secure this information.
however. there must be some mechanism for the collection.
verification and analysis of relevant cost data; and even
further. there must be established policies for resource
allocation. the development and use of cost standards. and the
intervention in programs which may operate significantly above
or below cost parameters.

Appendix E represents an attempt to devise per subject cost in
vocational education for materials and supplies.  The table
reveals that there were significant differences in per subject
cost; not only across different subjects. but within subjects
areas.  If one were to examine the data closely one would
determine that it is relatively useless and misleading for
estimating future expenditures on vocational subjects.  Having
examined the system that has produced this data. it may be
instructive to review some of the difficulties which undermine
the quality of the data.  Certainly. the intent of the review
is neither to berate the available data nor to be critical of
the institutions which produced them. but to point out systemic
deficiencies may well continue to undermine the effectiveness
of the technical vocational education in the secondary
schools. Five areas of difficulties are itemized and briefly
described below.

     1.   Lack of a system for obtaining disaggregated data on
          expenditures.  If data are needed to determine
          programmatic cost, then it is necessary to trace data
          back to expenditures at the program (or subject)
          level.  This requires that records be kept on both
          allocation and expenditures at the program level.
          Unfortunately, no such records are generally
          available.  Expenditures are summarized at the school
          level in categories that are more expedient for
          administrative reporting than they are for monitoring
          the utilization or funds by subject areas.   For
          instance. in many schools. expenditures (and estimates)
          will be provided for materials and supplies generally
          without reference to subject area.  In some cases where
          data on materials and supplies are provided by the
          subject areas. it is difficult to ascertain how these
          funds were actually expended.




32
     Allocation of funds is made by school type on a per
     capita basis. where the adjustment is made so that the
     percentage allocation for technical vocational stat is
     more than that for the general subjects. When the
     funds are sent to the school. the principal and bursar
     generally determine how they should be spent.   The
     result is the total funds allocated to technical
     vocational education may not go to the respective
     subject areas.  As a result. general allocation
     guidelines are not useful in ascertaining programmatic
     expenditures.  These guidelines are not enforced since
     the level of funding is so significantly below that
     which is necessary to operate the school.

2.   Lack of consistency in reporting.  Only about 50% of
     secondary schools actually submit expenditure reports
     although their submission is required by all schools.
     Of those reports that are submitted. few are prepared
     at the level of detail so that some judgment can be
     made regarding how the funds were spent. Even in the
     submission of estimates. few prepare sufficiently
     detailed budgets which will clearly indicate how the
     funds will be utilized programmatically.
     Additionally.there are structural differences between
     the estimates and reports submitted. Although the
     principals are provided with a form for reporting. in
     many cases. they differ in detail and specificity
     regarding what information they present.  The end
     result is that the cost data at the central office
     hardly represents information which could be sensibly
     aggregated over schools.

3.   Teacher's capacity to make budgeting estimates. Where
     details were provided in the cost estimates that were
     submitted to the Ministry. the data raised questions
     regarding the capacity of many teachers to prepare
     annual budgets for their programs.   Some teachers
     requested every item which would make their facilities
     perfect laboratories. while others significantly
     underestimated their needs.   Few teachers included
     budgeting estimates which reflected a consideration of
     the number of students~ the type of project exercises
     etc.   It would appear that teachers are not formally
     taught how to prepare the estimates. nor are they
     taught how to account for funds that are expended.    The
     quality and efficiency of instruction begins with the
     teacher. and as a result they should be trained to be
     true instead of symbolic partners in determining and
     fulfilling their resource needs.

     4.   Standards and procedures for allocating funds.  There
          is no general per capita cost for all technical
          vocational subjects.  Subjects should be funded by type
          and level.  Some vocational education subjects are more
          expensive then others - for instance machine
          shop/welding and business education.  Similarly, cost
          will vary based on how advanced the subject is
          addressed.  In some subjects, for instance, a form 1
          class may need less funding that forms 4 or 5. As a
          result, it is necessary to develop cost standards to
          determine procedures and guidelines ~or allocating
          funds.

     5.   The marking effect of aggregated data.   Aggregated data
          across schools. while helpful to some extent, may mask
          very significant strengths or deficiencies in
          programs.  Data may not capture the contribution of
          programs which generate supplemental funds or programs
          which find more creative ways to generating resources.
          Additionally, such aggregation may not capture waste
          and abuse.  Although a cost standard provides a "red
          flag" for the further investigation of deviations, it
          may be necessary to establish a monitoring structure
          which will identify and circulate exemplary practice,
          and which will detect abuse.   In some cases,
          standardizati on of a proportion of lab projects across
          schools provide a significant boost in controlling cost.

One should not promote a straight "top down" structure for
achieving ac~ountability.   Certainly. a school manager should
have a level of discretionary authority to make decisions which
are responsive to his/her unique circumstances . However,
teachers. administrator s and central office personnel should
mutually determine the best means of serving the interest of
the school and yet initiating procedures to ensure that each
dollar spent returns its worth and more.

The administrativ e structure for the request and expenditure of
funds seems to be in need of some fine tuning.

 OPTIONS FOR THE DELIVERY OF TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN
 THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF JAMAICA


  In light of the circumstances affecting the quality of
  Technical Vocational Education in the secondary schools of
  Jamaica, an appropriate course of action must be sought in
  order to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Technical
  Vocational component of the curriculum.   The anticipated
  outcome is that the chosen curriculum will better be able to
. fulfill its role as both the vehicle through which students
  develop some measure of technological literacy and the avenue
  for acquiring a sound knowledge base in the theory and
  application of technology.  Students will thereby be prepared
  for entry level employment in some fields: but more
  importantly, they will be prepared for further education and
  training and for competently interfacing with their
  technological environment.  This vision of a secondary
  curriculum in Technical Vocational Education aligns with
  current thinking among vocational educators in Jamaica.   It is
  not new.  However, in the face of current circumstances, the
  vision has not been realized.   It is therefore essential to
  reconcile how the nature of curriculum content and organization
  can most appropriately respond to the myriad challenges facing
  the system.

This report seeks to provide several ideas in this regard.
This section of the report explores selected options for the
conduct of what is traditionally known as Vocational and
Prevocational Education in the formal school system.  As one
explores these options, several considerations must be brought
to bear if a chosen option is to be effectively implemented.
Some of these considerations are noted below:

     1.   Any vision for a responsive vocational education
          curriculum must be tempered by current circumstances
          such as resources, (finance, staffing), traditions
          (organization of content), and current practices and
          commitments (timetabling, investment in equipment,
          trained teachers and teacher training capacity.)

     2.   The success of any reform in education is contingent
          upon the commitment and support of policymakers and
          programme implementors at all levels.




                                                            1-1
      3.   If any change must be realized. it must be supported by
           adequate planning. the participation of all actors. the
           design of supportive and facilitative policy and the
           provision of training in a timely manner to ensure that
           there is some receptivity to the impending change. and
           that individuals are component enough to handle new
           responsibilities.

      4.   The psychological climate in the context of
           implementation is a critical and typically overlooked
           factor in implementation success.  Staff who are
           distrustful. unmotivated. frustrated. unchallenged etc.
           can significantly undermine the success of a reform
           project.

In presenting_ the options. the following critical factors are
addressed.

      1.   A proposed structure for the organization of technical
           vocational education in Jamaica.

      2.   An analysis of options for the identification of
           subject areas.

      3.   An analysis of options for the organization of
           instructional content.

      4.   Restructuring the curriculum - recommended options.

      5.   General implementation issues and ideas.

      6.   Framework for the design of an implementation strategy
           by school type.

      7.   Technical Vocational Education in the second cycle.

PROPOSED STRUCTURE FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

As noted before. vocational and prevocational programmes in the
formal school system constitute a critical dimension of the
National Human Resource Development Programme. Every country
needs some capacity to produce and retain a competent labour
force at all levels - semi-skilled; skilled; technical and
professional. Accordingly. there must be the institutional
framework within the society which is able to respond to the
needs of employers to train and upgrade workers. Whether this
institutional framework is public. semi-public or private. the
system must be sufficiently cohesive such that training
responsibilities are allocated where they are most efficiently




1-2
and effectively achieved, and policy directives and incentives
are formulated to ensure minimal duplication and effective
articulation of services within the system. The proposed
structure of the organization of Technical Vocational Education
is intended to show the place of the secondary vocational
education programmes in the National Human Resource Development
Structure, and to foster the level of articulation which is
necessary for a cohesive and efficient National Training
Systems.
The key features of the structure are illustrated in figure la.
These features are as follows:
    1.   Some introduction to technology should start at an
         early age i.e. the primary level.
    2.   Government should provide opportunities outside of the
         normal school day for students to access educational
         services. These services can be accessed by students
         who need to overcome their status of academic
         disadvantagement; for students who have dropped out of
         school who need to pursue an educational programme for
         self development or employment; and by students who are
         more academically advanced, who need to get ahead in
         their educational pursuits.
    3.   Any vocational, technical or academic preparation which
         is offered parallel to or after the termination of high
         school (in grades 11 or 9) shouid be coordinated and
         articulated with the authority of governmental policy
         so that students can easily move from one level of
         training to the other. All students, especially those
         for whom formal education may be terminated at grade 9,
         should have the assurance that there are-legitimate
         opportunities available for them to continue their
         education and/or training.

                  Figure 1 a. A Proposed Structure for the Organization of Technlcal Vocatlonal Education In Jamaica
Underlying this proposed structure are assumptions regarding
the role of vocational and prevocational education in the
secondary schools of Jamaica. It is assumed that there are two
basic functions: (a) fostering technological literacy in all
students and (b) developing basic academic. technical and
vocational skills so that students become trainable and
educable after high school. These objectives certainly do not
preclude instructional programmes to enable students to develop
basic skills for entry level employment in some areas. They do
assert, however. that the secondary schools cannot be used as
the avenue through which craftsmen or craf tsperson are prepared
for careers. Secondary schools do not have the capacity nor
the culture to successfully pursue such training. As a result.
when such training is attempted, the effect is to fragment and
overload the curriculum; divide the process of general
education along academic and vocational lines; and compromise
the vocational content of the curriculum to such an extent so
as to bring disrepute to the training provided in schools. and
hence undermine the confidence of employers.
To effectively accomplish its charge, a study of technology
should begin in grade 1 and continue through the primary school
grades. The concepts covered need not be complex. Students
can be taught about technology through "technology stories" and
through experimentation with the technology they encounter in
daily life such as wheels. drycells. levers. binoculars and
microscopes. to mention a few. The basic concepts could be
that (a) technology has extended the capacity of humankind to
accomplish tasks that are essential for comfort and survival
and humankind has placed increased reliance on technology to
adapt to and function in his environment. The primary purpose
of such technology studies at an early age is to enable
students to develop a level of confidence in dealing with their
technological environment. In these grades the seed of
technological literacy can be planted so that students do not
gradually alienate themselves from the technological elements
of their world. such a curriculum should reduce fears and
feelings of insecurity, and it should build confidence and
self-concept. The curriculum will also serve the purpose of
stemming the prejudices between academic and vocational which
students develop at any early age. thus fostering a more
positive approach to all curricula at the secondary and
post-secondary levels. More information on the primary school
technology studies curriculum will be provided in a later
section.




                                                           1-5
Though not vocational or technological in its orientation, a
programme of supplementary learning opportunities which is
provided out of formal school hours may be an important
dimension of the primary school educational endeavor.   Students
entering grade one have various kinds of preschool academic
experiences which may imply various levels of receptivity to
academic content.  Through no fault of their own, some students
are academically disadvantaged, and·hence may become distanced
from the main stream of the curriculum.  The gap widens as
students progress through the elementary grades, and, with
mounting frustration, diminished self-concepts, and increasing
alienation (academically and sometimes socially) these students
become failures, discipline problems or dropouts.

To supplement school activities, it may be necessary to provide
experiential opportunities for students who have been socially
or academically deprived.  Such programmes can be conducted
after school on weekends or during vacations. While such
opportunities are already available, they are costly and hence
they are subscribed to by students who are least in need of
such services.  To equalize opportunities for school age
children, consideration should be given to some form of
government subsidy for out-of-school remedial and enrichment
programs so that students who are disadvantaged can have access
to compensatory education.

In grades 7-9 the emphasis of the Technical Vocational
curriculum should be an exploration of technology.   Such
exploration should have two primary purposes: (a) fostering
technological literacy and (b) providing a broad academic and
technological foundation upon which students can build, and
from which they can choose areas of interest for subsequent
specialization. A curriculum entitled "Technology Studies in
daily life" is proposed as one option and will be discussed in
a section to follow.   As a precursor to this however, two
aspects of the Technical Vocational Curriculum in grades 7-9
should be noted:   the evening school programme, and
opportunities for students who are not successful in attaining
a place in grade 10.

The evening school programme is proposed as a supplemental
educational structure to provide educational (academic and
vocational) opportunities to students who are in need and
students for whom such opportunities are not readily
available.  The evening school programme will utilize the
facilities of the school and the expertise of teachers who are
selected from the existing staff.   The programme will provide
various levels of remedial education and various levels of
instruction in the academic and vocational areas. At grades




1-6
7-9, supplementary courses could be offered so that students
can get a more in-depth exposure to various areas of technology
application. For instance, under the technology studies
curriculum a module can be offered on servicing lawn-mowers.
The related supplemental module or course in the evening school
could be small engine repair" at an advanced level and perhaps
         11


a short course on the proper use and care of lawn mowers at the
basic level. There can therefore be a series of short courses
at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels, where the
basic and intermediate levels could be for general or
avocational interest, and the advanced level intended for
students who are considering specialization to develop skills
for entry level employment. Of course, the structure and
content of the evening school programme must be clearly noted
and the programme must be articulated with other educational
efforts in and out of the formal school system.
There is a sense of hopelessness among students who have
terminated their secondary education in grade 9. No policy
consideration is given to ensuring opportunities for these
students after they have graduated from grade 9 or after they
have dropped out in grades 7 and 8. Many who leave school in
grade 9 join the mass of the unemployed and idle youth who
drift and search until they find a notch (educational or
employment wise) where they can fit, or until they find
themselves engaged in socially undesirable activities. ·Many of
them are exploited in the labour market as cheap labour.
However, there are a variety of potential opportunities since
there are ·many training options available in the non-formal
sector -- HEART being the most prominent. But while the
structures of these programmes are most suited to the graduates
of grade nine, selection criteria are set up in favor of
students who have completed their secondary education. The
students in grades 7-9 of the All Age schools suffer double
jeopardy - they are denied an opportunity to enter the second
cycle, and, as a result, they are denied future opportunities
to advance themselves educationally.
It is therefore recommended that, under the authority of
governmental policy, clear educational or career paths should
be established beyond grade nine. Some students will go into
the grade 10 academic streams, some students will go into a
grade 10 vocational stream, and other students will follow into
a variety of non-formal training opportunities - apprenticeship
programmes, special industrial training centers and HEART
programmes, among others. In effect, every one leaving grade
nine should have lines of opportunities to pursue further
education if they wish to.




                                                          1-7
The technical/vocational programme in grades 10-13 will be less
exploratory and more specialized in its emphasis. But this
specialization will not be at the expense of a proper academic
foundation. All students who participate in technical
vocational education should attain CXC general level
proficiency in English, mathematics and a science subject of
their choice. Of course, students who are in Business Studies
may elect to do Economics instead of a science subject.
The motivating consideration here, is that students should not
be railroaded into various vocational specialties with
curricula content that are so limited so as to restrict them
from capitalizing on post-secondary educational opportunities.
Figure 2 shows students can continue technical/vocational
education at a variety of places after graduation. A few of
these places are noted - JIDC, JAGAS Agricultural College and
CAST. These students may also capitalize on opportunities in
HEART, Industrial Training Centers, apprenticeship programmes
and the evening school programme, as appropriate. As with
transition from grade 9, articulation policies should be
established and lines of career opportunities should be
sufficiently clear so that students can more easily move from
one level to another if they have attained the established
prerequisite skills.
Certification is one of the critical issues to be considered
within this structure. Levels of certification are recommended
as follows:   "Certificate of Technology - Basic studies" which
is to be issued at the end of grade nine, "Certificate of
Technology - Introductory craftsmanship", to be issued at the
end of grade 11 and for programmes anywhere in the National
Training System that are offered at a similar level,
"Certificate of Technology - Craftsman" and 11 Certif icate of
Technology - Technician/Technologist", both to be issued at
appropriate post-secondary institutions. These will be
discussed in more details in the section of the paper
addressing certification.
In concluding this section it should be noted that any
consideration for reform in the vocational curriculum in the
secondary school must be done with due regard to the National
Training structure within which it is embedded. This requires
that the plethora of uncoordinated independent training
entities must be molded into a cohesive, efficient and
responsive training body. If vocational education at the
secondary level is not part of the National Training structure
it is wasteful; if the body of training entities nationally
does not take cognizance and advantage of the preparatory
programmes in the secondary schools, then the training they
provide will be inefficient and sub-optimal. A cohesive and
well-articulated body of training enterprises in a National
Training structure is critical to the economic well-being of
the country.
1-8
AN ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUBJECT AREAS.

Any attempt to reform the Secondary school Curriculum in
vocational education must be preceeded by some reconsideration
of the purposes(s) of Secondary Education. the purposes(s) of
the vocational component of the secondary curriculum. an
assessment of whether these purposes are generally being
achieved and an analysis of the factors which account for the
inability of the curriculum to attain its objectives.   These
analyses have been done.  Several issues emerge regarding the
nature of the vocational curriculum in the secondary school and
especially in grades 7-9.  The major issues are as follows:

    1.   Vocational subjects occupy an average of 30% of the
         total time allocated to the present curriculum in
         grades 7-9.   This is applaudable only to the extent
         that it does not detract from adequate coverage of
         those basic subjects which enable students to acquire a
         sound academic foundation.   It is applaudable. also. to
         the extent that the school can adequately meet its
         responsibilities to students who are less well prepared
         academically.

         The issue is one of priority. Given the purpose of
         education in the secondary school. the ages of children
         in grades 7-9 and the requirements for successful
         performance in the second cycle and in the society at
         large. the content areas of the curriculum should be
         prioritiied.  It will be futile to argue the relative·
         importance of academic and vocational content in the
         curriculum.  Both are important at this level.
         How~ver. there is general agreement that a good
         academic foundation should hold priority.  The time
         allotted to the vocational subjects may not be
         necessary and may be out of balance with the general
         purpose of the curriculum.

    2.   An assessment of the amount of subjects done in grades
         7-9 revealed that over 20 individual subject areas are
         being taught. While no one school attends to as many
         subjects. the fact that so many areas are being
         entertained on the grades 7-9 curriculum is cause for
         concern.  The more subject areas that are covered. the
         more the curriculum is fragmented. the less students
         are able to receive exposure of an adequate depth. and
         the less they will be able to cognitively structure the
         content so that it is useful.




                                                            1-9
       3.   Not only is there a plethora of subjects on the
            curriculum in grades 7-9. but the amount of content
            within these subject areas seem to be ever expanding.
            A cursory analysis of curriculum content guides over
            the years reveal that with each new development of the
            curriculum more content seems necessary for
            inclusion.   It appears that the development of the
            curriculum is relatively unconstrained by some
            realistic notion about how much time it takes to cover
            the recommended content.   There also seems to be
            increasing concern that more content should be covered
            in grades 7-9 in order to adequately prepare for the
            cxc and other terminal exams in the second cycle. Such
            expansion and surfeit of content at the grades 7-9
            level may serve to undermine the objectives for
            academic attainment at that level. Attempting to
            accomplish too much may actually be contributing to
            significantly diminishing returns.

       4.   The administrative infrastructure in the school system
            does not attempt to ascertain how much of the required
            syllabus is covered.   As a result, tea~hers may
            sometimes cover a significantly low proportion of the
            required content.   In addition, there is a large degree
            of variance among teachers with respect to what section
            of the syllabus is covered.   The result is obvious.
            Students across schools who have graduated from the
            9th grade may have vastly varying exposures to subject
            matter in the same content areas.   The consequences are
            also obvious for both the students and the teachers at
            higher grade levels.   Among the concerns are the
            following:   Little faith can be allotted to continuity
            in the coverage of curriculum content; it is difficult
            to develop instructional materials on the basis of some
            generally agreed upon standard for the attainment of
            prerequisite competencies; and,. inter alia, students.
            because of inadequate preparation. may flounder
            academically on entering the higher grades before they
            make the psychological and academic adjustment to the
            new content.  Unfortunately, some students never make
            such an adjustment and end up as failures.

       s.   In some areas. there is little articulation of subject
            matter content between grade levels in a manner which
            will minimize duplication, reduce gaps in transition.
            and clearly demonstrate the structural hierarchy of the
            content so that some pattern of knowledge acquisition
            is clearly discernable to students.  The recognition of
            what content should be offered at one level should be
            based on some idea of prerequisite skills that are
            needed to successfully complete the related syllabus at
            the succeeding level.

    6.   In most cases. the curriculum is content-fo cused rather
         than student-fo cused. It is not organized and
         structured in a manner to capture and retain the
         students interest. The curriculum is broken down into
         discrete conceptual units that tend to be relatively
         sterile and unmotivati ng. At the ages represente d in
         grades 7-9. it will be prudent to capitalize upon the
         interest of the student at this level of their
         developme nt. and to structure and deliver the
         curriculum in a manner that will be stimulatin g and
         motivating .
The foregoing analysis does imply the need for some reform.
With respect to subject areas in vocational education. the
three key terms which may embody the thrust of any reform are
rationaliz ation. consolidat ion and articulati on.
Rationaliz ation refers to the informed reconside ration of
current curriculum and instructio nal practices. It answers the
question as to whether the current organizati on and content of
the curriculum adequately meets the objectives of secondary
education in general, and that of secondary vocational
education in particular . Consolida tion addresses the issue as
to whether there is the need to reduce and focus the curriculum
so that it targets the most important content and delivers it
in a manner that is feasible under current constraint s.
Articulati on refers to the need to vertically align the content
of the curriculum at various levels so that the necessary
prerequis ite knowledge. skills and attitudes are developed. It
also refers to the need to horizonta lly integrate the content
of various subject areas so that the interrelat ionship between
curricular content areas are made clear and duplicatio n is
avoided when necessary. Table 15 provides a general assessmen t
of each subject area and the alternativ e reform strategies
which may emerge.
At the grades 7-9 level. there are five subject areas:
Industrial Arts (Wood. Metal). Home Economics. Agricultur e and
Art and Craft. Business Education is scheduled to be offered.
If one applies the three themes - consolidat ion.
rationaliz ation and articulati on. then there are two methods of
adjustmen t - a content adjustmen t within ·subject areas as they
are currently designated , and an adjustment in the subject
matter designatio n for time-tabli ng. These two approaches are
related.   If the content of any area has to be severely
adjusted (reduced) then the scope of content to be covered
within that area may not warrant time-tabli ng as a separate
subject. For instance. when one rationaliz es the relevance and




                                                             1-11
adequacy of the curriculum content in grades 7 - 9 for Art and
Craft, say, one may find that: (a) most of the curriculum
content is relevant and less content could be addressed in the
designated time frame or (b) that only a small amount of the
content is really relevant, that this content could be
addressed within the subject designation of another content
area and the need for time-tabling Art and Craft separately may
be unnecessary. Hence, the choice of an appropriate
consolidation option depends on the level of content considered
to be appropriate.
This approach was used to formulate the four options presented
in figure 2. Option 1 suggests retaining five separate subject
or content areas to be separately time-tabled. Within this
option one can either reduce the level of content as
appropriate or retain the subject areas in the manner that they
currently exist.
In option 2, Business Education and Art and Craft are
eliminated as areas to be separately time-tabled and the
relevant content. is subsumed under other subject areas as
illustrated. In option 3, Business Education and Agriculture
are eliminated as independent subjects at this level and are
time-tabled as illustrated. In option 4, two areas will be
time-tabled - Technology Studies (Industrial Arts with other
related content) and Home and Family management or Personal and
Family Development (Home Economics with other related content).
The relevant content of the other subject areas will be
distributed as illustrated. The advantages and the-
disadvantages of all these options are noted in figure 3.
As will be observe4 from the content of figure 3, each option
has associated with it several advantages and disadvantages .
The choice of one option from among these will depend on the
values to be maximized.   If one chooses to maintain the status
quo, for instance, then one also chooses to incur substantially
higher cost to perpetuate mediocre quality in the performance
of programmes. One also chooses to retain a range of
programmes without the administrativ e capacity to monitor and
control, and one chooses to compromise educational quality in
favor of abundance of course offerings. If one chooses to
change in any way, one automatically answers the challenge,
but assumes the responsibilit y for restructuring , retraining
and dealing with the many hurdles which axe associated with the
implementatio n of reform. The choice of an option should be
framed within what one envisions to be an ideal education
system which can be incrementally put in place over the next
five (5) to ten (10) years. Without such a vision, the
educational system will be needlessly committed to a path of
deterioration , or it will be subjected to a series of
uncoordinated project initiatives which covers the sore but
never heals the wound.

OPTIONS FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT


There are five individually timetabled subject matter areas in
technical/vocationa l education at the Grades 7-9 level.   These
areas represent a range of content. and. as has been already
noted. the amount of content to be covered far exceeds the time
available on the timetable.   One strategy for addressing this
problem is the evaluation  of.curriculum  content across all
these subjects in order to ensure that the topics covered are
those which are absolutely essential.    But reducing the
syllabus content may imply that some vocational areas may not
require the amount of time which is currently allotted on the
timetable for the 3-year period which students spend in Grades
7-9.

The issue then becomes whether one should restructure the
timetabling of vocational subjects to teach only what is
essential; and. if such restructuring is determined to be
appropriate. how should it be done in order to retain some
pedagogical integrity in teaching these subjects.

If the content of the individual five subject areas will not be
reduced to the point where one has to also reduce the
allocation of time. then the five subject areas can be retained
as individually timetabled subjects. However. this does not
appear to be the case.  An analysis of curriculum guides and
exam syllabuses seem to substantiate the position that much
less content can be covered to secure much greater benefits in
the performance of students in the second cycle and beyond. Of
course. this is very heavily dependent on the content of the
curriculum being properly rationalized. structured and
articulated.

This being the case. there must be some means of structuring
the relevant content of all these subjects so that there can be
some coherence and cognitive structure in providing
instruction .. Here. the notion of consolidation plays a very
critical role.   As noted in the previous section. one can
consolidate five subject areas into three areas or into two
subject areas to be separately timetabled.   The following
section of the paper will explore options for consolidation
into two subject areas.   This section of the paper will examine
the topics of relevance for Grades 7-9 in each subject area.




                                                             2-1
In the process of consolidating curriculum content it is
necessary to list. for each subject area. the topics which are
essential to be covered in Grades 7-9.   The choice of topics
should be based upon three criteria:

      a.   The topics should build on the content areas which are
           covered in Grades 1-6.

      b.   The topics should be critical elements in providing a
           foundation for the pursuit of further education.
           training and employment.

      c.   The topics should have utility in daily life.

One cannot arbitrarily choose and list topics.   The content
areas selected should have resulted from a process of
discussion and negotiation among the subject area supervisor.
teachers of that particular subject and selected personnel who
are involved in the design of curricula in related subjects.
The project did not permit time for such negotiations to take
place.  As a result. samples of curriculum content are not
presented in this document for all subjects that are candidates
for inclusion in the technology studies curriculum.

However. an attempt will be made to provide examples of
appropriate curriculum content which could be taken from Home
Economics and Industrial Arts.  Home Economics and Industrial
Arts were chosen for this purpose because they represent the
traditional pillars of Technical Vocational Education in the
Secondary School system. While Industrial Arts fosters
technological literacy. explores existing technology and
develops a basic practical foundation upon which students can
build for further study or employment. Home Economics examine
the essentials of home and family life which prepares students
for important life roles and which give them an adequate
background for pursuing careers. With an adequate academic
foundation. these areas represent essential core content in a
functional education - an education for daily life.

Another reason for the choice of these subjects as examples is
their current status of an instructional areas in the school.
As these curricula are currently administered and taught in the
schools. questions can be raised as to whether the content and
approach to teaching these subjects adequately meet the purpose
for which they are intended.  Industrial Arts. for instance.
can be characterized as a severely compromised skill training
programme and thus serves a limited function as general
education.  Similarly. Home Economics remains steeped in
tradition while essential aspects of its domain of knowledge
are handled by other curriculum areas.  A point in case is




2-2
Famiiy Life Education which is currently being handled under
guidance and, in some cases, social studies. While one cannot
reasonably endorse the monopoly of curriculum content by any
one subject area, it is important to understand the value of
structuring the delivery of knowledge so that students have
some cognitive framework as to where the content fits into the
scheme of life.
If one accepts that Industrial Arts and Home Economics are the
pillars of Secondary Vocational Education, then in any
consolidation plan, one can entertain the notion of structuring
the content of Technical Vocational Education at the Secondary
Level upon these two core areas. Because of concern regarding
how these areas are currently handled, it is necessary to
explore options for addressing their subject matter. Options
for addressing Industrial Arts will be addressed first; options
for addressing Home Economics are shown in table 19.
OPTIONS IN INDUSTRIAL ARTS
The options addressed in this section (table 16) are intended
to provide the Jamaica Ministry of Education with a variety of
alternatives for enhancing the effectiveness and relevance of
the Technical and Vocational curriculum in the Secondary
Schools. A variety of options are proposed at three levels -
grades one to six, grades seven to nine and grades ten and
eleven. The range.of options is presented in order to provide
a base of information from which an appropriate curricular
design can be selected in response to current circumstances .
These current circumstances are itemized in figure 4. Options
are proposed for three grade levels because any curriculum
reform in grades 7-9 must be done with reference to curricular
practices and traditions in grades 1-6 and grades 10-11 and
beyond.
The options which are presented in table 16 are based on
several assumptions. They are as follows:
    1.   Some formal study of technology should begin in Grade 1
         so as to impart some measure of technological literacy
         to students, and to provide them with a basic
         foundation in the application of technology and an
         appreciation of technological concepts. Such a
         foundation will stem the development of biases toward
         technical and vocational pursuits. Moreover, it will
         enhance students•unde rstanding of the ways in which
         technology is used and the mathematical and scientific
         principles upon which it is based.

      2.     There is a progression of understanding of technology
             as one moves from technological illiteracy to a level
             of sophistication in understanding and employing
             technology.  Perhaps this progression can be referred
             to as stages of development in the acquisition of
             technological understanding. A sketch of these stages
             are presented in table 17. One should note that in
             teaching any subject matter related to technology, due
             consideration should be given to this natural
             progression in designing the curriculum. When students
             are quickly thrust into the more advanced stages of
             technological understanding they are inclined to
             develop an alienation from and a fear of technology,
             and they are unable to appreciate the role and
             relevance of technology in the scheme of life.

      3.     A good academic foundation (general studies) is needed
             to effectively and productively pursue any curriculum
             in Technical Vocational Education. Further, it is
             disadvantageous to the student if he/she is only
             exposed to technical vocational content since it will
             restrict academic and occupational mobility and place
             limits on his/her career aspirations.

      4.   The options presented represent a range of ideas
           instead of mutually exclusive courses of action.
           Accordingly. these ideas (options) can be merged in
           order to tailor a curriculum that is most responsive to
           existing circumstances and present and future needs.

      5.   As noted above. options are presented for Grades 1-6.
           7-9 and 10-11. The selection of an option in Grades
           1-6 is independent of the option to be selected at
           Grades 7-9 or Grades 10-11. Therefore one can select
           an option at each level and prepare the curriculum in a
           manner which will ensure articulation between levels.

The options for Industrial Arts are illustrated in figure 5.
The advantages and disadvantages of each of these options are
enumerated in figure 6.

Restructuring the Curriculum: Recommended Options

This study is proposing a most significant change in the
Technical Vocational curriculum in grades 7-9; that change
being the consolidation of the Technical Vocational curriculum
into two subje~t areas for timetabling - Technology Studies and
Home and Family Management/Personal and Family Studies. The
rationale for this recommendation is based primarily on the
fact that Technical Vocational Education at the Secondary level
has far outgrown its capacity to provide effective education
and training.  As a result. Secondary Vocational Education
represents an unfulfilled promise - in terms of its pivotal
role in the National Human Resource development strategy. and
in terms of its ability to provide a proper educational
foundation for daily living.

This situation has occurred for a variety of reasons. and they
can all be subsumed under two key factors:  the overexpansion
of the curriculum; and the significant shortage of resources
(financial. human and material). Notwithstanding. the issue at
this juncture is determining how the situation could be
remedied.  Even with massive inflow of resources the situation
is not likely to make any significant change for the better of
programming is continued at the present level.  There are just
too many structural defects.  To attend to one without
attending to the other will lead to failure; and to attend to
all at the same time may cause such a level of confusion and
disorientation. that it too will be doomed to fail.  It seems
that the prudent.response is to cut back on the level of
programming (number of courses offered) and to build a reduced
but vibrant delivery system which could be effectively
supported and maintained in order to enhance and preserve
quality.

Table 18 provides and outline of the technology studies program
for grades 7-9, and table 19 provides a chart to demonstrate
the relevance of curriculum content in the areas of interface
with technology.   It should be noted that the Technology
Studies curriculum emphasizes two key features in its design:
it is conceptually structured so that students can follow the
stages for the development of technological understanding; and,
it is based on the development of an appreciation and
understanding of technology in daily life. The curriculum will
not compromise the level of content in the related Industrial
Arts subjects; rather, it will imbue this content with a high
level of relevance in practical life. Space and time do not
permit the detailing of this framework so that the level of its
content is explicit. Hopefully, if accepted, the curriculum
designers and those who develop curriculum materials will be
able to employ their creativity in making this approach truly
viable.
The second matter related to the Technology Studies curriculum
is consolidation i.e., determining what aspects of other
subject areas could be reasonably incorporated in Technology
Studies. Table 20 provides examples of content from other
subject areas which can be incorporated. Please note that
these examples are only illustrative and may be subject to
change when a detailed curriculum is being formulated. The
purpose of the table is to show a scheme for organizing the
content under separate subject areas. In light of this
approach several issues arise:
    1.   Timetabling.
    2.   Use of Teachers.
    3.   Role of Supervisors.
    4.   Level and use of Equipment.
    5.   Relationship to the Technical Vocational curriculum in
         the second cycle (especially as it relates terminal
         exams).
These issues, and others, are addressed in the section to
follow entitled General Implementation Issues and Ideas.

                                 Technology Studies Curriculum - An Example

2-18
The Home and Family Management or Personal and Family studies
curriculum is illustrated in table 21.  It is organized by
grade level and examples of relevant content.  Several points
are to be noted about this curriculum structure.  They are
enumerated as follows:

    1.   Like the technology studies curriculum. introduction to
         the content in personal and family studies should begin
         in grade 1. and should be addressed throughout the
         primary level. The intent here is similar.   It enables
         students to acquire a basic foundation by studying
         those aspects of the subject which are pertinent to
         their-immediate experiences. Further. it will help to
         stem potential biases which may develop at a higher
         grade when 'influential others• show subject matter
         preferences and prejudices.

    2.   The content is conceptually structured so that there
         can be some level of cognitive comfort in pursuing the
         subject.   The structure appropriately illustrates that
         the content of the traditional Home Economics
         curriculum can be divided into five "conceptually
         clean" units of information.   It also illustrates that
         subject matter from other subject areas can fit within
         this structure of organizing knowledge in Home
         Economics.   For instance. the inclusion of content from
         Business education under the area of resource
         management serve ~s an illustration.

    3.   The designation of topics (in terms of their title)
         shows that topics can be entitled so as to make the
         content more attractive to students.  Using unit titles
         that are attractive and meaningful to students give the
         content a more practical focus. and it may further
         stimulate their interest in learning the subject matter
         therein.

    4.   When properly organized, a structure of knowledge can
         be formulated for each section of the curriculum so
         that it is easy to ascertain the relationship of
         content between the lower and the higher levels.  Such
         a sequential layout of the curriculum content can help
         to determine the level of prerequisite knowledge needed
         as one moves between grades.  It also provides a basis
         for monitoring and evaluating to coverage of the
         curriculum.

Neither time nor space allows for the detailed analysis and
design of curriculum content in these two areas of focus.   It
should be noted. however. that a more detailed analysis than is
reflected in this section of the report was conducted. This
preliminary analysis demonstrated that:
    a.   Students will need almost twice the amount of time
         provided on the timetable to adequately cover the
         existing curriculum.
    b.   In grades 7-9. much less content can be covered without
         being detrimental to academic success in the second
         cycle.
    c.   Much of the relevant content for this grade level can
         be covered within the structure of Technology studies
         and Personal and Family Studies.
In concluding this section due regard should be given to the
potential disruption which could result from what appears to be
a significant change in the structure and delivery of the
curriculum. Further. it will be recognized that in a few
areas. the reorganization of curriculum content may not fit
neatly into the logic upon which the consolidated structures
are framed. Notwithstanding. it seems worthwhile to
restructure the curriculum in this direction. If it is not
restructured. the Secondary Vocational Education curriculum may
well stifle itself into extinction.

GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND IDEAS

As noted before, several issues arise with respect to the
implementation of the curriculum recommended above.    The scope
of these issues may be a basis of concern, and may therefore
engender a level of reluctance to seriously explore the
feasibility of implementing such a curriculum.    These issues
are enumerated  below and' each is briefly discussed.  The issues
are as follows:

    1.   The complexity of timetabling.
    2.   Confusion in monitoring and supervision.
    3.   Effective use of teachers.
    4.   Amount of time to be allocated per period.
    5.   Whether schools, students or grade levels will be
         allowed options.
    6.   The availability of equipment and facilities.
    7.   Whether the content of Industrial Arts or any of the
         other subject areas will be compromised.
    8.   Competence of teacher.
    9.   Sequential organization of content.

The Complexity of Timetabling

There may be some concern that timetabling will become more
complex since many subject areas are incorporated into one
subject.  To some extent, there is some legitimacy to this
concern since there are more teachers to be timetabled than
there are subjects available, and since, there will essentially
be multiple subjects under one subject title.

However, such concerns may not be warranted.  In fact,
timetabling will be easier.  There are less subjects to be
timetabled first of all, and there are more teacher resources
available to teach less content.  Although it is envisioned
that only the subjects will be timetabled, it is anticipated
that the amount of time (periods per week) allotted to each
subject will be increased.  Currently, over periods per week is
allocated to the Vocational areas in grades 7-9. With a
consolidated curriculum, all this time may not be needed.

When necessary, the principal can timetable more than one
teacher for each of these 11 subject slots. 11 Therefore in
Technology Studies, for instance, the content related to
Industrial A~ts, Arts and Crafts and Business Education can be
taught in the same term.    The principal would assign all these
teachers to the 11 technology studies slot 11 since at some time
during the term each will be teaching modules in their

                                                            3-1
respective area of expertise.   The teachers can work together
to plan the scope of work for the term, team teaching can be
practiced, and efforts can be made to ensure consistency and
continuity in the coverage of materials.   It should be noted
that in any one term a teacher can be assigned to both
Technology Studies and Personal and Family Studies at the
grades 7-9 level and to his/her regular subject at the grades
10 and 11 level.   It should be further noted that while only
one area will be timetabled, several modules representing
varying content areas will be presented in a modular structure
where each module is self-contained and where each may require
a different length of time for completion.

Confusion in Monitoring and Supervision

This confusion falls into two areas (a) the fact that as many
supervisors may not be needed for the consolidated subject
areas and (b) supervisors may experience more difficulties in
monitoring teachers in their subject areas.  Neither concern is
warranted.  Teachers will still be assigned regular
responsibilities is grades 10-11 and they will have set modules
to teach in grade 7-9.  The supervisor will be needed to
monitor these teachers - especially those who are assigned to
teach in grades 7-9 since there is much more accountability for
covering the subject content within the consolidated
structure.  Though the structure of the supervisor's
responsibilities will change, the demand for the supervisors
guidance and leadership may well increase.  In fact, one
significant advantage of this approach to supervisor is that
supervisors representing different subject areas will have to
cooperate in designing and monitoring a consolidated
curriculum.  The collective wisdom of the supervisory staff can
be tapped and applied across a wider range of subject matter.

Effective Use of Teachers

At first glance it may seem that since the teachers• subjects
are not timetabled they will not be effectively used.   This is
not the case.   The teacher will be timetabled to teach specific
modules within the subject area.   So the teacher will not be
free for the specific period. Where the teacher is not
utilized at the level to which he/she is accustomed, additional
responsibilities could be assigned - curriculum development,
remedial educational and/or curriculum planning and
sequencing.   The effectiveness with which the teacher is used
depends on the effectiveness of the school's administration.




3-2
Amount of Time Allocated Per Period
The amount of time to be allocated per period must be based on
need. However such needs cannot be determined until the
consolidated curriculum is specified in detail. It is
anticipated that while it will not be as much as the sum total
of time currently allocated to the vocational subjects in
grades 7-9, it will be more than that which is currently
allocated for Home Economics and Industrial Arts combined.
Allowance of Options
Options will not be allowed in.the curriculum. To allow
options will undermine the purpose of a common curriculum, and
will be contrary to the philosophy of good general educational
foundation for all students in grades 7-9. In fact, it is
proposed that all students should be timetabled for both
Technology Studies and Personal and Family Studies.
Need for and Availability of Equipment and Facilities
There will be little need for the level of equipment and
facilities that is now required to operate Industrial Arts
Programs. Both subject areas will rely on the technology which
we encounter in daily life. Reallocation of specialized
equipment, especially in Industrial Arts, should be carried
out. In this regard, the tools and equipment which are not
needed in grades 7-9 can be transferred to schools with senior
grades where the equipment will be needed.
Compromising Content in Subject Areas
There may be the view that the consolidated curriculum will
compromise the range and depth of content in the traditional
subject areas. However, since only the subject matter that is
absolutely necessary will be taught, the content of the
curriculum will undoubtedly be reduced. With respect to
technical studies, much of the content in the current
Industrial Arts curriculum will be covered using a different
approach to instruction; but the curriculum will have more
structure and scope than it has depth.   It is believed that the
depth currently required in. many of these subject areas is
unnecessary.  In fact, such depth of average has a detrimental
effect since it prevents students from effectively
conceptualizing the body of content. Rather than being
compromised, the curriculum will be streamlined and made more
effective without restricting the potential for covering
related syllabuses in grades 10-11.




                                                           3-3
Competence of Teachers

There may be concern about whether Industrial Arts teachers can
teach the Technology Studies syllabus.  Yes. they can.  Some
training must be provided to enable these teachers to acquire
more breadth. However. because of their mechanical inclination
it will not be difficult for them to adjust.  In many cases.
most of these teachers are fully competent with the forms of
technology found in daily life.

Sequential Organization of Content

One of the problems which may arise is that. since many subject
areas are being addressed. there may be large gaps in time
between the coverage of related modules within one content
area.   In addition. there may be some difficulties in assuring
some continuity and cohesiveness in the delivery of the
curriculum.   Both points are valid.  However. measures can be
taken in the design and planning of the curriculum so that
these problems could be avoided.

In summary. none of the issues mentioned are insurmountable.
With commitment and deliberate effort the consolidated
curriculum can be effectively implemented.  It can
significantly improve the quality of Technical Vocational
Education at the Secondary Level. and can contribute to a
significant improvement on the quality of the overall
curriculum available to students in Grade 7-9.

Chapter 4
TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN THE SENIOR SECONDARY CYCLE
Emphasis has been placed on Vocational Education in grades 7-9:
but consideration of reform in Secondary Te-chnical Vocational
Education is not complete without an analysis of the curriculum
in grades 10 and 11. Although an in-depth analysis is needed
of the Technical Vocational curriculum at this level, such an
analysis promises to be both time consuming and demanding.
This section of the paper will address some key points which
may serve as a foundation for streamlining the technical
vocational curriculum at the Senior Secondary Level.
     1. The curriculum should not focus on the training of
craftsmen. Instead the curriculum should focus on an initial
level of preparation of individuals in Technical and Vocational
areas. Students should be introduced to various craft and
technical areas so that upon graduation, they are both
employable at an entry level, and are prepared to pursue
education and training if they wish in their chosen field or
other related fields.
    2. In so far as possible special schools should be
designated as secondary vocational centers. These centers can
serve many schools in the immediate geographic locale. Apart
from being efficient in terms of investment in resources, such
a strategy will eliminate many of the problems associated with
the delivery of Technical Vocational Education in the context
of the comprehensive school.
    3. The examination system should be streamlined. At the
present time there a~e several terminal exams for Vocational
Education. This not only fragments the National Technical
Vocational curriculum, it also creates confusion among students
and employers who must be assured of levels of competence to
perform in the world of work. When the curriculum is so driven
by terminal exams, and when there is such a variety of exams,
the Ministry of Education is unable to assume its role in
curriculum leadership.
    4. There should be predesignated curriculum patterns for
students pursuing vocational subjects. All students should
take, in addition to their vocational or technical courses, at
least three academic subjects including English and
Mathematics. The other subject can depend on interest or the
nature of the vocational field being pursued. rhis is very
critical if students are to have academic and occupational
flexibility beyond high school.

                                                          4-1
    s. All technical vocational curricula should be broken
down into modules of employable skills.   The determination of
the range and levels of content to be covered in these modules
should be a joint venture between all technical.vocational
institutions.   There should be common syllabuses organized by
content areas (carpentry masonry, electrical engineering
technician, technician or technologist training in the
country).   These syllabuses should be modular and competency
based.   The secondary school will assure the responsibility for
completion of some designated portion of the syllabus; and, the
remaining portion can be covered in a variety of post secondary
institutions - non formal educational institutions in evening
school, or in private industrial training.   This however,
presupposes a regional or national certification system for the
Technical/Vocational subjects.

    6. Where appropriate, schools should embark upon joint
ventures with Industry to provide training. Ideally, the more
expensive facilities for workshop practice could be made
available by industry.  This will require some policy
incentives by government to stimulate the involvement of the
private sector in training.  In the long term, the secondary
school should not be involved in vocational training - among
many other reasons, it is much too expensive, and the structure
of secondary schooling does not allow for the high level of
responsiveness to economic demand.  It will be prudent at this
time to pursue a strategy of shifting the responsibility for
specialized technical training from the public sector to the
private sector.

     7. Where possible, schools should embark upon income
generating activities .. This should be structured so that the
economic as well as the educational benefits are obtained.
Such a strategy will defray th cost of materials and supplies.
Among the ideas to be entertaineo in this regard are the
following:

      a.   Office centers to do typing, copying, and perhaps
           bookkeeping services for schools and private agencies.
      b.   Production shops for school furniture.            '
      c.   A public school apprenticeship school building program.
      d.   Vacation production programs where the school
           facilities can be used by teachers and students to
           provide services and produce goods during the vacation.

Conclusion
Major educational reforms on a National level have generally
failed. This statement is not meant as a note of
discouragement but as a signal for caution. In exercising
caution, note should be taken of the factors which usually seem
to undermine the successful implementation of reform
initiatives. Hopefully. the MOE could embark upon measures so
that these factors do not undermine the realization of current
reform objectives. The factors are enumerated and discussed
below.
     1. Homogeneity of Ideas. There must be a high level of
internal consistency in the ideas that are proposed for
reforming the educational system. Policies. administrative
structures and practices. and curriculum design and
implementation must all be done in a manner which minimizes
internal conflict and promotes coordination and cooperation.
Only with a homogeneous set of reform ideas will the education
system become fluid and efficient.
     2. Consistent vision as an anchor. It is essential to
have a vision of what the educational system should be.
Without this vision. there is likely to be several digressions
in pursuit of an improved educational structure and an
effectively delivered process of education. Only with such a
vision. a feasible plan and the ability to marshal resources in
the right direction that one is able to move the education
system forward. While a certain level of inflexibility is
being promoted; it is not being promoted at the expense of
entertaining new ideas and modifying plans where necessary.
One has to avoid being flexible to the point of being
misdirected.
    3.  Balance between Political interest and educational
        responsibility. A public education system is
responsible to the public at large; hence political interest is
inherent in the national administration of education. There
should always be a balance between political interest and
educational responsibility. While the former ensures that the
public interest is met; the latter safeguards the integrity of
the educational system.
    4. The psychological climate implementation of reform.
Very little will be accomplished if the psychological climate
is not favorable. The matters which affect a teachers
motivation, for instance, may well appear simple and be readily
overlooked. But without a motivated teacher in the classroom
the primary objective of the educational investment is
compromised.


                                                          4-3
    11. Commitment to monitoring and evaluation. Without
effective monitoring and evaluation the reform movement is
likely to become fragmented and misguided. Monitoring and
evaluating are essential to ensure that objectives are
understood. that policies are properly interpreted. and among
others. to ensure that there is no unnecessary divergence
between the plans formulated and the activities upon which
school personnel may embark.
    12. Compromising on high short term cost. On many reform
initiatives. short term cost is high. There is a minimum cost
at which future implementation success could be possible. The
further one drops below this minimum cost. the more likely it
is that one•s long term objectives will not be met. Too much
compromise in the short term can lead to implementation failure
in the long run.
Hopefully. these ideas are useful in considering strategies for
realizing the objectives of the curriculum reform.

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

It is in the implementation of the common curriculum that the
curriculum reform initiative may face its greatest challenge.
For, in addition to the typical constraints which affect the
feasibility and ease of implementation such as the availability
of resources and the adequacy of institutional structures,
there are a variety of factors which are likely to undermine
implementation success. For example, there are significant
differences between types of schools and the nature of the
curriculum within each school type.  The All Age School, for
instance, in which over 40% of the secondary school students
are enrolled, provides a standard of education that is
significantly below that provided by these other secondary
schools.  The facilities of these schools are equally
inadequate.

The major implementation challenge, then, is to provide a
common curriculum in the secondary schools which does not
detract from the educational standard set by the Traditional
High Schools, and which at the same time, is not pitched
outside of the reach of the All Age School in terms of the
quality of the teaching cadre, the academic abilities of
students and the nature of existing facilities.   The
polarization of interest in a attempt to influence the nature
of the reform makes the situation even more complex.    On the
one hand, the representations of the All Age School will seek
to ensure that the common curriculum does not place their
students in a position of further disadvantagement.    The
representatives of the Traditional  High Schools, on  the  other
hand, will seek to ensure that the quality of their academic
offerings is not compromised.   These factors still do not
include considerations such as the interests represented by
other school types, the influence of terminal examination on
the receptivity to and adoption of the new curriculum and the
requirements for the development and adoption of new curricula,
among others.

The basic requirements for an implementation strategy are
recommended as follows.

    1. The common curriculum could only be realized over a
period of a specified number of years.   It cannot be
immediately adopted, and it cannot be allowed to remain in a
developmental stage for over too long a period.   Accordingly,
it is recommended that planning should ensure for the adoption
of the curriculum over a 5 year period. During this period,
schools will work toward the realization of the common
curriculum having due regard to the unique circumstances under
which they each function.

                                                            5-1
    2. Consistent with #1 above. the implementation strategy
should be designed by school type since each school type
represents a unique set of circumstances to be considered in
structuring implementation.
    3. There should be a one year planning period to precede
the five year period of implementation. Hence there will be a
six year implementation cycle.
    4. Only the group of students who enter grade 7 in the
first year of implementation will be introduced to the new
curriculum. This allows time for any adjustment in terminal
exams; it allows for phased curriculum development. testing and
adoption; and it prevents disruption in the courses of study of
students who are already pursuing a different syllabus.
    5. The curriculum should be pilot tested in sample schools
before widespread implementation. The sample of schools should
represent all school types, rural/urban location and the
variation in facilities and in abilities of students.
Tables 22, 23, and 24 note factors which should be considered
in the formulation of an implementation strategy by school type.

Comprehensive                There are six comprehensive high
High Schools                 schools with a total enrollment of
                             7,500 and an enrollment of 3,500 in

FRAMEWORK FOR A NATIONAL TRAINING PLAN

Definition

A National Training Plan is a comprehensive structure for
delivering training and educational services related to the
world of work such that it allows for the joint development and
implementation of national objectives, targets and strategies
for training.

It should be noted, however, that the concept of a National
Training Plan does not, and should not, limit the activities of
the plan to training services.  The ultimate objective of the
plan is to foster national development through the maintenance
and effective utilization of an adequate stock of skills in the
country.  This requires a wider vision than that of a myopic
training perspective.  The Training Plan must in some way
address policies and strategies for job creation and manpower
allocation.  Further, it must deal with both the systems which
provide assistance to citizens to get and keep jobs and the
policies which provide the necessary incentives and sanctions
so that these individuals remain maximally productive in their
respective jobs.

Rationale for a National Training Plan

While the foregoing definition of a National Training Plan
clearly infers some of the justifications for or the
significance of such a document, it is necessary to be very
explicit about the benefits which can be derived from such a
plan.   These benefits are enumerated as follows:

      1.   Training should be planned so as to reduce unnecessary
           duplication, and the possibility of oversupply in
           specific occupations.

      2.   Such planning will maximize the use of resources and
           facilities.

      3.   With a variety of training alternatives available, it
           will be more convenient to select the best training
           under given circumstances.

      4.   It will be easier to monitor and respond to manpower
           supply and demand forces under a nationally
           co-ordinated strategy for delivering training services.

      5.   A National Training Plan will promote a common
           perspective on national training goals and strategies.
           It will change the training environment from a
           conglomeration of relatively independent actors to an
           integrated and unified body of service deliverers.

C-2
    6.   In such a co-ordinated framework it is easier for each
         participating training organization to understand its
         role in the national training enterprise.
Essential Components of the National Training Plan
    1.   A functional administrative structure and process.
    2.   An approved and integrated network of service
         deliverers.
    3.   A national inventory of training services offered.
    4.   A standardized process for the identification and
         selection of clients.
    5.   An information system for monitoring and decision
         making.
    6.   A functional structure for planning a responsive
         programme of training.
    7.   An inter-organizational mechanism for setting training
         priorities.
    8.   An adequate and stable source of financial support.
    9.   Policy and financial incentives to sustain the interest
         and involvement of the private sector.
    10. A standardized certification system for all
        sub-professional occupations.
    11. A co-operative system between Industry and the National
        Training Board for the delivery of staff development
        services.
    12. A National Resource Centre for Technical Vocational
        Education and Training.
    13. A National Warehouse and registry of equipment that is
        available for mounting training programmes.
    14. Rapid reaction facilities for providing emergency
        training.
Each of these components is briefly addressed in the
subsections which follow. Collectively. these components will
form the pillars upon which a sturdy structure for the
implementation of a National Training Plan can be built.


                                                              C-3
1.    A Functional Administrative Structure and Process
The key feature of the proposed administrative structure is the
creation of one administrative entity with the responsibility
to manage all sub-professional training and training at the
national level. This administrative body must have the legal
authority to allocate training responsibilities, and to
initiate, modify or terminate sub-professional training
programmes wherever these programmes are offered. The
administrative body will function as the hub of a fully
co-ordinated and cohesive training system characterized by its
central administration and decentralized delivery.
2.    A Network of Service Deliverers
The success of the training plan depends on an integrated
network of service deliverers. By service deliverers is meant
the network of facilities that actually deliver training
services or the training establishments which prepare
individuals for the world of work. Network as a concept refers
to the allocation of responsibilities among training entities
such that each organization functions as an important part of a
cohesive national system of training.
3.    A National Inventory of Services Offered
It will be the responsibility of the Division as the single
administrative body to develop a comprehensive list of all the
programmes that are available in the country and to note among
other information where these programmes are being offered.
Individuals who are interested in training services could then
assess the availability of programmes in which they are
interested, and firms in various economic sectors could easily
identify areas in which they need training personnel for which
programmes are not available.
4.    A Standardized Process for the Identification and Selection
      of Clients
A national system of training should be structured so that any
citizen, irrespective of previous education, training or
experience could successfully pursue vocational training for
entry into or advancement in the world of work. This requires
that applicants for training programmes be carefully assessed
and placed in training programmes which are best suited to
their level of education and experience. There must be a
procedure for enabling these decisions to be made.




C-4
5.   An Information System for Monitoring and Decision Making
An information system is essential to the effective operation
of the national training system. A system must be established
so that information can be collected from all training entities
on a periodic basis. This information will facilitate
decision-making to ensure the effectiveness of the training
system. Training institutions will be required to submit.
inter alia. information on students (biographic data. level on
enrollment per programme and performance statistics). teachers
(qualifications. effectiveness. staff development needs)
facilities and equipment (capacity of programmes. condition of
equipment and facilities. needs for new equipment). and cost
statistics (cost per programme. cost per enrollee per programme
etc.). This body of information on all training facilities
will provide the necessary data for assessing the performance
of the training system.
6.   A Functional Structure for Planning a Responsive Programme
     of Training
A systematic programme of training must be responsive to the
economic circumstances which will dictate the need for training
personnel. Responsiveness. however. is not automatic. The
system must be structured in a manner which will allow it to
respond. The keys to responsiveness are information and
flexibility.
Changes in technological. economic. social and institutional
circumstances must be monitored so that the need to respond can
be detected. But there must be machinery for utilizing the
data to make decisions. It is anticipated that these data will
be collected by the Division. The Division will identify the
need to respond to particular circumstances. and. after
consultation with its advisory bodies. it will determine and
implement a mode of response.
7.   An Inter-organizational Mechanism for Setting Training
     Priorities
An inter-ministerial planning committee would be an ideal body
for establishing training priorities. These priorities must be
reviewed periodically. and the training system must be
constantly monitored to ensure that the thrust of activities is
aligned with the established priorities. Only through this
mechanism coutd the national relevance of training be
established.




                                                              C-5
8.    An Adequate and Stable Source of Financial Support
An adequate and stable source of funds is necessary to
implement a comprehensive national training plan. Direct or
indirect funding is necessary to elicit the participation of
industry as partners in the training enterprise. Financing is
also necessary to provide the support services such as
monitoring the performance of the system, data collection and
management and materials development, among others. The
portion of the Unemployment Levy that was intended for training
should be utilized to support this training plan. Financial
arrangements such as those which have been successfully
implemented in other countries can be explored.
9.    Policy and Financial Incentives to Sustain the Interest and
      Involvement of the Private Sector
Tax rebate policies and duty-free and tax relief concessions
can form an overall package of incentives for firms to
participate in the national training enterprise. In some
circumstances, however, it may be necessary for the Government
to provide direct funding to private firms through a
sub-contracting arrangement so that the facilities of these
firms can be used to provide up-to-date, on site training. A
variety of other cost-sharing arrangements can be explored; but
the end result is that firms will see it as beneficial to
participate in the training system.
10.   A Standardized Certification System for all
      Sub-professional Training
It is necessary to ensure that all students who have been
trained possess an acceptable level of competence for entry
into the world of work. The National Examinations Council for
Vocational Education already has a structure for the
certification of students. Yet there are other bodies which
certify students as being trained. Differences in requirements
and standards lead to differences in competence and a sense of
distrust among employers. Such problems will be resolved with
a single national certification body that sets the standards
for all sub-professional training. This certification body can
be supported by a curriculum development function which
prepares syllabuses and monitors the implementation of these
syllabuses in the schools.




C-6
11.   A Co-operative System between Industry and the National
      Training Board for the delivery of Staff Development
      Services
It is necessary to maintain a cadre of well qualified staff for
the effective operation of the training system. Since a
variety of pedagogical and technical expertise will be
represented among the diversity of organizations in the
training system. a sharing of expertise for staff development
purposes will be an efficient and cost-effective measure to
maintain or enhance the level of competence of all personnel in
the system. There should be periodic assessment of staff
development needs throughout the system. and a yearly schedule
of staff development activities should be prepared and
disseminated to participating training institutions.
12.   A National Resource Centre for Technical/Vocational
      Education and Training
Because of the knowledge explosion is recent decades. it is
essential to maintain a base of materials and information for
personnel who are involved with technical/vocational education
and training. The Centre will assume the responsibility for
collecting these materials and making them available to
interested personnel in technical vocational education and
training. The Resource Centre will function as the base of
knowledge for the technical/vocational education and training
system. The goals and activities of this Centre are detailed
elsewhere in this document.
13.   A National Warehouse and Registry of Equipment for
      Mounting Training Programmes
In a flexible system offering training services there must be a
comprehensive equipment inventory system to ensure that
national resources (i.e .• equipment) are effectively utilized.
Equipment that is not in use can be entered on an available
equipment list so that the necessary transfer can be made to
institutions where such equipment is needed. Equipment
donations. surplus equipment and unused equipment that use too
much space could be stored in a central warehouse facility to
be made available to institutions when needed.




                                                            C-7
14.   Rapid Reaction Facilities for Providing Emergency
      Training Services
Circumstances often arise in which there is need for rapidly
mounted customized training services. This may be due to
industrial expansion or restructuring, immigrating firms,
technological change affecting industrial processes; or in some
cases national emergencies which may require the training of
service workers at short notice. A structure must be put in
place to accommodate this type of training.
SUMMARY
                            -
Training nationally will benefit universally from such a
comprehensive training system. The goals that are detailed in
the following chapter will move us steadfastly toward the
implementation of such a national training system.

Report on the Assessment of Employer Training

AN ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYER NEEDS AND PERCEPTIONS

As part of the World Bank IV project to reform secondary
education in Jamaica. a employer needs assessment survey was
conducted.  The intent of the survey was to ascertain the views
of employers with respect to: (1)  their satisfaction with the
quality of training in the schools in Jamaica.   (2) their
perceptions regarding occupations in which there is and will be
need for training and (3) the type of training arrangements
which will be most appropriate to their businesses.   A survey
questionnaire was developed by the consultant for Technical
Vocational Education and Training. and was administered by Dr.
Leo Richards. local consultant in Manpower_ Research.

A purposive sample of 75 firms was selected.   These firms
represented a wide array of businesses as indicated in
Table 1. The firms which categorized themselves in the "other"
category could have been distributed throughout the designated
categories - wholesale and retail trade etc. For instance
"electrical installation" would fit under construction. and
"Garage Service" could have been placed under retail trade.     It
should be noted. however. that most of the firms in the "other"
category represented service occupations as will be noted in
Table 1. Column 1. A total of 40 firms (53.3%) were in the
service category. 32 (41.3%) in the manufacturing category and
4 (5.3%) in the construction category.   This selection of firms
does not represent the distribution of firms in Jamaica.    The
difficulty of soliciting responses prevented the selection of a
truly representative sample.   Though the sample may not be
representative. the responses do seem to generally mirror the
perception of employers as has been determined through informal
conversations with business leaders.

Most industries (50.7%) reported the growth (50.7%) or a
leveling off (30.7%) of business activity (Table 2).  This is
typically the type of business environment where employers are
most concerned about the quality of their employees.  In this
respect. the responses provided is all the more significant to
the educational community in general and to personnel in
Vocational Education and Training in particular.

Table 3 and 4 provide information regarding the type of firms
in terms of number of employees. Most of the firms were small
- below 20 employees - and many had large numbers in part time
employment.  It should be noted. however. that over 20% of the
firms had more than 120 employees with 12% having more than 160.

    Table 5 presents data on the number of employees who have
    received training in Jamaica's schools by type of school in
    which training was received. The data indicates that most
    firms hire employees from all the local schools. But few firms
    in this sample seemed inclined to hire HEART graduates.l It
    is apparent, however, that the business activity of the firm
    will in large measure determine the type of students (by
    school) that they are likely to hire; and this may imply that
    the jobs secured by students will vary by school type. For
    instance, many firms hire a significant number of All Age
    school graduates: a paint manufacture hired 78, aluminum
    fabricator, 56; manufacturer of confectionery, 126, coffee
    producer, 95; manufacture of bottles 440 etc. Further analysis
    must be done to determine the nature of jobs that are done by
    graduates according to school type. The data seem to infer
    that the graduates from some schools provide a ready source of
    inexpensive labour.
    Table 6 indicates that "employee referral" and "newspaper ads"
    are the primary means through which employers recruit.
    However, many of the firms indicated their use of school
    placement officers when asked the best source for the
    identification of new employees. Perhaps a placement function
    for high school graduates may well enhance their employment
    possibilities.
    Table 7 through 10 attempts to assess the level and adequacy of
    training provided within the firm. The responses provided do
    indicate that some level of intervention by the formal training
    system is needed to supplement industrial training. Over 70%
    of the firms are heavily engaged in training, and about half of
    them are .dissatisfied with the quality of their own training.




    1 Please note that this has been verified through a manual
    review of the questionnaires. Most forms left the designated
    column blank. The categorization of the data for analysis did
    not bring this out very clearly in the analysis. Further
    analysis of the data is needed to explore this tendency in the
    table .

Although equipment vendors provide training, about 60% of the
respondents are not satisfied with the training provided by
vendors.  It appears that firms find it necessary to embark
upon their own training programs, either because the training
system is not responsive, or because it is more efficient and
effective to provide in house training. Notwithstanding, the
splintering of training endeavors publicly and privately leads
to a substantial level of inefficiency in the allocation of
training dollars nationally. The fact that their is some level
of dissatisfaction among firms with their in house training
capacity does indicate that there is an avenue through which
the formal training system could be of more service to these
firms. A list is provided of the topics in which skill
training is provided by industry (Table lOA).
Table 11 examines the frequency with which employers hire
graduates by school type. The data indicates that firms are
more inclined to hire graduates from the secondary schools than
they are inclined to hire graduates from HEART. Graduates from
CAST are also hired at a frequent rate.  It should be noted
however, that a firm's predisposition to hire will depend on
the type of business activity and the nature of the firms human
resource requirements. In this regard, a firm may indicate
that it is less likely to hire a particular type of graduate as
a result of its human resource needs.
But it may well be that some firms are not inclined to hire
graduates from particular institutions because of the quality
of their training, or because of other factors which may render
certain individuals inappropriate. To the extent that the
latter is true, this may warrant some attention to determine
where training dollars should be allocated; or alternatively,
what must be done in order to improve the a6ceptability of
students from particular institutions.
Tables 12 and 13 indirectly examine employers perception of the
value of training. Over 80% of the employers believe that
training increases a student's opportunity for job placement,
and over 50% of these employers believe that training plays a
considerable role in this regard. over 80% of these employers
believe that training increases the opportunity for job
advancement; with over 50% believing that training is of
considerable importance for this purpose. Employers generally
believe in the value of training and appears to seek out
qualified prospects. They are beginning to invest
significantly more money in their own training activities.
This does infer that there is a receptive environment among
employers to enhance the National Training System.

Table 14 assesses the extent to which employers are familiar
with the National Training System. Very few employers were
confident enough to note that they were 11 very familiar" with
the training system. While 10% indicated that they were
"unfamiliar," most (over 70%) indicated that they were
"relatively" to 11 moderately 11 familiar. This, perhaps, could
have been anticipated.    There are so many differences between
programs, training institutions and certification systems, that
employers may well be baffled in their attempt to understand
and use the system to their best advantage.

Most employers found training opportunities to be convenient
(Table 15), although a few indicaied some inconvenience due to
scheduling (Table 15A).

Table 16 assesses the extent to which employers are satisfied
with the competence of school graduates by school type.  The
data are not as conclusive.  Employers seem somewhat
satisfied.  The highest level of satisfaction is with Technical
High School graduates and graduates from CAST.  The highest
level of dissatisfaction is with secondary school graduates
(30%), although almost 50% indicated either satisfied or very
satisfied. Many employers also seem to be satisfied with the
HEART graduates they have hired.

Table 17 summarizes data on employers• assessment of the
quality of graduates on particularly dimensions.   Students are
generally very willing to learn although there may be concerns
about the level of their technical and basic education skills.
Table 17A provide a list of employers• responses when they were
a~ked about the areas in which recruits are most likely to
demonstrate weaknesses.  The areas that were mentioned most
often are "customer relationship," writing skills,
communication skills, motivation and dependability. Many
employers expressed concern about the students• inability to
operate machines.  The data seem to indicate that the quality
of training could be enhanced.  In addition to technical
skills, students• basic skills and their personal skills must
be improved.

Table 18 examines occupational areas in which the employment
prospects are promising.   Jobs .in the electronics industry and
in the machine trades seem to have promising futures.    Jobs
prospects in the construction industry seems good, while those
in the clerical occupations seem stable.    Table 18A lists
occupations which, in the opinion of employers, seem to have
good employment prospects.

        Some classes (e.g .• Duff's) start at s:oo p.m. and
        others at midday. This type of scheduling requires
        employees to take time off. Classes should be started
        at a time that is convenient to individuals who work.
        Program requires day release for employees.
        Trainees lack sufficient skill and work experience to
        function on the job.
N.B.    It is apparent that training programs in formal
        education institutions are not set up in a manner to
        accommodate the needs of individuals who work. As a
        result. employers are inclined to set up their own
        training programs or use consultants who provide such
        training systems in the country. Employers generally
        do not view the formal training sector as an avenue
        through which retraining and upgrading needs of
        employees can be satisfied.

N.B.    It was noted by one respondent that there will not be
        any significant growth in new and emerging
        occupations. Rather, there will be significant changes
        in existing occupations, which will be brought about by
        changes in technology.  I tend to agree. This does
        point to the need for some capacity in the formal
        training systems to retrain and upgrade workers. There
        is need to reexamine the relevance of the traditional
        training structures. As one respondent noted, the
        training system must become more adaptable to the needs
        of the society. This may not only refer to the array
        of vocational areas in which training is offered but
        also to the structures which may well place limits on
        our ability to be responsive to the changing needs of
        employers.




G-18
Tables 19 to 21 attempts to assess the manner in which the
training system could be of best service to employers. Many
employers indicated that they were not in need of support from
training institutions. Firms which expressed a need for
support preferred specialized courses in electronics and
machine trade areas. Many firms expressed needs for formal
training and in-plant training. It may well be, that most
firms need training of a specialized nature. Firms' reluctance
to express this need may have resulted from their long held
perception/prejudices regarding the capacity of the formal
training system to provide assistance. Table 20 indicates that
firms are very interested in tailored programs, short term
programs and tax credits for training. Table 21 substantiates
firms' interests in seminar and workshops (short term training)
and highlights their receptivity to some form of formal
training. About 36% of the firms expressed a desire to be
visited by training institutions to embark on discussions
regarding training possibilities (Table 22). Although somewhat
cautious, employers seem very receptive to the establishment of
closer ties with the formal training system to meet their
training needs.
Table 23 lists the comments made by respondents regarding the
changes they desire in the training system. The list is very
informative. Although somewhat divergent in focus, the
employers seem to express two critical points which should be
noted by the vocational education and training community.
First, there is need for a greater emphasis on skill
development; and secondly, students need more adequate
preparation in basic skills. This may well infer that in
attempting to emphasize skill development under difficult
circumstances, the secondary education system has undermined
its ability to provide a sound basic education while doing a
mediocre job at skill training. There is need for significant
overhaul and restructuring of the curriculum.

       Greater emphasis on the English language.
       More vocational training.
       Expansion of technical training.
       Students should be exposed to the repairs of air
       conditioning in a more direct way rather than exposure
       in general electronics.
       The courses offered in electrical installation,
       especially at the secondary school level should be
       tailored to.suit our society's need.

       sales and marketing strategies.
       Training should start from first form; not just after
       high school (Hotel Service).
       Schools should place more emphasis on attitudinal
       skills.
       Courses in insurance sales should be offered in more
       institutions.
       Students should be exposed to additional areas of work
       apart from traditional woodwork, home economics, etc.

Have trainees exposed to the work environment during
their formal training.
In addition to learning the specifics. trainees should
be taught as part of the curriculum: attitudes at the
work place. and working as a team to achieve the bottom
line.
on the job training.
Encourage people in the work world to return to
training.
A more practical approach to training.
Train students in the knowledge and use of machines.
Restoration of a more vibrant apprenticeship program.
Wider opportunities for vocational instructors to
receive training.
Better and more up-to-date machines and equipment in
training institutions.
More practical training in various companies.
Home economics students should be trained to fit into
the manufacturing of confectioneries.
More modern and up-to-date machines and equipment for
use in training institutions.
Need for adequately trained and remunerated staff in
training institutions.
Concentrate more on the practical needs of society
e.g .• teaching of construction skills and techniques.
Students should be introduced to vocational areas at a
younger age.
More practical and hands on training.
School curriculum should address "customer
relationships" for students in forms 2 and 5.
More emphasis should be placed on skills required for
the job.
Government should give aid to more needy students and
stop helping the people who can afford it. Money
should be spent on primary education.
Students at secondary level should be exposed to the
nature of services in the hotel industry e.g .• serving
and meal preparation.
Students should be introduced to locksmithing.
Courses should be set up to train people in the major
areas of the uses of chemicals.
Too many individual consultants means that training is
expensive. A regulatory body should be set up so that
joint ventures could be forged.
More emphasis on practical rather than theory.
Students are not taught the preparation of oriental and
European cuisine. Students should be given a chance to
prepare more interesting meals.
Students need more field background.

Recommendations Based on the Employers Need Assessment Survey

1.   Conduct a more comprehensive and detailed survey to
     ascertain the views of a wider array of employers so that
     they can participate in improving the national training
     system.
2.   Embark upon initiatives to streamline training nationally
     so that training resources. could be effectively and
     efficiently allocated. Since most industries now engage in
     some form of in-house training. attempts should be made to
     accommodate private training as part of .the National·
     Training structure.
3.   Consider. as part of the national training policy. a system
     of tax incentives to encourage the participation of private
     firms in nationally established training goals.
4.   Reexamine and attend to the factors which tend to undermine
     the quality of training in Secondary schools and HEART.
5.   Examine closely the extent to which the Secondary school
     curriculum attends only to the non-instrumental goals of
     education. While education for jobs and social success is
     important. attention must be given to the importance of
     education for the development of human character. Too many
     employers have complained about poor interpersonal
     relations skills among students. and their lack of
     motivation and dependability.
