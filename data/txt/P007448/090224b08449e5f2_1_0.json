For a six-month period in 1989 and a one-month\n            period in 1990, the study group addressed the terms of\n            reference prepared by the Ministry of Education, i.e. the\n            rationalization of existing institutional types, development\n            of new curricula, and the feasibility of a unified lower\n            secondary cycle. In 1983, a United Nations Educational,\n            Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report on\n            education in Jamaica had suggested a common curriculum for\n            the lower cycle of secondary schools.  The study begins with\n            an overview in chapter one of the present system, the\n            historical forces which still shape it, and the major\n            problems which need to be addressed. The basic reasons were\n            outlined in chapter two. Recommendations for focus and\n            balance in the curriculum are presented in chapters three\n            and four. The main objective of the current reform of the\n            Jamaican secondary education system is the definition of a\n            common curriculum for all the students of grades seven-nine\n            is presented in chapter five. A plan for teacher education\n            and staff development is presented in chapter six.  Finally,\n            in chapter seven, an enhanced operational role for school\n            boards within the context of strong central planning by the\n            Ministry of Education is described. An incremental strategy\n            for implementation is presented as a guide to the work of\n            school boards and the Ministers and officials of the\n            Ministry in the task of introducing and implementing the reforms."}, "docdt": "1990-08-01T14:28:00Z"}
