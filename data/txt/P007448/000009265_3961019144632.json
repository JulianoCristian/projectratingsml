The main objectives of the\n            project were to prepare, pilot, and evaluate options for\n            cost-effective measures for qualitative improvement of basic\n            education (with particular emphasis on Grades 7-9), and more\n            efficient administration and targeting of the Student's\n            Loan Program (SLP) for higher education. The Bank's\n            performance in most stages of the project cycle was\n            satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The\n            most significant lessons learned from the implementation\n            experience of this project are: (i) although the Ministry of\n            Education was effective in implementing the education\n            components, it did not perform well in contracting or\n            managing civil works; (ii) to increase the financial\n            sustainability and administrative efficiency of student loan\n            programs, significant attention should be given, and\n            enforceable covenants included in the Loan Agreement and\n            monitored; (iii) the complexity of government procurement\n            procedures are evident in this project and in other\n            Bank-supported projects; and (iv) the Bank should be\n            extremely cautious in granting project extension requests\n            for projects that have experienced such difficulties."}, "docdt": "1995-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
