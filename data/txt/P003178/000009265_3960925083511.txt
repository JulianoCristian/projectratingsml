SOUTHERN PROVINCE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPENRT PROJECT
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
PREFACZ
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Southern Provinco
Agricultural Development Project (SPADP) in Zambia, for which IDA Credit 1193-
ZA in the amount of US$18.0 million was approved on December 12, 1981. The
Credit was suspended in May 1987 when Zambia's withdrawal rights were suspended
due to arrears on Bank loans.  At closing, the Credit showed an undisbursed
balance of about US$12.7 million. The last disbursement was made in May 1988.
The Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared
by the staff of the Agriculture Operations Division, Southern Africa Department,
Africa Regional Office. The PCR is based on a draft PCR prepared by FAO/CP after
examination of project files, discussions with Bank staff involved in project
appraisal and supervision, consultation in Zambia with Central Government and
Southern Province Authorities and existing project staff. Part II of the PCR
was prepared by the Borrower.

SOUTHERN PROVInC  AMRICULTU AL DEVELOPNT PROJECT
PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
VALUATIOf SA31RY
Obiectives
1.     The project objectives were to increase crop and livestock production and
thus raise farm incomes within the traditional farm sector in the Southern
Province. This was to be achieved through improving extension services along
the T&V system and providing greater access to credit; expanding input and crop
storage facilities; and upgrading veterina%7 services to control livestock
diseases. The project also aimed at strengtze-ning the planning and project
implementation capability of the Provincial PlannLng Unit (PPU) through technical
assistance. The project objectives were sound, given the low productivity in
smallholder agriculture in the province and the Government policy to decentralize
agricultural planning and project implementation functions to the provinces.
Implementation Exierience
2.    Implementation progress was very slow throughout the project period. At
.he closing date, only about 29Z of the IDA funds had been disbursed. Several
problems contributed to the overall poor implementation of the project: too
frequent changes in key local staff assigned to the project undermined
appreciation of project objectives; difficulties in providing start-up local
funds, with a consequent inability to establish a project account, delayed
project effectiveness for seven months; problems in the appointment of key local
staff, which were only alleviated through technical assistance financed by FAO
under trust funds, hampered initiation of various project's activities; and lack
of incentives for local project staff contributed to low morale and motivation.
Total actual project costs were about 'JS$6.9 million compared to Appraisal
estimate of US$23.8 million. The shortfall in actual costs was due to the fact
that project's physical inputs fell far short of SAR targets.
3.    Implementation of the extension comonent was considerably limited by
several factors: a severe drought faced by the country during the first three
years of the project; inadequate budgetary allocations for the local counterpart
funds relative to requirements; cumbersome and bureaucratic procurement
procedures; poor selection and supervision of contractors, thus slowing progress
in the construction of staff houses, agricultural stations and camps; lack of
effective linkages between extension and research services which reduced the
impact of extension staff; and a demoralizing rivalry between the PPU and the
office of the Provincial Agricultural Officer (PAO) which resulted in poor
implementation of the T&V system. For the livestock component, formation of user



- iv -
committees and introduction of user charges, which were conditions of
disbursement for the renovationiconstruction of dip tanks, were not fulfilled
until the last year of the project, resulting is poor operation and maintenance
of  the  available  dip  tanks.    Construction  of  storaae  facilities  was
satisfactorily carried out but utilization of the facilities was hampered
throughout the project period by lack of a clear delineation of marketing and
storage responsibilities between the National Agricultural Marketing Board
(NAMBOARD) and Southern Province Cooperative Marketing Union (SPCMU). The credit
funds of about US$ 0.4 million channelled through Zambia Agricultural Development
Bank (ZADB) were utilized but none of the US$2.7 million earmarked for credit-
in-kind through SPCMU was utilized as other national and bilateral funds were
available.
Results
4.   Overall, the project achieved little relative to its objectives. The only
major components that met their targets were technical assistance, and
construction of storage facilities and livestock crush pens (Table 6, A.). An
awareness of the T&V system of extension services was developed, but
implementation of the system was minimal due to various problems (para 1.12).
Civil work; related to the construction of extension staff houses, agricultural
stations and camps fell far short of the appraisal targets (Table 6, A).
Although the storage component met its targets, utilization was limited by
administrative difficulties (para 1.14). Most of the funds intended for credit
to farmers remained unutilized (para 1.15). While notable success was achieved
in controlling livestock diseases unrelated to ticks, the achievements were
negated by outbreak of tick-borne diseases due to poor dipping facilities (para
1. 18). With exception of strengthening of PPU's capability, the project achieved
little regarding institution-building objectives (para 1.19). Although lack of
data prevents quantitative assessment of the project's impact on production,
indications suggest that it had negligible impact and that rates of return are
likely to be substantially below appraisal estimates due to poor performance of
the extension and credit components, with minimal effect on crop production;
under-utilization of storage facilities; and outbreak of tick-borne diseases
(para 1.20).
Sustainability
5.   The project is not sustainable. Extension services based on the T&V system
calls for high levels of recurrent expenditures which Zambia will find difficult
to sustain because of budgetary constraints. Although the recent establishment
of user committees and introduction of user charges will help to improve
operation and maintenance of dipping facilities for livestock, availability of
veterinarian drugs and dipping chemicals will continue to be limitad by foreign
exchange constraint. The amount of funds provided by the project for credit to
farmers is likely to be increasingly eroded by high inflation and low repayment
rate. The storage component involves relatively simple structures which are
readily sustainable. Achievements in strengthening the capability of PPU will
be difficult to sustain in view of the country-wide shortage of qualified
manpower and frequent transfer of civil servants.



Findinas and Lessons Learnt
6.    The main lessons that can be learnt from the implementation of this project
are detailed in paras 1.26 and 1.27. The lessons suggest thats (a) T&V system
should be modified to reflect conditions and constraints specific to the country;
(b) it is important to ensure effective linkages between extension and research
services; (c) project design needs to allow a realistic implementation period;
(d) implementation responsibility and authority over project resources should
be properly matched; and (e) care should be taken in the selection of technical
assistance personnel and such personnel shnuld be placed preferably in an
advisory capacity rather than in line positions.

Country            t    Republic of Zambia
Sector                   Agriculture
Background
1.2         Zambia, a l-andlocked country covering some 760,000 sq. km, has a
population of about 7 million which is growing at 3.41 per annum. Some 401 of
the population lives in urban areas. The economy is heavily dependen'- )n
copper which, with other minerals, accounts for about 951 of the country's
exports. Since 1975, the economy has been steadily worsening, with serious
fiscal and balance of payments problems. Shortage of foreign exchange
resources and budgetary constraints have led to increasing delays in
implementation of projects and a deterioration of basic infrastructure
throughout the country.
1.3         As copper deposits are expected to be exhausted over the next 15-
20 years, the Government's policy is to diversify the economy. To this end,
the agricultural sector, with its vast unexploited resources, offers the best
potential. The sector provides a living for about 601 of the population,
employs 671 of the labor force but contributes only 171 of GDP. It is
markedly dualistic with a small modern subsector of about 800 farmers, and a
traditional subsector, comprising 600,000 subsistence-oriented farm
households. During the 1980s, agriculture grew at about 2.81 per annum, which
is considerably less than the population growth rate, and self-sufficiency in
staple food grains declined to 851 from 971 in the 1960s. The Southern
Province is an area of high potential, with 351 of the marketed maize surplus
and over 40Z of the national cattle herd.
1.4         In recognition of the fact that agriculture has to replace mining
as the lead sector in the economy, the Government at the turn of the decade
initiated four projects, supported by the Bank and other donors, to increase
agr.cultural growth through improved support services to traditional farmers.
The Southern Province Agricultural Development Project (SPADP) was the second



2
of four projects, all ongoing more or less simultaneoualy. The first was the
Eastern Province Agricultural Development Project (EPADP) in 1981, and the
third was the IFAD-assisted Northwestern Agricultural Development Project
(NWADP) in 1983. The fourth project was the Bank-supported Dairy Development
Project (DDP) which sought to expand milk output and sales in the Southern and
Central Provinces.
1.5         The project which is the subject of this completion report was
identified by the Bank in September/October 1978. Project preparation work
was initiated by FAO/CP in July 1979 and, after basic data had been assmbled
by the Planning Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Development
(MAWD), preparation was completed by PAO/CP in August 1980. Appraisal war
carried out by the Bank in November 1980. The project was to be implemented
over a period of five years, 1982-83-1986/87, at an estimated cost of US$23.8
million. IDA var to finance US$18.0 million or 76Z of the total costs and
the borrower US$5.8 million or 24Z of the total costs.
1.6         The Government wanted the project to be extended for a further
period of three years. The suspension of Zambia's withdrawal rights since May
1987 precluded extension of the project period.
Prolect Obiectives and Descrittion
1.7         Proiect Obiectives:   The project aimed at IvTcreasing crop and
livestock production and raising farm incomes within the traditional
agricultural sector in the Southern Province. The project sought to achieve
these objectives mainly through reorganizing extension services along the T&V
system together with improving transport and field facilities, upgrading
veterinary services, constructing crop and inputs storage, and providing
credit to farmers. It also aimed at strengthening the planning and project
implementation capability of the Southern Province secretariat.
1.8         Project Description:  The project provided funds for:
a)      improving extension services through: technical
assistance to reorganize extension services along the
T&V system; recruitment of 48 incremental extension
staff; constructicn of two new agricultural stations,
48 agricultural extension camps, and 30 new staff
houses; renovation of 127 staff houses; procurement of
24 four-WD vehicles, 62 motorcycles, and 2 mobile vans
for home economics; and a training program for all
extension staff.
b)      upgrading veterinary services through:
construction/renovation of 80 crush pens and 50 cattle
dip tanks; procurement of supplies for
vaccination/immunization campaigns; and tsetse control
in the Gwembe Valley.



3
c)    constructing 36,000-ton capacity of storage facilities
for crops and inputs, and procuring handling
equipment;
d)    providing credit for inputs-in-kind, totalling US$2.7
million through the Southern Province Cooperative
Marketing Union (SPCMU) for its members; and
incremental seasonal credit, totalling US$375,000
through ZADB, for non-SPCHU members; and
e)    providing technical assistance for strengthening the
planning and project implementation capability of the
Provincial Planning Unit (PPU).
Proiect Desian and Oreanization
1.9         In view of its provincial focus, the project was designed as an
area-based operation. The selection of the project components Was
appropriate, given the constraints facing smallholders in the province. The
design, however, suffered from several flaws.   First, experience shows that,
to achieve sustainable results, a project of this nature needs a much longer
implementation period than the five years envisaged at appraisal. Second, no
provision was made for linkages between extension and research services, thus
weakening the effectiveness of the extension staff. Third, no account was
taken of credit funds available from other sources through SPCMU. As a
result, project's credit funds through SPCMU were never used since SPCMU was
able to meet credit demand among its members from funds made available by
national a.d bilateral sources at more favorable terms compared to the
project's credit funds. Fourth, no provisions were made for short-term
fellowship which proved necessary and had to be provided later in the project
period.
1.10        The project organizational arrangements placed tle overall
implementation responsibility under the office of the Provincial Permanent
Secretary (PPS). These arrangements were appropriate at the t'ma of
appraisal, given the Government policy to decentralize planning and project
implementation functions from the central agencies in Lusaka to the provincial
offices. However, the arrangements created implementation difficulties
arising from separation of responsibility and authority over project
activities. Whereas the provincial office was held responsible for project
implementation, project's operation staff remained answerable to their
respective headquarters in Lusaka. The project depended critically on
technical support from the headquarter of Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Development (MAWD). The fact that MAWD was not accountable for implementation
functions led to low interest on the part of MAWD in the project as
exemplified by the fact that MAWD never carried out the required monitoring
and evaluation work. However, it is also true that, with four ongoing
projects (para 1.4), MAWD was overwhelmed by new responsibilities which made
it difficult to direct enough attention to all of them.   Another
organizational feature that adversely affected project implementation is
that the project center, where all the agricultural staff were located, is
some 200 km from tne provincial office. Moreover, because of the multiple



4
duties of the PPS and the constantly changing of the office-holder (four
separate holders of the post during implementation), a management vacuum was
created. This vacuum was filled by technical assistance personnel vito, while
well qualified in their own professions, had little skills in management.
Proiect Implementation
1.11        General:  Implementation progress was very ^low throughout the
project period. At the closing date, only about 29% ot the IDA funds had been
disbursed. In addition to the design and organizational deficiencies
indicated in paras 1.9 and 1.10 above, several other problems generally
contributed to the poor implementation progress. Too frequent changes in key
local staff assigned to the project undermined appreciation of project
objectives. Difficulties in making provision for start-up local funds, with a
consequent inability to establish a project account, delayed project
effectiveness for seven months. Problems were encountered over the
appointment of key local staff and these problems were only alleviated through
technical assistance financed by FAO under a trust fund arrangement. Lack of
incentives for national project staff contributed to low staff morale and
motivation. Total actual project costs were about US$ 6.9 million compared to
appraisal estimate of US$ 23.8 million. The decline in actual costs was due
to the fact that, except for the technical assistance and storage components,
the project's physical inputs (including credit through SPCMU) fell far short
of t\9 appraisal targets. Also, devaluation of the kwacha reduced local costs
in terms of foreign exchange.
1.12        Extension:  Notable achievements were made in creating awareness
of the T&V system. However, implementation was considerably limited by
several factors. The country experienced a severe drought during the first
three years of the project. Budgetary allocations for the local counterpart
funds were always much less than the amounts needed to ensure proper vehicle
operation and maintenance and to cover the required field travel allowances.
Cumbersome and bureaucratic procurement procedures made it impossible to
provide extension staff with the required vehicles for the first three years.
Inability of the office of the Provincial Commissioner of Works (PCW) to
ensure proper selection and supervision of contractors contributed to slow
progress in the construction of staff houses, agricultural stations and camps
(Table 6, A). Contractors were often selected with little regard to their
capability to carry out the expected civil works. As noted above, lack of
effective linkages between extension and research services reduced the impact
of extension staff. A further contributing factor to the poor implementation
of the T&V system was a demoralizing rivalry between the PPU and the office of
the Provincial Agricultural Officer (PAO).
1.13        Livestock Development:  Formation of user committees and
introduction of user charges, which were conditions of disbursement for the
renovLtion/construction of dip tanks, were not fulfilled until the last year
of the project. This resulted in poor operation and maintenance of the
available dip tanks. Upgrading of veterinary stations and construction of dip
tanks were far below the appraisal targets (Table 6, A). Because of the above
factors, coupled with inadequate budgetary funds, the livestock component
suffered rrom cumulative deterioration of the physical dipping facilities and



5
lack of dipping chemicals. The project, therefore, was unable to help in
controlling outbreak of tick-borne diseases.
1.14         Storage Comnonent:  Construction of storage facilities was
satisfactorily carried out. One of the main reasons for the success in this
regard is that implementation of this component fell entirely under SPCMU and
was thus not hampered by the cumbersome process that apply for civil works
procured through the Provincial Tender Board. The other reason is that the
volume of work was large enough to attract large and well equipped contractors
based in Lusaka. However, utilization of the facilities was hampered
throughout the project period by lack of a clear delineation of marketing and
storage responsibilities between the National Agricultural Marketing Board
(NANBOARD) and SPCNU.
1.15        Credit ComDonent:   After a long delay due to institutional
problems associated with the merging of the Agricultural Finance Corporation
(AFC) and Zambia Agricultural Development Bank (ZADB), the credit funds of
about US$ 0.4 million channelled through ZADB were utilized. None of the
US$2.7 million earmarked for credit-in-kind through SPCMU was utilized as
other national and bilateral funds were available (para 1.9).
1.16        Prolect Administration.  A number of factors weakened project
administration and management. Some of the management difficulties arose from
the fact that project administration was located in Livingstone while project
actions and operation personnel were centered around Choma, some 200 km. A
project coordinator was not appointed until late in 1986. The Planning
Officer/Team Leader of the technical assistance team assumed project
management but, in line with his professional skills, concentrated his
attention on planning functions of the PPU and allowed unnecessary conflicts
to develop between the PPU and other provincial departments to the detriment
of the project. There was a serious lack of management skills and the style
of management involved mostly imposition of time consuming regulations which
were aimed at controlling project activities with little regard to development
objectives.
1.17        A project review carried out in 1985 recommended several
corrective measures which lead to the appointment of a Project Coordinator and
some restructuring of extension services. It also helped to initiate efforts
to establish linkages between extension and research services through creation
of an Adaptive Research and Planning Team (ARPT) from the MAWD's Department of
Agriculture. However, little progress was made in the implementation of the
recommendations as project funding virtually ceased in May 1987 when the Bank
suspended Zambia's withdrawal rights due to arrears on Bank loans and credits.
Proiect Results
1.18        Project's physical results were generally poor and far below
appraisal targets (Table 6, A). For the extension component, only the
technical assistance inputs came close to the appraisal targets. Civil works
were carried out for less than half of the originally envisaged staff houses
and none for agricultural camps. For the livestock component,
construction/renovation of crush pens was up to expectation and good progress



6
was made in tsetse control but less than half of the envisaged veterinary
stations and dip tanks were constructed. The progress made in animal health
through vaccination/immunization program was negated by outbreak of tick-
borne fever as a result of poor conditions of dipping facilities. The storage
component was implemented virtually up to appraisal targets. However, the
hard standing facilities were not well distributed nor sufficient for average
annual grain yields.
1.19        Institutional results fell short of appraisal expectations.  As
noted above, little progress was made in introducing the T&V system of
extension services. Also, the discipline implied by such a system was not
significantly institutionalized. User comittees for dip tanks were
established and user charges introduced toward the end of the project but
their effectiveness remains to be seen. With regard to storage facilities,
institutional problems between SPCMU and NAMBOARD continued to restrict
utilization of these facilities. Notable progress was made in strengthening
the planning capability of PPU but PPU still lacks adequate skills and clear
guidelines for project management and implementation.
1.20         Since the monitoring and evaluation requirements were not
implemented, there are no empirical data to assess project's results in terms
of rates of return and production impact. However, general observations
suggest that the rates of return are likely to be substantially below
appraisal estimate of a 27% economic rate of return. Increase in crop
production was expected to come mainly from expanded adoption of improved
technological packages as a result of better extension services, coupled with
credit to farmers, and reduced storage losses. For livestock, production
gains were expected to come from eradication of diseases. Because of the poor
performance of the extension and credit components, 'inder-utilization of the
storage facilities, and outbreak of tick-borne diseases, the impact of the
project on production is bound to be little relative to appraisal
expectations. Moreover, actual costs shifted considerable toward technical
assistance personnel, with such costs taking nearly 50% of IDA funds compared
to the appraisal figure of 10%. Given that the performance of the technical
assistance personnel was poor, this shift in actual costs means that a much
larger proportion of project resources was directed into less productive uses
than envisaged at appraisal.
Prolect Sustainabilitv
1.21        The project is not sustainable.  Extension services based on the
T&V system call for high levels of recurrent expenditures which Zambia will
find difficult to provide because of budgetary constraints. The Government is
making efforts to maintain project activities to the extent possible and has,
since project completion, obtained some assistance under UNDP/PAO project,
with a duration of 32 months, to strengthen technical support to the
agricultural extension service in the province. Although the recent
establishment of user committees and introduction of user charges will help to
improve operation and maintenance of dipping facilities, availability of
veterinarian drugs and dipping chemicals will continue to be limited by
foreign exchange constraint. Tsetse re-infestation is already happening in
some areas. The amount of credit fund provided by the project is likely to be



7
increasingly eroded by high inflation and low repayment rate. The storage
component involves relatively simple structures which are readily sustainable.
Achievements in strengthening the capability of PPU will be difficult to
sustain in view of the country-wide shortage of qualified manpower and
frequent transfer of civil servants.
Bank's Performance
1.22        Two important issues raised within the Bank at the Issues Meeting
and through the Decision Memorandum were not fully addressed in the final
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). One of these issues relates to the Borrower's
capacity to implement the project, considering the heavy workload imposed on
MAWD by several projects going on more or less at the same time (paza 1.4),
the weak project monitoring capability of the MAWD's Planning Unit, and
budgetary constraints. The other issue relates to the need to ensure adequate
adaptive research in the Province to support extension services. These issues
caused serious difficulties in project implementation.
1.23        The Bank fielded three supervision missions before effectiveness
and nine during the five-year implementation period. In total, 13 staff
members visited the project for a total of 31.5 staff weeks, under five
separate mission leaders. Lack of continuity in mission leadership and
composition contributed to poor rapport between visiting missions and the
project staff and led to frequent divergence of views between Bank missions
and especially the technical assistance team. The transfer of project
supervision responsibility from Washington to the Bank office in Nairobi in
1985 slowed implementation of the mid-term review.
Borrower's Performance
1.24        The Borrower failed to ensure coordination between the Ministries
of Agriculture and Water Development, Finance and Cooperatives and the
Provincial Authorities. This led to a delay in the establishment of the
project account and project effectiveness; it also generally contributed to
difficulties in project implementation. Although the Planning Unit of MAWD
performed well during the preparation phase, 't took no further part in
project activities during implementation.  The performance of the project was
also worsened by frequent transfer of counterpart staff and failure to provide
local staff to understudy the expatriate planning and financial officers.
Moreover, incomplete implementation of the borrower's decentralization policy
continued a situation in which project implementation responsibility was place
under the provincial office while authority on project's operation staff
remained with the central agencies in Lusaka.
1.25        The Borrower did not complied with some of the covenants stated in
the Development Credit Agreement (Part III, Table 7). Non-compliances which
significantly affected project results were failure to employ a research
officer by MAWD for project monitoring, provide adequate local counterpart
funds, and establish user committees and introduce user charges for dip tanks.
Annual plans of work and budget, quarterly action plans and reports were



8
carried out as required. Auditing requirements, although initially slow, were
also complied .4.th, including final clearance for the special foreign exchange
account in the Bank of Zambia at project completion. The borrower prepared a
comprehensive draft Project Completion Report (old guidelines) which was not
officially released. There was full cooperation with project, provincial and
central Government authorities in thu collection of data for this PCR.
Lessons Learnt
1.26        An important lesson is that, to be effective in a country like
Zambia, the conventional T&V system needs to be modified to reflect the widely
scattered households, budgetary constraints, transport difficulties, shortage
of qualified staff, and considerable uncertainty over input availability. The
system also needs to be complemented with effective links between extension
and research services, and a research ?rogram to develop area-specific
cultivars. Local cultivars of maize in the Southern Province, with drought
resistance, better storage, disease resistance, and low management inputs have
all but disappeared. This has led to dramatic yield fluctuations as a result
of too much dependence on hybrid cultivars, requiring high inputs and average,
or above average, rainfall, under the uncertain weather patterns in Southern
Zambia.
1.27        Other important lessons include the need to ensure that:  the
project design allows for a realistic implementation period, taking into
account the local capability in terms of manpower and budgetary resources;
project implementation responsibility is properly matched with authority over
project resources; and techlnical assistance personnel is properly selected and
placed preferably in an advisory capacity rather than in line positions.
Consultigg and Contracting Services
1.28        Technical assistance was expected to play a major role in project
implementation, planning, financial control, farm management and extersion
reorganization. A short-term component was also provided to SPCHU for
designing and supervising storage construction. The performance of the
technical assistance team was unsatisfactory. The team leader, with little
management skills, assumed project management responsibilities and
coordination functions in the absence of a   1 onal Project Coordinator.  Farm
management survey and reorganization of exte -on were poorly executed, mainly
due to incompetence and internal dissension within the technical assistance
team. Local contractors for civil work related to livestock and extension
components performed very poorly. On the other hand, the use of short-term
architectural consultancy enabled SPCMU to complete its construction program
in a timely manner.
Proiect Documentation and Data Collection
1.29        Project documentation was well done from identificacion stage to
the date of effectiveness. Supervision reports were also well prepared.
Little was done to collect baseline data in a systematic wa;. The required
project monitoring system was never implemented. Because of lack of baseline



9
data and non-implementation of the monitoring system, it has been difficult to
emperically assess the project's impact on production and farm incomes.
Part II:   PROJECT REVIEW F!OM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Introduction
2.1         This report represents a brief summary of a larger report which is
still under preparation by the Planning Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture on the Southern Province Agricultural Development Project (SPADP).
The summary is intended to comment and elaborate on Parts I and III which were
prepared by the World Bank. In so doing, it has avoided duplicating the Bank's
parts.
Background
2.2         The Government in its statements of development objectives has
consistently highlighted the priority to rural development and the importance
of increased agricultural production to achieve higher levels of self-
sufficiency in staple foods, the provision of raw materials for domestic agro-
processing industries, the exploitation of export potentials and a reduction
in urban-rural income disparities. As copper ores are expected to be
exhausted over the next 15-20 years, the need to diversify the economy away
from copper becomes even more crucial.
2.3         It is this growing recognition that agriculture had to replace
mining as a lead sector in the economy which led the Government of the
Republic of Zambia (GRZ) to seek donor assistance in its efforts to improve
agricultural policies, institutions and productivity. The Southern Province
has always played an important role in producing surplus maize and cattle. It
has produced on average some 30-45Z of the country's marketed maize and 40-
45% of marketed beef.  It is estimated that 65% of all families in the
province own cattle and that about 882 of these cattle are owned in the
traditional sector where they are also an important source of draught power.
Pro act Obiectives
2.4          The objectives which were aimed at increasing the low
productivity of the smallholder as well as increasing rural incomes were sound
and acceptable to GRZ but the inputs necessary to achieve these objectives
should have included credit for hammer mills and haulage trucks for farmers
and farmer organizations in the province to help in the decentralization of
these services. Hummer mills for maize milling was especially important for
rural food processing since there was the possibility of maize-meal subsidy
withdrawal - a policy reform which the Bank had advocated for years. Another
serious omission in the project objectives is the lack of provision for post-



10
graduate training of Zambians in management skills to run the project on the
departure of the international technical assistance team.
Proiect Desitn and Organization
2.5          The project design seemed to have adopted a "top-bottom"
approach. The beneficiaries of the project were not given the opportunity to
contribute project ideas to the design. This was probably an oversight of the
Ministry's Planning Division which collected and assembled basic data for the
project. Except for the omission of credit for hammer mills for local
processing of maize, training for Zambians in higher management skills (there
were some training initiated by the FAO Team Leader) and credit for crop
haulage, the selection of the project components and inputs were appropriate.
Another project design omission was the lack of provision for a systematic
link between extension and research services. The project should have put in
place an ARPT team to carry out province specific research to support the
extension program by developing province-specific technical messages and
packages. The terms of the project's credit funds were less favourable than
others available to members of the SPCMU. There should have been enough
flexibility in the project design to change such a situation. Since there was
no such flexibility, the amount of credit available to the SPCMU was never
utilized.
2.6          The project organization arrangements placed the implementation
responsibility under the Provincial Permanent Secretary (PPS). This was a
major error and adversQly affected project implementation. The PPS's office
has multiple duties and cannot be normally tied down to supervise a project of
this size. The PPU on which the PPS might have relied for the project's
implementation was ill-equipped to do so. It was completely under staffed and
lacked project management experience and skills. The PPU also had multiple
duties and ended up directing the project on part time basis instead of
managing it. The project preparation mission should have recognized the
peculiarity of Southern Province where Choma is the Provincial Agricultural
headquarters while Livingstone is the provincial administration headquarters.
To reduce this problem, all Technical Assistance (TA) personnel should have
been in Choma where the major components of the project centred. Splitting up
the team between Choma and Livingstone was ill-advised. There was never an
appreciation, by the office in Livingstone, of the field problems encountered
by the staff at Choma.
2.7         Another major weakness of the project was the fact that a capable,
highly qualified coordinator was not appointed from the beginning to run the
project. The TA personnel whose terms of reference as senior planning officer
was to help train and develop the PPU's project management, evaluation and
monitoring capacity, became a de facto coordinator of the project, approving
purchases and budgets. Project monitoring and evaluation was non existent
throughout the life of the project. The appointment of a project coordinator
late in 1986 came too late. The position was filled with a retired veteran
agriculturist who was good in his area but had no skills in managing a project
of this size. To make matters worse he was based in Choma but was stripped of
all powers with regards to financial decision making. He had virtually no
powers as a project coordinator.



11
2.8         The extension component which was to absorb 23Z of the total
project costs had no provision for adaptive research linkages. There should
have been an ARPT located in one of the research stations, probably in
Mochipapa to conduct research specific to the province and provide technical
packages for extension which are specific and economical. The exclusive
dependence on the TA Farm Management expert Was not enough to provide
effective linkages.
2.9          The credit needs of the province was not fully appreciated by the
project. The credit fund of $2.7 million available to SPCMU for inputs to
members was not utilized. Credit needs for hamner mills, haulage trucks etc,
were not recognized by the project.
Project Implementation
2.10         General implementation performance was poor.  The project failed
to achieve most of its targets. One of the major factors contributing to poor
implementation was the delay in procurement of vehicles. The project failed to
procure vehicles for the first three years as a result of the cumbersome and
bureaucratic purchasing procedures as well as possible special interests in
the type of vehicles. The type of landrovers which was acclaimed as the best
4x4 proved most disastrous when these vehicles finally arrived. They just
could not cope with the road conditions of the project area. There were no
spares with the purchase and procuring spares was another nightmare.
2.11         GRZ was unable to provide the necessary counterparts to
understudy the TA personnel. This was mainly due to the lack of incentives
for the national project staff. The performance of the international
technical assistance team was weak as a result of internal dissension and
petty quarrels. More attention should be paid in future to the selection of
technical assistance staff. Preference should be given to qualified Zambians
and other African nationals. The selection of the TA team did not show
sensitivity to inter-personnel relationship and team work.
2.12         Disbursement was also slow for both GRZ and World Bank funds.
This is a chronic problem mostly because of the cumbersome procedure.
2.13        Extension:  GRZ agrees with the Bank that notable efforts were
made to create awareness of extension services along the lines of the T & V
system. However, the delay in the procurement of vehicles, the lack of base-
line survey, and the constant implementation conflicts between the PPU and the
office of the PAO made it impossible for much to be achieved. There was no
appreciation of field problems by the PPU in Livingstone some 200 km. away.
The PPU undertook little supervision or monitoring of the project and ran the
project on a remote control basis.
2.14        Livestock Development:  The provincial officials were satisfied
with the assistance that was provided by the project before suspension. The
province remained relatively free of livestock diseases during the project
period except for seasonal occurrence of malignant theileriosis and an
outbreak of foot and mouth disease from June 1987 to December 1987. The



12
vaccination and inoculation program did help in preventing serious outbreak
of the endemic diseases.
Proiect Results
2.15         Project results are difficult to estimate.  That the project
failed to achieve most of its targets is without debate. Only $6.9 million
out of the total projected expenditure of $23.8 million was utilized. This
will indicate minimal project results. Although there are no empirical data
to assess the benefits derived by farmers in the project area, it is difficult
to say there were substantial impacts on productivity and incomes during the
project life time. The severe drought during the first three years of the
project compounded this difficulty.
2.16         There was some awareness of the T & V system of extension but the
late delivery of transport, lack of staff incentive, complex procedures for
recovery of allowance and lack of province specific technical packages made
that awareness unproductive. For the livestock component, considerable
success was achieved with disease control. Input and crop storage was
constructed although they were not well distributed nor sufficient for average
or above average annual grain yields. The PPU capacity of the provincial
administration was improved but it still lacks project managemint skills and
is understaffed.
Proiect Sustainabilitv
2.17         As implemented, the project is not sustainable.  The major
components of the project which were to build the necessary infrastructure for
sustained development were not achieved. Training of Zambian manpower was
weak under the project and makes continued project implementation difficult
without more technical assistance input. GRZ continues to fund the project
and some of the construction work is being completed. Fund flows are however
slow and erratic. The lack of an ARPT for the project continues to weaken the
extension base.
Bank's Performance
2.18         The SAR was weak in the project design and organization.  The
splitting up of the TA team in Choma and Livingstone, the planning of
implementation responsibility on the PPS and the absence of a highly capable
project coordinator show lack of understanding of the Zambian situation. The
lack of provision for project monitoring and evaluation, training of Zambians
and an ARPT was short sighted.
2.19         The Bank fielded three supervision missions before effectiveness
and nine during the five-year implementation period under five separate
mission leaders. The missions gave the impression of lack of continuity and
appreciation of previous visits. There were a great deal of contradictory
guidelines to project staff from one mission to another. Each mission
formulated new conditionalities for project implementation and contributed to
the slow disbursement of funds for the project's main components. The
missions never clearly addressed the question of why the project's



13
implementation was so slow.
Borrower's Performance
2.20         GRZ is in agreement with the Bank that a major weakness of GRZ's
performance was the complete lack of coordination between the central
Ministries, Agriculture, Finance and Cooperatives and the Provincial
Authorities. There was a complete aloofness from the Ministry of
Agriculture's Planning Division. The project desk officer did not have
authority on project matters. The Ministry failed to provide the necessary
counterparts to work with the TA personnel. There was a constant shortage of
local funding throughout implementation and this adversely affpacted project
performance. Government procurement procedures were and still are too
cumbersome and bureaucratic.
Lessons Learnt
2.21         GRZ's beneficiary ministries should be involved fully in project
preparation and appraisal in order to ensure better understanding and
appreciation of the project's implementation. This process is gradually being
adopted by the Planning Division which now attaches full time counterparts to
consultants and multilateral, bilateral experts on project preparation, and
appraisal.
2.22         The selection of projects staff should begin with placing
qualified national staff to line positions. Such staff should be supported
with internationally recruited advisers where necessary, giving first
preference to candidates from African countries to the extent possible.
Statistical Information
2.23         The statistical information provided in part III of the Bank's
completion report are in close agreement with GRZ's own estimates.
Conclusion
2.24         If GRZ's withdrawal rights are restored, a second phase of SPADP
should be prepared to take into account all the constraints enumerated in this
report. Southern Province is an important agricultural area which needs a
strengthened infrastructure and institutional development for sustained
agricultural development and a second "corrective" SPADP should contribute to
that.

Comment:    Some of the technical assistance staff were extended up to June
1988 to help wind-up project accounts and prepare Completion
Report. The Government requested a 3-year extension but this
could not be done because of the suspension of Zambia's withdrawal
rights in May 1987.

Comment:  The low disbursement of IDA funds is mainly due to the slow project
implementation progress.  Devaluation of the kwacha is also a
contributing factor as it reduced local costs in terms of foreign
exchange.

Comments:    Most of the civil work were uncompleted by the time the project
ended. The main causes of the poor performance were weak
management, cumbersome procurement procedures, and weak
capability of local constructors.

Comments:    Actual costs are based on figures obtained from project files in
the field.  Total actual project costs are less than estimated
cost due to the fact that, except the technical assistance and
storage components, the project's physical inputs (including
credit through SPCMU) fell far short of the appraisal targets.
Also, devaluation of the kwacha reduced local costs in terms of
foreign exchange.

Comments:    Out of 10 local contractors employed for house building, 6
abandoned their construction sites, 1 partially completed, and 3
completed their work. Contributory factors were poor
supervision and lack of transport. A breakdown of the actually
procured vehicles and equipment is not available.
