At full development, the\n            project would lead to increased production of maize, cotton,\n            groundnuts, sunflower seed, soybeans and beef. The\n            realization of expected benefits would depend on the\n            effectiveness of the implementing agencies and the pace at\n            which farmers adopt improved husbandry practices."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
