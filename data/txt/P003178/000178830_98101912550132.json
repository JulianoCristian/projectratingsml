increasing\n            crop and livestock production and raising farm income levels\n            by increasing the use of modern inputs by smallholders and\n            improving marketing

It provides for credit to\n            smallholders, improvement of input and storage and extension\n            services, including veterinary services and tsetse control,\n            and technical assistance for strengthening SPCMU's\n            credit administration capability. At full development, the\n            project would lead to increased production of maize, cotton,\n            groundnuts, sunflower seed, soybeans and beef. The\n            realization of expected benefits would depend on the\n            effectiveness of the implementing agencies and the pace at\n            which farmers adopt improved husbandry practices."}, "docdt": "1981-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
