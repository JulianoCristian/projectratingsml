1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
At appraisal, the State of Bahia had good economic performance, in spite of Brazil’s
difficulties. These difficulties were related to Brazil’s development of a series of far-
reaching economic reforms, that aimed at bringing inflation down and encompassed trade
liberalization, deregulation, privatization, and the promotion of foreign investment. In
this context, the State’s GDP nonetheless increased by over 3% p.a. during 1994-2003,
while the national GDP increased at an average 2.2% p.a. Bahia became the sixth largest
State economy in Brazil with about 5 % of Brazil’s GDP. More importantly, the State
made substantial progress toward diversifying its previously commodity-based economy.
The State’s fiscal performance had been sound and stable over the 2000-2005 period.
From a balanced situation in 2000, the State had achieved robust positive primary
balances over the previous 5 years, reaching up to 11% of net current revenues in 2004.
The good performance of revenues, combined with favorable dynamics of exchange rate
and prices, resulted in the acceleration of the decreasing trend of indebtedness. As a
result, Bahia complied with all the fiscal limits established by the Fiscal Responsibility
Law, since its enactment in 2000 and with all the Fiscal Adjustment Program targets
agreed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) for 2000-2004.
From economic and social standpoints, Bahia improved faster than the national average,
but the State remained below economic and social national levels averages. A large
proportion of the population still dependent on low-productivity activities, mainly
traditional farming and cattle raising, resulted in a State a GDP per capita well below
Brazil’s average (about R$4,600 vs. R$7,630 in 2003). 1 Likewise, although the
Municipal Human Development Index (IDH-M) for the State had increased from 0.60 in
1991 to 0.69 in 2000, more rapidly than the national index, Bahia still ranked twentieth in
Brazil.
The continuity of the State’s administration, stimulated by the implementation of multi-
annual plans by the federal government, allowed Bahia to build a solid planning
management framework. In 2003, the State government presented a long term strategic
plan (Bahia 2020) identifying the main priorities for action regarding economic and
social issues. The State prepared two medium-term Multi Annual Plans (PPA)2, for the
2000-2003 and 2004-2007 periods; the latter included important first expected to lead
towards the Bahia 2020 objectives: (a) inclusive social justice; (b) diversified and
competitive economy; (c) clean and sustainable environment; and (d) spatial integration,
with adequate local and regional infrastructure and transport services.

At appraisal, federal, State and municipal road networks were in poor condition,
jeopardizing growth and competitiveness. At appraisal, the total road network in Bahia
was about 120,000 km, out of which approximately 13,800 km (11.4%) were paved; the
paved State highway network was about 9,400 km. In 2006, only half the traffic,
measured in vehicle-km, was circulating on highway in good conditions. This situation
was compounded by a steep truck traffic growth, resulting from the economic recovery,
putting ageing pavements under increased stress. Moreover, in many federal trunk
highways, a substantial proportion of traffic, including heavy trucks, had deviated onto
alternative State routes, which had not been designed for such heavy traffic. Overall,
deteriorating road conditions, railway bottlenecks and lack of adequate rural access to
markets adversely impacted the agro-businesses and petrochemical industries.
Drastic reduction of the funds allocated to roads over the previous ten to fifteen years, as
a result of the fiscal adjustment policies, led to a substantial deterioration of the networks.
Investments in the road sector, all financed through the general Bahia State budget,
decreased (in current terms) from US$172 million in 1993 to an average of US$50
million over the 2002-2005 period. Rehabilitation needs of the State road network largely
exceeded the expected availability of funds over the medium-term. As such, the State’s
road network management strategy focused on improving transport conditions on the
State’s main transport corridors and on their feeders, instead of following a more
traditional, network-wide strategy.
In spite of the general weakening of roads’ institutions in Brazil at the time of the
appraisal, the State had a well-run road administration (Departamento de Infraestrutura
de Transportes da Bahia – DERBA). DERBA’s management capacity had significantly
improved with the 2002 reorganization of the road administration approved in 2002, the
set-up of a State-of-the-art information system, of the basis for an integrated road
planning system, further staff contracting, and the implementation of a long-term, entity-
wide training program. Yet, the road administration was still facing some challenges,
including an imbalance between the profiles of the present staff and the staff profiles
required to fully fulfill the administration’s management duties, the consolidation of its
planning system, the lack of investments’ monitoring and evaluation system, and weak
supervision and quality assurance capacity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective was “to increase the effective use of the State road
infrastructure, with an aim at stimulating higher economic growth”.
Project Development Objective indicators were: (i) Percentage of reduction in average
land transport freight rates on selected itineraries; and (ii) Percentage of increase in use of
road transport infrastructure on selected itineraries.
Intermediate results indicators included: (i) Percentage of State paved network extension
under result-based contracts; (ii) Percentage of network traffic traveling on paved roads
in good conditions; (iii) Integrated road planning and management system operational;
(iv) number of regional offices (residências) operating DERBA’s information systems
on-line; (v) State multimodal strategy defined; (vi) Data warehouse system for
                                              2
PELTBAHIA operational; (vii) Plan under implementation to optimize logistics impacts
on the development of RMS; (viii) Geo-referenced social and economic database in
operation; and (ix) AGERBA’s normative body, and analysis/supervision capacity
consolidated.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project Development Objective was not revised.
Yet, the first Project restructuring introduced a third PDO indicator: “percentage decrease
of average unit vehicle operating costs on selected itineraries (cumulative)”. The rationale
for introducing this new PDO indicator was to tighten up the result chain between the
Project activities (primarily: road rehabilitation) and its intended results. The baseline
data had been collected in 2006 to carry out the Project economic analysis.
Besides, the intermediate result indicator “Percentage increase of State paved network
extension under result-based contracts (cumulative)” was rephrased as “Cumulative
number of kilometers of roads rehabilitated under result-based contracts”. Both versions
of the indicator basically measure the same result, but the latter wording is closer to one
of the Bank’s Core Indicators for roads and highways.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
Multiple stakeholders were expected to benefit from the Project. More specifically, road
users and road transport services would directly benefit from the improvement of key
highways, with decreased transport costs. It is estimated that the Project yearly benefitted
about 14.8 3 million travelers in 7.4 million trips.
Moreover, the Project targeted remote and poor populations, seeking to improve their
accessibility to markets, job opportunities and social services, by interventions on the
municipal road network to enable year round transit. The close to 1,200 km of
rehabilitated highways provide enhanced access to about one million poor population4.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: rehabilitation of State paved road (US$166 million)
The component supported the introduction and execution of long-term, performance-
based road maintenance and rehabilitation contracts5, on about 2,000 km of the State



3
    Based on 2012 Average Annual Daily Traffics on the Project’s sections and 2 people / vehicle on average.

4
  Poor population from the municipalities where Project’s sections are located. People receiving conditional cash
transfers were considered “poor” for the needs of this assessment. The Bahia Socio Economic Development for
Inclusive Growth DPL (P126351) Project Appraisal Document States that 60% of the State’s population receives
conditional cash transfers from the Government.

5
 Road rehabilitation and maintenance performance-based contracts main features are: (i) lump sum / global prices
contracts, instead of traditional input-based contracts, implying an important transfer of responsibility in the design and

                                                            3
paved road network (or 15% of the State highway network length).Works would include:
(a) initial highway rehabilitation (pavement, drainage, horizontal / vertical signaling,
equipment for road safety); and (b) highway routine maintenance over five years.
 All State road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project would meet the following
criteria: (a) be part of the road sections identified for maintenance and/or rehabilitation in
the PELTBAHIA 2004 or updated version thereof; or (b) be part of road corridors
connecting strategic cities or connecting the economically dynamic regions of the State
between themselves or to markets or ports for exports/imports from other States or
countries. In addition, investments needed a minimum internal rate of return of 20%.
During Project preparation, road sections totaling about 1,200 km for a Project first phase
had been identified as meeting the above criteria, the remainder expected to be identified
afterwards.

Component 2: institutional strengthening (US$20 million)
The component supported five sets of activities:
(a) Government efforts in optimizing the role of transport services to help deconcentrate
economic growth and provision of basic services, through determination of existing
logistics bottlenecks and level/localization of repressed economic growth due to
inadequate transport costs, integration of transport dimension in planning for education


execution of the rehabilitation works to the contractor; (ii) a remuneration based on the contractor’s performance to
achieve predetermined level of service (instead of ad-measurement payments); and (iii) bundling road rehabilitation
and subsequent routine maintenance in a longer-term contract.


                                                         4
and health interventions, identification of public actions required to improve logistics’
efficiency in the State, and definition of incentives to private sector to invest in logistics;
(b) The consolidation and gradual implementation of the State’s logistics program
(PELTBAHIA), especially with respect to the monitoring of the program’s impact in
logistics’ performance, strengthening of the State’s regulatory framework, and capacity to
model public-private partnerships;
(c) The strengthening of the State road administration, with respect to the consolidation
of its planning system (to allow for prioritization of interventions at the network level
taking into account fiscal constraints, and for systematic road/bridge condition and traffic
data collection), capacity improvements with respect to environmental/social impacts
mitigation and works supervision, and modernization of information systems;
(d) Improvements in the road administration’s technical capacity, to support
municipalities in maintaining their road networks and in improving transport services to
the poor; and
(e) The preparation of works’ engineering designs and supervision, as well as support to
the road administration in coordinating the Project’s implementation.

1.6 Revised Components
The original components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

This Project went through two restructurings, the first in 2010 for the increase in the
financing percentage and the introduction of a new outcome indicator and the second in

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
The Project was fully in line with the Brazil – World Bank Country Assistance
Strategy6 (CAS). It supported the CAS pillars by guaranteeing that the Project would: (i)
emphasize in the necessity for the Bank to consider economic growth as an equal priority
with social equity and fiscal balance; (ii) factor in that, without faster and sustained
growth, supporting the two former objectives would be increasingly difficult; and (iii)
recommend developing a more integrated Bank assistance to selected States.
The Project was consistent with the State’s long-term development strategy and
priorities, as established in Bahia 2020: O Futuro Agente Faz (Bahia 2020 – The Future

    CPS 2004-2007, discussed by the Bank’s Board of Directors on December 9th, 2003.
                                                     5
We Do). This lending operation was a key component of the Bahia 2020 long-term
development strategy and the 2004-2007 medium-term plan (Plano Pluri-Annual – PPA),
which sought the reduction of travel times and costs, so as to foster greater integration
and therefore contributing to a better balanced development.
This Project was the first performance-based road rehabilitation and maintenance
Project in the Northeast region and factored in lessons learned from previous
similar projects. In particular, the Bank-financed the Rio Grande do Sul State Highway
Management Project (P034578) and the Federal Highway Decentralization and
Rehabilitation Project (P092990), which were instrumental in the Project design: these
Projects developed the CREMA (Contrato de Reabilitação e Manutenção) concept,
whereby a construction company enters into a medium-term (five years in the Bahia case)
contract with the road agency in order to rehabilitate and maintain part of the network.
Besides, and critically important, part of the contractor’s remuneration depends on
quality standards to be reached (performance-based) and not on inputs. The State of
Bahia had been closely following these results and became interested in implementing
this performance-based contract model with the Bank’s support.
The CREMA model developed in other Brazil States was adapted to the Bahia
context. Improvements were incorporated to the CREMA approach through: (i)
modifying DERBA’s technical norms; (ii) the preparation of a standard bidding
document for performance-based contracts, factoring in the experience of earlier pilot
contracts, and (iii) the inclusion of specific support under the Project’s institutional
strengthening component, to ensure appropriate streamlining of performance-based
contract management within DERBA’s operational processes. In order to suit the State’s
particular needs, the contracts’ main characteristic included a functional recuperation of
the pavements during the first year and routine maintenance during the following four
years. Payments were based on ad-measurement, with globalized prices, for rehabilitation,
and on performance, monitored on the basis of a simplified set of indicators, for
maintenance.
Project “technical” preparation was quick and did not suffer from the 2006 general
elections in Brazil and the change of administration. Year 2006 was an election year
in Brazil (President, Governors, Congress and State Assemblies), and the new
administration in Bahia took power on January 1st, 2007. Preparation was quick, as it
required only seven months between the first identification mission (June 2005) and the
issuance of the invitation to negotiate (January 2006). Although the loan was fully
prepared and negotiated with the outgoing administration, the new administration bought-
in without hesitancy.
At Appraisal, risk and mitigation measures during implementation were adequately
assessed but a possible delay in the loan effectiveness, which actually occurred,
should have been explicitly included among the risks. The delay in loan effectiveness
(and, therefore, the delay in preparing the engineering designs) explain part of the
construction cost increase which prevented the 2,000 km to be fully met. State fiscal
stability issues, envisioned in the Project Appraisal Document risk matrix, actually
materialized, stemming from the 2008 global crisis. Yet, Government’s commitment to
maintain fiscal stability was indeed mitigated by the Bank’s agreement to monitor the

                                            6
State’s fiscal situation during Project implementation. In case of deterioration, the Bank
would propose measures to minimize the Project’s implementation fiscal impact, leading
to the first Project restructuring.

2.2 Implementation


After swift preparation, delays were substantial before effectiveness but, eventually,
did not affect the Project outcomes. The Board approved the Project on November 14,
2006, during a national elections period that resulted in a transition of administration; the
new administration took office on January 1st, 2007. The Senate could only approve the
loan signature on August 7, 2007, as the electoral law did not allow for any contract to be
signed neither three months prior to, nor three months after the elections. The issue was
compounded by bottlenecks in PGFN, with few lawyers available at that time to review
the draft legal agreement. Signing occurred on September 10, 2007. Loan effectiveness
then suffered from delays as the loan needed to be ratified by the new Congress, which
had stopped working for about eight months, due to political unconformities. The loan
finally became effective on December 6, 2007, about a year after the Board had approved
it.
While the new Bahia administration fully supported the Project, capacity in the
implementing agency was significantly lower, compounding delay issues. The new
State of Bahia Government was committed to the Project as prepared under the previous
Administration; only minor adjustments, which did not change the Project objectives,
were agreed. Yet, this transition involved internal changes in SEINFRA and DERBA at
both management and technical levels; the new personnel did not count, initially, with the
adequate experience to deal with Projects of this kind. To address this issue, the newly
elected Government of Bahia required to scale-up the institutional strengthening
component, aiming at speeding up Project implementation. This resulted in the creation
of a specific project implementation unit with the road agency, which indeed proved to be
a key element in project implementation.
In particular, the Government of Bahia’s decision to wait for the loan to be effective
before bidding the engineering designs significantly increased the delays and costs of
the works. Unfamiliarity with Bank international financing, the Government of Bahia
decided to wait for the loan to become effective before bidding the works engineering
designs. This decision increased by a year the Project initial delay. Engineering designs
started in May 2008; once contracted, delays issues were again compounded by the poor
quality of the designs, inducing back and forth exchanges between DERBA’s Project
Coordination Unit and the consulting firms. As a result, works contracts were awarded
only between March and November 2009. In sum, approximately four years elapsed
between the initial road assessments (end of 2004), on which the initial road works cost
estimates were based, and the actual works contracting. Road conditions had meanwhile
substantially deteriorated, and final engineering designs required adjustments to those
prepared at a conceptual level four years earlier in the Project Appraisal Document.
Rehabilitation costs consequently increased, compounded by four years of inflation.
Inflation has been particularly high in this time period for asphalt products. Heavier


                                             7
pavement rehabilitation solutions and construction cost / material inflation increased the
works cost by an estimated US$40.7 million.
The decreasing US Dollar vs. Brazilian Real further widened the Project financing
gap. While the PAD exchange rate is 2.16 R$ / 1 US$, the average exchange rate over
Project implementation was about 1.76 R$ / 1 US$; it is estimated that this unfavorable
foreign exchange rate caused an estimated financial gap of US$33.7 million.
In sum, the works costs increased by about US$77 million, jeopardizing the
execution of the Project’s second phase (800 km). The table below recaps the Project
costs increase.


                                                             Works cost increase (actual vs. PAD) , US$ million

                            Table 2: PREMAR’s Works Cost Increase Estimates


In parallel, the 2008 global crisis resulted, in Bahia, in a severe fiscal crisis, which
jeopardized the 50% counterpart financing required for the Works component. In
2008 and 2009, the State of Bahia fiscal revenues were respectively cut by 40% and 13%,
adversely impacting the implementation of most Bahia’s programs. Infrastructure
programs, among which PREMAR, were more affected than others, as the State gave
priority to addressing social issues first. In 2011, the federal government’s decision to
eliminate the regular fuel federal tax proceeds8 transfer to the State further compounded
the financing of the infrastructure sector at State level.
As a consequence, the Project was restructured in September 2010. The main feature
of this restructuring was to address the counterpart funding issue: the percentage of works
expenditures to be financed out of the loan proceeds was increased from 50% to 90%.
This restructuring did not include any additional financing to bridge financing gap
stemming from the works cost increase and unfavorable foreign exchange rate: in April
2010, the State of Bahia informed the Bank that the US$ 80 million additional financing,
which was discussed during the October 2009 midterm review, was no longer being
sought. The second phase of PREMAR (800 km) was de facto dropped.

Overall, the Project Monitoring and Evaluation framework was adequately designed,
considering the rather wide scope of the PDO: the increased effectiveness of the State
road infrastructure could be monitored through decreasing freight rates, increased road
usage, and decreasing vehicle operating costs. Yet, other factors than road rehabilitation
(e.g.: economic situation, level of competition of the trucking industry on these segments)
could also affect them substantially. With hindsight, two other aspects of the monitoring
and evaluation framework could have been considered for enhancing it: (i) no Project
Development Objective indicator captured the 11 intermediate outcome indicators
focusing on institutional strengthening; and (ii) there were probably too many
intermediate outcome indicators devoted to institutional strengthening.
Implementation. The Result and Monitoring Framework was substantially implemented
as planned. The Project outcome indicators proved to be precise and measurable. Project
outcome indicator #1 required specific survey and study, in order to compute the ex-post
rates freight rates on PREMAR’s sections and reconstitute part of the missing baseline
data for this indicator.
During implementation, the Project Coordination Unit submitted biannual monitoring
reports, in a timely and satisfactorily manner. These reports included: (i) a description of
the overall Project progress; (ii) data on disbursement performance over the previous 6
months and an updated disbursement calendar; (iii) an update on the procurement
activities and an adjusted procurement plan; (iv) a description of the social and
environmental safeguards’ implementation progress; (v) a description of potential
developments that could affect implementation; and (vi) the measurement of Project
performance through the impact indicators included in the Results Framework.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards. Project preparation and implementation were compliant with the Project
safeguards instruments prepared for the Project in application of the Bank Operational
Guidelines. The Road Agency prepared the following instruments, found acceptable to
the Bank: (i) Indigenous People Plan; (ii) Resettlement Framework; and (iii) Guidelines
for the Program’s Environmental Evaluation. At appraisal, the Project was rated Category
B: low or temporary environmental / social adverse impacts were expected, as often with
highway rehabilitation and maintenance projects with interventions within the existing
right-of-way. Indeed, during implementation, no critical safeguards issue has been raised.
The Bank environmental / social specialists carried out supervision missions once a year;
during all Project implementation, DERBA’s environment unit quarterly visited the
PREMAR sections, even after the rehabilitation works were over. No land acquisition or
resettlement stemming from the Project activities was required; the only environmental
issues were related to worksites clean-up, and had been overall addressed by Project
closing.

Financial Management. Financial management was carried out in accordance with the
arrangements agreed upon in the legal agreement and the operational manual. The Project
had an acceptable financial system in place on the onset of Project implementation,
strongly relying on the Road Agency systems. Specific financial management missions
were carried out once or twice a year during implementation; no critical issue has been

                                             9
raised. Annual Audited Financial Statements, issued by the Bahia State Court of Account
(Tribunal de Contas do Estado), were submitted to the Bank in timely manner, and did
not raise major issues either. For the most part, ISR ratings were deemed as
“Satisfactory”, except during the period covered between January and May 2010
(“Moderately Satisfactory”); this Moderately Satisfactory rating resulted from
counterpart financing issues, later addressed in 2010 by modifying the Bank / State pari –
passu financing for works.

Procurement. The Project financed six works contracts (ICBs), eight goods contracts
(including four ICBs) and 41 consultancy contracts, out of which 17 were for individual
consultants. Almost all consulting services were contracted through the Quality and Cost
Based Selection procedure. All procurement processes have been prior-reviewed, to
better control the adequacy of procurement processes. Until October 2009, procurement
supervision was embedded in the standard supervision missions, as the Project TTL was a
Procurement-Accredited Staff. Afterwards, with a change to TTL, a Procurement
Specialist based in Brasilia was designated; procurement missions were then carried out
once a year.

The procurement of goods, works, and services was carried out satisfactorily in
accordance with Bank Procurement Policy. During Project implementation, procurement
was rated “Satisfactory” and “Moderately Satisfactory” after January 2012. This overall
rating was confirmed by a procurement audit (conducted in March 2013). The
“Moderately Satisfactory” rating resulted from long delays in contracting consultancies
for the Institutional strengthening component: the average procurement process duration
for Quality and Cost Based Selections was 2 years and 4 months (between preparation of
the requests for proposals and contract signing). Reasons include: (i) initial
misunderstanding from DERBA’s procurement office, imposing that bidding processes
were also subject to the State of Bahia’s procurement rules, and, therefore, triggering
additional administrative burden and delays; (ii) delays between the Project Coordination
Unit and other State entities beneficiaries; (iii) overall poor initial quality of procurement
documents, requiring thus back and forth between the Project Coordination Unit and the
Bank; and (iv) difficulty to come up with short-lists of two consultancies maximum per
country.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Road maintenance performance-based contracts will be still on-going about a year after
the loan closing date; the road agency even plans to extend them by another year, fully
financed by the Government of Bahia’s own resources and making the most of the
routine maintenance carried out by private entrepreneurs. In sum, the Project contributed
to put in place a strengthened road asset management system through, (i) better planning
(Pavement Management System) and, (ii) more cost-effective road management contracts
(CREMA contracts).

On April 16th 2013, the Governor of the State of Bahia declared his intention to seek a
new loan from the Bank, in support of the transport sector. This new operation
(PREMAR 2) would be a continuation of PREMAR, consolidating and scaling it up
                                             10
through a US$200 million loan, contributing to a US$300 million Project. Continuing and
improving, based on lessons learned, the performance-based road rehabilitation and
maintenance model, PREMAR 2 would also contribute the Project outcome
sustainability: highway performance-based maintenance requires a change of mindsets,
both from public (road agency) and private (contractors) partners, which only can take
place on a longer term, with mutual and well-understood benefits. In September 2013, the
Brazil federal government secretariat for external affairs’ technical committee had
reviewed the loan proposal. The federal Commission for external financings (COFIEX)
was expected to examine this proposal in a near future. See also Section 4, Assessment of
Risk to Development Outcome.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objective of increasing the effective use of the State road infrastructure, with an aim
at stimulating higher economic growth, was and continues to be highly relevant, in a
State that is over-dependent on the highway network for the transport of goods and
passengers and is still facing high levels of traffic growth. This objective was to be
achieved through (a) rehabilitation and maintenance of key sections of the State paved
network and (b) support a set of key institutional improvements in the road sector to
ensure the sustainability of physical achievements. Today, this objective is still fully
aligned with the Brazil – World Bank Country Partnership Strategy 9 (equity,
sustainability and competitiveness pillars) as well as with the State of Bahia priorities, as
outlined in the Bahia Multi-Year Plan (PPA)10.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 2)
Linking, through the PDO, Project activities (basically the rehabilitation 12% of the State
highway network) to the “higher objectives” of stimulating growth, was probably
ambitious; the Project certainly contributed but a quantitative causal link is difficult to
establish. Yet, as the PDO had this “aim at stimulating higher economic growth”, let’s
first examine what was the State’s economic growth during Project implementation.
Between 2006 and 2012, despite the 2008 fiscal crisis, Bahia’s economic growth has
been substantial, with about a 27 point increase of the State’s GDP per capita 11 . In
parallel, inequalities have been reduced, the State’s Gini index related to households
income decreasing from 0.556 in 2006 to 0.554 in 201112. As detailed in Section 1.1,
these results are better that the Brazil average. The causal linkage between the Project

activities, and their good results, and the State’s economic growth is not direct; yet,
several studies13have shown the close correlation between freight transport demand and
economic growth. On this basis, as the estimated growth of cargo transport on the
PREMAR sections has been about 20% between 2006 and 2012, the Project activities are
deemed to have, at least, accompanied the State economic growth.
Road rehabilitation and maintenance works
More specifically, the three Project outcome indicators were met and show that, in
Project sections, both freight rates and road users operating costs have decreased, and the
use of road transport infrastructure has increased. A specific ex-post survey carried out by
a transport and logistics company, using the PREMAR rehabilitated sections, concluded
that the freight rates decreased by 10.8%, for a series of products, between 2005 and 2012.
While a number of factors determine freight rates (including diesel cost, labor cost, level
of competition, truck depreciation, etc.), it is deemed that roadway rehabilitation
influenced this trend. Actually, the third PDO indicator estimated that road users’ costs
had decreased by about 12.5%, as a result of better road conditions. Finally, and this may
be the most compelling result, highlighting the strength of Bahia’s economic growth in
this period, road traffic volumes have increased by 66% between 2005 and 2012, when
only a mere 12% increase was expected.
The loan financed the rehabilitation and maintenance of 1,196 km of the State
highway network: without the Project, about 12% of the key State highway network
would not have been rehabilitated. This counterfactual scenario is described in details
in Annex 3: highways undergoing only from routine maintenance, as well as
reconstruction when required by an advanced stage of deterioration. This scenario would
have entailed higher economic costs for the society, both in terms of capital investment
costs for the Road agency (reconstruction is more expensive than rehabilitation) but also
for road users and final clients, stemming from higher vehicle operating costs, on
highways in poor conditions.
Even beyond PREMAR’s sections, fully rehabilitated, the overall condition of the
State paved highway network has substantially improved, as shown in the Chart
below. In 2012, about 85% of the State paved highways were in good conditions 14 ,
compared to a mere 71.5% in 2007.

   Chart 1: Evolution of the Highway Network Conditions – State Paved Roads (Source: DERBA)


The key achievement is that Bahia, over 2008 – 2013, rehabilitated a total of about 3,700
km, about a third of the state paved network; rejuvenating a third of the network in 6
years this is a considerable result. The loan contributed to finance the rehabilitation (and
maintenance) of 1,196 km of the State highway network, while the State financed the
rehabilitation of an additional 2,513 km of paved highways.
Rehabilitation works quality and subsequent routine maintenance has been overall
satisfactory. Despite some initial or punctual issues, PREMAR’s sections rehabilitation
was adequately carried out, leading in good results in terms of comfort and transport
condition, meeting standards and triggering payments. The second intermediate outcome
indicator surveyed that 83% of the traffic circulates on State highways in good conditions.
At contract level, few rehabilitation solutions were changed, highlighting the good
quality of the engineering designs. Works execution has been overall timely.
Performance-based road rehabilitation and maintenance appear to have been more
cost-effective than traditional rehabilitation contracts. Rehabilitation of the PREMAR
sections averaged BRL280,000 per km and routine maintenance about BRL6,000 per km
and per year. Excluding the PREMAR program, highway rehabilitation cost over the
same period averaged BRL405,000 per km. Acknowledging that these averages can
cover very different initial road condition and traffics, the gap between traditional
rehabilitation and performance-based rehabilitation costs remains substantial. A life cycle
cost analysis would be required to fully capture, on the medium term, the benefits of



                                               13
bundling rehabilitation and maintenance within performance-based contracts15. Contract
management has also been improved: the five CREMA contracts covering the PREMAR
network have had cost overruns less than 5% of the initial contract amounts, while it is
not unusual that traditional road rehabilitation contracts reach a 25% cost overruns16 .
Finally, rehabilitation quality has been overall good, reaching the contractual quality
standards: (i) about 95% of rehabilitated sections met the contractual quality standards for
pavement roughness; and (ii) during the maintenance phase, payment penalties of only a
few percent have been applied to contractors for some criteria not being met, highlighting
the globally satisfactory implementation of routine maintenance.



Bahia is the first State of Brazil’s Northeast region to have executed large-scale
CREMA Projects. The implementation of this innovative results-based modality of
contracts had transformational implications on the State’s road rehabilitation and
maintenance culture, both in the public and private sectors, at the technical and decision-
making levels. This culture change was achieved through the provision of plenty of
training and supervision during Project preparation and implementation. This resulted in
a successful experience to be replicated in other States and countries. As a matter of fact,
this innovative performance-based approach has triggered knowledge transfer and south-
south collaboration: delegations from Vietnam and Cabo Verde visited Bahia to learn
from the Bahia road management performance-based experience.


Institutional strengthening
Important results have been achieved altogether through institutional strengthening,
complementing the works activities towards the achievement of the Project Development
Objective.
SEINFRA’s Road Agency (DERBA) most benefited from the institutional
strengthening component. The Pavement Management System was updated; although
the works were not finalized by Project closeout, this step is expected to critically
enhance and optimize road rehabilitation planning, with a better allocation of available
resources. Besides, a comprehensive assessment of DERBA’s workflow has been
undertaken, in order to modernize this institution towards a result-based organization. A
new model has been designed and a pilot test is scheduled to take place in the coming
months. Other technical assistance support focused on roadworks’ environmental
management, as well as on engineering design quality control.
Several initiatives focused on logistics planning, building up knowledge on this key
topic for the State economy. The flagship study is Bahia’s transport and logistics
masterplan (PELTBAHIA), which will outline the State’s strategic orientations for

logistics and transport State for the next 20 years. This activity, which included a strong
analytical and forecast part, unfortunately started late within Project implementation and
could not be completed by Project closeout. Nevertheless, several other studies were
completed, including: (i) the State airports masterplan, (ii) a draft new regulation for
waterborne transport, and (iii) an estimate of freight transport rate reduction stemming
from road rehabilitation.
A critical step forward has been given to the State on-line georeferenced
information. SEPLAN’s superintendence for social and economic studies (SEI)
developed two interesting databases aiming at providing online information to public
agencies, private actors, researchers and the public at large. The first one, “Azimute”, is
available online at http://azimute.sei.ba.gov.br/;it focuses on State health and education
services. The other one (Bahia Geoportal) is currently being finalized and will focus on
the State infrastructure database: transport, energy, water and sanitation. This is a
collaborative effort of several public agencies in Bahia, pooling data and updating
procedures in one integrated tool. These initiatives are particularly innovative – few
States in Brazil have such tools, and Azimute was already presented in several research
events.
The institutional strengthening of the State’s transport, energy and communication
regulating agency (AGERBA) was the only subcomponent which failed. No action
materialized, despite efforts to organize a Master’s in Business Administration training,
adapted to the needs of AGERBA’s staff. The overall weak capacity and many
managerial changes in this entity could explain this shortcoming. Nevertheless, this
situation did not prevent the State’s Public-Private Partnerships program to move forward
(indicator #12 met), essentially thanks to the creation of the State PPP unit, linked to the
Finance Secretariat.
On some occurrences, the institutional strengthening dialogue went beyond what
was initially planned in the Project Appraisal Document. Thanks to the dynamism of
SEINFRA’s Transport studies superintendence (SUPET), two key pieces of work have
been developed with Bank’s financing. First, the intermunicipal passenger transport
masterplan aimed at developing a large study to redesign the intermunicipal bus routes
within the State of Bahia; all bus routes were (or are about to) be retendered at the end of
2013. Intermunicipal public transport is critical to address the mobility needs of poor
people, who cannot afford to buy a car, in the State most remote areas. Second, the wide
passenger Origin-Destination survey over the Salvador metropolitan area was a critical
input to better assess transport patterns and demand, feeding the studies for the planned
Salvador mass transit PPP. These activities might be considered beyond the strict scope
of the Project outline, but their impact has been considered instrumental for people’s
mobility needs.
Beyond PREMAR, the State of Bahia and the World Bank Group developed a
strong sector dialogue on transport. This materialized in particular through (i) the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) advisory services on highway concessioning;
since 2008, the IFC was the transaction advisor for the concessioning of the 121 km of
the State BA-093. The deal was successful, signed in 2010, and the IFC provided further
capacity building to the State on PPPs; and (ii) the 2012 Development Policy Loan Pro-

                                            15
Inclusao. This US$700 million Development Policy Loan (Pro-Inclusao) was approved
by the Bank in May 2012. Aiming at “reducing social inequality, developing more
efficient institutional infrastructure and logistics, and strengthening public sector
management”, this loan has an interesting synergy with the PREMAR Program; this DPL
contributed to the creation of the State Transport and Logistics Committee, a decision-
making entity on policy and investment in the sector. The main benefit provided by this
Committee, now operational, is the fostering of inter-institutional coordination and the
addressing of cross-cutting issues, as this Committee includes representatives from
various State secretariats, from the federal transport administration and from the transport
and logistics private sector.

3.3 Efficiency
An ex-post economic analysis was conducted following the same methodology as at
Appraisal, computing costs and benefits over 20 years with HDM-4, based on data
(works, traffic etc.) actually observed on the PREMAR highway sections, including: (i)
types of road works applied, (ii) observed unit costs for road works, (iii) observed traffic
volumes, and (iv) observed IRIs.
Overall, the ex-post economic evaluation confirms that the investments under PREMAR
have been economically sound; the investments resulted in an Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) and a Net Present Value (NPV) of 74% and US$292.0 million at a 12% discount
rate at a 2006 price respectively (full details are presented in Annex 3). The ex-post ERR
is higher than the Appraisal estimate (46%); while the NPV is lower than the Appraisal
estimate (US$453.3 million), the ex-post NPV remains by and large positive, confirming
the efficiency of the investment. Increased ERR results mainly from much higher than
expected traffics and benefits, while the reduced investment NPV stems from the fact that
the works started later than initially scheduled.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Although the three Project outcome indicators were fully met, a few intermediate
outcome indicators were only partially met. In light of this, the overall outcome rating is
considered Moderately Satisfactory.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Highway rehabilitation and maintenance remains a priority at the State level. In the recent
years, State expenditures for the transport sector, roads in particular, have dramatically



                                              16
increased, as illustrated by the Chart below17: State expenditures level for transport has
soared from around R$300 million a year before 2008, to about R$650 million a year in
the 2012 period; most of these expenditures are devoted to highway investment. Maybe
more importantly, about 51% of the Road Agency resources, since 2010, have been
dedicated to highway rehabilitation and maintenance, as opposed to network
development (construction of new roads, investments to increase capacity). This is a very
positive trend, showing growing awareness and concern about existing asset maintenance,
as opposed to a headlong rush toward an unsustainable road network development.
At project close-out, the six road maintenance performance-based contracts are still on-
going; they will end by August 2014, only including routine maintenance services. The
State of Bahia will bear the full cost of these contracts. Looking ahead, it is expected that
the Bank follow-up lending operation, PREMAR 2, could include some of the
PREMAR’s corridors.

Furthermore, after 2008 which was affected by the State’s fiscal crisis, the proportion of
State expenditures devoted to the transport sector, almost doubled, from 1.5% to 2.75%.
In recent years (2010 – 2012), this proportion has decreased, reaching 2.12% in 2012.

This order of magnitude is in the standards of required investment levels to adequately
maintain existing infrastructure.
Looking ahead, the risk of policy reversal regarding the priority given to the transport
sector among other State programs is deemed low: in its latest mid-term planning
documents (Planejamento Pluri-Anual – PPA 2012-2015), the State commits to the
development of the core infrastructure required to foster development and growth. The
2013 budget includes a particular allocation of about R$720 million in the road subsector
only.
However, the sustainability of the post-2010 level of investments in the road sector may
be questioned and advocates for a Moderate risk level (rather than Low). While
acknowledging that SEINFRA’s 2013 budget 18for roads is substantially higher that the
2012 one, the risk of falling back to pre-2010 level of investment remains. Whether the
declining trend, since 2010, of transport expenditures within the total State of Bahia
expenditures will continue declining (or stabilizing) is an open question.
Such situation lays the ground for a second phase of PREMAR, aiming at deeper
enrooting the performance-based approach in highway maintenance.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Project design and preparation was very quick, with only seven months between the first
preparation mission and the invitation to negotiate. The first identification mission took
place in June 2005 and the invitation for negotiations was sent to the State mid-January
2006, aiming at carrying out negotiations in March. By February 2006, the preparation
for negotiations was well underway, the bidding documents for the engineering designs
had already been prepared and terms of reference for several institutional strengthening
activities as well. Both the State and the Bank were very efficient in the definition of
activities and action plans to be carried out from mission to mission during the
preparation stage.
This Project had a very innovative approach, promoting results-based contracts
(CREMA), which made Bahia become the first State in the Northeast region to have
executed this modality of contracts. Since Project preparation, the Bank provided the
State’s public and private sectors with technical capacity, both at the decision making and
technical levels, so as to achieve a complete understanding of the benefits this
methodology could bring. This resulted in the client’s cultural change and therefore the
acceptance and engagement to the carrying out of CREMA contracts.



18
     There may be here interference, as 2013 is a pre-electoral year.
                                                        18
The Project also embedded, in its design, a varied and ambitious institutional
strengthening component, which has been almost achieved by Project closing. A deep
sector dialogue had been held with the Borrower, so that these institutional strengthening
activities scale up the benefits expected to result from the works component.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the Project Appraisal Document included a full specific
annex (Annex 9B) presenting a fiscal analysis of the Bahia’s State Government. This was
not (and is still not) standard practice in Investment Project Financing PADs. This extra
analysis, assessing the fiscal soundness of the State with an aim to appraise the
sustainability of the infrastructure investment, highlights the in-depth analysis that
characterized the preparation phase
Despite all these qualities, only a Moderately satisfactory rating is proposed, stemming
mainly from: the too old costing elements of the engineering designs, which should have
been, at least, updated by appraisal. This initial shortcoming paved the way for the
financial gap (compounded by other factors) which materialized during implementation.
The exceptional delay of 13 months between Board approval and effectiveness cannot be
attributed neither to the Bank nor to the Borrower, as none of them can do much about it.
Yet, while this delay eventually did not substantially impact the Projects outcomes (no
closing date extension was requested), it could have been envisioned upfront as a risk in
the PAD.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank implementation support has been satisfactorily carried out through:
   (i)     strong relationship with DERBA, SEINFRA and the other implementing
           entities through including appropriate advice and solutions, and consistent
           efforts to remain abreast of the implementation situation;
   (ii)    regular Bank missions (25 missions in 8 years) with monitored and agreed
           actions, as well as systematic field visits during the execution of works;
   (iii)   adequate environmental and social implementation support, also with field
           trips, even though the Project could have benefited from some further
           involvement from Bank environmental and social specialists in the last two
           years: safeguards supervision was indeed mainly carried out by the Project’s
           Task-Team leader, in part due to existing capacity at local level and in part
           due to the lack of any significant events in this area during this period;
   (iv)    adequate fiduciary supervision, with several financial management missions.
           During the first part of Project implementation, procurement supervision was
           directly carried out by the Project Task-Team Leader, a procurement-
           accredited staff. After 2010, a Sr. Procurement specialist, based in Brasilia,
           went on mission to Bahia once a year; this was deemed sufficient as all
           processes were prior-reviewed;
   (v)     adequate responsiveness when the need to restructure the loan arose, which
           happened twice during implementation.

                                           19
On the negative side, the Bank supervision team should have amended the monitoring
and evaluation framework, as part of a formal restructuring, to (i) reflect the impact of the
increased works cost and (ii) incorporate an institutional development indicator at the
PDO level. These shortcomings do not diminish the overall satisfactory performance of
Bank’s implementation support.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall Bank performance is considered Satisfactory: six years of effective
supervision, including a rich institutional dialogue with DERBA, SEINFRA and the other
Project beneficiaries outweigh the Moderately Satisfactory quality at entry. Even Bank
performance in quality at entry would have been good, had the works costs estimates
been adjusted before appraisal. This was the main shortcoming, even though, as already
highlighted, this did not impact adversely the overall timely achievement of the outcome
indicators. More importantly, the quality of the sector dialogue between the Borrower and
the Bank, in areas as diverse as road management, transport and logistics planning, and
administrative reform has led to high-profile results, exemplified by the integration of the
Project sector dialogue with other World Bank Group activities in Bahia, namely the
Development Policy Loan Pro-Inclusao (P126356) and the IFC advisory services on the
BA-093 highway concessioning. Finally, the perspective of the new operation, PREMAR
2, shows the mutual interest on the Borrower and the Bank on continuing the partnership
in the road sector, building on past PREMAR’s achievements.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
On the positive side, the State has been, from the beginning of preparation to the end of
implementation, very committed to the Project. The administration transition, in 2007,
was smoothed from the Project’s perspective, albeit with some delays in implementation.
The strong element of commitment triggered the decision to initiate road management
performance-based contracts on a wide scale in Bahia. Beyond the works component, the
State was also fully committed in the design and implementation of the Project’s
ambitious institutional strengthening component; it was the State who initially advocated
for such comprehensive and diverse technical assistance activities. Finally, the State has
complied with its counterpart financing responsibilities. The State actually went further,
dutifully covering the financing gap from the first phase of CREMA cost overruns.
Annex 1 shows that the participation of the State to the Project costs eventually amounted
129% of the Appraisal estimate, reversing the State/ Bank pari – passu Project financing.
On shortcomings, two elements could be highlighted. First, at times, the late payment of
counterpart financing; while this did not eventually affect the Project outcomes, this
element should be noted. More importantly, the State has not been able to finance the full
2,000 km PREMAR program, as envisioned in the Project Appraisal Document. On this
basis, a Moderately Satisfactory rating is proposed.

                                             20
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
DERBA and its Project Coordination Unit performances were together fully satisfactory.
This rating is based on: (i) DERBA’s highly successful implementation of an innovative
and therefore demanding road rehabilitation and maintenance program, which was the
first of its kind in Brazil’s northeast region; (ii) the Project Coordination Unit was
instrumental in making the activities move forward, coordinating with the various
beneficiaries and providing constant technical contributions throughout all the Project
phases, especially by closely monitoring and supervising the development of the
engineering designs and the execution of the works; and (iii) the effective monitoring and
evaluation performance of the activities, through comprehensive and detailed bi-yearly
monitoring reports submitted to the Bank.
Both SUPET (SEINFRA’s transport studies superintendence) and SEI (SEPLAN’s
economic and social studies superintendence) carried out the technical assistance
component in a satisfactory manner; they have shown close activity monitoring and
follow-up, on a wide range of assignments. The less than highly satisfactory rating is
based on the lengthy delays on the procurement processes. On the other hand,
AGERBA’s (State regulation agency) performance was unsatisfactory. This Agency did
not undertake any of the technical assistance activities, from which two were linked to
intermediate results indicators. This was due to the low priority given to these activities
and the lack of managerial leadership necessary to move them forward.
Due to the aforementioned, the overall performance of the implementing agencies is
deemed very positive and rated overall satisfactory.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The only main two negative elements are, at the Government level, the decision to drop
the additional financing and, at the implementing agency level, AGERBA’s
unsatisfactory performance. Overall Positive performance at both Government and
implementing agencies levels, as above-detailed, altogether outstrip these shortcomings.
An overall Satisfactory rating is proposed for the Borrower’s performance.


6. Lessons Learned (both Project-specific and of wide general application)
(a) In Bahia, the implementation of performance-based road rehabilitation and
maintenance contracts (CREMA) yielded significant benefits, but a close
supervision was needed. Rehabilitation contracts were completed on-time, with almost
any cost overrun. While comparisons are delicate to make and should cover the full road
life cycle, PREMAR rehabilitation costs have been substantially lower than other
simultaneous rehabilitation works in Bahia; this result would be in line with previous
research on this matter. Highway rehabilitation quality has been up to the expected
standards and, overall, routine maintenance as well. Yet, contract implementation

                                            21
required a strong supervision involvement from the road agency, and its Project
Coordination Unit in particular, to get them right (contract requirement compliance). The
lesson is that incentives mechanisms embedded in performance-based contracts are not
necessary enough, especially in road agencies pioneering such kind of contracts.
(b) The adoption of the CREMA concept is the right first step towards an improved
road asset management in Bahia, but still important cultural change will be
necessary to reap its full benefits. The State of Bahia is the pioneer, in Brazil’s
Northeast region, in implementing performance-based road rehabilitation and
maintenance. The implementation of this innovative modality of contracts required a
cultural change, which was achieved through persistent dialogue, training and monitoring,
at the technical and decision-making levels, both for public and private (consultancies
and construction companies) sides, to explain the concept and ensure acceptance and
commitment. While this CREMA program has been overall successful, Project design
and implementation support should not understate that implementing such performance-
based arrangements can be challenging, especially in cultures where tradition is deeply
rooted and risk appetite, and capabilities, from the private sector is too low. In Bahia,
despite dramatic progress on performance-based road management, there is still a long
way to go to use it in its full scale.
(c) The CREMA model is not cast in stone; learning from experience, improvements
are possible. Likewise, CREMA specifications have to be tailored to the capabilities
of the private and public sectors. Some contract features of the Bahia CREMA proved
not to work fully adequately. For instance, the unbalance between rehabilitation and
routine maintenance costs gave little incentives for contractors to perform in a completely
satisfactory manner on maintenance. Regarding capacity, the monitoring and rating
specifications in the contracts were certainly too complex to be thoroughly understood,
and abided by old-fashioned local companies. DERBA carried out a retrospective
analysis aiming at improving the model for future performance based rehabilitation /
maintenance programs, in Bahia or elsewhere. This retrospective analysis includes,
lessons learned and recommendations related to:(i) contract amendments; (ii)
environmental assessments; (iii) penalty systems for works and supervision services; (iv)
budget allocation for road signs; (v) enforcement of technical visits prior to starting the
execution of the works to evaluate drainage conditions and proposed solutions; (vi)
supervision services measurement methodologies; (vii) maintenance performance
standards; and (viii) quality assessment tests.
(d) Combined lending instruments and interventions across the World Bank Group
leverage sector results. The Project included ambitious institutional strengthening
activities, conducive to an in-depth sector dialogue. Synergies between this Investment
Lending Project and the Development Policy Loan Pro-Inclusao (P126356), approved in
May 2012, and the International Finance Corporation advisory services on concessioning
the BA-093 highway fostered the sector dialogue for more efficient road management
and logistics in the State of Bahia.
(e) Finally, Project Development Objectives and related indicators should remain
commensurate to what the Project activities can achieve, within a strong enough
causal link. In this case, many other factors drive the freight prices (first PDO indicator),

                                             22
among which diesel prices. Elaborate indicators, such as this one, are interesting, as they
provide a more comprehensive perspective on the impacts of the project; they are also
challenging to implement, as they requires comparators to evaluate how the changes of
those indicators compared to other similar roads/corridors without project interventions.
Finding “similar” corridors could prove challenging, as shown by recent impact
evaluation studies focusing on infrastructure, whose effect materialize on a longer term.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


Introduction
This annex presents the ex-post economic analysis (methodology, results) of the
PREMAR - Bahia Integrated State Highway Management Project. At appraisal, a
Project-level economic analysis was undertaken for the first seven contracts to be
financed by the Bank loan, comprising 1,171 km and requiring US$ 108 million for
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works. The evaluation was carried out with the
Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4), which simulates life cycle
conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and
maintenance alternatives. The economic analysis concluded that the main benefits were
savings in road user costs and estimated a net present value19 of the investment of US$
453 million, for and an economic rate of return of 46 percent.


Methodology
The ex-post economic evaluation follows the methodology of the ex-ante evaluation
undertaken as part of the Project preparation in 2005-2006 with HDM-4. HDM-4 is
designed to make comparative cost estimates and economic evaluations of different
construction and maintenance options, either for a single road section or for an entire
network. The model simulates road infrastructure life cycle conditions and costs and
provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance alternatives.
Costs considered for the analysis included construction and maintenance costs, vehicle
operating costs and travel time costs. Benefits resulting from a better road safety were not
included.

During Project implementation, the BA 270: BA 001 (Canavieiras) –Sta. Luzia section
was removed and the BA160 : XiqueXique – Barra section was added. Therefore, the
scope for the ex-post evaluation is comprised of 1,196 km of paved roads.
Assumptions
The ex-post evaluation was based on the data/information resulting from: (i) observed
traffic growth between 2006 and 2013, (ii) observed rehabilitation works costs, (iii)
observed type of works (solutions), and (iv)observed ex-post International Roughness
Index (IRI).

The Average Annual Daily Traffic was estimated to increase an accumulated 23% by the
end of the Project, based on a 3% yearly growth rate established in the PAD, but it
actually increased by 73%, equivalent to a 9.6% yearly growth rate. The table above also
shows that the actual proportion of heavy vehicles is lower than expected (27% vs. 36%
at Appraisal). This may stem from an overall better federal highway network that heavy
vehicles are prone to use.

* Only 30 out of the contracted 90 Km were carried out with the loan’s funds. During execution, some of the pavement
tests went wrong, due to which, the Bank requested that a more thorough study be carried out to determine the reasons
behind the problem. Given that this is a touristic highway and that the thorough studies were going to take time, the
Government decided to take responsibility of the execution in order to expedite the rehabilitation of this section.
** Using the 1 US$ = 1.76 BRL: average foreign exchange rate, where current forex rates, at loan disbursement dates,
are weighed by related disbursement amounts.

The works component suffered from a dramatic cost increase stemming from: (i) the light
rehabilitation solutions that were estimated at appraisal; (ii) the significant road
deterioration developed between Project preparation (end of 2005 - beginning of 2006)
and the contracting of the engineering designs in May 2008;(iii) construction costs
increase, compounded by theapproximately four years of inflation that passed between
Project preparation and the works contract awards (March – November 2009); and (iv),
for the costs in US$, the unfavorable foreign exchange rate.

The table above shows that most of the rehabilitation solutions that were estimated at
appraisal were substituted for heavier ones during implementation. Out of the 6 contracts
(each letter represents one works contract), 5 include at least one section to which the

*The IRIs after works for these sections were anticipated to be higher than the IRIs before works because the
solutionestimated at appraisalwas maintenance, for which a resulting 4.5 IRI was established as acceptable.

The IRIs after works significantly improved, the actual average IRI is23% lower than the
anticipated results and 44% lower than the average IRI before works. These good
outcome derived from both the heavier solutions implemented, and the overall
satisfactory execution of the works.

      Scenarios:

HDM-4 estimates the benefits of an investment comparing the costs/benefits for the
various stakeholders in a scenario which would have prevailed without Project (“Base
case scenario”) to the ones resulting from the Project implementation (“Project scenario”).
In order to compare the ex-ante and the ex-post evaluation, the Base case scenario
remained the same. Besides, all assumptions from the ex-ante Project scenario were
replicated to ex-post Project scenario, with the exception of traffic, costs, solutions and
IRIs, as detailed above.

Overall, this ex-post evaluation confirms that the investments under the PREMAR have
been economically sound; most benefits: (i) road users operating costs savings and (ii)
savings from the Road agency in infrastructure maintenance. The ex-post EIRR is
significantly higher than the ex-ante one, despite substantially costlier investment. This
could be explained by the dramatic differential traffic increase between the ex-ante and
ex-post evaluations, as well as the better results obtained in terms of IRIs. Yet, the
investment Net Present Value is actually about a third lower than expected, due the
delays in initiating the works.

This Annex summarizes the Borrower Implementation Completion Report, submitted to
the Bank on Dec. 20, 2013.


The PREMAR program (Programa de reabilitação e manutenção rodoviario) went
through different phases throughout its implementation, such as:
      A slow start due to specific delays in procurement and in the conclusion of the
       engineering designs, which finally occurred in the second semester of 2008.
       Thereafter, the bidding processes for the execution of the works began.
      2009-2010 Satisfactory Performance: Due to the contracting of the works in 2009,
       the Program began to take off, despite procurement delays for the Institutional
       Stengthening component and issues related to the State’s counterpart financing.
      2012-2013 Slow implementation: from the end of 2011, with the conclusion of
       the rehabilitation works, the performance went back to a slow pace, mainly
       because of the procurement delays for the Institutional Development activities.
       Nevertheless, by the end of the Program’s effectiveness, all the key activities had
       been contracted.

PREMAR enabled the Performance-Based Contracts (PBC) concept in the State’s road
Administration. This contract modality is innovative and includes, among others, the
following benefits:
      Optimizes the management structure, reducing the number of contracts and
       management efforts;
      Reduces the need of the agency’s supervisory staff and their efforts for the
       measurement and supervision of contracts and services;
      Decreases the agency’s flexibility to modify the contract’s established objectives
       and quantities, dramatically reducing the need for contractual additives;
      Avoids constant complaints from contractors, because the rules are very clear and
       the constructor's role is well defined. The constructor is made accountable for all
       the phases of the services, and responsible for setting the location, the timing and
       the manner in which things need to be carried out, as well as the workplan, quality
       control and the maintenance of the services performed. This allows the
       development of new technologies, the acquisition of new and more efficient
       equipment, etc.
      Adopts less detailed engineering designs, but with sufficient technical elements
       necessary to define the adequate solutions, based on a pre-established solutions
       catalogue;


                                           44
      Allows the adoption of simple, easy to measure and monitor performance
       standards.

This type of contract however shows some peculiarities that may be restrictive, if they are
not conveniently and timely taken into consideration, such as:
      Does not include possibilities to undertake emergency maintenance services,
       which were not included in the cost of routine maintenance, such as the damage
       caused by exceptional rains resulting in large erosions or barrier falls.
      Requires a solid financing system that counts with credibility throughout the
       contract period, to avoid disruption of services or lack of credibility, which are
       fatal to such types of contract, because they involve higher risks and disbursement
       needs by the contractors;
      Reduces competition opportunities for small contractors, who must enter in joint
       ventures with other constructors or work with sub-contractors in order to be able
       to participate.


The overall technical quality of the 1,196.41 km of works and routine maintenance
services was satisfactory, as expected through the program’s implementation. The main
difficulty was that the contrators were not accustomed to perform planning and
monitoring activities for maintenance services. The companies submitted the
measurement of the IRI performance indicator, maintenance plans and monthly reports
with delays. Yet, the outcomes obtained from the execution of the PREMAR works
promoted the inclusion of a new works quality standard for the State of Bahia. On this
basis, a second phase funding program is being prepared to increase the State’s road
network under performance-based contracts.
Furthermore, the existence of the institutional component enabled the State to advance in
some critical topics related to planning and management, such as the GEO-portal, Origin-
Destination Surveys, DERBA’s Macroprocesses and organizational structure study, the
State’s Transport and Logistics Program, and DERBA’s Pavement Management System,
although the latter one has not been fully deployed and operational. All these actions
have been identified and implemented to modernize the State’s infrastructure
management.Notwithstanding delays in implementation, the Institutional Strengthening
activities were all contracted and concluded for the most part. The activities that were
still being implemented by project closeout, will be concluded with the State’s Treasury
Funds, in accordance to the established in the Loan Agreement.


In conclusion, the State of Bahia ranks PREMAR’s results and the partnership
established with the World Bank for this program as totally satisfactory.
