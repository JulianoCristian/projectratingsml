The\n            changes aim at: 1) increasing the percentage of expenditures\n            to be financed by the Bank proceeds for the works category,\n            from currently 50 percent to tentatively 90 percent; 2)\n            reallocating funds from the unallocated category to the\n            works category; and 3) introducing a new project outcome\n            indicator. The restructuring chiefly stems from the\n            difficulty, for the Borrower, to come up with the required\n            counterpart funding, in a moment when the fiscal situation\n            of State of Bahia is constrained. Although the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) does not change, it is proposed\n            to add a third project outcome indicator and to modify one\n            project intermediate indicator. The new outcome indicator\n            would measure the reduction of average unit vehicle\n            operating costs on selected itineraries, basically the State\n            highway network under result based contracts. Almost all the\n            loan amount is already committed; disbursements of loan\n            proceeds have increased, from 8 percent in October 2009 up\n            to almost 42 percent in August 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-09-09T00:00:00Z"}
