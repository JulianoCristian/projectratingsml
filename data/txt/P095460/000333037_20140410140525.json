the Bahia Integrated State\n            Highway Management Project for Brazil were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the adoption of\n            the Performance-based Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance\n            Contract (CREMA) concept is the right first step towards an\n            improved road asset management in Bahia, but still important\n            cultural change will be necessary to reap its full benefits.\n            The State of Bahia is the pioneer, in Brazil's\n            Northeast region, in implementing performance-based road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance. The implementation of this\n            innovative modality of contracts required a cultural change,\n            which was achieved through persistent dialogue, training and\n            monitoring, at the technical and decision-making levels,\n            both for public and private (consultancies and construction\n            companies) sides, to explain the concept and ensure\n            acceptance and commitment. While this CREMA program has been\n            overall successful, project design and implementation\n            support should not understate that implementing such\n            performance-based arrangements can be challenging,\n            especially in cultures where tradition is deeply rooted and\n            risk appetite, and capabilities, from the private sector is\n            too low. In Bahia, despite dramatic progress on\n            performance-based road management, there is still a long way\n            to go to use it in its full scale. Finally, project\n            development objectives and related indicators should remain\n            commensurate to what the project activities can achieve,\n            within a strong enough causal links."}, "docdt": "2014-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
