rehabilitation of the international port at Cap Haitien,\n            for which Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) (Federal\n            Republic of Germany) is considering cofinancing equivalent\n            to US$6 million; (ii) construction of five and\n            rehabilitation of two coastal shipping ports; (iii)\n            supplementary works at Jeremie; (iv) preparation of a master\n            development plan for the Port-au-Prince harbor; and (v)\n            institutional assistance for APN's management in the\n            maritime sector and consulting services for project\n            supervision. In addition to preventing the collapse of the\n            existing wharf, the main benefits are additional earnings\n            from cruise ships and from the on-shore expenditures of\n            their passengers. The most significant risk is that traffic\n            development may not take place as rapidly as expected. This\n            risk is minimized by avoiding over-investment through a\n            staged construction program. The main benefit is to improve\n            access to communities not linked to the main road network.\n            The main risk is that traffic will not develop as rapidly as\n            expected. Risks are reduced by holding investments to a\n            minimum and by institutional assistance to the maritime\n            sector to foster the growth of coastal shipping."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
