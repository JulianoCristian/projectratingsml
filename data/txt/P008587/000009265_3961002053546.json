the social safety net, and containing upward pressure\n            from the health sector on the state budget. To achieve these\n            goals, the project will: (a) improve health status by\n            strengthening health promotion and prevention programs; (b)\n            support the first steps in restructuring the health sector\n            by shifting the focus from institutional care to effective\n            primary care through better trained primary care doctors and\n            nurses; (c) strengthen institutional capacity in policy\n            making, planning, management and evaluation by providing\n            managers access to improved infromation systems and\n            management education; and (d) ensure sustainability of\n            services and control costs in the health sector in the\n            medium-term by improving effectiveness, efficiency and\n            quality of service delivery in three project regions. The\n            project comprises four components: (a) health promotion; (b)\n            primary health care; (c) health management; and (d) regional\n            health services. For each, it will provide technical\n            assistance, training, equipment and civil works."}, "docdt": "1992-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
