I'EMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ItrrERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A HEALTH SERVICEZ DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Poland for the equivalent
of US$.30.0 million to help financ, a project for development of health
services. The loan would be at the Bank's stancard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of seventeen years, including a four year grace period. The
project is being cofinanced by a grant of US$25.0 million equivalent provided
by the Commission of the European Communities (EC).
2.       CmuLtZ5ector_Backgroun.  The Government is committed to major
health sector reform to improve the bleak social conditions left by decades of
poor living standards, disregard for the environment, unhealthy lifestyles and
misdirected priorities in provision of health services. Since the mid-1970s,
health indicators in Poland, including life expectancy, have deteriorated
while they have improved in most western countries. Extensive but poorly
targeted investments in the early 1970s led to a build-up of acute care
hospitals and training of medical specialists. Little attention was given to
targeted health promotion and disease prevention, rehabilitation and long-term
care facilities. Training of general practitioners, nurses and other health
workers was neglected, causing imbalances in health care staffing and
ineffective primary care. The budget needed to operate the resulting massive
national health service outstripped the country's financial resources. In
recent years, underfinancing and neglect have left health care facilities
badly in need of repair and replacement. Hospitals and ambulatory clinics
often lack basic diagnostic and therapeutic equipment. Shortages of critical
drugs and supplies result in low quality care. Most seriously, there are no
incentives to motivate patients to maintain good health and use scarce
resources judiciously, or to encourage health workers to provide quality care.
3.       The health sector confronts these problems during a time of economic
crisis. Following a period of hyperinflation, the Government launched reforms
to introduce a market economy in January 1990. Although the economy is
beginning to stabilize, the annual rate of inflation during the latter part of
1991 was still about 40 percent and output has declined sharply for two
consecutive years. This has resulted in a serious fiscal deficit, which could
potentially worsen in 1992. Measures taken to confront the present fiscal
crisis are likely to include real expenditure cuts.  These reductions could
have an important bearing on the health sector, which relies almost
exclusively on state budget transfers for its financing. It is becoming
increasingly clear that success of the Government's economic reform program
depends to a large extent on measures taken to balance the budget and reduce
the social cost of adjustment. Increasing public expenditure on health
services and further deteriorating standards of care could compromise the
reform program.



4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In 1990, with input from a Joint
Government/World Bank Task Force on Health System Reform, the Government
formulated the strategic framework for fundamental reform in the health
sector. The Government places a high priority on improving health as a vital
strategy in reversing the bleak social cor.ditions and protecting vulnerable
groups during and after the transition period. The Government recognizes that
major restructuring of the health care system cannot be immediate and that
upgrading health services to western standards is far beyond its financial
resources in the near future. The Government therefore does not intend row to
address all the problems in the health sector. Instead, it will concentrate
on priorities that would have the greatest impact on improving health,
increasing effectiveness and efficiency in health services, and transferring
some of the responsibility for financing health care from the state budget to
contributory social insurance.
5.       To provide an appropriate policy and legal framework for health
sector reforms, the Government has recently taken the following important
steps: (a) a National Health Promotion Strategy was formulated in 1990; (b) a
Health Care Institutions Act passed in 1991 will allow establishment of
private practice and a greater role of the private sector in provision of
health services; (c) a Pharmaceutical Act passed in 1991 will increase cost
recovery, redefine entitlement, and introduce criteria for a limited drug
formulary; and (d) the Health Care Provisions under the Local Government Act,
which was passed by Parliament two years ago supports efforts to decentralize
the health care system by increasing the responsibility of local government
for financing and provision of health care. Through sector dialogue and
project preparation, the Bank has already assisted the Government to develop
strategies, policies and programs to restructure the health sector in support
of a new and more appropriate balance in the public/private mix. Many of the
Government's programs have foreign currency requirements and need for
technical assistance that are far beyond the capacity of local financial
resources or those that can be mobilized through the international donor
community. The Government is therefore seeking a World Bank loan to launch
its health sector reform.
6.       Role of Other Donors.  The EC has been closely involved in project
development and is a cofinancier. The Government of Switzerland has begun
preparation of a bilateral grant which builds upon a model for regional health
services developed under this project. The MOH has been supported in project
preparation with technical assistance funded by the Governments of Denmark,
Japan, Sweden, and the U.S. and by direct technical assistance from Project
Hope.
7.       Proiect Objectives.  The project would support the Government's
economic reform program by improving health, strengthening the health sector's
contribution to the social safety net, and containing upward pressure from the
health sector on the state budget. The specific project objectives are:
(a) to improve health status by strengthening health promotion and prevention
programs; (b) to support the first steps in restructuring the health sector by
shifting the focus from institutional care to primary care through better



-3-
trained family doctors and nurses; (c) to strengthen institutional capacity in
policy making, planning, managament and evaluation; and (d) to ensure
sustainability of services and control costs in the health sector.
8.       groject Descriltion.  The project would comprise four components:
(a) Health Promotion; (b) Primary Health Care; (c) Health Management; and
(d) Regional Health Services. A special feature of the project design is the
initial targeted application of components (a), (b) and (c) in three project
regions (see Map) under component (d) to maximize impact. Health services
within the three regions would be reorganized as "health consortia" of
participating voivodships. Concurrently, the project would contribute to
progressive strengthening of the entire health sector through aspects of
components (a), (b), and (c) that would be implemented in stages nationwide.
A breakdown of project costs, financing, procurement and disbursement methods
are shown in Schedules A and B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank group operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and
D. The Bank has approved a Project Preparaticn Facility (PPF) Advance of
US$1.5 million, which would be refinanced upon loan effectiveness.
9.       The Health Promotion Component (41 of base cost) would help
consolidate national health promotion activities focused on critical and
preventable risk factors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, and unhealthy
diets), and strengthen capacity in health education. The component would also
support policy development and planning of programs to address occupational
health and safety issues.
10.      The Primary Health Care Co2=onent (211 of base cost) would strengthen
community-based primary care teams of family doctors, community nurses and
allied primary health care workers. Family doctors would be trained to
provide comprehensive first line care, including family planning, to the
general population. Academic training units would be established at existing
medical academies and universities, while in-service training would be
established in community-based teaching practices. The project would also
support upgrading of primary care clinics in the public sector.
11.      The Health  .nagmnt Component (251 of base cost) would strengthen
institutional capacity in the health sector by providing managers with
appropriate management tools and knowledge. It would support capacity-
building in budgeting and the first steps in restructuring health care
financing away from reliance on the state budget. The component comprises six
inter-linked parts: (a) hospital admission/discharge (A/D) information
systems; (b) accounting information systems; (c) pharmaceutical registration
and monitoring; (d) budgeting; (e) management development; and (f) health
financing policy development.
12.      The Regional Health Services Component (501 of base cost) would
initiate decentralization of the health care delivery system in ten
voivodships belonging to three project regions (Ciechanow, Pomerania, and
Vielkopolski) under a new regional organizational structure called 'health
consortia.' In each region, the project would support: (a) strengthening of
policy making, planning, management and evaluation capacity through design of



*4
priority health programs (health promotion, primary care, strategic pla8is for
health care facilities, maragement information systems and human resources
development) that would be implemented later during the project; (b) a
selective upgrading o.' the infrastructure and equipment of primary care and
institutional care facilities on the basis of approved strategic plans and a
new balance between acute and chronic cares (c) strengthening of the
management capacity of local institutions to provide efficient serv'.ces
through introduction of management information systems (A/D information,
accounting and drug monitoring systems, described above); and (d) improvement
in the management of scarce resources throuS joint materials and technology
management (procurement, distribution, and operation).
13.      Project Im2lqantation.  Project management and implementation
arrangements have been designed to reflect the concertration of investment in
the three regions (para. 12). Project implementing units in each of the three
project regions would be responsible for: coordination and monitoring of
project tasks at the regional level; ftnancial management; and procurement of
civil works, equipment and technical assistance that cannot appropriately be
packaged for bulk procurement. The MOH will be responsible for overall
coordination, liaison with implementing agencies for national aspects of
project components and bulk procurement, and support to the regions.
14.      Project SustainabilitL.  The project is integral to the Government's
broad health reform effort. Project activities allow for refinement of reform
initiatives at the regional level and capacity-building in national
institutions prior to countrywide dissemination. Incremental recurrent costs,
mainly of new information systems, are expected to be more than offset by
bttdgetary savings achieved through efficiency gains.
15.      Lessons Learned ftom Previous Bank In_volvement.  This is the first
Bank health operation in Poland. Ongoing experience with other investment
operations in the country suggests that recruiting and maintaining project
staff on the present public sector salaries could delay or prevent effective
project start-up and implementation. Project preparation has therefore
provided for detailed appraisal of implementation arrangements, early
recruitment of project implementation staff and local consultants, and
appropriate technical assistance for project management. Experience has also
indicated that coordination of technical assistance is expensive and time-
consuming. Early involvement of the international donor community has
facilitated project preparation. The EC is providing several staff years of
implementation support and the Bank staff have prepared a detailed supervision
plan.
16.      Actions to be Agreed.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
the Government would: (a) maintain throughout the project a national project
implementation unit with staffing and functions acceptable to the Bank; (b) in
its budget, ensure that funds made available to the voivodships in the health
consortia are treated as supplemental to normal budget allocations; (c) ensure
that the voivodships and health institutions in the project regions provide
adequate funds to cover the operating costs of the regional management
structure; and (d) carry out jointly with the Bank two interim reviews of



project implementation according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Loan effectiveness would be conditional on:  (a) KOH issuance of the following
policies/regulations: (i) recommended minimum data set for hospital patient
admission/discharge information; (ii) accounting practices for health care
institutions; (iii) registration of drugs and a standard format for drug
prescriptions; and (b) employment of consultants to assist with project
management. A condition of lisbursement for infrastructure consolidation in
each project region would be provision to the Bank of regional health services
strategic plans and investment proposals acceptable to the Bank.
17.      A=vrgn=e-J Asects. The project cwpoonents have been individually
evaluated for potential environmental impact. All components have been
categorized as "C" (not requiring environmental analysis) with the exception
of the Regional Health Services Component, which has been categorized as B"3
(requiring limited environmental analysis). The designs for rehabilitation of
health facilities would comply with environmental standards acceptable to the
Bank. Provision would be made in architectural plans for proper disposal of
sanitary, medical and laboratory wastes.
18.      B      .  Major benefits include increased orientation to prevention
of health problems, more accessible and effective primary care, more efficient
and professionally managed health services, reduced reliance on the state
budget for health care financing, and experience in decentralization of health
services. Improved targeting of poor and vulnerable populations would be
achieved through better equipped and more highly trained family doctors. This
would also address fragmentation of primary care and reduce reliance on
enterprise-based services, thereby facilitating labor mobility. A reduction
in avoidable infant deaths could be expected. Improved accounting methods,
monitoring of drug prescriptions and sales, and professional hospital
anagement would all lead to efficiency gains and contribute to cost
containment. Regional restructuring of health services is expected to permit
greater involvement of the private sector in hospital support services such as
laundry, catering and maintenance. Development of training for primary care
physicians and nurses is also expected to foster high quality private
practices. The three project regions would contribute to sustainability of
the project through cost containment and improved efficiency by establishing
shared services in technology and materials management, planning and
evaluation. Once materials management is operating, up to 10 savirgs on
operating budgets could be achieved, and up to 52 savings are possible on both
investment and operating budgets with efficient equipment management. The
combined total savings from measures that address pharmaceutical consumption
and efficiency in hospitals could be as high as ZL3 trillion or 8 percent of
the total health care budget. These internal savings could be redirected
toward priorities such as health promotion, prevention and primary care.
19.     Risks. There are two main risks. The first is continuation of weak
project implementation capacity in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare
(KOH). Project implementation presents an administrative challenge
unprecedented in MOH, and the number of qualified staff responsible for
implementation needs to be increased. This risk is compounded by the
difficulty in attracting and maintainLtg staff with the present public sector



-6-
salarius. Management capacity at the regional level is also a concern. To
reduce this risk, technical assistance in project management would be provided
during project start-up and implementation.  The second risk is that continued
uncontrolled rise in health expenditure and further economic difficulty could
compromise financing and sustainability of health services. Project design
has been tightly focused on essential investments to rationalize health
expenditures and minimize incremental recurrent costs. Management
improvements and cost recovery to be implemented under the project would yield
substantial efficiency gains.
20.      R eomedatign. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank .and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
