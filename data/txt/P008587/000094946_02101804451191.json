Overall World Bank\n            performance is satisfactory, although uneven. Borrower\n            performance is considered satisfactory. Following are some\n            of the lessons learned: The implementation capacity of the\n            Borrower proved insufficient--smaller steps or a more\n            compact project would help avoid such implementation\n            bottlenecks. A project not firmly placed within a coherent\n            health policy designed by the Borrower will have more of a\n            physical rather than institutional impact, which reinforces\n            yet again the importance of government ownership in\n            project-financed activities. Public information and\n            dissemination of project activities and progress can enhance\n            project impact. More importantly, though, a public\n            information campaign can increase project ownership by\n            making the government more accountable to its citizens.\n            Lastly, the sustainability of training activities is linked\n            to proper selection of participants. That is, lower and\n            middle level staff are less likely to be laid off when a new\n            government comes to office. Thus, knowledge remains in the\n            system. In contrast, top management is vulnerable to changes\n            in government."}, "docdt": "2002-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
