The project's progress\n            towards achieving its development and global environment\n            objective is satisfactory. At closing on April 30, 2011, the\n            project will have exceeded development and global\n            environment objectives. Notably, the project will have\n            financed manure management investments on 105 livestock\n            farms compared with 60 planned farms. The annual decrease in\n            the amount of nutrients, which are not taken up by plants\n            and eventually flow into watercourses from project\n            beneficiary farms, is conservatively estimated at 44 percent\n            for nitrogen and 100 percent for phosphorus compared to the\n            baseline levels. Additionally, the Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF) grant has funded manure management storage\n            facilities and equipment, and nutrient management curriculum\n            development at six agricultural high schools, which is\n            expected to have significant long-term replication impact by\n            exposing future farmers, agricultural advisors, and\n            agro-industrial professionals to proper farms nutrient\n            management practices. The GEF grant has also improved\n            Serbia's capacity to collect and process risky animal\n            waste generated at slaughterhouses and meat processing\n            enterprises and thereby reduced the likelihood of\n            inappropriate dumping of these substances and resulting\n            water pollution. The reallocation is necessary to redirect\n            grant proceeds that have not yet been allocated or that are\n            available for an activity that has already been completed,\n            toward a disbursement category that will allow the recipient\n            to successfully complete project activities and finalize payments."}, "docdt": "2011-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
