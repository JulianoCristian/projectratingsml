                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall progress towards achieving Project Development and Global Environment Objectives (PDO and GEO) remains satisfactory. In fact, the PDO and GEO targets have been
                         exceeded. The annual decrease in the amount of nutrients, which are not taken up by plants and may eventually flow into watercourses from Project beneficiary farms is
                         conservatively estimated at 44% for nitrogen and 100% for phosphorus compared to the the target of 20% for each nutrient. The Project has completed animal waste management

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         * The change in Government (anticipation and ensuing transition) since early 2011 has prevented new commitments, including signing of contracts with selected providers, as a result
                         of which approximately US$ 560,000 of the GEF and SIDA will be returned to the financiers.
                         * The Ministry of Agriculture, trade, Forestry and Water Management (WATFWM), the implementing agency, has transferred the truck that had been procured for the rendering plant
                         Glutin, which later became non-operational, to the rendering plant Cuprija. The physical transfer will occur in May. The mission congratulated MATFWM for their swift handling of the
                         matter.
                         * The Secretariat for Environmental Protection of Vojvodina plans to continue groundwater quality monitoring in some or all of the 7 beneficiary farms where the Project stared such
                         monitoring, as part of their regular environmental monitoring program funded by the Environmental Protection Fund of Serbia.

                         * The Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report for the Project will be completed by June 30, 2011. It was agreed that MATFWM will provide the Bank with its Borrower
                         ICR by April 29. The Bank will share the draft ICR with MATFWM and SIDA for comments around May 15. The ICR will be finalized by June 30, 2011 and made available to the
