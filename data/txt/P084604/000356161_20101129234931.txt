     REPUBLIC OF SERBIA: THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF) GRANT
      FOR THE DANUBE RIVER ENTERPRISE POLLUTION REDUCTION PROJECT
                                (P084604)1
                GEF TRUST FUND GRANT AGREEMENT TF054908

                                                 AND

     SWEDISH GRANT FOR CO-FINANCING OF THE DANUBE RIVER ENTERPRISE
                     POLLUTION REDUCTION PROJECT
                  GRANT NUMBER TF056212 AND TF096289


1.      The Closing Dates for the above-referenced grants will be extended from
December 31, 2010 to April 30, 2011. The Government of Serbia (the Recipient)
requested the extensions through letters from the Minister of Finance dated October 16,
2010.

2.     A recent supervision mission found that implementation is satisfactory and
includes substantial compliance with the Agreements for the Project. Disbursement of TF
054908 is at 95.1 percent, of TF 056212 at 89.4 percent, and of TF096289 at 31.3
percent.

2.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow Serbia to use approximately US$
840,000 in uncommitted funds, which arose in part due to an exchange rate buffer that
implementing agency has retained. These funds would support additional public
awareness raising activities and nutrient management investments in about six farms.
These activities have high priority and are fully consistent with the original project
objectives and economically justified. The mission positively appraised the implementing
agency's action plan to implement these activities. The mission also agreed with the
implementing agency that the majority of contracts funded under these TFs will be signed
in US$ or Swedish Kronor (SEK), the currencies of the TFs to avoid the need to keep a
buffer against Euro/US$ and Euro/SEK fluctuations, respectively. Payment for any
goods, services, and works delivered or performed after the new Closing Date would be
the Government's responsibility.

3.        This will be the second and final extension of the project.
