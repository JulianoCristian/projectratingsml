 REPUBLIC OF SERBIA — THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF) TRUST
                         FUND GRANT FOR
          DANUBE RIVER ENTERPRISE POLLUTION REDUCTION
                         PROJECT (P084604)
            GEF TRUST FUND GRANT AGREEMENT TF054908




1.     Proceeds for Serbia: Danube River Enterprise Pollution Reduction Project GEF
Trust Fund Grant Agreement TF054908 will be reallocated as follows:

    Category of Expenditure             Allocation                % of Financing
      Current        Revised      Current        Revised       Current      Revised
(1) Goods, works,
consultants’
services, training
and incremental
operating costs         NA         4,220,000     4,000,000       89%            NA
(2) Nutrient
reduction sub-
grants                  NA         3,900,000     4,240,000      100%            NA
(3) Unallocated         NA           150,000             0
(4) Grants to
agricultural high-
schools                 NA           750,000       780,000      100%            NA
            TOTAL                  9,020,000     9,020,000


2.     The Project’s progress towards achieving its Development and Global
Environment Objective is satisfactory. At closing on April 30, 2011, the Project
will have exceeded Development and Global Environment Objectives. Notably,
the Project will have financed manure management investments on 105 livestock
farms compared with 60 planned farms. The annual decrease in the amount of
nutrients, which are not taken up by plants and eventually flow into watercourses
from Project beneficiary farms is conservatively estimated at 44% for nitrogen
and 100% for phosphorus compared to the baseline levels. Additionally, the
GEF Grant has funded manure management storage facilities and equipment,
and nutrient management curriculum development at six agricultural high-
schools, which is expected to have significant long-term replication impact by
exposing future farmers, agricultural advisors, and agro-industrial professionals

                                          1
to proper farms nutrient management practices. The GEF Grant has also
improved Serbia’s capacity to collect and process risky animal waste generated
at slaughterhouses and meat processing enterprises and thereby reduced the
likelihood of inappropriate dumping of these substances and resulting water
pollution.

3.      The proposed Reallocation is necessary to redirect grant proceeds that have not
yet been allocated or that are available for an activity that has already been completed,
toward a disbursement category that will allow the Recipient to successfully complete
Project activities and finalize payments.
