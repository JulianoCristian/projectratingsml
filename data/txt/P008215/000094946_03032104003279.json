outcome was unsatisfactory,\n            with an unlikely sustainability, though with modest\n            institutional development impacts, and, similarly, both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are deemed\n            unsatisfactory. Through the many lessons drawn from the\n            project, it is primarily specified that, given the\n            country's weak capacity to design, and implement a\n            complex health reform, it would have been preferable to\n            proceed with simplified, phased reforms, complemented by\n            management, and infrastructure improvements, rather than\n            preconditioning other components, on the successful\n            implementation of the policy analysis, and pilot\n            experimentation component. This could have reduced the risk\n            of costly delays, and, permitted the phased construction of\n            a policy framework to foster further institutional\n            development. Moreover, key indicators - increased coverage,\n            quality and efficiency - to measure basic outcomes, should\n            have been agreed at appraisal time, not as it turned out,\n            during implementation, when the focus is on the project\n            progress in the short-term, and not intended for the\n            long-term implementation efficiency, and impact evaluation.\n            Similarly, other lessons offer suggestions as for the\n            preparation (and careful supervision) of policy studies; for\n            project restructuring, provided changes in government\n            policy, and priorities so require to ensure relevance, and\n            impact; for the design of training programs, to include an\n            evaluation scheme, integral to the overall training program;\n            and, for the appropriate use of the Mid Term Review, in a\n            planned, strategic manner for efficient implementation,\n            impact evaluation, and if so needed, for restructuring the\n            scope, and content of the project."}, "docdt": "2003-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
