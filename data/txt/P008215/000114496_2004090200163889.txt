Re:
Loan No. 3823-VE (Health Services Reform Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Dr. Izaguirre:
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela (the Borrower) 
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated 
October 12, 1995, as amended.
We are pleased to inform you that, as requested by a letter from your Ministry 
dated June 30, 1998,  the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan Agreement, as follows:
(a)
by deleting the date “June 30, 1998” in the table in paragraph 1 of 
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement and replacing it by “December 31, 1998”; and
(b)
reallocating $7,000,000 from Category (2) to Category (1).  Therefore, 
the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 will read as per the attachment to this letter.
If you agree with the proposed amendments, please sign the confirmation form on 
this letter.  The amendments set forth in this letter shall enter into effect upon 
receipt by the Bank of a duly executed counterpart of this letter.
In view of their interest, we are sending a copy of this letter to the Minister 
of Health and Social Assistance, as well as the General Coordinator for the Project.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
