The project will help the Government to:\n            a) redefine key government health policies related to the\n            organization and financing of health services; b) promote\n            decentralization by building the capacity of the four states\n            and their respective health facilities; and c) enhance the\n            quality and efficiency of government health services by\n            rehabilitating plant and replacing basic equipment in\n            ambulatory clinics and hospitals. The project consists of\n            three components. The policy analysis and reform component\n            will support policy reform in the areas of: 1) hospital\n            autonomy; 2) rationalization of the service delivery model;\n            and 3) improved health financing. The institutional\n            development component will build capacity at the state level\n            to manage health care by providing in-service management\n            training to staff of state health directorates, district\n            health offices, hospitals and ambulatory clinics; by\n            developing systems for them to manage finances, human\n            resources, strategic planning, materials, maintenance,\n            waste, and health information; by providing computer support\n            and technical assistance. The strengthening of health\n            service delivery component will improve the quality and\n            efficiency of health services by rehabilitating ambulatory\n            clinics and hospitals and replacing and completing basic equipment."}, "docdt": "1994-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
