The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            irrigation systems has been substantial, sustainability is\n            likely with continued maintenance and repair, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, when co-financing\n            is arranged, the co-financier should be in full agreement on\n            concept, objectives, and focus of the project they support.\n            Second, to prevent the under-utilization of equipment\n            provided under co-financing arrangements, the Bank should\n            make sure that only specific project needs are satisfied and\n            adequate budgetary allocation is made for operating\n            expenses. Third, in order to permit meaningful agro-economic\n            evaluation, a baseline survey should be carried out before\n            project works start and monitoring should continue after\n            project completion. Fourth, to ensure that irrigation and\n            drainage systems produce acceptable agricultural benefits, a\n            continuing program of maintenance and repair is essential.\n            Fifth, techniques of system modernization developed by\n            foreign technical assistance should be tested under local\n            conditions before they are propagated. Lastly, to prevent\n            delays in the start of project works, field engineers should\n            receive instruction in the desired standard for selection\n            and preparation of schemes right from the beginning."}, "docdt": "1990-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
