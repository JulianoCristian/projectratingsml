The four projects were\n            a successful part of the early implementation of the RAP\n            strategy. However, they drifted away from this strategy and\n            did not achieve their projected results and impact. While\n            the projects had some worthwhile and widespread poverty\n            alleviation impact, they also provided large transfers of\n            public resources to some of the rural elite. The\n            institutional outcomes of the projects were not up to\n            expectations. While the sustainability of the improvements\n            made to watercourses under the projects is not in doubt, the\n            method of financing adopted, with its heavy reliance on\n            external aid and subsidies, is not sustainable. Even so, the\n            four projects were generally successful in achieving their\n            main physical objectives but the greater institutional and\n            social problems affecting system performance remain and may\n            have increased. Two major lessons can be learned from these\n            projects. First, there is a need for disaggregated\n            investment packages which are tailored closely to the\n            specific physical, social, and economic characteristics of\n            the very different areas within the system instead of broad\n            scale national projects. Lastly, there is a need for an\n            improved and independent analytical base on water sector\n            issues, routinely maintained in current status rather than\n            being periodically updated."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
