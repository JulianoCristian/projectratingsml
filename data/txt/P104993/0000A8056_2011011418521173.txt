                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program's objective is to mitigate the deterioration of basic services brought about by the inability of the Palestinian Authority to meet its budget
                         requirements by providing financing for non-salary operating expenditures in key social and service delivery sectors (Health, Education, Social Assistance and
                         Water, Sanatiation and Electricity).
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The electricity and fuel crisis has amplified the troubles that the Gaza population face, especially in view of the prolonged power cut which has reached its peak during the summer
                         - an average of 12 hours electricity cuts per day. This has negatively impacted vital sectors such as health and water. For instance, the Gaza population continued to suffer from
                         inadequate water supplies owing to power cuts and fuel shortages, raising concerns for public health. Hospitals scrambled to collect fuel to be able to function on electric generators
                         and drastically cut back on ambulance services and transportation for medical staff. Additionally, the Health authorities in Gaza announced that the constant electricity failure that the
                         health facilities are facing nowadays has potential fatal risks on patients, especially those in the Intensive Care Units, Neonatal Units, and Kidney Dialysis Units. In that effect, the
                         Emergency Services Support Program has been instrumental in providing a lifeline support to these key sectors. Funds have been allocated to cover fuel costs for the Ministry of
                         Health power generators, hospitals and clinics, as well as for the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility water wells and pumping stations. The Project Coordination Unit closely monitors
                         the situation of fuel shortages, supply and distribution. As part of its monitoring and oversight role, the Project Coordination Unit team accompanies the fuel vehicles during the
                         distribution process.
