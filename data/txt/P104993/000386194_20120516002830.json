"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Services\n            Support Project (ESSP) : Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for\n            West Bank and Gaza were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; grantee performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a fast\n            disbursing operation without any conditionality, reform\n            requirements, cumbersome procurement procedures, or explicit\n            capacity building component is an efficient and effective\n            vehicle for responding to emergency and crisis situations. A\n            multi-donor trust fund is a more suitable arrangement for\n            managing large donor-financed operations than single donor\n            trust funds. It reduces the burden on the Bank teams\n            administering the trust funds. Also, with donor resources\n            pooled in a single trust fund, it may be easier to entice\n            donors not to earmark their financing. Close supervision and\n            flexibility to respond to urgent needs and changing\n            requirements through reallocation of resources are important\n            to ensure that the program remains responsive to the\n            emergency situation. The project experience confirms that\n            under a complex emergency situation, it is beneficial to\n            have the Task Team based in the field. The Bank can mitigate\n            risks for its program by having the external auditor carry\n            out spot checks of activities financed by the grant. These\n            spot checks are particularly useful in monitoring physical\n            implementation of the project and in verifying that funds\n            are spent for the purpose intended and in accordance with\n            Bank rules. The ESSP approach of providing targeted\n            emergency budget support is more appropriate than the\n            alternative of general budget support to ensure that\n            essential services continue to receive their share of scarce\n            resources. In a multi-donor trust fund arrangement, Bank\n            management has an important role to play in managing\n            expectations of individual donors, in order to reduce the\n            stress on the Bank Task Team and enable them to concentrate\n            on project implementation support. The Bank must take great\n            care to ensure that the recipient complies with both the\n            Bank's and the recipient's financial management\n            control mechanisms and guidelines to avoid potential misuse\n            of funds."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
