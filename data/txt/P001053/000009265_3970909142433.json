"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Forestry and\n            Fisheries Management Project for Guinea was unsatisfactory.\n            The project only achieved some of its objectives, its impact\n            on institutional development has been significant,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of the both\n            the Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, a\n            project's scope and implementing mechanisms must be\n            tailored to the Borrower's design and planning\n            capabilities, and the Borrower, as well as the ultimate\n            beneficiaries, must really want the project and be closely\n            involved in its preparation. Second, proper project\n            management must be available before project start-up and\n            assured at all times. Sound management is key, from the\n            design stage through implementation, to the very achievement\n            of project objectives. Third, forest management, including\n            conservation, cannot be addressed in isolation of the\n            management of surrounding areas. Finally, regarding\n            fisheries, the issue of dramatically diminishing resources\n            must be at the center of any operation in this sector and\n            geographic area."}, "docdt": "1997-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
