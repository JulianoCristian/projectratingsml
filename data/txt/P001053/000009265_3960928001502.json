           and Fisheries Management Project will be to assist the\n            government in establishing operational institutions and\n            systems for managing foresty and fisheries resources through\n            management support and training.  First, work plans will be\n            prepared for forestry protection and management with a view\n            to a) reducing deterioration and regenerating the humid and\n            dry forests, b) increasing wood product self-sufficiency, c)\n            creating employment in forest industries, and d) increasing\n            government revenues from commercial use of forests. To\n            protect the humid forests from encroachment, an inventory of\n            land rights will be undertaken, as a pilot operation.\n            Second, an integrated fisheries management system will be\n            introduced, aimed at a) protecting fisheries resources, b)\n            strengthening and implementing transparent licensing\n            procedures for industrial fisheries, c) maintaining a\n            sustainable yield, and d) increasing government revenues.\n            The project will comprise three major components : the\n            protection and management of the natural forests (humid and\n            dry), a pilot operation aimed at registering land rights in\n            the humid forest, and the management of offshore fisheries."}, "docdt": "1989-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
