The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, institutional development was\n            partially achieved, sustainability is uncertain at this\n            time, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, project design should be results oriented.\n            Second, project design and implementation should focus more\n            explicitly on measures to ensure sustainability. Third,\n            communication both up and down implementing agency staff\n            levels and responsible responses by staff reflecting\n            understanding and accountability of their actions is\n            essential for iterative identification and solving of\n            problems, and other forms of adaptive management. Fourth,\n            technical assistance contracts should be ready for signing\n            as a condition of negotiations. Fifth, organizational reform\n            is risky. Wide-reaching reorganization requires careful\n            analysis of power structures and personality relationships\n            and their potential impact on implementation. Finally,\n            forest development planning and implementation should be\n            site specific, and take into consideration technical\n            expertise, environmental factors, views of local people, and\n            market prospects."}, "docdt": "1998-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
