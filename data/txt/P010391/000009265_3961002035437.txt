MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO 7HE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR A WEST BENGAL FORESTRY PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
zecommendation on a proposed credit to India for SDR 24.4 million (US$ 34.0
million equivalent) to help finance a West Bengal Forestry project. The
credit wculd be at standard IDA texms with 35 years maturity. The funds would
be onlent from GOI to GOWB as part of central assistance to the state for
development projects on terms and conditions applicable at the time.
2.               Secntxy1Stor Background.  Forestry is very important for village
economies and pressure on forest lands is high. India's forest resources
cover 64 million ha or about 19% of the country's land area. Due to their
considerable geographical extension and the large number of people depending
on them, forest resources play an important role in the conservation of
environmental quality, the welfare of the rural poor and the productivity of
agricultural lands. Forests are the main source of household energy in India
r.nd by far the main depositories of genetic diversity. The average forest
stock is about half and the annual production of wood one quarter of world per
ha averages. While India's forests are relatively rich in flora and fauna,
these resources are rapidly declining due to pressure from local population,
cattle and theft. About 90% of wood demand is for fuelwood. Forests are also
a main source for fodder and non-wood forest products (NWFP), such as oils,
medicinal plants, silk, resins, dyes, fibers and leaves.  About 75% of India's
population live in rural areas, and many, particularly women, are employed in
forestry or collection of NWFE.
3.       The Government is addressing deforestation through legal means and
afforestation programs. The National Forest Policy was revised in 1988 to
ensure environmental stability and maintenance of ecological balance. The
Policy advocates increasing tree cover and use of forest areas to meet
requirements of rural and tribal populations for fuelwood, fodder, and NWFP,
while industries as far as possible are to arrange for raw materials from farm
forestry. In an attenpt to force forest departments to pay attention to
social concerns, the policy focusses heavily on such issues. The unfortunate
result has been that commercial and economic considerations have not been
realistically integrated with social goals. Forestry is a priority in the
draft Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97). Key issues are to: develop forest
management approaches based on local participation (joint management);
improve the efficiency of state forest departments and allow a larger role to
the private sector in forest development; improve forest research and
technology; and to modify/adopt legislation to improve incentives for farm
forestry and joint management.
4.       West Bengal State has considerably fewer forest resources than the
per capita average in India. The state can be divided in five agro-ecological
zones of which all except the central alluvial tract have forest resources.
Only 70% of the designated forest areas contain actual forest cover and over
one-third are open forests with a crown density of less than 40%. About
150,000 ha of farm forestry plus strip plantations and some woodlots were



developed in West Bengal during the 19808 wi;.h IDA assistance. The group farm
forestry approach taken proved highly successful as did the support to
regeneration ot forests in southwest Bengal through village based forest
protection committees (FPC). There is significant further scope to
regenerate/afforest degraded forest areas and to expand farm forest coverage.
5.       L     aS6nR Learned from Previous Bank operationa. Problems of a general
nature in forestry projects include: delays in project mobilization;
institutional weaknesses; and inadequate local funding. The major Jesson from
projects in India is that it is time to move to a more comprehensive approach
to the sector, based on indepth country and site specific sector analysis. The
IDA-supported West Bengal Social Forestry Credit (Cr. 1178-IN), was approved
in 1981 for SDR 25.8 million (US$29 million equivalent) and closed in March
1991. Project experience demonstrated that there is need to: give more
attention to research and plant propagation, training, extension, operational
direction, monitoring, and local participati^n in planning and management of
plantations; work. out benefit sharing arrangements in advance; and include
more species in plantations. Attempts to involve people in the protection of
village woodlots through the local gcvernment did not work.
6.       Rationale for Bank Tnvolygmernt.  The strategy for Bank assistance to
the agricultural sector in India is to support policies and investments that
promote economic growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic
restructuring. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased
efficiency in the public sector and appropriate targeting and delivery of
support systems to the poor. The proposed project fits well within that
framework. It also fits well with the objectives of the Bank's forest policy
and with the Asia Region's strategy for forestry lending which emphasizes an
ongoing policy dialogue with borrowers concerning key forestry issues coupled
with investment in afforestation. A state by state forestry approach is
advocated for India which parallels current strategy for statewide
cgricultural and irrigation development projects. The project follows India's
sorest policy and addresses forestry issues in West Bengal.
7.       Proje±t QOjectives.  The project's main objective is to support
GOWB's forestry development program. The key in West Bengal, as in most of
India, is to prevent continuing degradation of forest lands since all other
forestry policy objectives ultimately depend on this. The project aims to
install a sustainable protection system in all regions of the state, and to
enhance forest productivity and conserve biodiversity.
8.       PrE;   gt nlgscgrip2tin.  The project would support forest regeneration
and plantation on 208,000 ha of new areas plus an additional 82,000 ha of
lands wtiich the Forest Department has started to develop.  The main strategy
is to protect forest areas by working with local communities based on
experience in the southwest which would be adapted. The successful group
approach would be followed for farm forestry where contiguo.  areas are
involved. A start would be made in addressing the serious overgrazing
problem. Project design emphasizes improving the organizational efficiency of
the Forest Department through redeployment of manpower resources, training,
and development of a suitable MIS; and improving research and technology.
One-third of works expenditures are earmarked for the vulnerable boundaries of
Wildlife Protected Areas. The main components are as follows: (a) forest
regeneration and afforestation; (b) supporting works (roads, watershed works);
(c) special action programs in areas of particular concern (research,



- 3 -
training, joint management, wildlife, and mangroves); (d) service support tor
the FD; and (e) fodder development.
9.       ErQjec t    lentatiM. The p-oposed project would be carried out
by the West Bengal Forest Department and Animal Resources Development
Department. The project cost is estimated at US$39.0 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$2.4 million equivalent (6.2%) and taxes and
duties estimated at about US$1.2 million equivalent. IDA would finance SDR
24.4 million (US$34.0 million equivalent, 100% of the foreign exchange and 87%
of the total). Retroactive financing is provided, up to an amount of SDR 2.4
million (US$3.4 million equivalent) for project expenditures incurred from
July 1, 1991, to get a head start on project works and take advantage of the
planting season which begins in July. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of precurement
and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.10011-IN, dated February 25,
1992, is being distributed separately.
10.      Sustainability.  The project would be sustainable after IDA funding
ends. Most afforestation investments would have been completed and the
maintenance requirements (thinning, etc.) would easily be met from state
resources. The project includes limited incremental staff who would be funded
on a declining basis by IDA during project implementation and subsequently be
carried fully on the state budget.  The concept of managing public forests
jointly with local populations ensures that plantations created under the
project would have a good chance of long-term survival and high productivity.
Xnstitutional changes would be made to support the joint management system.
11.      Aurand Actions.  The main assurances obtained from GOWB during
negotiations are summarized as follows: (a) the Forest Department would
reorganize as per the government order and action plan; (b) consultants would
be hired to design a research program which would be discussed with IDA, and
research staff would remain in post at least five years; (c) staff trained
overseas would have at least five years to retirement and remain posted in
areas for which they have been trained at least three years; (d) agreed
forestry treatments and improved nursery practices would be followed; (e) TOR
for studies would be submitted to IDA for comment; (f) all seedlinqs would be
priced and prices would be increased each year to reach full cost recovery by
the end of the project period; (g) benefit sharing arrangements for forest
areas would not be changed without prior IDA approval; (h) GOWB would adopt
all appropriate means to promote farm forestry in the state; (i) GOWS would
obtain all clearances and approvals as may be required from GOI to carry out
its actions under the project; and (j) semi-annual progress reports would be
submitted to IDA and a mid-term review would be undertaken by September 1994.
12.      Environmental Aspects. The project would be very beneficial for the
environment. It is heavily oriented towards environmental improvement through
community based protection of forest area,. Specific proposals for wildlife
and biodiversity are also included. Forestry management/works practices in
West Bengal have been reviewed and found to follow environmentally sound
principles. The protection of any forest land wil-. depend much more on a
contented fringe population than on legal prescriptions. The forestry models
have been designed to accommodate factors that would foster a strong community



stake in forest protection. The models include a mix of trees, bushes and
grasses and would improve the environmental sustainablity of treated lands.
13.      Institutional IMpact.  The project would foster a major change in
forest policy from enforced protection to cooperation with local communities.
The state is strongly committed to this change which is based on experience
from the southwest that has attracted interest from within and outside of the
country. Moves towards a restructuring of the Forest Department organizat3on
to respond to the challenges ahead are already underway. An added
institutional feature is the start of a coordinated fodder program involving
the Forest Department and the Animal Resources Development Department.
14.      I=art on Women.  Women are the predominant collectors of fodder,
fuelwood and NWFPs and would benefit considerably from the project. The
forestry models and felling regimes proposed would significantly enhance
availability of the forest products which women collect to provide household
subsistence and secondary income. One forestry treatment, Arjun planting for
tasar 3ilk cultivation, has been set aside for women. Effective participation
of women in joint management of forests would be critical to reduce illicit
removals. NGOs would be responsible for ensur-ng that the efforts to mobilize
women have effective support in the initial years. The provisions for
household membership in FPCs would be revised to include women as full members
and women's subcommittees would be established for managing NWFEs. The
efforts to incorporate women in all aspects of the project would be supported
by a new FD hiring policy to encourage recruitment of women as forest guards,
foresters, and range officers - currently staffed 100% by men.
15.      Project Benefita.  The project would bring about 290,000 ha of
degraded forest and uncultivated land under sustainable management.
Approximately 400,000 households should receive direct benefits from the
project. The annual value of FPC benefits should average between 10-30% of
annual household income (a sample survey in southwest Bengal found mean
returns of Rs. 2,815 per household). women would be the principal
beneficiaries and scheduled castes and tribes would constitute over 30% of
beneficiaries. About 33.8 million person days of employment would be
generated in plantation establishment, a benefit which is almost wholly
captured by the poorest and landless households. Processors and marketers of
wood and NWFPs would benefit through increased supply of raw material. The
economic rate of return for the project as a whole has been estimated at 20%
over 30 years. The ERR is only moderately sensitive to changes in the cost
and benefit streams.
16.      Riaka.  Technical risks are not high although marketing risks remain
an area of concern. A significant downturn in market prices could discourage
farm households from replanting and FPCs from providing adequate protection.
This could only occur as a consequence of otherwise successful development and
should be judged in that context. The principal risks are that FPC joint
management in southwest Bengal proves unsuccessful in the longer term, and
failure to install effective modes of joint management of the state. The
without project scenario would almost certainly lead to continuous
deforestation and land degradation.



17.      Recommendat       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
