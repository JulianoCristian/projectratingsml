development objective of the Second\n            Public Sector Performance Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            Project for Mauritius is to support improvements in the\n            performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting\n            the government to implement reforms within the following\n            three pillars: 1) strengthening programs that support and\n            empower the most vulnerable; 2) streamlining trade\n            regulations and processes; and 3) improving human resource\n            management in the civil service and the monitoring of\n            State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) performance. The Government of\n            Mauritius continues to diversify the economy to enable the\n            country to achieve a higher income status in the medium\n            term. Since independence in 1968, economic growth in\n            Mauritius has been built on a long tradition of economic and\n            institutional reforms. This DPL series supports the\n            strengthening of the institutional, policy, and management\n            tools required to address some of the challenges posed by\n            these reforms. The fiscal position is improving, and the\n            government achieved greater debt consolidation in 2012 than\n            had originally been expected."}, "docdt": "2013-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
