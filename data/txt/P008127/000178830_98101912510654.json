promotion and\n            formulation capacity within participating private\n            intermediary banks; and (c) provide technical assistance to\n            the main appraisal unit under the proposed project (UA) and\n            to industrial borrowers to improve their production,\n            technology, and managerial efficiency. The project would\n            help the country improve the international competitiveness\n            of its industrial and tourism enterprises within the\n            framework of its import liberalization policies. The project\n            is expected to have a significant development impact through\n            industrial growth, foreign exchange earnings and savings,\n            employment generation and institutional improvements."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
