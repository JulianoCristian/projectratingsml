SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1930-UR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completlon Report (PCR) for the Second Indus-
trial Credit Project in Uruguay, for which Loan 1930-UR in the amount of
US$30 million equivalent was approved on November 16, 1980. Project imple-
mentation took place during a period marked by a deep economic recession both
on the domestic and international level which was accompanied by the Latin
American debt crisis.   The Closing Date was postponed by two years to
December 1987.   A total of US$16.3 million was cancelled under the Loan,
mostly reflecting the uncommitted portion of the Loan and some committed
funds which were later not required by the Borrower.
The PCR was prepared by the Trade, Finance, and Industry Division,
Country Department IV, ef the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Sxmuary, Parts I and III). Preparation of Part TI was
requested from the Tsorrower on February 7, 1990; however, given the time
elapsed since the closing of the Loan and the fact that many of the Bor-
rower's staff involved in managing the project have moved to new assignments,
the Part II was not completed.
Preparation of this PCR was started in February 1990 and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal and President's Reports; the Loan Agree-
ment; supervision rotports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
and internal Bank memoranda.

SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1930-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARsY
Objectives
1.      The project was expected to have a significant developmental impact
by improving resource allocation and productive efficiency with an emphasis
on an export-oriented growth strategy (para. 1.03).   It was designed to
encourage and support the Government's Tariff Reduction Program (TRP, decree
736/978) which became effective January 1, 1980.  This was to be achieved
through a US$30 million loan to the Republica Oriental del Uruguay to:
(i) finance productive industrial, agro-industrial and tourism investments
within the framework of Uruguay's import liberalization policies to improve
the international competitiveness of Uruguayan industrial and tourism enter-
prises; (ii) help establish project promotion and formulation capacity within
participating private intermediary banks; and (iii) provide technical
assistance to the main appraisal unit under the proposed proctct (UA) along
with industrial borrowers to improve their operational, t-''Aological, and
managerial efficiency (para. 1.04).
fmplementa.ion and Results
2.       Institutional Arrangements.  The Bank accepted the organizational
set-up of the First Industrial Credit loan as follows: (a) the Centr 1. Bank's
Fund for Developing Investment Financing (PPID) through its subfund for
Industrial Development (IDF; established under this project) was responsible
for channeling loan funds through intermediating banks; and (b) Unidad
Asesora (UA) under the Ministry of Industry and Energy was responsible for
appraising and supervising projects under the loan. This arrangement created
significant problems in managing the project (para. 1.13).
3.       Credit COmDonents.  The most critical shortfalls in actual versus
planned implementation were in the slow use of funds and the poor quality of
the subprojects approved. The commitment date expired on June 30, 1984 with
a postponement to June 30, 1985 while the Loan Closing Date was postponed by
two years to December 31, 1987 (para. 1.17). Main reasons for the slow rate
of commitments and disbursements of this project are: (a) Institutional -
(i) long lags for intermediating banks to identify and present export-
oriented subprojects to UA; (li) long evaluation periods by UAI and (iii) the
political uncertainty that preceded the November 1984 elections which led
companies to delay execution of their projects; and (b) Economic - (i) the
loan became effective at the onset of Uruguay's deep recession (real indus-
trial GDP decreased 4.61 in 1981 and 23.51 in 1982); (ii) the overvaluation
of the peso from October 1979 to November 1982 decreased competitiveness of



- iv -
export-oriented indusvrial firms -- the core of the project pipeline; and
(iii) the worldwide economic recession affected Uruguay's export markets, in
particular Argentina and Brazil (para. 1.18).
4.       Cost and Financing.  Financial intermediaries for investment credit
were expected to finance up to 80S of total investment costs and were allowed
to refinance up to 100l of their financing with the IDF. Tot#Al project cost
was estimated at US$66.14 million with the Bank Loan expected to finance
about 45Z. A Guarantee Fund which had been established by the BCU under the
First Industrial Credit Loan was continued for the Second Industrial Credit
Loan.   It covered 75X of the subloan amount to the participating interme-
diaries in case of default by final borrowers (para. 1.08).
5.       The project did not fulfill its objectives.  It had been estimated
during design that 65-80 suoprojects would be generated for a total cost of
US$65.39 million, out of which US$29 million were to be financed by the Loan,
generating employment for about 3,200 workers. Instead, only 10 subprojects
were financed for a total cost of US$49 million, with US$13.2 million dis-
bursed under the Loan, creating employment for only 387 workers. Performance
of the project portfolio was not successful either: 6 of the subloans were in
arrears as of April 1, 1990, with the total amount in arrears at US$5.01
million (see Annex 2). These subloans correspond to projects which had dif-
ficulties of various natures including reduced markets, low productivity and
quality of products, and management problems (paras. 1.20-1.22).
6.       Technical Assistance.   The Supervision Mission Reports failed to
provide information on the progress of the Technical Assistance component of
the Loan aside from the portion allocated to the Tariff Reform Study. The
deadline for Loan Agreement Effectiveness was postponed nearly one year due
to the delay in hiring consultants for the Tariff Reform Study. It became
effective March 22, 1982.   The study, completed in July 1983, was of un-
usually high quality in terms of its broad scope but it was based on 1981
data and did not take into account the significant changes caused by the
major devaluation which occurred in 1982. An agreement was reached with the
outgoing Government to update the study, but it was deferred due to the
proximity of the elections (November 1984). The new Government indicated a
willingness to undertake such updating, which was completed only in 1986
(para. 1.19).
7.       Status of Covenants.   Compliance with the covenants was achieved
with major delays, except for a joint review with the Bank on the conclusions
of the Tariff Reform Study which did not take place. The Bank waived the
latter condition considering the scarcity of alternative long-term financing
(para. 1.24).
Sustainabilitv
8.       Given the failure of most subprojects, there are no expected net
benefits that would be sustained (para. 1.27).
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.       Prolect Design.  The project has shown the importance to establish
an adequate counterpart, responsible for ovarall coordination and with full



accos. to pertinent lnformation.  This was not the cose in this project,
since UV was given responsibility to appraise and supervise the projectsp
whoreas BCU, through its IDF *ubfund, had direct contact with the financial
Intermediaries.   Due to the inadoquate coordination between both institu-
tions, information necessary to follov-up on the project wae not readily
avallablo, which made it difficult for the Bank to eercise its judgement on
the status of the subprojects throughout their lmplementation (para. 1.34).
10.      Implamentation.   The Bank did not exercise enough diligence
regarding project implementation.  It was too lenient with the Government
concerning the fulfillment of caienents under the loan.  In spite of bad
performance by most *ubloans, the Bank agreed to postpone both comimtment and
Closing Dates without undertaking an in-depth analysis of the project's
situation and prospects (para. .35).

B. Backitround
1.02    Following the severe balance of payment probloms, high rate of
inflation, and the deteriorating fiscal situation of the early seventies, the
Government shifted its economic policies (beginning in 1974), giving top
priority to stabilization. In order to incesase the International compoti-
tireness of induetrial and tourism enterprises the Government Instituted
import liberalization policies that placed greater reliance on the price
mechanism. The appraisal mission noted that from 1974 through the tim of
appraisal (November 1980), the Government encouraged private investment and
non-traditional exports and made improvements in public finances and the
financial system.  This reorientation resulted in:  (i) increased output,
employment, and investment; (ii) a favorable balance of payments situation
with a sharp increace in reserves; and (III) an improved fiscal situation.
Although improvements vere made in these areas, high inflation continued to
be a problem (60S during 1976-79 and a reduction from 832 in 1979 to 502 by
the end of the third quarter of 1980). In 1979 economic growth of 8.42 was
the highest in 33 years.  The appraisal mission concluded that the high
growth rate was largely the result of a strong demand by Argentinian
inveators and tourists for relatively low-cost Uruguayan goods and fixed
assets (mostly real estate), which also led to an acceleration of domestic
inflation. With the appreciation of the peso in real terms (on an export
weighted basis) by 142 in 1979 Uruguay moved from being a relatively low cost
market to a moderately high one.
1.03    The project was oxpected to have a significant developmental impact
by Improving resource allocation and productive efficiency with emphasi on
an export-oriented growth strategy. It was desipned to encourage and support
the Government's Tariff Reduction Program (TRP, decree 7361978) which beame
effective January 1, 1980. Under the TRP all import charges of a tax nature



-2-
were to be reduced over a five year period to a uniform level of 35S by the
end of fifth year.  The credit component was to assist Industrial firms to
become internationally competitive by providing long-term financing for
equipment modernization and replacement, and to expand their capacity to
supply domestic and internation-al markets.
1.04     A First Industrial Credit Loan (Loan 1176-UR) for US$35 million had
been approved on December 1975 to support the Government in its economic
reform program in the areas of industrial development and export expansion.
The Loan initially had three components:  an imported capital component of
US$24.5 million, a medium and long-term investment component of US$10.0 mil-
lion, and a technical assistance component of US$0.5 million. The imported
capital component was cancelled due to the existence of a competing line, and
US$10.3 million were transferred to the investment component.  In spite of
the difficulties and slowness in the initial stages of implementation of the
investment component, it was successfully completed and its objectives of
contributing to the modernization and expansion of the exporting industrial
sector were achieved.   Under this component, 38 subprojects were financed,
with profitability (net income/total sales) satisfactory in all but 8 enter-
prises.   The technical assistance component was utilized to provide the
"Unidad Asesora" (UA), the main appraisal unit of the Government, with short
term experts in order to improve its capabilities, and to finance consultants
to assist the Government in its trade liberalization program.  In order to
administer the Project, a Coordinating Committee assumed the functions of a
Board of Directors, the UA the functions of the Project Appraisal Unit and
the Fund for Investment Development Financing (FFID) within the Central Bank,
the functions of the Financial Resources Department. Although coordination
problems were found under this arrangement, the Bank considered that a more
detailed preparation of the Project could. have helped resolve such problems
(Project Performance Audit Report No. 4860 for Loan 1176-UR, December 30,
1983).
C. Proiect Obiectives and Description
1.05     The project consisted of a US$30 million Loan to the Republica
Oriental del Uruguay.  The main objectives were to:  (i) finance productive
industrial, agro-industrial and tourism investments within the framework of
Uruguay's import liberalization policies to Improve the international com-
petitiveness of Uruguayan industrial and tourism enterprises; (1i) help
establish project promotion and formulation capacity within participating
private intermediary banks; and (iii) provide technical assistance to the
main appraisal unit (UA) under the proposed project along with industrial
borrowers to improve their production, technology, and managerial efficiency.
1.06     Components of the Loan were:
(a) US$29.45 million for investment credit, and
(b) US$0.55 million for financing  -. nical assistance to the
Government.
1.07     The Bank Loan bore a fixed 9.252 annual interest rate plus a 0.752
commitment fee on undisbursed loan balances borne by the intermediaries. The



-3-
loan vas repayable over a maximum of 12 yearp, at a fixed asmortization
schedule. Resources of the credit component were possed on by the Government
to the Central Bank'a Industrial Development Fund (IDF), established as a
sub-fund within the Fund for Development Investment Financing (PhID), for
onlending through commercial banks and cacas bancarias to industrial and
tourism projects. The Government absorbed the foreign exchange risk between
the various currencies and the US dollar or the local currency, depending on
whether sub%.ans were expressed in US dollars or pesos, as well as risks
associated with any decline of LIBOR below the Bank rate. Interest rates In
Uruguay had been positive in real terms between 1976 and 1978 with an average
of 62, but a surge in inflation In 1979 resulted in a real interest rate of
-16S mainly as a result of US dollar denominated loans combined with slow
devaluation. In 1979, the spread on foreign loans had averaged 61 p.c. and
on peso loans 241 p.a. (clois to 61 in dollars plus a 201 devaluation), but
competition was expected to reduce spreads in dollars to around 3-41. Taking
into consideration these conditions and in order to allow industrial
borrowers to accommodate their expectations of inflation and devaluation,
funds under the project were made available out of the IDF to financial
intermediaries in two different ways:   (a) in US dollars at a floating
interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 12, and (b) in pesos subject to indexation
of principal based on domestic inflation with a 0.52 interest rate. In all
cases, a 0.751 commitment fee on undisbureed amounts was charged by BCU to
intermediaries. Final interest rates to subborrowers were freely negotiated
between intermediaries and the subborrowers to ensure market rates as well as
adequate spreads to intermediaries. Repayments for all subloans were to be
made semi-annually, with LIBOR estimated as the arithmetic average rates
outstanding on the last 30 days prior to the payment date.  IDF-loans and
subloans expressed in local currency were to be subject to indexation of
principal based on changes in the wholesale price index as published by the
Central Bank. Interest on subloans and TDF-loans due at the end of a six-
month period was calculated upon the adjusted principal outstanding.  The
principal was adjusted at the end of each period, by using the change in the
price index during the period but permitting a lag of two months to allow
sufficient time for the publication of the price index by the Central Bank.
i.08     Credit was made available through three types of subloans for indus-
trial and tourism enterprisess (a) oroiect investment financing, up to US$4
million of cumulative Bank lending per borrowing enterprise (with maturities
between 4 and 10 years, including grace periods of up to 3 years); (b) tech-
nical and manaaement consultint financing, up to US$80,000 equivalent per
borrowing enterprise (with maturities between 3 and 5 years, including a
grace period of up to 1 year); and (c) gre-inveatment financint, under the
same limits and terms as in (b). The "free limit" 'below which the Bank would
not review UA's appraisals was set at US$500,000 equivalent. Under the tech-
nical assistance component of US$550,000, up to US$350,000 was made available
fort (a) UA to hire consultants in project promotion and analysis; (b) UA to
hire short-term consultants for sectoral and market analyses, procurement
matters and technical analyses for specific subprojects as necessary; (c) to
cover the Government's counterpart contribution for 1981 for the foreign
exchange costs of the UNDP Industrial Investment Promotion Project; and (d)
to cover foreign travel expenditures related to training of UA staff; and
US$200,000 to finance the Tariff Reform Study as required by the Loan
Agreement.

1.09     o9t and Ilnancint.  Flacncial lntermediaries were expected to
finmace up to 802 of total Investment credit costs, with borrowers moeting
the remaining costs with their amn funds.  linancial intermediaries wer
allownd to refinance up to 100S of their total financing for Individual sub-
projects with the ID. Total project cost was estimated at US$66.14 million,
with the Bank Loan expected to finance about 452 of total project cost, cor-
responding to about 652 of the foreign exchange component. A Guarantoe Fund
(OF) established by the BCU undor the Bank'. First Industrial Credit Loan wvs
continued for the Second Industrial Credit Loan. The Fund covered 752 of the
subloan amount to the participating Intermediaries in case of default by
final borrower.  The Bank and BCU agreed on tho need for maintaining this
fund in order to continue inducing financial intormediaries to engage in
long-term operations. Under tho First Industrial Credit Loan the experience
of the Of had been satisfactory with only one subloan defaulting under the
System.
1.10     IDP Resources. IDF resources Initially amounted to US$52.2 million,
with the following componentst   (a) US$4.75 million originating from the
Goverrment and the BCU's original counterpart contributions of US$2.25 mil-
lion to the AID agro-industrial loan, and U1$2.S million to the IBRD'o First
Industrial Credit Loan; (b) US$29.45 million from resources from this
project; and (c) US$18 million from the Bank of America c-edit line origi-
nating from a loan of US$85 million (disburaed on October 3, 1978) at an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25S for 10-1/2 years, including 4 years of
grace. Loan recoveries, plus interest and fees income, were to be used to
service the Borrower's or Central Bank'os 1D-related debt.  The remaining
balances were to finance further Investment projects. The Central Bank was
to ensure that IDF's equity value be maintained in real terms and protected
from a possible devaluation of the Urugusyan peso. IDJis cash resources were
to be maintained in convertible foreign currencies or in securities expressed
in the same currencies.
1.11     Effective January 1, 1986 the Bank amended the Loan Agreement to
permit a Special Account in the BCU amounting to US$3 million equivalant, to
be maintained in US dollars, for the purposes of Loan 1930-UR. The purpose
was to give the BCU immediate reimbursements for eligible expenditures under
the project.
D. Project Deelsn and Orranization
1.12     Loan Components.  The design of the project was based on previous
experience with the First Industrial Credit Loan, in which its first com-
ponent, to finance imported inputs for exporters, had not been successful,
while its second component, to finance industrial export subprojects, met
with 4 large number of requests which led to a reassigning of funds from the
first into the second component (para. 1.04). Based on these results, the
major component for the Second Industrial Credit Project consisted of a
credit line for project financing. The technical assistance components were
justified because they provided financing for a study on trade liberalization
progress--a major concern under the project--and for enhancing Goveroment's
capabilities in project promotion and formulation, which was important-to
improve the effectiveness of the line of credit.

1.13     Loan Justification.  Conceptually, the project was well designed in
terms of its objectives.  The liberalization of impo ts together with the
expectation that the economy would continue to grow, seemed to justify the
need for long term financing necesseary to support transforming an inefficient
industrial sector into a more efficient, export oriented and dynamic sector.
1.14     Institutional Arrangements.   The Bank accepted the organizational
set-up which corresponded to the division of responsibilities In Uruguay,
with the Central Bank administering financial resources and the Ministry of
Industry and Energy (MIE) in charge of industrial policy. Due to satisfac-
tory experience with the FPID under the First Industrial Credit loan, this
fund was also employed to channel funds to financial intermediaries for the
Second Industrial Credit Loan. However, an Industrial Development Fund (IDF)
wae established as a sub-fund within FPID in order to establish operating
policies and procedures for managing the Loan that would be satisfactory to
the Bank.  The evaluation and approval mechanism was also streamlined and
reinforced:   the technical unit in charge of project appraisal (PAT) and
Unidad Asesora (UA), the promotion unit, were reorganized into UA (within the
Ministry) which was made solely responsible for appraising and supervising
projects under the Loan, while promotion and formulation of projects fell
mostly on the financial intermediaries. The main problem with these arrange-
ments as it turned out was that none of these institutions assumed, in prac-
tice, overall responsibility for the loan (para. 1.29).
1.15     Scale of the Progect.  The Loan amount of US$30 million was estab-
lished based on the following premises:   (a) over US$20 million had been
committed for the financing of 30 subprojects under the First Industrial
Credit Loans (b) a survey by HIE (requested by the Bank) covering 99 medium
to large industrial firms indicated that they planned to invest over US$200
million during 1980-825 (c) apart from an US$18 million line of credit from
Bank of America also to be administered by TDF, there was little additional
long term financing as commercial banks engaged preferentially in short term
credit operations; (d) the interest rates that were to reach the subborrocers
under the loan (LIBOR plus about a 3-4Z spread) seemed to be in line with
interest rates prevailing in the banking systems and (e) it was forecast that
the behavior of the economy would be a continuation of that xpeorienced In
the recent past, and that the industrial sector had reasonable good prospects
as long as it undertook important investment programs to modernize and
improve efficiency (as considered under the Loan).
1.16    Main Shortcominas.  As Indicated above; the project was designed to
make extensive use of past experience, building upon and improving existing
Institutions but also accepting major faults in design which had not affected
significantly the performance of the First Industrial Credit Loan at a time
when the economic situation of Uruguay had been good. The loss of dynamizing
of manufacturing activity during the early 1980s, due to overvaluation of the
peso and the fall in domestic demand, traumatized the system. The division
of responsibilities between UA and IDF deterred (para. 1.14) the supply of
adequate lformation to the Bank for subproject approval and subsequent
supervision and thus the impact of the crisis on the industrial creditors was
not understood in all its magnitude.  Another shortcoming was tuat the



Project design allowed for minimization of risk taking by financial interme-
diaries since these were covered by the Guarantee Fund (para. 1.09). Thus,
there were no strong incentives to financisl intermediaries for a prudent
assessment of the subprojects.
E. Prolect Implementation
1.17     The Loan was signed on January 19, 1981.  Loan effectivenese was
postponed six times from the initial planned appraisal date of April 15, 1981
to the actual date of March 22, 1982.   These postponements were due to:
(i) delays in reorganizing UA satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) delays in the
submission of legal documents establish tg the Industrial and Tourism
Development Sub-Fund within BCU; and (iii) delays by the Government in hiring
consultants, satisfactory to the Bank, for the Tariff Reform Study. The last
mentioned of all the factors took the longest time to fulfill as in addition
to delays by the Government in complying with the above policy conditions,
the Bank had rejected the Government's initial bid to hire consultants (memo
9/28/81), approving a second bid in March 22, 1982 which the Bank established
as the effective date of the Loan.
1.18     At appraisal, it had been estimated that the first disbursement of
the Loan would be made in fiscal year 1982 and that the funds would be fully
disbursed by end of fiscal year 1985. However, the pace of commitments and
disbursements was slower due to the deep Uruguayan economic recession, which
the Bank recognized, extending the commitment period by one year to June 30,
1985.  By this date commitments totalled US$19.3 million (65Z of the Loan)
and disbursements amounted to US$8 million (272 of the loan). On January 22,
1986 Closing Date for the Loan was postponed by one year to December 31,
1986.   The Closing Date was extended a second year to December 31, 1987.
Effective November A, 1986 the unwithdrawn amount of US$14,712,694.17 (492 of
the Loan) was cancelled from the Loan including some undisbursed amounts
which were not to be used because the subprojects had been completed or
modified.   The Borrower also refunded the unused balance of the Special
Account, amounting to US$1,552,254.00 equivalent which was cancelled on
February 6, 1987, bringing the total cancellation up to US$16,264,948.14 in
fiscal year 1987. On October 6, 1988 the Borrower refunded US$62,500 equiva-
lent to the Special Account which the Bank cancelled from the outstanding
loan balance in the third quarter of 1990.
1.19     The main reasons which contributed to the slow rate of commitments
and disbursements of this project are: (a) Institutional - (i) long lags for
intermediating banks to identify and present export-oriented subprojects to
UA; (ii) long evaluation periods by UAI and (iii) the political uncertainty
that preceded the November 1984 elections which led companies to delay execu-
tion of their projects; and (b) Economic - (i) the Loan became effective at
the onset of Uruguay's deep industrial recession (industrial GDP decreased
4.6Z in 1981 and 23.52 in 1982, in real terms); (ii) the overvaluation of the
peso from October 1979 to November 1982 decreased competitiveness of export-
oriented industrial firms, the core of the project pipeline; and (iii) the
worldwide economic recession, affected Uruguay's export markets, in par-
ticular Argentina and Brazil.

1.20     Technical Assistance Component.   The Supervision Mission Reports
failed to report on the progress of the Technical Assistance component of the
Loan aside from the portion allocated to the Tariff Reform Study. AO men-
tioned above, the hiring of consultants for the Tariff Reform Study did not
take place until March 22, 1982. The Loan Agreement was amended to postpone
the following deadlines:   (a) to hire the consultants, to May 31, 1982; (b)
to furnish to the Bank the study findings and conclusions, to April 30, 1983;
and (c) to review the findings and conclusions with the Bank, to July 31,
1983.   The study was not actually completed until July 1983.   The Bank's
assessment of the study was that it was of unusually high quality in terms of
its broad scope, meticulously executed methodology, and policy-relevant con-
clusions; but the study was based on 1981 data. The report did not take into
account the significant changes caused by the major devaluati-zn which
occurred in 1982.  Its conclusions were out of date, and the review did not
take place. An agreement was reached with the outgoing Government to update
the study, but because of the November 1984 elections no action was taken.
The new Government indicated a willingness to undertake such updating, which
was finally completed in 1986 and used in connection with SAL '11.
F. Project Results
1.21     The Credit Component.  The differences between the project estimates
and those actually achieved were considerable. These were as follows:
(a)  Project Estimates 65-80 projects for a total cost of US$65.39
million, US$29.45 million of which were to be financed by this
Loan, generating employment for about 3,200 workers;
(b)  Actual:   10 projects for a total cost of US$49 million, with
US$13.2 million disbursed under the Loan, generating estimated
employment according to UA for 387 workers, but with actual
employment generated closer to 48 workers due to subprojects
failures (see Annex 3). The subprojects financed comprised: 6
new plants, 1 plant expansion, and 3 plant modernizations, with
the last group resulting in a reduction of their work force.
Implementation was mostly unsuccessful; out of the ten sub-
projects:  (a) two never began operations due to administrative
problems;  (b) four initiated operations but were rot able to
develop sufficient markets; and (c) only four succeeded after
initial difficulties.  In conclusion, the project not only fell
short in coverage, its economic impact was poor with an overall
negative rate of return.
1.22     The status of the subloans as of April 1, 1990 were as follows:  4
subloans were current and 6 in arrears.   The total amount in arrears is
US$5,016,673 or 37% of the disbursed loan (see Annex 2). The BCU is taking
judicial action against 5 of the companies with subloans in arrears and has
covered 1 through its Guarantee Fund.
1.23     Due to the failure of most of the 10 subprojects the project did not
fulfill its objective of improving subborrowers' efficiency. Although the 4
subprojects that functioned have contributed to expansion of Uruguayan
exports, these represent only 1% of the country's industrial exports, a very
small overall effect.



1.24     Technical Assistance ComPonent.   No data were available from the
Supervision Mission reports on the progress of this component aside from the
portion allocated to the Tariff Reform Study (discussed in para. 1.20 above).
1.25     Status of Covenants.  Compliance with the covenants was partial.  A
joint review with the Bank of the findings and conclusions of the Tariff
Reform Study was postponed due to delays in carrying out the study, and
although the Government had offered to schedule a review, it did not take
place.   Other Loan conditions were complied with after delays, including:
(a) audit repcrts of the Fund and Sub-Fund for 1981-1983 due six months after
year end submitted only in July 1984; (b) consultants for the study on import
liberalization were hired almost one year later than agreed (see para. 1.15);
and (c) the results of the Tariff Reform Study which were to be furnished to
the Bank no later than March 31, 1982, were not completed until July 1983 as
a result of delays in hiring consultants.  In addition, in March 30, 1983,
the Bank decided not to invoke its right of not approving subloan applica-
tionts until after the review of the Tariff Reform Study had taken place,
because it considered that recent measures taken by the Government maintained
or increased slightly, the progress towards import liberalization mandated by
Decree 736/978 (see para. 1.27).
1.26     'olations.  Two subprojects were initially in violation of the Loan
Agreement: (a) Agroindustrias La Sierra - the promissory notes of the inter-
mediary (Citibank) to the subborrower gave Citibank the legal power to demand
full repayment of the subloan upon each installment date. The violation was
subsequently corrected in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) Perfiles
Guida - the subloan was approved to purchase an existing building operation
which did not qualify for funding under the Loan Agreement.   The Bank
instructed the BCU to submit a new disbursement application restricting the
use of funds to remodeling expenditures of the building.
1.27     Chanre in Prolect Objective.   Section 4.02 (c) of the Loan Agree-
ment, stated that the Goverrnment of Uruguay must enforce its December 26,
1978 Decree 736/978, establishing a global maximum tariff rate of 35% by
January 1, 1985. In December 1982 the Government announced that it would not
carry out the terms of the Decree; instead, effective January 1, 1983, the
maximum tariff was lowered from 76% to 55%, and all protective minimum prices
were abolished, to be replaced by anti-dumping reference prices. However, in
1984 the industrial sector suffered the worst recession in history1 forcing
the Government to suspend its Tariff Reduction Program and to reassess its
protection policy. Furthermore, in 1985, the Government, at IMF's request,
put into effect an across-the-board 5 percentage points increase in import
tariffs as one of the measures designed to bring down the overall public
sector budget deficit from 10.5% to 6% of GDP by June 30, 1986. Taking into
account that these temporary tariff increases were necessary to boost govern-
ment revenues, and that alternative funds were scarce, the Bank chose not to
exercise its rights under section 4.02 (c) of not accepting new subloan
applications and disbursement requests.
G. Proiect Sustainabilitv
1.28     Given the failure of most subprojects (para. 1.22), there are no
expected net benefits that would be sustained.



-9-
H. Bank Performance
1.29     (a) Loan Design.   The Project was designed based on previous
experience and on an assessment of potential demand for industrial credit
(para. 1.12) which appeared to justify the project.  Overall design of the
project seemed adequate except in two aspects; (i) division of responsibili-
ties between UA and IDF (para. 1.15) created problems of coordination, and
the Bank's later attempts to place UA under the Central Bank together with
IDF was not accepted by the Government; and (ii) the Bank's acceptance of
maintaining the Guarantee Fund (para. 1.08) reduced incentives for financial
intermediaries in ensuring viability of projects financed under this Loan.
(b) Supervision. Main shortcomings during supervision were: (i) time allo-
cated for this stage was inadequate (about 7 staff weeks per year) leading to
insufficient information on the status of the Loan components; (ii) the Bank
underestimated the negative impact of the economic situation on the sub-
projects and continued postponing the Closing Date for the Loan in expecta-
tion of improvements with its portfolio (para. 1.18); and (iii) the Bank
failed to adopt a decisive course of action on the Loan shortcomings (para.
1.25) and UA did not provide reports on subproject appraisal and supervision
on a timely basis.
I. Borrower's Performance
1.30     The major characteristic of the Borrower's poor performance, noted
during supervision, was the decaying institutional arrangement in managing
the Loan. Since the processing of subloans was shared between BCU and UA, no
one unit or person was accountable for the overall management of the Loan on
a day to day basis.  Establishing continuity in the management of the Loan
became more complicated as the staff morale declined due to lack of clear
responsibilities and decrease in salaries, resulting in an increase in staff
turnover at UA during the implementation of the Project. Lack of coordina-
tion among the entities directing the Loan aggravated the situation further
(discussed in detail in section J). Additionally, throughout implementation
there was no supervision by BCU of the participating banks and the promotion
of new operations was poor in quality and effort.   In some cases subloan
agreements (administered by UA) had not met with agreed subproject require-
ments (as in the case of Agroindustrias La Sierra), in other cases disburse-
ment conditions concerning the financial structure on sub-borrowers had not
been met.
J. Proiect Relationship
1.31     Although the relationships of the BCU and UA with the Bank were
cordial, the information they provided was frequently inadequate and
untimely.   The relationship between the BCU and UA lacked coordination and
involved some friction in the manner in which subproject appraisals were
handled. Up to late 1983, the UA authorized the disbursements to companies
and specified from which line the funds were to be drawn; at the insistence
of the FFID staff, after 1983 the UA could only approve disbursements. The
UA also felt politically pressured by managerial staff of the BCU to approve
subloans to companies that had already agreed with BCU staff that these would
be approved. The relationship between UA and the intermediary banks was poor



- 10 -
as stated in supervision missions reports (6/14/83 and 9/28/84).  Coordina-
tion and exchange of information on the part of UA with intermediaries was
virtually non-existent. The UA felt that the companies and the banking com-
munity gave them no feedback. The companies felt that UA was a bureaucratic
organization that requested information and placed unrealistic conditions
upon them. The banks on the other hand, did not care to impose any condition
on companies, except for requiring a mortgage and the participation of the
Guarantee Fund. The banking community did not appreciate the evaluation or
supervision work done by UA's staff and under Uruguay's bank secret code,
refused to provide information of the companies' credit conditions or finan-
cial situation (supervision missio, report 9/28/84).
K. Project Documentation and Data
1.32     The legal agreements between the Bank and the Government of Uruguay
provided the parties with adequate rights and protections during project
implementation.
1.33     Basic data for the preparation of this PCR on the part of the Bank's
Project Files and MIS were generally readily available except on the Tech-
nical Assistance component.   Data requested from the BCU concerning sub-
projects were furnished; however, the presentation of the data did not follow
the Bank's specific instructions, was unclear, and lacked explanatory notes,
and portions were inaccurate and partially incomplete.
1.34     The first audit report prepared by the Tribunal de Cuentas was late
and insufficient. The source of the problem was the FFID's lack of a modern
accounting and information system and the failure of the BCU to establish a
separate set of accounts for FFID. In FY83 the system continued to be over-
due and incomplete. Audits through FY83 included only sources and uses of
funds and lacked balance sheets and income statements. By 1984 a new system
of accounts had finally been established and complete sets of the 1981-83
audited financial reports were sent to the Bank. Between September 28, 1984
and March 14, 1985 UA had produced no reports on the status of subprojects.
Five reports were overdue. Both UA and FFID failed to dete^t and correct the
inconsistency found in legal documents of the "La Sierra" subproject.
L. Lessons of Experience
1.35     An overall assessment of the Project shows that it was unsatisfac-
tory and its institutional impact was negligible. Although economic circum-
stances outside its scope were partly responsible for the slow rate of com-
mitments and the failure of many subprojects, some defects could be pointed
out regarding project design and implementation. First, the Project did not
establish an adequate counterpart responsible for overall coordination and
with full access to pertinent information. Two entities were responsible for
project administration in Uruguay: UA was given responsibility to appraise
and supervise the projects, whereas BCU, through its IDF subfund, had direct
contact with the financial intermediaries.   Due to inadequate coordination
between both institutions, information necessary to follow-up on the Project
was not readily available, which made it difficult for the Bank to exercise
its judgement on the status of the subprojects throughout their imple-
mentation.



- 11 -
1.36     A second lesson was the difficulty for the Bank to take decisions
rapidly in order to avoid continuous deterioration of the Project.   This
shortcoming could be attributed in part to lack of prompt adequate informa-
tion from the Government (para. 1.35) and to inadequate time allocated for
supervision (para. 1.29). The Bank was also too lenient with the Goverrmont
concerning the covenants under the Loan. In spite of bad performance by most
subloans, the Bank agreed to postpone both Commitment and Closing Dates with-
out undertaking an in-depth analysis of the Project's situation and
prospects.
