REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent
of US$10.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for
dairy development. Approximately $6.5 million would be relent to the
Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) for 20 years, including five years
of grace, with interest at 4% per annum. TRDB would onlend to dairy
operators at an interest rate of 8-½% for periods up to 15 years including
grace periods of up to four years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last full Economic Report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was followed
by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) distributed on December 11, 1972
and which was especially prepared for the East African Consultative Group
meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. A basic economic mission is scheduled
for late 1975. An agricultural sector report was issued on December 10,
1974. An industry and mining sector report and a report on the fiscal
aspects of Tanzania's recent decentralization of Government was distributed
in April 1975. The Consultative Group for East Africa met in April 1975
to discuss the progress and prospects of the Tanzanian economy and the
need for additional resources to support the Government's development
policy. Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Tanzania has a one-party system which is embodied in the constitu-
tion. The party, TANU, is a well organized mass party and is actively
engaged at the grass roots in the promotion of popular involvement in the
national development effort, and democratic principles are being strictly
adhered to within the party. In economic policy making, the long-term
objective of.social equality prevails over economic interests of minority
groups; some progress towards reducing inequality of income distribution
within the category of employed workers has been made, but large gaps
continue to exist between urban and rural standards of living. Tanzania
is one of the 25 least developed countries as defined by the United Nations.
4.        Between 1968 and 1973, GDP increased 4.8% per year in real terms.
Exports of goods and services in constant prices grew 2.8% per year during
the same period. Domestic savings were maintained at about 18% of GDP. In-
vestment increased from 19% of GDP to 23% with public sector investment rising
to 80% of the total investment in 1973. Annual price increases were moderate



- 2 -
to low. Current Government receipts more than doubled, but current expendi-
tures increased at similar rates so that budgetary savings stagnated. While
imports, especially of capital and intermediate goods grew rapidly, export
earnings grew very slowly and the increasing current account deficits were
financed by a rapid increase of public capital inflow, largely on concessional
terms.
5.        The level of domestic savings and investment is substantial and is
evidence of a serious commitment to development. The growth of GDP is prob-
ably not commensurate with the investment effort. This is largely due to
the large amount of investment that went into slow gestation infrastructure
and social services. This was exemplified by the investment of about $200
million in the Tan-Zam railway, the largest single project undertaken in
Tanzania, and by the diffic:ulties encountered in mounting investment in
agriculture. The stagnation of agricultural export volumes and very slow
growth in food production were the most worrisome problems. However, prudent
domestic financial management, and an increasing inflow of external aid on
concessionary terms together with a rather sharp terms of trade improvement
in 1973, made it possible t:o maintain a high investment rate while reserves
at the end of 1973 stood at a healthy $145 million which was then the equiv-
alent of four months' imports.   Indeed, the economy appeared in relatively
good shape before the events of the winter of 1973-74.
6.        Events occurred then which resulted in EL drastic change in the
overall balance of payments of Tanzania. First, import prices rose sharply;
most particularly petroleum prices. Other import prices increased an estima-
ted 15 to 20%. The increased cost of petroleum imports in 1974 compared to
1973 is about $70 million or about 38% of the increased import bill. Second,
the 1973 rains failed in many parts of the country resulting in a substantial
reduction in food production in 1973-74. This became evident in January and
February 1974 necessitating substantial increases in imports of basic food
items. The drought became general in 1974 making necessary continued high
levels of food imports from September 1974 to August 1975 when the new crop
harvest begins. Food imports in 1974 cost about $150 million compared to
an annual average in 1970-72 of $40 million. The stagnation of food and
agricultural export volumes in 1974 was largely attributable to the drought
but also reflected weaknesses in government agricultural policies.
7.        The overall balance of payments was in surplus in 1972 and 1973
but the net result of the events of 1973-74 described above is that reserves
declined by $89 million in 1974 to a level representing about two weeks'
imports. The upward trend of import prices, high food imports and stagnant
agricultural export volumes are expected to contirLue into 1975 resulting in
an estimated balance of payments deficit of about $150 million. The Govern-
ment has secured partial financing of the gap through a $30 million Bank
Program Loan of December 20, 1974 (Loan No. 1063 TA) and other multilateral
and bilateral sources.



- 3 -
8.        The projected size and persistence of the balance of payments deficit
necessitate strong policy action. The Government has begun a program of in-
vestment restructuring, administrative changes, and reduction in the rate of
growth of consumption that forms the basis of a sound program for the solu-
tion of the medium-term problems. Under this program, the Government has
made substantial progress in reallocating public investment from infrastruc-
ture development to the directly productive sectors of agriculture, industry
and mining. The single largest economic weakness is the low growth of agri-
cultural production. Several steps have been taken to increase output. The
Government has raised producer prices so as to provide greater incentive.
Retail prices have been brought near world parity. Project planning and im-
plementation is being improved by administrative changes within the Ministry
of Agriculture that will enable government staff to be more effective. The
negative impact of villagization on output is being reduced through more
careful planning. The Government is reducing unnecessary non-development
related recurrent expenditure and is using taxation and wage/price controls
to reduce the rate of growth of private consumption.
9.        The balance of payments problem is likely to persist through the
end of this decade in spite of concentrated Government actions. Accordingly,
Tanzania will require additional balance of payments assistance in 1976 and
1977, and a continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange compo-
nent of high priority projects if it is to achieve its development targets.
Financing of some local expenditures will therefore be justified.
10.       Tanzania is one of the three Partner States belonging to the East
African Community. The 1967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is one of
the most far reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agreements in
existence among sovereign states. However, in practice the degree of eco-
nomic integration and cooperation among the Partner States is much less than
what was envisaged in the Treaty. Political developments in the Partner
States have created tensions within the Community and impaired the growth of
interstate trade. These difficulties have been compounded by the balance of
payments crisis which currently faces all three Partner States.
11.       Tanzania's overall debt service ratio is currently about 6%.    In
terms of outstanding commitments, the Bank Group is Tanzania's largest credi-
tor followed by Sweden, the People's Republic of China, Canada, Denmark, the
Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany. Including a notional one-
third share of the debt of the East African Community Corporations, the IBRD
is presently holding 14% of Tanzania's outstanding external debt and IDA 16%;
the IBRD share is expected to rise to about 20% in the next five years, and
the IDA share to remain about the same. Debt service payments to the Bank
are about 10% of total debt service payments; the corresponding share for IDA
is about 2%. These two figures are projected to rise to about 20% and 3%,
respectively, by 1980. Most capital aid to Tanzania is made available on
very favorable terms and a declining share of the total is tied to procurement
in the donor country. Suppliers' credits have been kept to the minimum.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
12.       Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962.   Beginning with an
IDA credit for education in 1963, 19 credits and eight Bank loans amount-
ing to $289.8 million have so far been approved for Tanzania. In addition,
Tanzania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million, which
have been extended for the development of common services operated regionally
by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their association in the East African
Community. The only IFC investments in Tanzania to date, totaling $4.7 mil-
lion, were made in the Kilombero Sugar Company in 1960 and 1964. This Company
encountered financial difficulties and in 1969 IFC and other investors sold
their interest in the Company to the Government. Annex II contains summary
statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Tanzania and the East African Com-
munity organizations as of May 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of on-
going projects.
13.       Our lending program, reflecting the e4ph1asis the Tanzanian Govern-
mient is placing on agricultural development, has increasingly focused on
directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to the end of FY72,
10 out of 14 loans and credits have been made for infrastructure. All but
one of the loans to the East African Community organizations, of which
Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-guarantor, have been extended for improve-
ments in transportation and communications. However, the approval by the
Executive Directors of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA) in
October 1970 opened a new phase in our lending for more directly productive
activities. The Smallholder Tea Development Project (Credit No. 287 TA) and
a Second Livestock Project (Credit No. 382 TA) were approved in March 2972
and April 1973, respectively. A Cotton Development Project (Credit No.
454 TA), a Cashewnut Development Project (Loan No. 1014 TA) and the Kigoma
Integrated Rural Development Project (Credit No. 508 TA) were approved in
1974. Maize and fisheries projects are scheduled for appraisal in June of
this year. Preparation for the Tabora rural development project and a for-
estry project are underway.
14.       Tanzania is developing an institutional structure stressing greater
regionalization and development of ujamaa villages designed to promote and
respond to development initiatives. These institutions are still in their
formative stages, and related organizational and staffing difficulties have
sometimes resulted in the project delays referred to in Annex II. Tanzania's
education and training programs are expected to solve the manpower problem
in the longer run, but meanwhile there will continue to be a need for techni-
cal assistance in planning and implementation if the difficulties in executing
projects are to be overcome. The Government has taken steps to speed up re-
cruitment of needed expatriate technical expertise and is giving priority to
improving project implementation. At the request of the Government, about
15 technical staff have been supplied by ADS. With the further assistance
of the Regional Mission in Eastern Africa, project implementation is expected
to improve. Discussions of a technical assistance project to aid project
preparation are underway with the Government. The proposed fifth education



-5-
project will help improve project implementation and government administration
by providing, among other things, training for village and cooperative man-
agers, bookkeepers, and accountants.
15.       The urban Sites and Services Project (Credit No. 495 TA) approved
in July 1974 marked the Bank Group's first lending to Tanzania for urban de-
velopment. The Credit for the Tanzania Investment Bank (Credit No. 460 TA)
was approved in February 1974 and has now been fully committed. A second
loan is scheduled for appraisal later this year. A Highway Maintenance Proj-
ect (Credit No. 507 TA) was approved in August 1974. A proposed project for
development of a cotton textile plant at Mwanza has been approved; another
proposed project for industrial estate development at Morogoro is presently
under preparation. In view of the overall balance of payments difficulties
presently being faced by Tanzania (see above paragraphs) a Program Loan (Loan
No. 1063 TA) was approved in December 1974.
16.       The difficulties facing the East African Community Corporations
referred to in paragraph 10 have affected the Bank's lending program for the
Community. As a result of the agreement between the Partner States in July
1974 on measures to rehabilitate the East African Railways Corporation the
Executive Directors approved a proposal on November 5, 1974 to allow the
EARC to use the uncommitted portion of Loan No. 674 EA, amounting to about
$7.4 million, for consulting services and to help support an emerging invest-
ment program. However, since EARC corporate funds are not being transferred
in accordance with the agreed formula and Sh 60 million, out of a total of
Sh 150 million the Partner States agreed to inject into EARC, have not been
paid, the EARC's right to make withdrawals from the Loan Account from Loan
No. 674 EA was suspended in February 1975, pending action on both these issues.
Furthermore, in the current state of uncertainty regarding the future structure
of the Community Corporations, appraisal of further proposed Community proj-
ects for corporations which may have structural changes have been postponed
until the issues mentioned above have been clarified. The Bank has throughout
this difficult period provided assistance to facilitate solutions to the prob-
lems facing Community Corporations. This effort is continuing but in view of
the fundamental and complex nature of the problems involved it would be rea-
sonable to expect that the process of resolving these problems will not be an
easy task.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General Background
17.       Agriculture and related activities constitute the largest single
sector in the Tanzanian economy. Roughly 40% of GDP is derived from the
sector of which 50% constitutes subsistence production. Agricultural exports,
which account for 80% of total exports, include mainly sisal, cotton, cashew
nuts and coffee. About 94% of the population live in rural areas, usually in



- 6 -
small isolated communities and 90% of the economically active people are
engaged in agriculture.
18.       Most production is from smallholdings using family labor.     Large-
scale agriculture is represented by a small number of private estates and
some state farms producing sisal, coffee, tea, wheat, rice and livestock.
Estate production has diminished in importance and the state farm program
remains small.   Tanzania's national herd, the second largest in Africa, is
grazed extensively over the 40% of the country which is free from tsetse fly
infestation. It is largely managed along traditional lines. There is limited
use of oxen for cultivation, mainly in the western cotton areas. In years
of normal rainfall, Tanzania is largely self-sufficient in staples, but about
9% of total imports in 1973 were foods of which dairy products accounted for
24%, sugar 32% and food grains about 18%. Food imports in 1974 are expected
to rise to over 20% of total imports owing to a continuation of drought
conditions during the early part of the year.
Agricultural Development Strategy
19.       The Government recognizes that agriculture will continue to be the
main source of employment and has been trying to devise a strategy which will
bring about improvement in output, incomes and the living conditions of the
agricultural population.
20.       The major aim is to make significant progress towards socialist
organization of rural activity, based on ujamaa cooperatives and maximization
of the use of labor. State. farms fill a need for larger scale production units,
but the approach to mechanization is cautious and in general based on proven
viability. Agricultural production is to be increased within a framework of
crop priorities based on production possibilities, market prospects, and a
desire for increased self-sufficiency. High priority is given to raising
nutritional standards in the country and to the expansion of selected export
activities including cotton, livestock, flue-cured tobacco, and cashew nuts,
all of which are already being assisted by the Bank Group. Several other types
of farming, including dairying, pyrethrum, oilseeds and forestry products and
commodities also have scope for expansion. Projects designed to develop some
of these are in various stages of preparation. A vigorous policy for the
development of vertically integrated single crop authorities dealing with all
aspects of production, processing and marketing, is being pursued with cooper-
atives playing a central role.
21.       The agricultural and rural development study (Report No. 541a-TA),
December 1974, discussed Tanzania's agricultural goals, problems, and strate-
gies in detail.   The conclusions of this report have been given added signifi-
cance in view of the economic problems facing Tanzania. The recent shift to
projects with directly productive results will accelerate, particularly in
maize and livestock. Pric(es of domestic agricultural products have been
increased to approach import parity which will provide a renewed producer
stimulus and lead to reduced import requirements. A reassessment of export taxes



-7-
on agricultural commodities and subsidies for agricultural inputs is underway
with the aim of reducing influences that tend to restrict or discourage pro-
duction. Difficulties in distributing production inputs and the marketing of
crops will be reduced by a government program strengthening the cooperative
marketing system and providing credit to private truckers.
22.       In implementing its policy of reduced dependence on food imports
the Government has given priority to the promotiPn of smallholder production
of maize. Subsidized fertilizers, the use of insecticides and improved
transport are included in this program. Other projects will make Tanzania
self-sufficient in sugar production by 1977, improve livestock marketing in
the traditional sector and expand meat processing facilities, increase cashew
nut production and establish smallholder export oriented projects for tea,
tobacco and cotton.
Technical Services
23.       Research presently being carried out in Tanzania is generally of
a good standard although strengthening of some areas is needed. In par-
ticular, there is a gap between research and its application at the farm level.
Owing to inadequate dissemination of new techniques, limited material, poor
logistic support and the fact that staff have been spread too thinly, the
extension services have been rather ineffective in introducing the improved
techniques to farmers except when organized along project lines.
The Dairy Industry
24.       The dairy industry in Tanzania is relatively under-developed, and
Tanzania has imported an increasing volume of dairy products to meet rising
demand in the urban areas. A small commercial sector is engaged in modern
dairy farming, using almost exclusively non-indigenous dairy cattle.. Although
a few farms are privately owned, most are run by parastatal corporations and
serve commercial dairies primarily in the Arusha-Kilimanjaro-Dar es Salaam
areas. Commercial dairying has declined in recent years to approximately
10 million liters in 1973 due to the departure of non-African farmers and
low milk prices and many farms now stand in urgent need of rehabilitation.
By far the largest volume of milk (approximately 475 million liters) is
produced by traditional cattle owners. Half is available for human consumption
and forms an important part of rural diets. Only a few traditional cattle
owners produce for cash sale. Milk is also produced in a very limited number
of ujamaa villaRes as a communal venture.
25.       Principal constraints for dairy development include the location of
some high potential areas far from major markets, low milk price levels, poor
rural road networks and limited milk collection services, low milk yields of
traditional cattle, shortage of feed during the dry season, weak extension
services for dairy, shortages of inputs, and inadequate research to develop



-8-
dairy farming systems suitable for Tanzanian conditions.   If these con-
straints are removed or surmounted, Tanzania could develop a viable,
indigenous dairy industry, producing all its milk requirements.
26.       The Government's strategy for development of the dairy industry
is sound. It aims at import substitution production and recognizes the
importance of dairy products in the diet of rural dwellers. While depending
on parastatal organizations to quickly meet the needs of the urban sector,
the Government also seeks to meet the needs of the rural population through
a longer term program of assistance benefiting the smallholder.
27.       Responsibility for implementing the Government dairy development
program rests in the Ministry of Agriculture (KILIMO) whose Livestock
Development Division (MIFUGO) has policy responsibility for all matters
relating to livestock and dairy. MIFUGO carries out its policies through its
research, training, husbandry, extension and veterinary staffs and through
parastatal corporations. The Livestock Development Authority of Tanzania
(LIDA) has broad responsibilities, including marketing and production of
beef and dairy products through parastatal corporations such as the National
Ranching Company (NARCO), the Dairy Farming Corporation (DAFCO) and Tanzania
Dairies, Ltd. (TDL). NARCO operates beef ranches and breeding ranches.
DAFCO has responsibility for developing large-scale dairy farms and TDL
for developing and managing commercial milk collection, processing and
distribution. The Tanzania Sisal Corporation (TSC) operates well-run beef
ranches and dairy farms in the Tanga region as a part of its diversification
program. The Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union (KNCU) and the National
Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO) also operate dairy farms. The
Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) has been designated by the Government
as the primary financial vehicle for promoting agricultural credit. Oper-
ating on commercial principles, the TRDB handles short- and medium-term
credit to farmers through cooperatives, provides somes technical assistance
and has served as the main channel for IDA funds in previous credits
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
28.       An appraisal report entitled "Tanzania - Dairy Development
Project", Report No. 765-TA, is being circulated separately. A Development
Credit and Project Summary are provided as Annex III to this report.
29.       The project was mainly prepared by the Government and appraised
in the field in September-October 1974. Negotiations for the proposed
credit were held in Washington in May 1975. The Tanzanian delegation was
headed by Mr. A. Mushi, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.



-9-
Project Description
30.       The project is an integral part of the Government's long-term
program for the improvement of dairy farming in Tanzania. The project
includes (i) rehabilitation and expansion of commercial dairy farming on
nine parastatal farms and improvement and expansion of milk collection,
processing and distribution facilities, (ii) development of the traditional
dairy sector in 50 ujamaa villages, (iii) breeding improved dairy heifers,
(iv) related technical services and applied investigational work for
animal disease control, and (v) future project preparation.
31.       Seventeen dairy units of about 350 cows each would be developed
or established at nine dairy farms in five regions (see map).
Two new farms would be established and seven dairy farms already operating
would be rehabilitated and expanded. The condition of these farms varies
widely, ranging from quite successful dairy farms to very run-down
farms with animals in poor condition.
32.       The farms would be run as commercial ventures under the management
of DAFCO and are located near existing or planned Drocessing-facilities.
Modern intensive dairy farming practices would be followed using pre-
dominantly non-indigenous cattle and a high degree of mechanization to
produce and preserve sufficient fodder to last through the long, dry
season. The farms would, in addition to producing milk for the urban
markets, serve as a nucleus for development of farming techniques appli-
cable to different regions and geographic conditions, and for training
managers and farmers in dairy farming. Development of these units would
permit the Government to develop dairy farming models that could be extended
to other farms in the future.
33.       The project would improve milk collection systems in Dar es Salaam
and Arusha. Milk collection centers would be located on dairy farms
and would serve neighboring small producers. Processing and distribution
facilities in Dar es Salaam would be expanded, obsolete equipment replaced,
production bottlenecks removed and new equipment installed. Vehicles
would also be provided to improve milk distribution.
34.       Small (20 cow) dairy units would be developed in 50 ujamaa
villages in suitable regions as a pilot program to develop dairies in
ujamaa villages. These units would be based on up-graded cattle from the
heifer breeding unit and would be run as communal ventures, with milk
generally consumed within the village as a source of protien, and in some
cases sold. This program will help to develop the technical and insti-
tutional base for future projects.
35.       A breeding unit would be established in the West Lake region
(see map) to produce approximately 1,800 dairy heifers a year for sale
to parastatal dairy farms, individual farmers, and ujamaa villages. These
heifers are essential to build up herds on parastatal dairy farms and
ujamaa dairy units developed under this project, and would also provide a



- 10 -
source of up-graded dairy cows that would be required for future dairy
projects, particularly those directed at village producers. The breeding
program would use 6,000 zebu-boran cows raised on the ranches, and would
be based on artificial insemination with imported semen from pedigree
dairy bulls.
36.       A total of 30 man years of technical assistance would be provided
for the commercial dairy farms, the ujamaa dairy units, and the West Lake
heifer breeding unit, to train Tanzanian managers, develop management
systems and administrative procedures, and prepare future projects.
Specialists would be internationally recruited to serve as dairy farm
group managers, manager of the heifer breeding unit, a project preparation
team for the ujamaa dairy farms, and to provide technical support at LIDA
headquarters, and financial advice to TRDB. The qualifications and ex-
perience of these experts and their terms and conditions of employment
would be subject to approval by the Association (Section 2.02 of the
Project Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Funds would be provided for overseas fellowships and in-country short
courses to develop skills in dairy farming techniques and for studies to
assist in monitoring and evaluating project performance.
37.       An applied research program on the impact of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) and other animal diseases on the traditional cattle herd
would be initiated. This program would be designed to analyze existing
information on herd co-efficients and the reported incidence of FMD and
other diseases and to conduct applied investigational work at village
level to measure losses in production that result from FMD outbreaks.
The principal items financed would be a veterinary economist and staff
and logistic support.
Organization and Execution
38.       Implementation of the project is estimated to take five years.
The Ministry of Agriculture (KILIMO), as the parent organization, would
have overall responsibility for project implementation. LIDA would over-
see and monitor the project through a project coordinator who would
expedite and coordinate implementation. The Board of Directors of LIDA,
which has members from all agencies involved in the project, would serve
as project coordinating committee. The committee would be responsible for
approval of ranch development plans. DAFCO would manage its own commercial
dairy fatms as well as those of KNCU, NAFCO and TSC. TRDB, in conjunction with
the regional livestock staff, would be responsible for the ujamaa dairy program, NARCO
would establish the West Lake heifer breeding unit. TDL would be responsible
for the milk processing and collection component. KILIMO, LIDA and TRDB
would direct and coordinate technical services.



Project Costs and Financing
39.       Total project costs are estimated to be US$15.3 million, of
which US$7.3 million (48%) is foreign exchange and $0.2 million is taxes
and duties. The commercial dairy farms are estimated to cost $4.8 million.
the collection and processing component $0.5 million, the ujamaa dairy
development $0.5 million, the hLeifer breeding unit $1.4 million and tech-
nical services $2.7 million excluding contingencies. Price contingencies
of $4.4 million and physical contingencies of $1.0 million have been
included in the total cost estimates. A 15% p.a. price contingency was
used based on recent Tanzanian experience.
40.       The proposed IDA credit of $10.0 million would finance 65%
of the total project cost, covering the total foreign exchange cost
and 33% of local costs excluding taxes and duties. The balance would be
financed by the Government, parastatal corporations and ujamaa villages.
41.       Credit funds for the commercial dairy farms, ujamaa dairy units,
the heifer breeding program, and milk collection, processing and dis-
tribution would be loaned by the Government to TRDB for 20 years including
five years of grace at an interest rate of 4% per annum. TRDB would take
the credit risk and the Government would bear the exchange risk. TRDB
would loan funds for the commercial dairy farms, ujamaa dairv units, and
the heifer breeding unit at 8-½% annually for 15 years with a four year
grace period. Funds for the milk collection and processing component
would be onlent at 8-½% for eight years with no grace period since returns
would begin immediately. The lending rate is one percentage point higher
than the existing lending rate for such loans by the TRDB.   The 4-i%
margin that TRDB would derive from onlending is sufficient to defray the
cost of credit administration and procurement and delivery of inputs to
the beneficiaries as well as allowing the accumulation of further funds
for relending to priority rural sector projects.
42.       Financial projections have been made for each of the dairy
farms and found to be satisfactory, with an average 18% rate of return;
operations of the heifer breeding unit would result in a financial rate of
return of 33%. The financial position of the ujamaa villages will be
examined during the selection of the 50 to participate in this project.
Since no strong tradition of ujamaa dairy farming exists, reliance upon
dairy units for cash generation would be risky. Accordingly, it is
anticipa'ted that in virtually all cases the dairy unit would be one of
several communal ventures producing cash revenues. Loans would be ex-
tended only if repayment were assured by a sound source of cash income
adequate to meet debt service requirements.

Production, Marketing and Prices
43.       Total milk producton in Tanzania is currently estimated at
about 500 million liters a year with about 10 million liters entering
the commercial market. Annua:L incremental production under the proposed
project by 1980 would be about 10 million liters of milk and would increase
to 15 million liters by 1987, at full development. Milk produced on
project commercial dairy farms and provided through the improved collection
system would be sold to the commercial dairies, which would be expanded to
handle the anticipated increased volume. Milk produced in ujamaa villages
would in general be sold within the villages but in some instances, where
the ujamaas are located near processing facilities, surplus milk would be
sold to commercial dairies. M1ilk prices are controlled by the Government
at the producer and retail levels for commercially processed milk. The
Government has previously attempted to keep milk prices low as it views
this as a product of primary necessity but is now considering a substantial
price increase in view of the need to provide incentives for increased
production. The current price averages about T Sh 1.00 per liter and
an increase to T Sh 1.25 a liter is under study. Such a price level would
ensure an adequate financial return to dairy farms at: current price levels.
With the expansion of milk production under the project pricing policies
will assume greater importance in the future and would have to be reviewed
on a regular basis to ensure i:hat they are set at a level which will assure
an adequate return to both large and small producers. It was therefore
agreed at negotiations that the Government woula consult with the Association,
at least once a year, on milk price levels in Tanzania (Section 3.03 of
the Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
44.       Contracts for the supply of machinery, equipment and vehicles
(US$2.0 million) would be awarded after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines, with the exception of some
machinery for milk processing (US$0.2 million) which would be purchased
directly from the supplier of the plant's basic equipment to ensure
conformity with existing equipment and to economize on procurement of
spare parts and service. Cattle (US$2.3 million) would be purchased
locally. Orders would be bulked to the maximum extent possible. For
small individual purchases such as single vehicles or tractors, spare
parts, supplies, etc., not to exceed US$50,000 for individual orders.
Government procurement procedures would be followed. In evaluation of
bids, local manufacturers would be allowed a preference margin of 15%
or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is the lower.
45.       Local contractors after local bidding would carry out most
civil works contracts (US$1.6 million). The balance would be constructed
by force account (US$0.6 million) or, for ujamaa units, by village labor
(US$0.1 million).

Disbursements
46.       To minimize delays in project implementation, it is proposed
that up to $50,000 would be disbursed retroactively to cover technical
assistance costs for the preparation of ranch plans in order to enable
procurement to proceed more rapidly.
47.       Funds from the Credit Account would be disbursed over five
years on the following basis:
(a) 80% of the total of each loan approved by TRDB for development
of commercial dairy farms, ujamaa units, milk collection and
processing, and the heifer breeding unit (US$6.5 million);
and
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures
for technical services, salaries and fees (US$2.0 million).
The remaining US$1.5 million of the credit is unallocated.
Benefits
48.       The benefits of the project would consist of increased production
of milk and high grade dairy heifers, which would result in savings of
foreign exchange by reducing dairy imports and increased milk consumption
in villages where nutritional levels are low. Annual foreign exchange
savings of about T Sh 20.0 million (US$2.7 million) are anticipated when
the project is fully developed. Ujamaa villages participating in the
project would derive benefits either in the form of increased milk for
consumption (and thus improved levels of nutrition) or its equivalent
value as cash revenue, estimated at T Sh 21,600 (US$3,000) per village
annually at full development, and T Sh 14,000 (US$2,000) annually from
livestock sales.
49.       The economic rate of return from the project is estimated at
22% over 25 years. An increase in total project costs of 10% would lower
the return to 18%; a decrease in project benefits of 10% would also lower
the return to 19%. The primary risk involved in this project is the
sensitivity of dairy output to the quality of farm management. For the
parastatal farms to remain viable, the quality of farm management would
have to be improved through the technical assistance that would be provided
by this credit. The ujamaa dairies involve high risk since there is little
experience with this dairy model. This experiment, however, is low in
cost (US$0.5 million) and holds promise as the beginning of a large program
of dairy development through developing high yielding dairy methods and a
cadre of skilled manpower.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United
Republic of Tanzania and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and the Tanzania Rural Development Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Agreements conform to the normal pattern for livestock and agricultural
credit projects.
51.        Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of
special interest are referred to in paragraphs 36 and 43 of this report.
Conditions of credit effectiveness would be (a) that a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Borrower and TRDB, acceptable to the Association,
had been executed, and (b) that at least three group managers for the dairy
farms had been recruited and taken up their posts (Section 5.01 of the
Development Credit Agreemtent).
52.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

D. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONl/
(As of May 1, 1975)
There are currently 16 projects under execution in Tanzania
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project:   $9.0 million Credit of October 9,
1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
As a result of the Tanzania Government's intention to complete
its villagization program by 1976, the process has been accelerated and
a total of about 7,200 families have been moved to villages in the
tobacco complexes, bringing the number of project farmers to 10,000.
As a result of these vigorous efforts, it is now likely that the appraisal
target of 15,000 farmers will be reached by 1975. Strict measures to
enforce minimum tobacco acreaRes per family are expected to contribute
to increased tobacco production. However, yields per hectare and
quality of leaf have been below anticipated levels. Improvements are
required to strengthen the extension and cooperative services. Pro-
vision of water supplies and social infrastructure are progressing well.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 million Credit
of March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
This project has experienced serious management problems both
at headquarters and in the field which have largely contributed to the
shortfall in planting achievements, currently 45% of target. Insuf-
ficient and poor quality field supervision with inadequate control
and guidance from headquarters have resulted in poor husbandry practices,
low yields and poor quality of leaf produced. Of the four tea factories
established or improved under the project, only one is performing
satisfactorily. These problems are being reduced since all senior
extension staff positions have been filled and monthly visits are being
made to each project area. F'inancial management is improving and
disbursements accelerating after the appointment of a Chief Accountant,
Cost Accountant and Internal Auditor.
1/      These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in par-
ticular, to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the actions being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

The credit became effective in November 1974. Government
has designated two national parastatal marketing corporations to per-
form the input delivery and crop marketing functions under the project
rather than the Kigoma Cooperative Union which would have required a
financial reorganization. Possible changes to legal documents
are being studied. TRDB remains the lending channel for IDA funds
under the project. The Operations Manager (henceforth designated
Project Manager), Financial Controller and Land-Use Planner are now
on site and heavily involved in planning implementation; several other
appointments remain to be filled. A large acreage (relative to
previous years) has been planted with cotton and a variety of steps
are necessary (now underway) to market it effectively. The Project
Management hopes that 30 project villages will qualify for loans under
the project starting in September. However, this goal may be an
optimistic one in view of the need for a trained bookkeeper and
extension worker and preparation of a Village Site Feasibility
Report for each project village as a prerequisite to its borrowing
under the project.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 million Credit
of January 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
The conditions in which the project will operate were radically
changed by the decision effective April 15, 1974, that farmers through-
out the district should immediately move into villages. The move
was poorly planned and in the short-run will adversely affect production
of cotton and food crops. Although in the long-run villagization
could well be advantageous to the project as savings in mechanization,
extension and credit staff could be achieved, the initial implementation
of the project will be delayed. A mission from RMEA is reviewing the
project and their report is awaited.
Loan No. 1014 TA - Cashewnut Development Project: $21.0 million
Loan of June 24, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1981
The lowest bids for the five processing facilities to be
constructed under the project were considerably in excess of the ap-
praisal estimate for the project component. Following detailed
discussions between the Government and contractor, the cost has been
considerably reduced by deletion of non-essential items so as to not
affect the aims of the project. The Government has requested deletion
of a rural water supply and a community education center; with these
changes, the loan funds will be sufficient to finance 66% of the
project as compared to 69%, at appraisal.

Credit No. 513 TA and Loan No. 1041 TA - Kilombero Sugar Development
Project: $9.0 million Credit and $9.0 million Loan of September
27, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The project was declared effective February 24, 1975. The
Government is currently making good progress toward ambitious project
goals. Civil works bid documents are in an advanced stage of prepara-
tion.  Contracts are being let for some goods and equipment; measures
to reduce possible cost overruns on the civil works components are
being considered by the Government.
Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5
million Credit of May 23, 1973_1Closing Date - December 31, 1977
The credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973
but so far implementation has been extremely slow. IDA disbursements
to date have been limited to technical services and it is only during
the past four - five months that the development of cattle ranching
and marketing has started to get under way. The meat processing
component of the project was recently scaled down by almost a third
of appraisal proposals becauset of increase in costs. However,
overall progress should improve now that responsibility for project
implementation has been transferred to the newly established Livestock
Development Authority.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149 TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Most project schools are complete and all are scheduled
for completion by July 1975. Completed schools are adequately furnished
but not yet fully equipped. IProcurement and installation of the
remaining furniture and equipment is in progress. The project has
experienced a minor overrun of $0.4 million.
Credit No. 232 TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Contracts for all 13 project institutions have now been awarded
after retendering made necessary by high prices of the original
quotations. As a result, the project is about 18 months behind schedule.
Procurement of furniture and equipment and the fellowship training
program are progressing satisfactorily. A cost overrun of about
$0.45 million is expected.

Credit No. 371 TA - Fourth Education Project: $10.3 million Credit
of April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
A substantial cost overrun, possibly as much as $13 million,
for civil works is being discussed within the Government. The Govern-
ment has decided to defer the construction of three secondary schools
in the project to reduce building standards and to seek additional
financing from bilateral aid donors.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit No. 460 TA - Tanzania Investment Bank Project: $6.0 million
Credit of February 13, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The credit has been fully committed. A follow-on project is
under consideration.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $3.0 million Loan of
December 14, 1970 and $5.0 million Supplementary Loan No. 712-2 TA
of June 24, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
Construction work for this project is nearly complete. The
project is on schedule and the first unit came on stream in March
1975 and the second is expected to be completed by July 1. A mission
visited Tanzania in April to appraise the second stage Kidatu power
project.
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Credit No. 265 TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 million Credit of
August 6, 1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
After long delays in completing tender arrangements, the
contract for the Mtwara-Masasi road was made at nearly three times
the appraised cost. Most of the overrun is covered by a $4.4 million
loan from ADB and use of the $1.8 million balance from the Bank's
Second Highway Project (Loan No. 586 TA). Construction of this road
is proceeding satisfactorily.
Feeder road construction in Geita and Mara has been slowed by
shortages of local funds, fuel, materials and personnel. This has
received the attention of the Ministry of Works and some improvement
has been effected.
Consultants' feasibility studies for Kilombero and Kilimanjaro
are proceeding satisfactorily.

Credit No. 507 TA - Highway Maintenance Project:   $10.2 million
Credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1979
The project was declared effective on November 20, 1974.
Recruitnent of expatriates required for implementation is being discussed
by the Government with the Crown Agents.   Tender documents for the
first batch of equipment are being prepared by the Ministry of Works.
URBAN SECTOR
Credit No. 495 TA - Sites and Services Project: $10.0 million
Credit of July 12, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1978
The project was declared effective in October 1974 and
has made a good start. Contract for infrastructure construction
at two sites have been awarded; tenders for two other sites have been
received, and contract documents for the remaining two sites are being
completed. Tender prices were high on the initial bids but are becoming
competitive as more sites are tendered. At present total project
costs are estimated to exceed appraisal estimates by about 3%.
Training program for technical staff of Ministry of Lands, Housing
and Urban Development commenced in March 1975. A consultant has been
appointed for Monitoring and Evaluation of the project.
PROGRAM LOAN
Loan No. 1063 TA - Program Loan: $30.0 million Loan of December
20, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The loan is fully disbursed. The Government continues to
implement policies designed to relieve the balance of payments dif-
ficulties.  A Bank mission will visit Tanzania in July to review the
effect of the implementation of such policies. Although the Government
has been successful in finding other sources to assist in financing
the balance of payments gap, the overall resource gap will be larger
than anticipated at appraisal owing to a more rapid deterioration in
the terms of trade than expected.
There are currently six projects under execution by the East
African Community.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
Loan No. 674 EA - Third Railways Project: $42.4 million Loan of May
25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
This loan was suspended on February 13, 1975. The reasons for
suspension and conditions for lifting the suspension are discussed
in Parts,Iand II of this report.

Loan No. 638 EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan of
August 25, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The Harbours Corporation is in a healthy cash position overall
although there have been problems in transferring funds from regional
offices to headquarters. It is now expected that the project will be
completed by the end of 1975.
Loan No. 865 EA - Third Harbors Project: $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Closing Date - June 30, 1977
A delay of six months is expected in completing civil works
under this project. Cost overruns have been experienced in some project
items. The situation is under study by the Corporation, which will
shortly issue a plan for speeding implementation.
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Loan No. 843 EA - East African Development Bank Project: $8.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1972; Closing Date - May 31, 1976
Operations-of the Bank have been decentralized with a resulting
strengthening of the Bank's supervisory capability. Management problems
associated with decentralization have largely been rectified so that
the pace of Bank operations is expected to quicken in FY76. Nearly
$6.5 million of the loan has been committed, and a second loan is being
considered for appraisal.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Loan No. 675 EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million
Loan of May 25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Problems within the EAC have only marginally affected the
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation due to the considerable
existing decentralization of operating authority. Deterioration of the
corporate cash position and rate of return has been slight in comparison
to other Community Corporations; the situation will be improved by a
rate increase allowed by the Community in February 1975.
Loan No. 914 EA - Third Telecommunications Project: $32.5 million
Loan of June 22, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
Procurement is generally on schedule with $20 million committed
and the balance near tender stage. All major items are expected to
be completed by mid-1975, except two microwave links which, due to
long lead time for delivery, will be delayed by 18 months.
