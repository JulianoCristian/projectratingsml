                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The release of the L-BEC grants in October is a major breakthrough which has effectively unblocked this project. Districts are now conducting activities in line with their capacity
                         development plans, supported by teams of service providers fielded by the CPIU. There have been other important breakthroughs in the BEC overall program: the Thematic
                         Education Dialog has restarted in mid December under the stewardship of the Deputy Minister of National Education, so this will feed the pipeline of analytical work and collaboration
                         with development partners.
                         Modules for capacity development have been finalized for use by service providers, focusing on the five strategic areas of local education governance plus gender mainstreaming and

                         While the program moves in a positive direction, there have been repercussions from the significant delay in releasing the L-BEC grants, and complications due to the high turnover
                         of staff in district teams since the program started. The CPIU overspent on several cost categories as a result of compensatory activities during the wait for the grant release. An
                         extension is required if the districts are to achieve project development objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It is proposed that the BEC-TF be extended through 2012 to allow districts to achieve project development objectives. The Bank executed portion should be further extended into
                         2013 to allow reporting and follow up studies.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
