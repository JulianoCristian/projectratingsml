                         Implementation Status Overview
                         National level PDO Indicators were not changed to reflect the project re-direction to purpose level achievements when the SISWA initiative was cancelled. The team conducting the
                         final supervision believs that the project has seen considerable progress in the final year of implementation at project purpose level where a rating of Moderately Satisfactory is
                         indicated. Based on the March 2012 SUSENAS data, Primary the Net Enrolment Rates (NER) was 92.52% (below the end-target of 95.18% and lower than the 2008 Baseline of
                         93.98%). Primary Gross Enrolment rates (GERs) are 102.96% (below the end target of 114% and the Baseline of 109.37%). Junior Secondary NERs in 2012 are 69.96% (slightly
                         higher than the end target of 69.21%). Based on 2011 data, Primary Completion Rates are 99.26% (higher than the end target of 97.76%). Junior Secondary Completion Rates are

                         99.39% (higher than the end target of 98.61%).Transition Rates from Primary to Junior Secondary are 77.26% (lower than the end target of 84.68% but higher than the baseline of
                         66%). While interim national-level data received from SUSENAS indicates below end-targets for Primary Net Enrolment Rates (NER) and Gross Enrolment Rates (GER) trends have
                         actually increased since 2009, and these gains are not adequately captured in these statistics at present. Preliminary analysis of trends in NER and GER is problematic as there have
                         been changes to the timing and methodology used by SUSENAS to derive figures.

                         Intermediate Results Indicators Performance indicators have been achieved, with the exception of Component 2b: Number of districts with at least 60% of schools providing BOS
                         education budget information through school announcement boards. 37 BEC districts have achieved the KPI; in the remaining 13, school disclosure about the plan for use of BOS
                         funds to parents and public remains largely informal. 68% of schools nationally share information on BOS with parents, mostly during annual meetings.

                         Current Status of Disbursement of L-BEC Grants: As of November 22, 2012: 84% of the total 2010, 2011 and 2012 budget of IDR125billion had been transferred to Local
                         Government Designated Accounts. 16% of the L-BEC budget is yet to be allocated. Given there is only one week left to submit proposals and/or claim for reimbursement from MoF, it
                         is predicted that approximately 10% of the remaining amount will be withdrawn, based on implementation progress feedback from districts. .

                         Districts have reported that the BEC-TF approach has been a catalyst for them to focus on ‘localized’ needs rather than those that are identified in what is seen as the usual ‘top-
                         down’ norm. The End-line Local Governance Capacity Assessment Survey (LGCA) will document and explore changes in education governance between 2009 (the Baseline) and
                         2012 in the 50 BEC districts. The Good Practices web-site WAPIK-web will be hosted by the Directorate General, Basic Education web-site and supported by Teacher Training
                         Institute Provincial Hubs currently being established through a University Surabaya- BE-TF supported initiative.
