                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to support GoI to convene and co-host regional conferences, national workshops, various Education Sector Working Groups and produce targeted research
                         focused on MDG and EFA policy dialog across the education sector. In the context of decentralized basic education, the Tool for Reporting and Information Management by Schools
                         (TRIMS) reduced onerous school reporting to districts and was integrated into the 2011 nation-wide BOS School Management Team training program. The design team continues to
                         collaborate with MoNE in the development of the revised EMIS system. Project activity supported capacity development and good practices in education governance and
                         management. Smoother 2011 L-BEC grant disbursement enabled districts to implement their capacity development plans (CDPs) which are progressing well. However, some

                         districts require additional targeted technical support and guidance from the central project team -- particularly with regard to KPI achievement. The project extension (from April 30,
                         2012 until December 31, 2012) has been signed on October 21, 2011 to enable completion of activities within a realistic time-frame and, a reallocation of Grant proceeds across
                         budget categories was agreed. This followed implementation review and decision meetings with donors, MoF, MoNE, MoRa and the World Bank which took into account the Euro
                         8,700,000 grant reduction by the Dutch to the overall Grant. Project Development Objectives and Intermediate Outcome Indicators remain unchanged and the GoI has provided
