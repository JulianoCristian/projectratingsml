                         Implementation Status Overview
                         GoI-executed project activities supported district level capacity development and good practices in education governance and management. Additional support was provided through
                         the Bank-executed TF to the CPIU to enable targeted technical support and review activities during implementation. Smoother 2011 – 12 Local – BEC (L-BEC) grant disbursement
                         facilitated districts to implement Capacity Development Plan (CDP) activities. Several districts continue to need targeted technical assistance from CPIU and WB technical support
                         teams, particularly with regard to Ker Performance Indicator (KPI) achievement. In January 2012 all BEC districts participated in Good Practice Workshops held in Bali which focused
                         on refining 2012 CDPs and aligning them with project KPIs. Technical awareness raising sessions were also conducted on: Tool for Reporting and Information Management by

                         September 2012. During August and September 2012, the team conducted workshops with the 50 districts to facilitate districts to review progress and to develop finalization and
                         sustainability plans.

                         Project extension and budget reallocation activities were finalized in 2011 and the 2012 Work Plan revised. MoF provided formal assurance that the improved mechanism for grant
                         disbursement established in 2011 would be maintained for the remainder of the project. By early October 2012, 42 districts had received Tranche 1 grants; one district’s proposal was
                         in progress; and, two had received Tranche 2 funds. The Pre-Financing Mechanism is being used by a further seven BEC districts to fund remaining CDP activities as specified in the
                         L-BEC manual of procedures to remove the risk of unutilized funds remaining in the LG account at the end of the block grant period.

                         The State Development Audit Agency’s (BPKP) FY2011 Consolidated Financial Report Audit of 79% of BEC districts gave an ‘Unqualified Opinion’. Outstanding monies identified in
                         the FY2010 Audit of IDR243,785,920.19 are still being followed up by districts according to BPKP recommendations. To date 83% (IDR1,231,566,821) has been settled of the
                         IDR1,475,352,741.17 identified for follow up action. Recommendations were: (i) return of overpayments on honoraria and other transactions to national and district Special Accounts;
                         (ii) refunds of overpayments, non-compliant procurement to be made at the direction of the Head of District Education Office (DEO) to procurement and DPIU teams in Demak,
                         Wonogiri, Halmahera Selatan and Sorong Selatan; and (iii) District Project Implementation Unit (DPIU) Bojonegoro to reconcile all transactions and balance DEO and DFO funds.

                         L-BEC grant disbursement has increased but processes still experience bureaucratic bottlenecks. Outstanding administrative items relating to financial management have been
                         resolved; cancellation of Service Provider procurement due to delays in the GoI DPA process is now resolved with the recruitment of 4 individual consultants. Pilot activities under
                         Part 3: Local Government Budget Support Facility - Covenant 16 and 17 were cancelled when the project was restructured in 2011. (Ref. Project Paper: Level 2 Restructuring,
