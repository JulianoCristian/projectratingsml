These objectives support the country's\n            efforts to rapidly enhance creditworthiness by improving the\n            balance of payments and to launch effective industrial\n            restructuring programs and private sector development\n            initiatives in line with the ongoing reforms. The project\n            comprises two components. The first component would include\n            investments in state-owned and private exporting industrial\n            enterprises for which Bank funds would be channeled through\n            selected participating banks. The second component would\n            include technical assistance aimed at: (a) improving the\n            banking system; (b) supporting the restructuring of\n            industry; and (c) supporting measures to stimulate the rapid\n            development of the private sector."}, "docdt": "1990-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
