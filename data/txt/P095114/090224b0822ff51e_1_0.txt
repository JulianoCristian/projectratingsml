                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the project is (a) to improve the reliability of India's Northern Electricity Grid through the addition of renewable, low carbon energy from the
                         Rampur hydropower project; and (b) to improve the effectiveness of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN) with respect to the preparation and safe implementation of
                         economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable hydropower projects.

                         The excavation of the head race tunnel has been completed in July 2012 and benching in February 2013, and associated lining activities in November 2013. The work on the
                         collection gallery has been completed in October 2013. Close attention is required for the completion of the multi junction concreting and the exit channel (where there was a collapse

                         now proceeding satisfactorily. Another critical element of the overall project is the evacuation transmission line (being erected by Powergrid), where work is yet to start on two (out of
                         12) towers where the land is to be secured. Back-up arrangements are being explored by Powergrid in case the full evacuation system is not ready by the commissioning of the plant.

                         SJVNL and its contractors are making continuous efforts towards the implementation of the Environment Management Plan (EMP), including taking necessary steps, as agreed in
                         June 2013, to ensure that the temporary bund built around the power house area was adequately safeguarded to prevent any muck flowing into the river. With the completion of the
                         collection gallery works, the removal of the temporary bund has started but it needs to be expedited as the original completion target was end of October 2013. In addition, SJVNL
                         and the contractors need to maintain continuous focus towards strengthening housekeeping and safety management practices.

                         The land acquisition and resettlement plan implementation is fully completed except for the payment of cash assistance to one (1) displaced family (where the matter is sub-judice).
                         However, the implementation of community development works is slowed down despite several reminders to the State Administration. New works worth of Rs. 11.6 million were
                         approved in July 2012, but these works are yet to commence as the initial installment amounts are yet to be released to the concerned panchayats. With respect to payment of
                         compensation for house damages and crop damages, more than 85% of the assessed amount (that has been deposited in full by SJVNL) has been paid to the people by the District
                         Administration so far. The team has again brought the poor implementation of the community development activities to the attention of the local administration and the State
                         Government for them to take corrective action on a priority basis.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All Six units have been boxed up. Water filling in the Head Race Tunnel is expected to start in second half of February 2014. Based on the current progress and the constraints faced,
                         the commissioning schedule will undergo another change with the first unit expected to be ready for spinning and commissioning by end March 2014 and the commissioning of full
                         plant in a phased manner by May/ June 2014. The transmission line for the evacuation of the power plant output is being erected by Powergrid, but work is yet to start on two (out of
                         12) towers.
