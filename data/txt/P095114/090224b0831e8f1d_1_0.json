implemented the World Bank funded 412 megawatt (MW)\n            run-of-the-river hydro power project at Rampur in Himachal\n            Pradesh, immediately downstream of and in cascade operation\n            with the 1500 MW Nathpa Jhakri Hydroelectric Project (NJHP).\n            The project-affected area covered eight panchayats. Lessons\n            learnt by SJVNL during its first project at Nathpa Jakhri\n            were utilized to formulate better implementation practices\n            regarding land acquisition, resettlement, and community\n            development in the Rampur project. The land acquisition and\n            resettlement plan were fully implemented by the time of\n            closure of the World Bank loan in December 2014 in\n            accordance with the provisions of the framework adopted for\n            the project. The end-term impact evaluation undertaken for\n            the project confirmed that the project affected families\n            have an overall improved living standard, proportion of\n            workers in regular employment, average income, earning\n            capacity and diversification of income have increased, and\n            housing standards have improved."}, "docdt": "2015-10-01T00:46:04Z"}
