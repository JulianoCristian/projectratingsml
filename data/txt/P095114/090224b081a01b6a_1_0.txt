                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the project is (a) to improve the reliability of India's Northern Electricity Grid through the addition of renewable, low carbon energy from the
                         Rampur hydropower project; and (b) to improve the effectiveness of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN) with respect to the preparation and safe implementation of
                         economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable hydropower projects.

                         SJVNL and its contractors have taken steps to address most of the issues identified in the agreed action plan to address the identified gaps on labor camp management, muck
                         management and safety aspects. In the area of safety management, SJVNL continues to undertake additional efforts to improve worker safety conditions, including increased

                         monitoring and training/ awareness sessions. The land acquisition and resettlement implementation is fully completed. However, the implementation of community development
                         works are slowed down due to the code of conduct of recently held assembly elections. On the Local Area Development fund, out of the Rs. 52.5 million deposited by SJVNL with the
                         District Administration, so far 84 works with a value of Rs. 35.14 million (67%) have been either completed or in progress. Additional works worth of Rs. 11.60 million were approved
                         by Local Area Development Authority in July 2012. With respect to payment of compensation for house damages, 66% of the assessed amount of Rs. 57.35 million has been paid to
                         the people by the District Administration so far. With respect to crop damages, out, 61% of the Rs. 70.34 million assessed by the District Administration has been deposited by
                         SJVNL with them (release of balance amount is awaiting clarifications from the district administration). Out of the amount deposited by SJVNL, 60% has been paid to the affected
                         people by the District Administration. The process for speeding up the implementation of the above activities have been again brought to the attention of the local administration and
                         the new State Government for corrective action on priority basis.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Full Project Commissioning is likely to be delayed with supply of Electro-Mechanical equipment on the critical path. Based on the current schedule, SJVNL is expected to commission
                         the first two units of the plant by September 2013 and full plant only by December 2013 (against the target of full commissioning by September 2013).

                         As a result of the progress SJVNL has made on the implementation of the Environment Management Plan (EMP), the project ratings on the Implementation Progress is being revised
                         upwards. SJVNL and its contractors need to continue to maintain necessary close oversight so that (i) the EMP implementation and management of the construction site is continued
                         in line with agreed action plan; and (ii) the physical progress, particularly at power house and the electro mechanical supplies, to avoid any further slippages. The State Government
                         has been again requested to facilitate the prompt implementation of the remaining works on the community welfare related activities and the release of the balance deposited money
                         to the actual beneficiaries.
