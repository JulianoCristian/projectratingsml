                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the project is (a) to improve the reliability of India's Northern Electricity Grid through the addition of renewable, low carbon energy from the
                         Rampur hydropower project; and (b) to improve the effectiveness of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN) with respect to the preparation and safe implementation of
                         economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable hydropower projects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The construction of the power plant is now in its final stages with significant progress recorded since the December 2013 visit. The tunnel excavation was completed on July 24, 2012.
                         The Head Race Tunnel (HRT) benching got completed on February 20, 2013; the overt lining on August 19, 2013 and the invert lining on November 24, 2013. All the six units were

                         boxed up by January 4, 2014. The commissioning of all three Butterfly Valves was done by January 31, 2014. The plugging of all adits was completed on February 22, 2014. The
                         outfall exit channel work, which was on the critical path during the December 2013 visit, was completed on February 23, 2014. The surge shaft works, including Multi junction
                         concreting at one end of the HRT (which was also on critical path) and gate erection, were completed on February 25, 2014. The penstock works were completed on March 12, 2014.
                         The GIS was completed for synchronization on March 18, 2014 and all the remaining parts will be completed by the middle of April 2014. The removal of the temporary bund,

                         constructed for the completion of the collection gallery works, is in the final stages and expected to be completed in April 2014, against the revised date of end February 2014,
                         because of the design change.

                         Work on outfall gates installation is expected to be completed in early April 2014 and work on the outfall gates at TRT of Nathpa Jhakri is expected to be completed by middle of April
                         2014. The water conductor system is now fully complete. The filling of the Tail Race Tunnel (TRT) started on January 26, 2014 and the HRT filling started on February 23, 2014 and
                         was completed on March 14, 2014.

                         Cooling water system, Cabling system, Main Inlet Valve, Bus duct for three units completed and for other three units, work is in progress. Five Generator Transformers are currently
                         installed and the last one will be installed by April 2014.

                         For the evacuation of the Rampur generation output, Powergrid is constructing a 400 kV Loop in Loop Out (LILO) transmission system. Construction work on the western pot head
                         yard has been completed and work on the eastern pot head yard, where work on two towers had not started during the December 2013 visit as the land was still to be secured, has
                         started with the acquisition of the land for the two towers and is expected to be completed before end of April 2014 when the LILO system will be fully operational. In the interim, the
                         western pot head yard will be used for the Loop in as well as Loop out for the synchronization of the units to the grid.

                         SJVNL and its contractors are making continuous efforts towards the implementation of the Environment Management Plan (EMP), including taking necessary steps, as agreed in
                         June 2013, to ensure that the temporary bund built around the power house area was adequately safeguarded to prevent any muck flowing into the river. The removal of the
                         temporary bund is in final stages and expected to be completed in April 2014. In addition, SJVNL and the contractors need to maintain continuous focus towards strengthening
                         housekeeping and safety management practices.

                         All activities envisaged under land acquisition and R&R implementation are completed, except for the payment of cash assistance to one displaced family (due after the court ruling in
                         response to his appeal for higher cash grant in lieu of alternative house plot). There has been a significant progress on this aspect: the District administration has disbursed more
                         than 98% of the entire assessed amount for the house and crop damage compensation to the affected people. However, the implementation of community development works needs
                         further attention from State Government - This issue was also brought to the attention of the Chief Secretary, GoHP and GoHP has promised to address the issues on a priority basis.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Spinning of three units was successfully undertaken on March 4, March 5 and March 23, 2014 respectively. The synchronization test of the first unit with the grid was successfully
                         undertaken on March 19, 2014, and was followed by the successful synchronization of the 2nd unit on March 21, and of the 3rd unit on March 29, 2014. Based on the current
                         progress, SJVNL expects to undertake the synchronization of the fourth unit in April 2014, and the last two units in May 2014. SJVNL expects to start commercial operation of the
                         first two units in April, next two units in May and last two units in June 2014.

                         The issue of slow implementation of community development works was brought to the attention of the Chief Secretary, GoHP and GoHP has promised to address the issues on a
                         priority basis.
