                         Synchronization of last unit (Unit # 6) is expected to take some time as there is problem with the Generator Transformer and the contractor/ SJVNL are working to address the
                         problem. Testing and Commissioning of Tandem operation System (TOS) between Rampur Hydropower Project and upstream Nathpa Jhakri Power Station NJHPS will be
                         undertaken when all the six units are synchronized with the grid. Given that the project construction is now in final stages, SJVNL and the contractors need to accelerate the
                         implementation of the EMP, notably the restoration of the muck dumping sites and restoration of the work sites. The implementation of community development works needs further
                         attention from State Government and the following key issues were raised with the State Government: (a) notification of project affected area and project affected Zone as per the
                         new LADA guidelines, in the absence which the funds deposited in LADA Account are yet to be allocated as per the new criteria; (b) initiation of monitoring of implementation of
                         schemes under LADF; and, (c) completion of the Integrated water scheme (by IPH department) in the project area (for which SJVNL had already given its share of the funds earlier).
