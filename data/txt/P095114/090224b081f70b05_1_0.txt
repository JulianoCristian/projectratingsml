                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the project is (a) to improve the reliability of India's Northern Electricity Grid through the addition of renewable, low carbon energy from the
                         Rampur hydropower project; and (b) to improve the effectiveness of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN) with respect to the preparation and safe implementation of
                         economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable hydropower projects.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The excavation of the head race tunnel has been completed in July 2012 and benching in February 2013, and associated lining activities are going on and expected to be completed
                         with a delay by November 2013. Close attention is required to the civil works, to the completion of the lining and of the collection gallery where there was a collapse in January 2013

                                                                                                                                                                                                         Page 1 of 5

                         (a revised methodology has been adopted to ensure work is completed with minimum delays). The work on the collection gallery is expected to be completed by October 2013. While
                         there has been a significant improvement in the supplies of Electro-mechanical equipment compared to six months earlier, close and continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that
                         there are no further slippages and the project critical path is not altered. Another critical element of the project is the evacuation transmission line, being erected by Powergrid. While
                         work has started on most of the transmission line’s towers (erection of 5 towers out of 12 has been completed), Powergrid is still in the process of securing land for one tower.

                         SJVNL and its contractors are making continuous efforts towards implementation of the Environment Management Plan (EMP), including steps to address most of the issues
                         recorded in the agreed action plan, i.e. identified gaps on labor camp management, muck management and safety aspects. One key area that SJVNL and its contractors need to
                         focus on is the completion of the collection gallery, where the working area (temporary bund) is close to the river bed. SJVNL has already constructed retaining walls along the river
                         bank, and on top of several layers of boulders to protect the powerhouse and the works in that area. It is also taking additional measures, such as a careful rotation of trucks, to
                         prevent any muck spilling into the river.

                         The land acquisition and resettlement plan implementation is fully completed except for the payment of residual cash assistance to one of the displaced family (due after completion
                         of construction of his house), and the payment of cash assistance to another displaced family (where the matter is sub-judice). However, the implementation of community
                         development works is slowed down despite several reminders to the State Administration. On the Local Area Development fund, out of the 85 works awarded, 70 are completed and
                         the remaining 15 are in progress. New works worth of Rs. 11.6 million were approved in July 2012, but these works are yet to commence as the initial installment amounts are yet to
                         be released to the concerned panchayats. With respect to payment of compensation for house damages, 66% of the assessed amount of Rs. 57.35 million has been paid to the
                         people by the District Administration so far and the balance is held up due to non-availability of some people (on account of people having migrated/ not living regularly in the project
                         area). With respect to crop damages, out, 61% of the Rs. 70.34 million assessed by the District Administration has been deposited by SJVNL with them (release of balance amount is
                         awaiting clarifications from the district administration). Out of the amount deposited by SJVNL, 68% has been paid to the affected people by the District Administration. The process
                         for speeding up the implementation of the above activities has been again brought to the attention of the local administration and the State Government for them to take corrective
                         action on a priority basis.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Five units have been boxed up so far - Remaining one unit is expected to be boxed up by November. Erection of Generator Transformer has been completed for two units and for
                         remaining four units, it is expected to be completed by November 2013. Based on the current progress and the constraints faced, SJVNL anticipates a slight delay in the
                         commissioning schedule and expects to ready the first unit for spinning by late December 2013 and for commissioning by middle of January 2014 and the full plant for commissioning

                         by March 2014. The transmission line for the evacuation of the power plant output is being erected by Powergrid, but work has yet to start on one tower for which the land acquisition
                         process has ended up in court and is not yet resolved.

                         The State Government has been again requested to facilitate the prompt implementation of the remaining works on the community welfare related activities and the release of the
                         balance deposited money to the actual beneficiaries.
