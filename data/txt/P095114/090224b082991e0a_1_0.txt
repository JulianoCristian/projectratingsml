 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The plant is now completed with the sixth (last) unit getting commissioned on December 4, 2014. The plant started full commercial operations on
 December 16, 2014. Before declaring the commercial operation for the six units, the entire plant was tested at full capacity and in tandem operation
 with Nathpa Jhakri and the plant capacity reached 450 MW, exceeding the plant design capacity by about 9%. This enhances the ability of the plant to
 provide additional power during peak times. Till December 28, 2014, the project has generated around 1154.59 million units, which includes around
 71.38 million units of infirm energy.

 Given that the plant is now fully commissioned, SJVNL and the contractors need to expedite the completion of EMP activities related to the final
 phase of construction and commissioning of the plant. Important of them include, the restoration of the muck dumping sites and restoration of the work
 sites and the same are expected to be completed by March 2015. All activities envisaged under land acquisition and R&R implementation are
 completed, except for the payment of cash assistance to one displaced family (due after the court ruling in response to his appeal for higher cash
 grant in lieu of alternative house plot). The crop and houses damage compensation have been fully paid except those families who are not available in
 the villages to receive payments. The implementation of community development works needs further attention from State Government and the
 following key issues were raised with the State Government in a joint meeting of SJVNL and Bank team with GoHP: (a) notification of project affected
 area and project affected Zone as per the new LADA guidelines, in the absence which the funds deposited in LADA Account are yet to be allocated as
 per the new criteria; (b) completion of the Integrated water scheme (by IPH department) in the project area (for which SJVNL had already given its
 share of the funds earlier); (c) notification of list of beneficiaries for the annuity scheme, and timelines for the completion of the same were agreed with
 State Government.
