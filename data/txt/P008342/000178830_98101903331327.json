The project area of 1,060 acres in south central\n            Nicosia is that part of the city where the need for a sewer\n            system is greatest because of population density and where\n            present disposal methods are creating the greatest problem.\n            The project includes 16 miles of connecting sewers and 53\n            miles of lateral, sub-trunk and main trunk sewers through\n            which sewage will flow by gravity to the treatment site. It\n            also includes construction of a treatment plant, which will\n            provide effluent should prove suitable for irrigation or\n            could safely be discharged into the Pedios River."}, "docdt": "1971-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
