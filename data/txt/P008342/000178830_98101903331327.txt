AFPRAISAL OF THE NICOSIA SEIERAGE PROJECT
SUMrIARY AND CONCLIJSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a sewerage project in
Nicosia for which a Bank loan of US$3.5 million equivalent is proposed.
A second loan of US$1.9 million for sewerage in Famagusta, to be con-
sidered concurrently with this loan, is discussed in a separate report.
The project, which together with that of Famagusta would constitute the
first public sewer systems in Cyprus, is required to improve the environ-
ment of the capital city by eliminating potential health hazards and to
reduce the growing expense of septic tank maintenance. The proposed re-
use of the treated waste water for irrigation would be an additional
benefit of the project.
ii.       The project would be the first stage of a Mlaster Plan of sewers
for the capital city, serving initially some 32,000 of the city's 118,000
residents. The project area of 1,060 acres in south central Nicosia is
that part of the city where the need of a sewer system is greatest because
of population density and where present disposal methods are creating the
greatest problem. The project includes some 16 miles of connecting sewers,
and some 53 miles of lateral, sub-trunk and main sewers through which
sewage will flow by gravity to the treatment site. It also includes
construction of a relatively inexpensive treatment facility which should
provide an effluent suitable for use in irrigation or for disposal to the
Pedios River. Construction of facilities to use the water for irrigation
is not part of the project, but would be done by irrigation interests
after studies of the waste water quality and methods of use are completed
by the Department of Agriculture.
iii.      A portion of the project area lies within the walls of the old
city of Nicosia, where an archaic water supply system is to be reconstructed
concurrently with the installation of sewers. The consultant has redesign-
ed the water system to permit the necessary work to take place at the same
time as the laying of the sewers in order to save costs. The -water system
improvements will be made by the local water authority, with financial
assistance from the Government.
iv.       Because of the political situation, there may be difficulty in
reconstructing the water system or in laying the sewers in the 60 acres
of the project area lying within the Turkish sector. If it should prove
impossible to execute this part, which would only amount to about 3% of
the project cost, other parts of the project will not be affected; the
portion in the Turkish sector could be postponed until after a general
political settlement is reached,



- ii -
v.        The financial requirements of the project (exclusive of funds
required to finance loans for connections) total US$6.8 million equivalent,
of which US$3.5 million will be met by the proposed Bank loan.  The loan
will cover the foreign exchange requirements for engineering and construc-
tion totalling US$3.0 million, of which US$0.1 million represents retro-
active financing of detailed engineering costs incurred since July 1, 1969,
together with US$0.5 million for interest during construction on the Bank
loan. The local currency requirement would be US$3.3 million. Included
in this sum of US$3.3 million are US$0.2 million for preliminary construc-
tion carried out in 1970 and engineering costs paid before July 1, 1969.
vi.       The Borrower would be the Sewage Board of Nicosia (hereinafter
referred to as the Board), which was created under appropriate legislation
in January 1971. The M4unicipai Engineer has been appointed as the Chief
Engineer of the Board and this is acceptable. The Accountant/Administrator
will be appointed not later than October 1, 1971. Appointments to these
positions will be made only after the Bank has had an opportunity to
comment on the proposed appointee.
vii.      The Board has no initial revenues and the project requirements
would be 100% debt financed.  The Bank loan, covering foreign exchange
construction costs and interest during construction on the Bank loan would
provide about 50% of financial requirements, and the Board would sell bonds
on the local market for most of the required local currency, including
funds to provide loans to householders for financing connection costs in
cases where the house holder cannot afford to make payment in cash. These
bonds would be guaranteed by the Government, which would also provide a
loan of us$0.48 million equivalent for working capital. The interest rate
of the bonds will be between 7-1/4 and 7-1/2% (depending upon market conditions
at the time of issue) and the term 12 years. The Board would set up a sinking
fund to redeem 50%0 of the bonds at maturity and the Government will guarantee
the refinancing of the remainder of the bonds for a further 12 years.
viii.     The future expenses of the Board would be predominantly debt
service. Sewer service charges would be based on water meter readings
and on the assessed value of properties. Assessment on properties would
be made both within the present project area and in areas to be served
at a later date. The mil rate charged in the areas outside the present
project area would be approximately one-third of the rate to be charged
within the project area. Revenues are expected to grow steadily as a
result of increasing property assessments and water sales. Together with
receipts from sale of treated waste water for irrigation, there would be
surpluses after the initial years of operation with constant price and
tariff levels. Future surpluses would be used for minor extensions to the
system.
ix.       The internal financial return on the project is about 12%.
x.        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$3.5 million, for
a term of 25 years including a grace period of approximately 4 years.



CYPR1U
APPRAISAL OF THE NICOSIA 5EERAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Cyprus has requested a Bank loan to help
finance a sewerage project in Nicosia. Nicosia, the capital of the
Republic, has a metropolitan population of 118,000 (1970) increasing at
about 2.7% per year. The project would serve about 32,000 people in
south central Nicosia. The total financial requirements, excluding loan
funds for financing private connections, are estimated to be US$6.8
million equivalent, consisting of construction costs of US$6.3 million and
interest during construction on the Bank loan of US$0.5 million.  A Bank
loan of US$3.5 million equivalent is proposed to finance the foreign
exchange construction costs of US$3.0 million and interest during
construction on the Bank loan.
1.02      There is no public sewerage system in Cyprus, although the need
has long been recognized. A report prepared for the Government in 1959
recommended a sewerage system for Nicosia, but no action was taken because
of the political situation at the time. Following independence, the
Government requested the World Health Organization (WHO) to study and
report on sewerage on the island. The WHO report in 1965-66 recommended
that sewerage systems be built in tNicosia and Famagusta. The report
further recommended that consulting engineers be employed to draw up
Master Plans and early stage plans for sewerage in the two cities. As
a result, the Government included sewerage for Nicosia and Famagusta in
the Second Five-Year Plan (1967-71) of the Republic. In early 1968, the
Mlunicipal Corporation of Nicosia, with Government approval, retained
MacLaren International Limited of Toronto, to make a comprehensive study
of the sewerage needs of Greater Nicosia. The NacLaren report includes
a Master Plan of sewers looking ahead for 50 years, and more detailed
plans, estimates and feasibility studies for the first three stages of
the Master Plan. It recommended that the first stage be constructed
immediately, followed by a second and third stage to be constructed in
the first decade.
1.03      The proposed project is the first stage of the Master Plan
recommended by MacLaren. It includes a complete sewage collection
system for the highest priority area of the city, the trunk mains
leading to the treatment site and the first stage treatment facility.
1.04      A Bank pre-appraisal mission visited Cyprus in February 1969
and recommended the project for further consideration. Certain of the
design standards were subsequently reviewed and amended to lower costs
by reducing sewer slopes, and therefore sewer depths, and by reducing
the diameters of the trunk sewers.

1.05      This report is based on information furnished by the Government
of Cyprus, the Municipality of Nicosia, the consultants' reports and on
field investigation by a Bank appraisal mission of January 9 - February 7,
1970 composed of Messrs. R. Bowering, B. Grover and R. Smith.
II. THE SECTOR
A. Relation to Economy
2.01      Cyprus, with an area Of 3,750 square miles, is the third largest
island in the M4editerranean. It has a typical Mediterranean climate with
hot, dry summers and variable winters with an average annual rainfall of
about 40 inches in the mountains and 12 to 18 inches in the plains. There
are no rivers with a perennial flow of water.
2.02      The total population is about 630,000 of whom nearly 500,000
belong to the Greek community, the remainder to the Turkish community.
The 1960 Constitution provided for division of governmental posts
between the two communities but certain aspects of the Constitution have
been the cause of dispute and the two national groups are now generally
separated on a de facto basis.
2.03      Notwithstanding this problem, growth in GNP has averaged nearly
7% per annum over the period 1962-67 and average per capita income is
now around US$830 per annum. Tourism has grown particularly rapidly and
tourist expenditures amounted to nearly US$19 million equivalent in
1969, which compares with earnings from commodity exports of some US$95 million.
2.04      The dominant activity in Cyprus is agriculture and exports in
this category increased by more than 50% over the period 1962-67.
Agricultural activity is more restricted by lack of water than lack of
land and yields from irrigated areas are some eight times greater than
those from dry-farmed areas. Irrigation projects receive financial
support from the Government and the treated waste water from the proposed
sewerage project will increase water available for irrigation purposes.
2.05      Nicosia, the capital city is also the main administrative and
commercial centre with a population in excess of 118,000.  During the
next decade it is estimated that population growth will be about 2.7%
per annum, compared with an estimated l.I-) per annum, for the island as
a whole, reflecting a trend to urbanization. The island's international
airport is located near the city so that Nicosia is also the main arrival
and departure point for tourists.



- 3-
B. Water Supply and Water Resources
2.06      Water is in short supply in Cyprus, with most of the water
sources, mainly groundwater, now approaching maximum development. Because
of the absence of sewer systems in Cyprus, no facility exists whereby
waste water can be collected, treated, and re-used for irrigation or
groundwater recharge to help alleviate the water shortage. Annex 1
describes the water resources and water supply situation in Cyprus and
the water organization in Nicosia. The water systems for Nicosia are
well rtm and have thus far been able to keep abreast of steadily increasing
demand.
C. The Present Sewerage Situation
2.07      Although most homes and buildings of the major towns of Cyprus
are now equipped with modern plumbing, sewage is still disposed of
privately through septic tanks and absorption pits, This arrangement is
satisfactory as long as the numnber of homes and buildings is limited and
the soil is poroLs.  With the increasing number of plumbing systems in
urban areas with non-porous clay soil, nuisances to sight and smell and
health hazards have grown and the cost of pumping and trucking septic
effluent has increased proportionally. In Nicosia, private firms, the
Government and the Municipality use 16 tank trucks for removing septic
effluent at a cost of some LC90,000 per year. The areas in Nicosia
with the most serious problems are those within the walls of the old
city and in the clay area south of the walls. In these areas, only the
construction of a public sewer system will permit a permanent and
satisfactory solution to the sewerage problem.
III.  TBE B=ORROTER
3.01      The Borrower would be a new agency, the Sewage Board of Nicosia
(the Board). The legislation enabling creation of the Board and other
similar Boards where required, was passed in January 1971. This legislation
provides that where the Board's area includes a municipality the Board
shall consist of the Mayor as Chairman and all members of the Municipal
Council, and where the area extends beyond municipal boundaries, as in
the case of Nicosia, additional representation on the Board could come
from outside areas. A permanent chief executive officer responsible for
day to day administration under the general policy guidance of the Board
will be appointed. Provision is made for the appointment of municipal
staff to work part-time for the Board.
3.02      The legislation is sound, and covers the general powers and
duties of a Sewage Board. The Board has the right to acquire compulsorily
land and rights-of-way, to borrow and issue securities, and to control



- 4 -
the type of wastes permitted to enter the sewers. The Board is empowered
to require owners of buildings with piped water supply to connect to the
sewers and to pass by-laws (subject to the approval of the Government's
Council of Ministers) setting tariffs and charges for sewerage services.
The legislation requires that the Board be financially independent, and
provides for the proper keeping of accounts and audit of the Board's books.
3.03      The principal officers of the Board would be the Chief Engineer
and the Accountant/Administrator. The Chief Engineer who will be respon-
sible for the day to day operation of the Board, is the present Municipal
Engineer, working for the Board on a part-time basis. This is an accept-
able arrangement since he has had full responsibility for development of
the project to date. The Board has agreed that it will appoint the
Accountant/Administrator prior to October 1, 1971 after notifying the
Bank sufficiently in advance of such appointment for the Bank to have
adequate opportunity to comment on it. The Board has further agreed that
it will similarly notify the Bank in connection with any future appointments
to the posts of Chief Engineer or Accountant/Administrator. Additional
staff, particularly a sewerage engineer will be needed during project
construction and the Board has agreed that he will be appointed not later
than October 1, 1971 (see Organizational Chart, Annex 2). The treatment
plant operator will be enployed while the plant is under construction.
No major problems are envisaged in creating an organization or recruiting
the staff.
3.04      The technical staff of the Board would receive training by the
consultants during the construction of the project. The Board has agreed
that the Treatment Plant Foreman would be given practical training of
approximately 3 months duration at a similar plant and that the Sewerage
Engineer and the Technical Assistant (Maintenance and Supervision) would
be given 3 months training in matters related to Sewerage System operation.
Other local staff, trained during the construction of the project, should
be able to operate and maintain the sewer system without additional extensive
training. No funds are provided in the project for training as amounts
required are relatively small and could be provided from the Board's working
capital.
3.05      As the legislation provides for the members of the Council to
be members of the Board, the finances of the Board will be controlled by
persons familiar with municipal operations. The Municipality has been well
managed and is in a sound financial position (Annex 3). Tariffs will be
set to recover full costs of the service (para 6.11). The accounts and
funds of the Board would be entirely separate from those of the Municipality.
3.06      Accounting will be carried out following sound public utility
practices including maintenance of detailed plant records and inclusion
of revenues and costs on an accrual basis. The Accountant/Administrator
(para 3.03) would be a competent accountant. Suitable accounting personnel
are available in Cyprus. With a competent accountant, consultant services
should not be needed. The legislation provides for audit by the Auditor-
General and this is satisfactory.



IV. THE PROJECT
A. ProJect Description
4.ol      The project is the first stage of a 1Waster Plan of sewerage
for Greater Nicosia.  The system would cover 1,060 acres and serve 32,000
residents occupying about 6,000 properties. It would consist of:
(i) piping for house connections;
(ii) 16 miles of connecting sewers;
(iii) 50 miles of lateral and minor trunk sewers;
(iv) 3 miles of main sewer between the collection system
and the treatment site; and
(v) a sewage treatment plant.
A detailed description is given in Annex 4, and see Maps 1 and 2.
Nl sewage would flow by gravity at self-cleansing velocities
to the treatment facility consisting of oxidation ponds. The treated
waste water would be suitable for discharge to the Pedios River or to a
nearby agricultural area that now cannot be irrigated because of lack of
water. The project wiould take about 3-1/2 years to complete (Annex 6).
4.02      Except for metering the flow of treated waste water leaving the
plant and providing a connection for a future irrigation system, the
project does not include any irrigation works. The development of an
irrigation system to use the waste water would be the responsibility of
the Department of Water Development (DWD) and the farmer beneficiaries,
advised by the Department of Agriculture (see para. 4.06).
4.03      Since it would be desirable to replace the water distribution
system within the walls of the old city at the same time that the sewage
system for this section is constructed in order to minimize costs, the
Water Commission has retained the consulting engineer for the project to
redesign the water system.
4.04      Approximately 6% (60 acres) of the project area is in the
Turkish sector. The detailed design for this part of the project has been
done by the consultant using survey data prepared for him by Turkish
Cypriots. In the present political climate there may be difficulty in
laying the sewers in the Turkish sector and if laid, there might be
difficulty in collecting sewage revenues. The electricity and water
authorities, which have continued to provide service into the Turkish
sector, have not been able to service their facilities or collect revenue
since 1963.



- 6 -
4.05      The part of the project and the reconstruction of the portion
of the old water system in the Turkish sector is readily separable from
the rest of the project area.  The sewers, which are of minimum size and
would be laid at minimum depth, are all upstream of sewers in the Greek
sector. If they are not laid now, it would not affect any part of the
rest of the project area; their future laying would require no further
work in the Greek sector.
4.06      The availability of treated waste water for irrigation will be
an important benefit of the project. Before arrangements for constructing
irrigation works can be made, however, the quantity and quality of the
effluent, which cannot be predicted accurately at this time, will have
to be known. The Department of Agriculture plans to make quality studies
on the basis of which it would provide advice on the crops suitable for
irrigation, and on an appropriate price for the water. Waste water from
similar plants is used successfully in other nearby countries and no
problem is envisaged, especially because the proposed legislation
authorizes the Board to control wastes entering the sewers. If the boron
content of the waste water is found to be sufficiently high to be injurious
to certain crops, for example, it could be lowered by controlling the type
of laundry detergents used by the public. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from the Government that these studies will begin within
twelve months of the plant becoming operational, and that the Board will
establish charges acceptable to the Bank for the sale of waste water.

4.o8      Estimates for pipe and accessories are based on quotations
received by the consultant from potential suppliers. As no sewerage
projects have been built in Cyprus, estimates for civil works were made
on the basis of contracts for similar work in the area. A physical
contingency of 15% has been allowed for all expenditures other than land
and engineering. A price escalation contingency of 10% has also been
allowed. This is considered adequate in view of the price trends in
Cyprus over the past few years and the short procurement period for
imported goods.
4.09      The foreign exchange cost of engineering services before July 1,
1969, (US$24,000), and of sewers presently under construction (US$175,000)
are considered part of the project, but are not proposed for Bank financing.
Therefore, they are included as local costs both in the table (para 4.07)
and in Annex 5.
4t.10    Wdith the exception noted above (para 4.09) the proposed Bank
loan would finance the full foreign exchange requirements of the project
including retroactive financing of the foreign exchange component of the
engineering services for detailed design paid since July 1, 1969. (These
costs to date since July 1, 1969 are estimated at US$80,000).
4.11      The local currency requirements of the project will be provided
as described in para 6.02.
C. Engineering and Construction
4.12      The consultants, i4IacLaren International Ltd. of Toronto, have
completed the detailed working drawings and are preparing tender documents.
They will evaluate the bids and supervise construction.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      All contracts will be bid on internationally following Bank
procurement guidelines. It is likely that, in addition to foreign
contractors, three local contractors would participate in the bidding
for civil works contracts. Practically all materials and equipment
required for the project would be imported.
4.14      Bank disbursement would be against the C.I.F. costs of imported
goods and the foreign exchange costs of engineering services.  Disbursements
on civil works contracts would be a fixed percentage of the costs represent-
ing the estimated imported components. This percentage has been agreed
at 35%.
4.15      Any loan funds not required for the project will be cancelled.

4.16      Steps are being taken now to acquire the treatment site, easements
and rights-of-way for applicable portions of trunk sewers. During negotia-
tions assurance were obtained that such land, easements, and rights-of-way
will be acquired by July 31, 1971.
E. Environmental Effects
4.17      The project will substantially improve the environment of the
city by removing potential health hazards and nuisances to sight and
smell caused by the many defective septic tanks and cesspits. No odor
nuisance is expected from the treatment plant which in any event is
down wind of the city. It will improve the nearby rural environment by
reducing the areas used for the dumping of septic tank cleanings. The
condition of the Pedios River will be improved by converting much of the
polluted water now entering the river into treated waste water suitable
for the irrigation of certain crops.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The present method of sewage disposal using private septic tanks
and absorption pits produces nuisances and hazards to health, and Nicosia's
problems become worse each year. As the population density and the water
use per capita increases, the ability of the soil to absorb effluent
decreases, and maintenance costs of private sewer systems rise. The only
satisfactory answer to Nicosia's problem of disposing of municipal liquid
waste is through a central collection and disposal system.
5.02      The need for a sewerage system has long been recognized by
Government and the MIunicipality, which has commissioned reports on sewers.
It has employed engineering consultants to prepare a staged Master Plan
for sewers, and has already invested IC73,000 (US$175,000) in construction
of sewers in an area in which road construction is being carried out.
5.03      The area to be sewered is now subject to building height
restrictions because of the present problem of sewage disposal. Construction
of sewers will permit relaxation of these restrictions, in effect, increasing
the land supply in the central area of 1Jicosia. Resultant higher densities
in this area should result in more efficient use of roads, water supply and
electricity systems, etc., and will thereby permit delaying new infra-
structure investments in outlying areas.
5.04      The sewerage system will also end the rising costs of septic
tank construction, maintenance and the trucking of effluent. In Nicosia,
trucking costs are estimated at EC90,000 for the year 1969 and are
expected to increase steadily until sewers are built. Most of this cost
is incurred in the project area.



- 9 -
5.05      Agriculture is more restricted by lack of water than lack of
land. Yields fram irrigated areas are, on the average about eight times
greater than those from dry-farmed areas, and there is a need to conserve
and fully utilize all possible sources including treated waste water for
irrigation purposes. The actual benefits are difficult to quantify as
they will be dependent upon both quantity and quality of the effluent.
However, the volume of treated waste water estimated to be available by
1979 should increase the value of the agricultural output up to about
£C35,000 per annum depending on the crop. For financial projections it
has been assumed that waste water will be sold at 10 mils/m3 (US$0.09
per 1,000 gals) which is in the middle of a general range of prices
presently being paid for irrigation water. At this price the estimated
1979 revenue is £C10,500 which is about 3% of the Board's total revenues.
When related to increase in agricultural output the value of the treated
waste water would range between 7 and 35 mils/in3.
5.o6      Cyprus has a rapidly expanding tourist industry.  The island's
international airport is located near Nicosia so that the city is the
main arrival and departure point for tourists, most of whom thus spend
some time in the city. The first stage sewer system will help not only
to make the area more attractive to visitors, but will also reduce the
hazards of epidemic disease which could be disastrous for the tourist
industry.
5.07      The internal financial return on the project calculated on the
basis of net project revenues is approximately 12% (Annex 7).

- 11 -
6.02      The four sources of new capital are briefly described below:
(a) IBRD Loan WC1,458,000
For the purposes of this report, interest on the Bank loan has
been assumed at 7-1/h%. A term of 25 years, including a grace period of
about 4 years is proposed. The estimated physical life of the assets is
over 50 years.
(b)  Cyprus Loan Commission.    c65,ooo
Funds have already been provided by the Loan Commission to the
Municipality of Nicosia to cover the cost of sewer construction which was
carried out concurrently with road reconstruction in 1970. This debt
will be transferred to the Sewage Board. The terms of the loan provide
for repayment over 12 years with interest at 5-1/2% per annum.
(c) Loan from Government of Cyprus tC200,000
The Government will provide this sun for working capital. This
loan will be for a 25-year period at 6-1/2% interest, including a grace
period of 7 years on amortization, and without payment of interest for the
first 2 years.
(d) Local bond issues EC1,700,000
The major portion of the local currency cost is to be met from
the proceeds of bond issues in Cyprus, underwritten by the Central Bank
and guaranteed by the Government. Each issue will be for a 12-year term
and at 7-1/1 - 7-1/2% interest, with a sinking fund to provide for
redemption of 50% of the amounts issued.  The Government  has guaranteed
refinancing of the remaining 50% for a further 12-year period. Such bond
issues, together with the bond issues for the Famagusta project, would
at the same time assist the Central Bank in the development of a capital
market in Cyprus. A substantial portion of these issues should be taken
up by the commercial banks as these are subject to exchange controls
and cannot invest outside Cyprus without permission. To the extent that
the bonds are not sold the Government will take up the balance through
the Central Bank. These issues will also provide funds for loans to
householders for financing connection costs in cases where the householder
cannot afford to meet connection costs by payment in cash. Actual issues
will be arranged to provide the Board with funds as required but for the
purpose of financial projections it has been assumed that issues totalling
1Cl,500,000 will be made during the period 1971-197 with the balance
of !C200,000 being issued in 1975 to provide funds for additional loans
for house connections.
The Government has also undertaken to provide any residual
funds which may be required.

B. Sewerage Tariffs, and Financial Prospects of the Sewage Board
6.03      The Board's revenues will come from sewer service charges based
on water sales and property assessments. About two-thirds of this revenue
will come from property assessments during the next ten years.
6.04      Interest and debt redemption will represent approximately 90%
of the Board's annual costs. Charges Will. be set to cover annual costs
in the early years. With the anticipated growth in water consumption
and property assessments, these charges would generate cash surpluses
beginning in 1277.
6.05      The financial projections assume charges of 50 mils/m3 on water
sales, 36 mils/fC of assessed property value in the project area and 12
mils/tC of assessed property value in areas to be sewered at a later date.
The same required revenue could be obtained from other combinations of
charges and assessments with similar incidence on users. The exact rates
to be charged will depend upon final costs of the project and upon actual
assessed property values and water consumption, but the Board will commence
levying charges based on property assessments effective from January 1, 1973.
Charges based on water consumption will commence as properties are connected
to the sewers.
6.06      The sewage rate of 50 mils/m3 on water consumption would be
equal to the initial rate block for water charges, also 50 mils/m3; the
assumed sewage assessment of 36 mils/EC of assessed value for properties
in the project area, would be 40% more than the municipal tax levy of
25 mils/IC of assessed value.
6.07      To assess the implications of the annual charges, an example
lower-income householder with a monthly water consumption of 15 m3 and a
property having an assessed value of fC300 1/ will presently pay approx-
imately S118 per annum for water and municipal taxes. Charges for sewerage
will increase this annual payment by approximately 1C20.
6.o8      In addition to the annual charges, property owners will incur
initial connection charges. In the event that a property owner may not
be able to afford the cash cost of making the connection the Board will
provide financial assistance. Funds will be made available to the Board
through the proceeds of Bond issues and will be re-lent to householders
who will be required to repay over an 11 year term with interest at 7-1/2%
per annum.  Collection of these amounts will be arranged through the
Inland Revenue Department by means of addition to the property tax.
1 The present basis of property assessment is out of date and assessed
values are related to pre-1930 costs. Revision of this assessment
base has been under Government review for some time, but discussion
of the position did not indicate any probability of the work being
undertaken in the near future.



- 13 -
6.og      The revenue projections for water usage and for the sewer user
charge are based upon the expectation of present water consumption
increasing as fo'lows: in the project area outside the walls of the old
city, by 3-1/4% per annum; within the walls, by 1-1/4% per annum until
the obsolete water system is replaced in 1974, at which point an immediate
increase of 50% in per capita consunption is forecast which would increase
thereafter by 3-1/4% per annum. Revenue projections from property
assessments are based upon present assessments with an annual rate of
growth of 3%, which is equal to the rate of growth over the past 8 years.
6.10      The charges based on water consumption will be billed and
collected by the water authorities and the charges based on property
assessments will be billed and collected by the Inland Revenue Department.
The Inland Revenue Department presently bills and collects municipal taxes
for a 2-1/2% commission. Similar arrangements will be made in connection
with the sewerage assessments. Agreement has been reached with the Water
Board to collect sewerage charges at a rate of commission not to exceed 5%.
6.11      During negotiations assurance was obtained that the Board will
maintain charges sufficient to generate annual revenues to cover:
(i) operating expenses (including depreciation);
(ii) debt interest;
(iii)  repayment of debt (including sinking fund payments)
to the extent not covered by depreciation, and
(iv) provision for a reasonable reserve.
6.12      Projected rates of return on net plant would be 7.6% in 1976
when the project is completed and the majority of properties in the project
area connected, increasing steadily thereafter, reaching 10% in 1979
(Annex 8).
6.13      The sewerage Master Plan Drovides for system extensions in
due course but these have not been included in the financial projections
as the timing of the construction is too uncertain. Substantial extensions
appear unlikely before the late 1970's.
6.14      Details of the financial projections through 1979 are shown
in Annexes 8, 9, 10 and 11.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) The Board will appoint and train required staff (paragraphs
3.03 and 3.01)



- 14 -
(b)  The Government will undertake studies leading to the cptimum
use of treated waste water (paragraph h.06).
(c)  The Government will ensure provision of local financing for
the project (paragraph 6.02).
(d)  The Board will finance the cost of connections in cases where
property owners are not able to meet the costs of connection
by payment in cash. (Paragraph 6.08).
(e)  The Board will establish and maintain charges and assessments
which will ensure revenues sufficient to cover operating costs
and debt service requirements plus a reasonable reserve
(paragraph 6.11).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$3.5 million, for a term of 25 years including a 4-year grace period.

CYPRUS
NICOSIA SEWERAGE PROJECT
WATER RESOURCES AM PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY IN CYPRTU6
Relation to Cyprus Economy
1.        Cyprus, an island of 3,750 square miles with a population of
630,000, has a typical Mediterranean climate with light annual rainfall
and hot, dry summers. Annual rainfall, which occurs in the winter,
averages 18 inches, varying between 12 inches on the coast and 40 inches
in the mountains. There are no perennial rivers and the only natural
storage of water is in the gromndwater aquifers.  Storage sites for
development of surface water are relatively few and expensive to develop.
Agriculture, the most important activity on the island, is by far the
largest user of water. Agricultural production, the value of which has
increased 9% per year since independence, is limited by water resources
available for irrigation. Public water supply for domestic and industrial
use is the second largest user of the water resources. The tourist
industry, which is very dependent upon good water supply systems, is
expanding rapidly and may shortly become next only to agriculture as a
producer of foreign exchange. Since there will be increasing competition
for the limited water between irrigation and public water systems, return
of public water to agriculture through the reclamation of sewage will
become increasingly important for Cyprus.
2.        The groundwater levels in all but one of the island's aquifers
are dropping as a result of continued over-pumping. The Department of
Water Development (DWD) estimates that half the volume of groundwater now
being pumped, most of which is used for irrigation, represents over-
extraction. Two significant UNDP studies on water resources are just
about complete. One, an evaluation of the island's groundwater resources
contains recommendations as to how to best use these scarce resources.
The other provides an inventory of all surface water resources along with
possible storage sites so that a Master Plan can be prepared for total
water resource development. The studies reveal that additional irrigation
water carnot be provided in the immediate vicinity of Nicosia or Famagusta.
Public Water Supplies
3.        Groundwater is the only source of the island's public water
supplies at present. One-third of the population living in the four major
towns (Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta and Larnaca) either have an adequate
supply now or an adequate future supply is assured by the Department of
Water Development (DWD). DWD is responsible for future bulk supply



ANINEX 1
Page 2 of 2 pages
of domestic water, although some of both Nicosia's and Famagusta's older
sources are locally owned. DWD began supplying some of Famagusta's bulk
supply in 1970 and will increase the supply still further over the next
three years. D W also has plans for adding to Nicosia's bulk supply over
the next five years. The remainder of the population live in some 628
villages of which over 85% now have piped water providing at least 10
gallons per capita per day.  Only l0io of the population live in villages
facing a serious water shortage. The water supply schemes of the villages
are planned and constructed by DID, which is responsible for the bulk
supply of water to the villages. Local financially independent water
commissions are responsible for operation, administration and retailing
the water through water meters to the public.
The P'esent Water Supply Situation in Nicosia
4.        Three authorities are involved in the water supply of Nicosia.
The old city "within the walls" is supplied by the Nicosia Water Commission
through an old-fashioned system which is in urgent need of replacing. The
area outside the walls, but within the pre-1968 municipal boundary, is
served by the Nicosia Water Board, an independent agency. The remaining
area of Greater Nicosia. forming a ring around the Nicosia Water Board
area, is served by the Department of 1Wter Development.  The Nicosia 1hter
Board, which reads meters, bills and collects for the three separate water
authorities will bill and collect the sewerage charges based on water use.

NICOSIA SEWERAGE PROJECT
PRDJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Introduction
The project is the execution of the first stage of a master
plan of a sewerage system for Greater Nicosia. It includes construction
of a complete sewage collection system for the area of the city most
acutely in need of sewerage, the main trunks through the project area to
the treatment site, and construction of the first stage treatment plant.
The topography is such that sewage from the entire metropolitan area can
be drained by gravity to the treatment site.
B. The Sewage Collection System
The sewage collection system will cover 1,060 acres and serve
about 32,000 people living in some 6,000 individual properties. About
one third of the area covers the southern half of the old city "within
the walls", and the rest covers a densely populated part of the clay zone
south of the wall.
About 42 miles of 8 inch lateral sewers, and 6 miles of 10 inch
to 24 inch sub-truink sewers will provide a sewer for every street in the
project area. About 16 miles of 4 inch and 6 inch connections to the
street sewers from the property line of each building plot will enable
practically all present and future buildings in the project area to be
connected to the sewerage system without further street excavation. Piping
will also be provided for connections on private property. The sewers
will be laid at slopes giving a minimunm self-cleansing sewage velocity
of 2-1/2 feet per second. The minimum sewer depth of 6 feet, besides
providing good drainage of practically every plumbing system in the area,
will enable future work to be done on other underground utilities without
disturbing the sewerage system.
The laying of the sewers in the section within the walls of the
old city will be done concurrently with the rehabilitation of the water
system in that area.
About 60 acres of the project within the walls of the old city
are in the Turkish sector where administrative and political problems will
have to be solved before sewers can be laid. If the problems can be solved
during the project years, this small area can be sewered as part of the
project. If not, the rest of the proect will not be affected, and the
sewers can be built in the Turkish sector later.

C. Main Trunk Sewers
9he main trunk sewers include about 1.7 miles of 36 inch main
through the sewage collection area, and 3.3 miles of 40 and 44 inch mains
leading from the project area to the treatment plant. All the trunk sewers
will be laid at grades giving sewage velocities of better than 3-1/2 feet
per second, when full, and at least 2 feet per second at the outset when
the sewers operate at less than capacity.
During appraisal studies were made to see if any trunk mains
could be reduced in diaraeter. While no advantage could be found in
reducing the diameter of the 36 inch trunk sewer through the walled city,
as a result of the studies the diameter of the main trunk down-stream of
the walled city was reduced froram 54 inches to 44 inches, and the number
of manholes was reduced.
D. Sewers Presently Under Construction
About a mile of trunk sewers were laid in 1970 concurrently
with reconstruction and realignment of some major roads. This sewer forms
part of the project and is regarded as preliminary construction. (Para 6.02b).
E. Treatment Plant
The treatment plant will be built on a well chosen site on the
right bank of the Pedios River about three miles northeast of the project
area. An industrial district screens the site from any residential or
commercial district.  Yoreover, the prevailing wind is away from the city.
Sewage from any part of the metropolitan area can flow to the site by
gravity. Effluent from the plant can flow by gravity either to a nearby
irrigable farming area or to the Pedios River below town.
Initial treatment will be by aerated and facultative lagoons.
Two aerated lagoons each 1 acre in area and 8 feet deep will operate in
parallel. The sewage will then pass to 4 facultative lagoons each 3-1/2
acres in area and 5 feet deep. The capacity of the plant will be about
2.2 Imgd. This is an inexpensive type of treatment, which, in the climate
of Nicosia, should provide an effluent suitable for either irrigation or
discharge to the Pedios River. Sufficient land will be obtained for future
expansion. If, at a later stage, a more compact type of plant should be
deemed necessary, the first stage lagoons could be still used for effluent
polishing. The plant will include coxininution of the influent and provide
for chlorination of the effluent.
F. Future Expansion
The project area can be expanded by adding small tributary areas
to the south at any time. Subsequent stages of the Master Plan can be
sewered without changes to the trunk system and with sinple expansion of
the treatment plant.

NICOSIA SEWERAGE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANTCIAL PROJECTIONS
Income Statements
1.        Annual water consumption is based initially upon present water
consumption with annual increases as detailed in paragraph 6.09.
2.        Annual property assessment is projected to increase at 3%
per annum, based on historical growth over the period 1960-68.
3.        Effluent sale for the years 1974-79 is based on the expectation
sales will equal 55% of water consumption after taking into account losses
between water supplied and treatment plant delivery, and possible non-
saleability of effluent in the three winter months.  The 10 mil/m3 sale
price is an estimate and represents the mid-point in a probable range.
4.        Charges of 50 mils on water consumption, 36 mils on assessed
property values in the project area and 12 mils in the areas to be sewered
at later stages, are assumed in order to generate required revenues in the
initial years of operation.
5.        Collection charges of 2-1/2% on property assessments and of 5%
on water consumption are as agreed between the Board and the collecting
authorities. The 5% rate is a maximum and the actual charge may be slightly
less.
6.        Depreciation has been charged at 2% per annum, based upon
approximate average physical life of the assets.
7.        The proposed collection agencies, the Inland Revenue Department
and the Water Board, are substantially free from bad debts. It is
considered that this situation will also apply to sewerage bills and bad
debts are therefore considered to be negligible.
Cash Flow Statements
8.        Cash operating expenses amount to approximately 10% of total
costs. As most of such operating expenses are labour costs the Accounts
Payable at the year-end will be negligible and thus have been ignored.
Inventory has also been ignored as no substantial cash outlay is anticipated.
It is estimated that year-end Accounts Receivable will amount to approximately
10% of annual revenues, excluding sales of effluent.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 2 pages
9.        Bond issues are assumed to be made to meet cash requirements.
10.       Sinking fund investments are assuned to earn 6% per annum.
11.       Timing of future major extensions is uncertain and construction
of Stage II of the Master Plan is unlikely to comaence before the late
1970's.
Balance Sheets
12.       Amounts due to the Loan Commissioners represent advances made
for sewer construction coamenced in 1970 in areas where road reconstruction
was to be carried out.
13.       The sum of LC200,000 advanced by the Government of Cyprus during
1971 is intended to cover working capital and preliminary expenditures.
1h.       Loans to householders for connection costs are assumed to
cover 80% of total estimated connection costs. Repayments are based on
an 11 year term and interest at 7-1/2% per annum.
