IOTH WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REFUBLIC OF CYPRUS
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$3.5
million to the Sewage Board of Nicosia and on a proposed loan in an
amount in various currencies equivalent to US$1.9 million to the Sew-
age Board of Famagusta.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made four loans to, or guaranteed by, the
Republic of Cyprus for power and port projects. The projects now
proposed were first brought to the attention of the Bank in May 1967.
In early 1968 the Nicosia and Famagusta Municipal Councils engaged
consultants to prepare Iviaster Plans for both cities, which were com-
pleted in 1969. The present projects arose from these plans.
3.        A mission to appraise both the Nicosia Sewerage Project
and the Famagusta Sewerage and Drainage Project visited Cyprus in
January-February 1970. At that time there was no modern sewerage
system in Cyprus. A Sewage and Drainage Law, creating sewage boards
and setting forth their powers was prepared, but continued delays in
the passage of this legislation held up further consideration of these
projects. This legislation was finally enacted in January 1971 and
the proposed Borrowers were established. Negotiations were held in
W4ashington in February. The principal negotiators for the Borrowers
were Mr. C. Kythreotis, Chairman of the Municipal Council of Nicosia,
and Mr. A. Pouyouros, Mayor of Famagusta. Mr. A. Anastasiou, Direc-
tor General of the Ministry of Interior and Defense, was the principal
representative of the Guarantor.

4.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Cyprus as
at February 28, 1971:

5.        The projects for which these loans were made have been, or are
being carried out satisfactorily. Construction under the Ports Project
(Loan No. 628CY) is on schedule and no delays are expected. Disbursements
from the loan account, however, have been delayed due to the Government's
submission of incomplete withdrawal applications. It is expected that this
will be corrected shortly and that disbursements will attain the rate pro-
jected toward the end of this year.
6.        No other loan proposal for Cyprus is expected to be submitted to
the Executive Directors for approval within this fiscal year.
7.        IFC has had no operations in Cyprus and none is contemplated in
the near future.

PART III - THE PROJECTS
10.       Two appraisal reports entitled "Appraisal of the Nicosia Sew-
erage Project - Cyprus" (PU-45a), and "Appraisal of the Famagusta Sewerage
and Drainage Project - Cyprus" (PU-46a), both dated March 9, 1971, are
attached (Nos. 1 and 2).
11.       Wiater is in short supply in Cyprus, with most of the water sources,
mainly groundwater, now approaching maximum development. In the absence
of sewer systems in Cyprus, waste water cannot be collected, treated, and
re-used for irrigation or groundwater recharge to help alleviate the water
shortage. Furthermore, with the increasing number of individual plumbing
systems in urban areas wfith non-porous clay soil, health hazards and nui-
sances to sight and smell have grown. In these areas, only the construc-
tion of a public sewer system will permit a permanent and satisfactory
solution to the sewerage problem.
12.       The propGsed Borrowers are new agencies created by authority of
the Sewage and Drainage Law and known as the SewJage Board of Nicosia and
the Seawage Board of Famagusta. Composed primarily of members of the re-
spective Municipal Councils and with the authority to utilize Municipal
Council staff as needed, the Sewage Boards have been given the powers
necessary to carry out their functions efficiently. No major problems
are envisaged in building up the organizations or recruiting their staff.
13.       The Nicosia project would be the first stage of a IMaster Plan
for sewers for the capital city of Cyprus, serving initially 32,000 of
the city's 118,000 residents. The project area of 1,060 acres in south
central Nicosia is that part of the city where the need for a sewer system
is greatest because of population density and where present disposal methods
are creating the greatest problem. The project includes 16 miles of con-
necting sewers and 53 miles of lateral, sub-trunk and main trunk sewers
through which sewzage will flow by gravity to the treatment site.  It also
includes construction of a treatment plant, which will provide effluent
which should prove suitable for irrigation or could safely be discharged
into the Pedios River.
14.       A portion of the project area lies within the walls of the old
city of Nicosia, where an archaic water supply system will be reconstructed
concurrently with the installation of sewers but will not be financed frcm
the loan. It is hoped that the political situation in Cyprus will permit
construction on schedule of the very small part of the project within the
Turkish sector of Nicosia. If this should prove impossible, however, con-
struction of this portion at a later time would pose no technical problems.
15.       The Famagusta project includes both a sewerage and a drainage
system. The sewerage system would be the first stage of a Mlaster Plan of
sewers for Famagusta, serving initially 12,000 of the town's 42,000 residents
and accommodation for about 4,000 tourists.   The project area of 420 acres
near the beach is that part of the Municipality where, as in Nicosia, the
need for a sewerage system is greatest because of population and tourist



density and where present disposal methods are creating the greatest prob-
lem. The sewerage system would include 7.5 miles of connecting sewers, 18
miles of gravity sewers and pressure transmission mains, four pumping sta-
tions and a treatment plant. The waste water produced should be suitable
either for irrigation or for discharge to a nearby reservoir to recharge
the aquifer.
16.       The storm water drainage component of the project would improve
the drainage of two areas totalling 120 acres near the waterfront and an in-
land area of about 40 acres. The storm water from the waterfront areas would
be discharged to the harbor. That from the inland area would be discharged
into Ayios Loukas Reservoir to allow re-use of the water. The system would
include about four miles of gravity storm drains, a pumping station, and
about 0.6 miles of pressure main.
17.       The total cost of the proposed projects is $6.8 million for Nicosia
and $3.2 million for Famagusta including interest during construction on the
Bank loans. The Boards' revenues will come from sewer service charges, based
on water sales, and property assessments. Interest and debt redemption will
represent approximately 90 percent of the Boards' annual costs. Charges will
be set to cover annual costs in the early years. Beginning in 1977, these
charges would, with the anticipated growth in water consumption and property
assessments, also generate cash surpluses. The draft Loan Agreements contain
a rate covenant requiring the Borrowers to maintain charges sufficient to
generate annual revenues to cover operating expenses, including taxes and
maintenance, interest and amortization or depreciation (whichever is greater),
and provision for a reasonable reserve.
18.       The projects would be entirely debt financed.   The funds necessary
during the construction period (1971-1974) would be provided in three ways:
the Bank loans, local bond issues, and loans from the Government. The Bank
loans would finance the full foreign exchange requirements of the projects
including interest during construction. The major portion of the local cur-
rency requirements would be met from the proceeds of bond issues by the Sew-
age Boards, underwritten by the Central Bank and guaranteed by the Government.
Each issue will be for a 12-year term at about 71½ percent interest, with a
sinking fund to provide for redemption of 50 percent of the amount issued.
The Government would guarantee refinancing the remaining 50 percent for a
further 12-year period. Preliminary expenditures and working capital would
be financed through government loans which would be for a 25-year period at
about 6e½ percent interest, including a grace period of seven years. There
would be no payment of interest for the first two years. The draft Loan
Agreements provide that no further debt can be incurred by the Sewage Boards
unless total annual debt service is covered 1.3 times by net revenues.
19.       Executive Directors have been advised that retroactive financing
of the foreign exchange component of engineering services is proposed. This
would entail financing payments made since July 1, 1969 for Nicosia (approx-
imately $80,000) and November 15, 1969 for Famagusta (approximately $52,000).
These relatively long periods arise as a result of the delay in passage of
the necessary legislation over which the Borrowers had no control.

20.       Individual house connections will be mandatory and will form
an integral part of the two projects. The piping to be used for these
connections will be purchased by the Sewage Boards and would be financ-
ed from the proceeds of the proposed loans. Their installation, how-
ever, will be the responsibility of the house-owners. The average cost
will probably be less than $200, and for those unable to afford this
cost, the Sewage Boards are empowered to lend the amount needed. The
Sewage Boards intend to finance these sub-loans from a portion of the
proceeds of the bond issues referred to above.
21.       Loan funds would be disbursed on the basis of the estimated
foreign exchange costs:
(i) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for pipes and
equipment and for consultants' services;
(ii)  35 percent of total expenditures for civil works; and
(iii)  100 percent of interest and other charges on the Bank
Loans during construction.
Any surplus funds under the proposed loans would be cancelled. Pro-
curement will be carried out under full international competitive bid-
ding and in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
22.       Both projects are justified by the improvement of the envi-
ronment, public health and the value of treated waste water for irriga-
tion. Furthermore, the indirect benefits to tourism should be consid-
erable, since Nicosia is the main arrival and departure point for tour-
ists, many of whom spend some time in the city. Famagusta is also one
of the principal tourist centers and the sewerage system is urgently
needed if beach pollution is to be avoided. The sewerage systems will
also end the rising costs of septic tank construction and maintenance
and the trucking of effluent. The estimated internal financial rate
of return on the Nicosia project is 12 percent, and on the Famagusta
project it is 13 percent.
PART IV - LBGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreements between the Bank and the Sewage
Boards of Nicosia and Famagusta, respectively, the draft Guarantee
Agreements between the Republic of Cyprus and the Bank, the Reports
of the Committees provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of Resolutions approving the pro-
posed Loans to the Sewage Boards of Nicosia and Famagusta are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
24.       The draft Loan Agreements which include the provisions referred
to in Part III of this Report conform substantially to previous loan
agreements for projects of this type.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
25.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Cyprus" (EA 174 a) and an updating memorandum on the economic sit-
uation were distributed to the Executive Directors or. October 31, 1968
and June 5, 1969, respectively. A basic data sheet is annexed.
26.       The political situation in Cyprus has not changed signifi-
cantly during the recent past. Representatives of the Greek and Turk-
ish commtunities are continuing to meet and discuss problems, and the
growing demand for labor in the Greek community is providing increas-
ing opportunities for the Turkish labor   force.  Jhile no breakthrough
has yet been achieved, there is general agreement that the political
disputes should be solved through a negotiated settlement.
27.       In spite of the political difficulties, GNP in real terms
increased at an annual average rate of 6 percent during the first Five
Year Plan (1962-1966) exceeding the target rate of 5.5 percent. Invest-
ment and savings also increased. Exports and earnings from tourism
rose significantly. Conservative fiscal and monetary policies resulted
in budget surpluses, internal and external financial stability and ac-
cumulation of external reserves.
28.       The Second Plan (1967-71) stresses the development of agri-
culture, industry and tourism as a means of diversifying and restruc-
turing the sources of income and foreign exchange so as to provide a
more stable economic basis than the declining mining sector and the
expenditures of foreign troops (including UNi forces) stationed in
Cyprus. Actual growth which averaged about 7.5 percent yearly exceed-
ed the 7 percent target rate in 1967-70. The most dynamic components
of demand have been exports and investments. Earnings from tourism
have increased markedly.   Gross investments represented about 20 per-
cent of GNP in 1968 and like savings have been rising at about 11 per-
cent per annum.
29.       After several years of stability, inflationary pressures
started to appear in 1968. Between end 1967 and end 1970 prices rose
by 11 percent. More importantly a wave of labor disputes in late
1968 resulted in wage increases ranging from 10 to 30 percent. Imports
rose sharply, by 20 percent in 1969 and by nearly 10 percent in 1970.
The government has been seriously concerned about this situation and
has taken steps to meet it by resorting to more restrictive monetary
and fiscal policies and other supporting measures designed to encour-
age savings and to discourage speculation. The full impact of these
measures cannot be forecast accurately but they appear to be adequate
without being unduly deflationary.



-8 -
30.       Provided that the slow return to normal relations between
the two communities is not hampered by serious unrest the potential
for econo.mic development is good. During the Second Five-Year Plan
(1967-71) total fixed investment of £186 million is contemplated and
the ratio of investment to GNP is projected to increase from 17.7 per-
cent in 1966 to 21.2 percent in 1971. Over 26 percent of the total
investment during the Plan was expected to be financed from foreign
sources, of which about two-thirds by transfers and net factor income
from abroad and the rest by capital inflows.
31.       The total outstanding external public debt of Cyprus as of
December 31, 1969, was about US$50 million of which US$32 million was
disbursed. Service payments were just over 2 percent of gross foreign
exchange earnings in 1969. In spite of its need for foreign capital
for productive investment and its low debt service burden, Cyprus does
not have good prospects for borrowing in external markets because of
its internal political difficulties. It has an excellent debt service
record and is creditworthy for the proposed Bank loans.
PART VI - COIiPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed loans.
