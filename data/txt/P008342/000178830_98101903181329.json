The project area of 1,060 acres in south central\n            Nicosia is that part of the city where the need for a sewer\n            system is greatest because of population density and where\n            present disposal methods are creating the greatest problem.\n            The project includes 16 miles of connecting sewers and 53\n            miles of lateral, sub-trunk and main trunk sewers through\n            which sewage will flow by gravity to the treatment site. It\n            also includes construction of a treatment plant, which will\n            provide effluent should prove suitable for irrigation or\n            could safely be discharged into the Pedios River. The\n            Famagusta project includes both a sewerage and a drainage\n            system. The sewerage system would be the first stage of a\n            Master Plan of sewers for Famagusta, serving initially\n            12,000 of the town's 42,000 residents and accommodation\n            for about 4,000 tourists. The project area of 420 acres near\n            the beach is that part of the Municipality where, as in\n            Nicosia, the need for a sewerage system is greatest because\n            of population and tourist density and where present disposal\n            methods are creating the greatest problem. The sewerage\n            system would include 7.5 miles of connecting sewers, 18\n            miles of gravity sewers and pressure transmission mains,\n            four pumping stations and a treatment plant. The wastewater\n            produced should be suitable either for irrigation or for\n            discharge to a nearby reservoir to recharge the aquifer."}, "docdt": "1971-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
