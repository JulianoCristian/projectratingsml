This will be achieved by: a) improving\n            existing infrastructure; b) improving access to the area for\n            industrial, commercial and passenger traffic; c) maintaining\n            the SBF asset base, including protection of the environment;\n            and d) strengthening the capacity of the Subic Bay\n            Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to manage and administer the\n            facility. The project consists of three components. The\n            first is the site improvement, which includes improvement of\n            land access; airport improvements; port repairs; a pilot\n            standard factory building development; and the provision of\n            miscellaneous equipment for security and maintenance\n            purposes. The second component is technical assistance and\n            training to strengthen the institutional capacity of the\n            SBMA and to provide appropriate systems for the\n            implementation of freeport policies. The third is\n            environmental protection, which includes the carrying out of\n            an environmental baseline survey, the provision of\n            monitoring equipment and institutional support to establish\n            a sound environmental infrastructure at the SBF."}, "docdt": "1994-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
