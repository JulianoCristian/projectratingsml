To this end, a\n            strong legal framework is required, not only to build\n            institutional capacity, but to enhance the operating\n            autonomy, and flexibility of a government-owned and\n            controlled corporation, and prevent the limitations\n            encountered by the SBMA's charter, and dual status.\n            Project changes should be rationally evaluated, and the\n            inclusion of a strong social development components,\n            significantly enhances private sector development."}, "docdt": "2000-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
