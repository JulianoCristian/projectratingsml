ecoregions in the Recipient's territory: the\n            Inland Atlantic Rainforest and the Araucaria Forest regions;\n            and (6) to design and implement a model for improving\n            biodiversity conservation in the Recipient's territory.\n            The Panel recommends to the Board of Executive Directors\n            that it approve the Panel's proposal to refrain from\n            issuing a recommendation at this time on whether an\n            investigation is warranted in this case, but rather await\n            further developments on the matters raised in the Request\n
