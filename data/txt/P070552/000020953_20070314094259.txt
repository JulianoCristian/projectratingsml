                           BRAZIL PARANABIODIVERSITY PROJECT


1. IntroductoryStatement

This Project Paper informs the Board of the second-order restructuring for the Brazil Parana
Biodiversity GEF Trust Fund Grant No. 051007. The Beneficiary has requested a reallocation o f
funds betweenGrant Agreement categories together with amendments to the Grant Agreement in
order to improve project implementation and address the issues raised by the recently completed
Technical Audit' included inthe Bank's management response to the InspectionPanel2.


2. Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

The Brazil Parana Biodiversity Project i s supported by a U S $ 8.0 million grant from the Global
Environment Facility Trust FundTF05 1007. The Grant Agreement betweenthe State o f Parana,
Brazil, and IBRD was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 21, 2002 and
became effective August 27, 2002. The closing date i s currently set for January 31,2009.

Disbursements to date total US$4.3 million (54% of the total), leaving a balance of US$3.7
million to be disbursed over the next 24 months. After a slow start, implementation has
accelerated, and US$ 2.5 million has disbursed during the last 18 months. The Beneficiaries'
Action Plan, calls for disbursement o f US$ 4.9 million during this period, o f which US$ 3.7
would be from the GEF Grant and US$1.2 million would be from counterpart funds. This would
be disbursedinthe categories according to the table inAnnex 1.

As describedinthe PAD, the primary objectives of the Project are to (a) to support biodiversity
conservation and sustainable natural resource management in two highly threatened ecoregions
in the State of Parana, the Brazilian Inland Atlantic Rainforest and Araucaria Forest and b)
design and implement a model for improving biodiversity conservation in Parana. The Project's
four components are as follows:

    Component I: Education and Capacity Building - provides training in biodiversity
    conservation to Government officials, rural communities and civil society organizations to
    encourage active engagement inthe Project;

    Component 11: Biodiversity Management - works with direct stakeholders to establish
    microcatchment-based corridors and encourage environmentally benign agricultural
    production systems;

                                                        2

    Component 111: Control and Protection - supports reform of the state's environmental
    monitoring and evaluation capacity, development of norms for licensing activities with
    environmental impact, and research to develop programs for the protection o f endangered
    species;

    Component IV: Project Administration- provides for overall coordinationand monitoring
    o f the Project's physical and financial performance. Additionally it includes the review and
    revision of relevant legislation, regulations and enforcement and incentive systems.

The project has been progressing well towards meeting the Input, Output and Outcome goals laid
out inthe PAD. Main achievements as o f December 31,2006 include:

            involved 12,93 8 producers inrestoration activities withinmicro-catchments
            (compared to the 19,600 planned for the end o f the project);
            ensured 1,7231productiveunitshave their productionsystems adapted for biodiversity
            conservation (compared to the 2,700 planned for the end of the project);
            engaged 537,000 ha of a planned800,000 inthe implementationof the project's three
            Target Corridors;
            trained 38,135 producers (compared with the 19,600 planned inthe PAD);
            developed all 40 o f the planned 40 agro-ecological modules;
            implemented26 environmental education and social mobilization courses for
           professors and community leaders (compared with the 20 planned inthe PAD);
            online connection o f all the plannedIAP Regional Offices to the Central
            EnvironmentalMonitoring Unit;
            produced 2 of the 3 planned Macro Strategic Plans; and
            identified 41 of the 40 planned demonstration projects, and 179 ofthe planned280
            micro-catchments.

The project has laid the groundwork for achieving the objectives o f creating and implementing a
sustainable and replicable model for natural resources management and biodiversity
conservation. However, further implementation o f the project, such as implementing proposed
management plans and disseminating information about agro-ecological models to be carried out
throughout the project area, i s also essential ifthe project is to achieve its objectives.

On July 10, 2006, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection, dated June 23, 2006.
The Request was submitted by a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the State of
Parank, Brazil. It claimed that there has been accelerated destruction o f native Araucaria areas
and that the project was thus not fulfilling its objectives inthe Araucaria corridor.

In response to the concerns raised by the Requestor's, Bank Management: (i)carried out a
Technical Audit (see below) which was completed at the end o f October 2006 after discussions
with project stakeholders including interested NGOs; and (ii)        carried-out intensive supervision
and assistance to the State for improvingproject implementation and for identifying mechanisms
for biodiversity conservation inproductive areas.




                                                   3

Following the Mid-Term Review carried out on October 15-17, 2006, the client presented an
Action Plan to the Bank which includes a series o f adjustments to the Project that would address
the recommendations of the Technical Audit and the Management Response to the Inspection
Panel submitted on November 20, 2006. The Action Plan gives detailed proposals for activities
that the project would undertake to ensure it achieves its objectives.

The conclusions of the Technical Audit (TA) are that, although the results of the project will
only be seen clearly in the medium and long-term, the project i s a well-developed and advanced
initiative, which has achieved positive planned objectives and has been implemented diligently
and with attention to the established planning instruments. The TA also concludedthat it would
be appropriate to make certain modifications and adjustments regarding improvement of the
project in order to make it more effective in achieving its global objective of conserving
biodiversity.

Inlight ofthe findings ofthe TA, officials ofthe State Government ofParanirecentlyprepared a
proposal and submitted to the Bank on November 20, 2006 to respond to the concerns of the
Inspection Panel requesters by re-orienting strategic directions and activities under the Project.
The State Government has providedthis draft proposal to the Requesters and other interested and
affected parties for input and comment. Among its elements, the TA call for increased focus and
attention on actions to conserve the remaining remnants, especially of Araucaria forests such as:
(i)improvingmonitoringandcontrol activities (component 111); (ii)strengthening IAP; (iii)
focusing training and capacity building activities on priority areas; and (iv) developing
alternative mechanisms to finance biodiversity conservation (Le. ecological certification ICMS
andthe introduction inthe Project of a mechanism for the financing of Biodiversity Subprojects
in favor of selected NGO working in the area of biodiversity conservation). In line with the
Action Plan, the Government has requested a twenty-four-month extension.


3. Proposed Changes

The original PDO is not modified and the associated outcome targets remain the same, with the
exception of some operational adjustments that do not materially change the expectations o f the
results that the project would achieve.

In order to implement the Proposed Action Plan, the Beneficiary has requested the following
operational changes: (i)  a mechanism to support civil society organizations who wish to conduct
environmental studies or applied research, education activities or to improve infrastructure in
order to promote conservation o f biodiversity through Biodiversity Subprojects which would
become a new subcomponent under Part B.5 o f the Project; (ii)a revision o f procurement
provisions o f the Grant Agreement; and (iii)a reallocation o f funds mainly to provide
strengthening of the activities o f the Environmental Institute o f Parani (IAP). A strengthening o f
the Advisory Committee is also contemplated inthe restructuring as an efficient means to get all
stakeholders involved as well as to get feedback from them on the progress achieved by the
Project. The changes to the Grant Agreement and also the allocation o f resources are presentedin
the amendment letter to the Grant Agreement. Complementing the extension of the closing date
granted by the CD until January 31, 2009, these include the creation of a new disbursement
category to support biodiversity civil society subprojects as well as the necessary adjustments to
be made to the current Operational Manual. Other minor changes include adjustments to the
procurement schedule and the introduction o f SEOP (the State Secretariat o f Public Works) as a



                                                4

 new executing entity incharge of building minor biodiversity conservation infrastructure. With
 this Action Plan the balance of US$3.7 millionwould be fully disbursedby the new closing date
 of January 31,2009.

 As a result of the proposed changes additional outcomes include the improved protection o f
 biodiversity through the establishment of at least 5 private protected areas in the Auracaria
 Biome, enhanced performance o f the state environmental agency (IAP) through the provision o f
 consulting services, the purchase of satellite images and the necessary equipment for
 interpretation and monitoring o f forest cover and the improved collaboration between civil
 society organizations and state government in the design and implementation of conservation
 policies and practices through the incorporation of civil society representation in the project
 council and the implementation of 40 subprojects. These activities will be carried out by the
 closing date o f the project.


 4. Analysis

Eligible NGOs will participate in the Project both to implement specific subprojects aimed at
improving conservation o f the Araucaria Biome, and to participate in the project's advisory
council. These, together with the support to be provided to the establishment o f private protected
areas and the protection to forest remnants, are expected to improve project impact in the
Araucaria Biome one o f the three targeted corridors assistedby the Project.

Furthermore the proposed changes do not have a major effect on the original economic, financial,
technical, institutional or social aspects o f the project, as appraised. In addition, the proposed
changes do not raise the environmental category nor do they trigger new safeguard policies.

 No exceptions to Bank policies are involvedinthis restructuring.


 5. ExpectedOutcomes

 The original PDO is not modified and the associated outcome targets remain the same despite
 this additional indicators have been developed to ensure adequate monitoring of the proposed
 changes. Table 2 includes a full list of key project indicators including those developed to
 monitor new activities inbold.

 Implementation o f new activities can be satisfactorily carried out due to availability o f adequate
 resources. The participationo f Civil Society would add implementationcapacity to deliver some
 o f these new project activities. Relevant units within IAP will now be strengthened through
 technical assistance and specialized equipment, particularly inregards to private protected areas.
 Inaddition, the experience acquired by the project inthe last four years of implementation has
 identified significant information and experience at the regional level that will allow for the
 successful implementation o f new activities.

6. Benefits and Risks

The main benefits of the restructuring is the substantial improvement in delivery o f project
actions in the Araucaria Biome through the creation o f private protected areas, the engagement
of NGOs in the implementation of subprojects, the strengthening o f the State Environmental
Agency (IAP), effective enforcement, and the provision of incentives for the protection o f forest
remnants.

No major risksto the restructuringare envisaged inaddition to those listedinthe original Project
design. However, certain risks exist with regards to a possible lack o f demand by NGOs for the
implementation o f the new type of subprojects, and inadequate response by IAP to the
institutional strengthening activities. These risks would be mitigatedthrough the participation of
NGOs in the advisory council, a strong communication and dissemination campaign, the
establishment of clear rules and procedures for the preparation and financing of subprojects and,
inthe case of IAP, through the elaboration of a detailed needs assessment ineach ofthe relevant
departments and the preparation of comprehensive terms o f reference and specification for the
requiredconsulting services.
