support the development of a sustainable natural resource\n            management, in two highly threatened eco-regions - the\n            Brazilian Inland Atlantic Rainforest, and Araucaria Forest -\n            through the design, and implementation of a model for\n            improving biodiversity conservation in the State. Project\n            components include: 1) education and capacity building,\n            aimed at sensitizing the population of Parana State in the\n            importance of biodiversity conservation, mobilizing it to\n            support the process of regaining the quality of ecosystems,\n            and enable the participation of project implementing\n            agencies, beneficiaries, and stakeholders. Eight capacity\n            building courses, and specialized training are projected for\n            implementing agencies to assume management, fiscal, and\n            legal enforcement responsibilities; and, courses for the\n            dissemination of project concepts, and practices are\n            intended to target rural communities to participate in\n            agro-ecological subprojects. Educational, and promotional\n            materials will be provided to support the above mentioned\n            courses, and agricultural extension activities; 2)\n            biodiversity management, and improved administration of\n            seven protected areas at the core of the geographic\n            corridors, through macro-planning to identify\n            micro-catchments, to then sequence the development of\n            management plans, with the assistance of consultants,\n            pubic-private partnerships, and nongovernmental\n            organizations. Equipment supply, and infrastructure\n            activities are to be included, to support sustainable\n            financial sufficiency, through eco-tourism, and handicrafts\n            development; 3) establish monitoring and evaluation quality\n            criteria for biodiversity conservation, by refining\n            licensing norms for environmental activities, and supporting\n            municipal fiscal decentralization; and, 4) project\n            administration practices to coordinate the central,\n            regional, and municipal management committees, and,\n            strategic studies will focus on the consolidation of\n            environmental legislation, and certification, as well as on\n            the cost-benefit of environmental interventions."}, "docdt": "2002-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
