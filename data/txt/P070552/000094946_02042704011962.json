Nonetheless, because of existing\n            interactions between the project, and other developmental\n            activities in the State of Parana, the following shall be\n            excluded within project implementation: fumigation; planting\n            of crop species not native to the soil; fertilizer and/or\n            pesticide spraying; dredging or drainage of natural\n            habitats; river flows diversification; and, pervasive land\n            uses. Mitigation measures shall forbear cultural and\n            religious sites, while other restrictions include land\n            acquisition, disposal of toxic wastes, and, vegetative\n            degradation. Natural resource management within the project,\n            include vegetative propagation of autochthonous species,\n            including terracing, or protective plant barriers to prevent\n            soil erosion; groundwater protection, and appropriate water\n            distribution; and, woodland restoration to attract natural\n            fauna. Project agro-ecological modules will be promoted\n            within communities (which includes individual properties),\n            favoring alternatives to reduce the risk of natural resource\n            degradation, i.e., crop rotation, and mixed agricultural and\n            livestock production, including the maintenance of genetic\n            diversity. The environmental regional criteria will be\n            enforced at the municipal, administrative, and micro-basins\n            levels, in compliance with the regulations set by the\n            Regional Commission, formalized by a municipal protocol\n            intended to cooperate with project activities, while\n            identified micro-basins will undergo the biodiversity\n            conservation management as set by the project components."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
