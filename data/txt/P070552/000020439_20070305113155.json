BRAZIL: Parana Biodiversity Project (GEF TF\n            051 007),\" dated September 11, 2006 (Report No.\n            INSP/R2006-0005), and distributed to the Executive Directors\n            and Alternates on September 21, 2006, and contains the\n            Panel's final recommendation on whether the issues\n            raised in the request for inspection warrant an\n            investigation. The report contains the panel's final\n            recommendation on whether an investigation of the issues\n            raised in the request for inspection is warranted. The panel\n            understands the concerns of the requesters for the reasons\n            noted below. The Requesters, the Government and Bank\n            Management agree that the Araucaria Mixed Forest remnants in\n            advanced successional stage are very rare and now reduced to\n            about 60,000 ha or 0.8 percent of their original area,\n            although there are estimates that the exact area may be a\n            little higher or lower. They note that the threat of the\n            complete destruction of these remnants is very high and that\n            the highest priority for biodiversity conservation in the\n            State should be to prevent their destruction. The Panel\n            notes that after the Request for Inspection to the Panel, a\n            number of actions have taken place to address the\n            Requesters' concerns about the implementation of the\n            Project. The Technical Audit, conducted in September and\n            October 2006, proposed increased attention to conserving the\n            remaining remnants of the forests, especially the Araucaria\n            forests. The State Authorities in Parana subsequently\n            prepared an Action Plan to develop additional measures to\n            support biodiversity conservation. In light of the above\n            considerations, the Panel does not recommend an\n            investigation of whether the Bank has complied with its\n            operational policies and procedures."}, "docdt": "2007-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
