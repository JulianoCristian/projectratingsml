The Request was\n            submitted by a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in\n            the State of Parana, Brazil. The Requesters state that the\n            approval of the Project carried \"an unprecedented and\n            very positive expectation that would generate actions\"\n            aimed at preserving the State of Parana's biodiversity.\n            According to the Request, the conservation of the biomass of\n            the Araucaria and the Atlantic Forest is of \"great\n            priority\" in the State of Parana, because same are now\n            reduced to 0.8 percent of its original area. However,\n            according to the Request, \"methodological changes\"\n            made to Project implementation after approval have resulted\n            in a change of Project activities, which will prevent the\n            achievement of the original Project objectives, and will\n            worsen the current situation. Until further notice, all\n            communications with the Requesters in connection with the\n            Request will be sent to the Executive Secretary of the NGO\n            Network of the Atlantic Forest, whom the Requesters\n            appointed as their representative. After receiving the\n            Management response, the Panel will, determine whether the\n            Request meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraphs\n            12 to 14 [of the Resolution], and shall make a\n            recommendation to the Executive Directors as to whether the\n            matter should be investigated."}, "docdt": "2006-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
