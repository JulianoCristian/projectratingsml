performance of the Paran\u00e1 Biodiversity Project in its\n            design, implementation and execution context, taking into\n            account a retrospective analysis and forecasts in order for\n            future adjustments and improvements performance. The Paran\u00e1\n            Biodiversity Project represents an innovative approach to\n            regional biodiversity conservation and its integration into\n            the processes of sustainable rural development and might\n            become an important model for the country. The\n            implementation process is set to expand the interpretation\n            of the concept of Biodiversity Conservation. The project\n            still has problems concerning the interpretation of the idea\n            of biodiversity. This idea needs to be discussed and to\n            develop a smooth coordination between all institutions and\n            to execute and represent civil society. For this, it is\n            vital that there are open channels of permanent dialogue and\n            leveling concepts, functions and mechanisms for\n            implementation. The implementation of the design has so far\n            been subjected to a number of interruptions that effectively\n            limit their real-time implementation and has created a\n            negative overall performance."}, "docdt": "2006-09-03T00:00:00Z"}
