assessment is that the\n            project outcome was satisfactory. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory. Project\n            sustainability is likely. Lessons included the following:\n            States needed sufficient time and support at the beginning\n            of projects to set up planning procedures and systems and to\n            fully involve the communities in defining their needs and\n            involvement. The success of constituted user groups\n            emphasized the importance of the government strongly\n            supporting and promoting the establishment and involvement\n            of local village organizations. This project's success\n            depended on project design including community awareness\n            building, farmer and community training, savings schemes\n            promotion, and interventions that provided short-, as well\n            as medium- and long-term benefits to individual farmers and\n            communities. On the other hand, technical support for the\n            project was too narrowly confined to adaptive agricultural\n            research. The project gave little direct emphasis to\n            women's needs and aspirations; it should have focused\n            on forming specific women user groups, and training women in\n            village-based income-generating activities. Policy and\n            action plans should have emphasized restrictimg livestock\n            numbers, combined with more active programs to exclude\n            grazing and rehabilitate forest areas. Benefits would have\n            acrued with more inter-agency collaboration. Lastly,\n            nongovernmental organizations should have been participated\n            in initial planning and received training."}, "docdt": "1999-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
