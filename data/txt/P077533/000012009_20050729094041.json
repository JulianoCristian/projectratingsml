A key lesson is, that in\n            a difficult post-conflict situation characterized by limited\n            government capacity, the project's choice of\n            institutional arrangements featuring performance based\n            contracting of service providers for implementation and\n            management has lend itself to a rapid scaling up of both\n            community-driven development (CDD), and labor intensive\n            public works activities. A related lesson is that the\n            establishment of such arrangements takes time, and\n            expectations regarding how quickly operations can begin on\n            the ground, need to be realistic. Furthermore, in a\n            post-conflict context where rapid delivery of a \"peace\n            dividend\" is critical to establish or maintain the\n            credibility of government vis-\u00e0-vis the population,\n            implementing agencies need to manage the challenge of\n            maintaining engineering quality of sub-projects (as has been\n            the issue in the community empowerment component), or of\n            providing meaningful sub-projects (as has been the issue in\n            the public works component, where villagers have questioned\n            the usefulness of types of road repair that would only bring\n            short-term benefits). Consultations with agencies that have\n            prior experience of working in the local context is crucial\n            for developing a sound implementation approach, and\n            contributes at the same time to establish buy-in and\n            commitment to key project principles. Other lessons address\n            public works, institutional sustainability, and the\n            introduction of innovative development approaches, and\n            notably, Bank efficiency in delivery of assistance to weak\n            client governments in post-conflict situations is critically\n            dependent on having both operational and procurement,\n            disbursement, and financial management staff on long-term\n            assignments in the country office from the start of the\n            operational presence."}, "docdt": "2005-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
