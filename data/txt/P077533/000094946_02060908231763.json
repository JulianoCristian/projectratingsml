(ESSF) ensures the\n            management of environmental adversity, provides guidance for\n            social adverse impacts, and plans mitigation measures. It\n            stipulates that no subprojects will be eligible should land\n            acquisition affect 200 or more people, and, specifies\n            attribute ineligibility of subprojects that involve\n            significant degradation to natural habitats, cultural\n            heritage sites, or forests (commercial logging is to be\n            avoided), or, adversity to waters among riparian neighbors.\n            Sectoral adversity is identified, followed by the relevant\n            mitigation measures. 1) water supply infrastructure:\n            prioritize leak detection; conduct chemical and\n            bacteriological testing of water quality; install drainage\n            pipes to prevent stagnant waters, and, covered pumps to\n            prevent contamination; select sites for latrines and septic\n            tanks installation; and, conduct regular surface, and\n            groundwater investigations. 2) Solid waste: conduct frequent\n            waste collections; minimize incineration practices;\n            specifically identify collection, and disposal of medical,\n            and hazardous wastes; establish appropriate monitoring\n            criteria. 3) Roads: prepare adequate drainage designs;\n            restore borrow areas; conduct re-vegetation practices to\n            protect soil surfaces. 4) Erosion: maintain slope stability\n            through re-vegetation; design and construct access roads;\n            prevent firewood practices; remove, and adequately dispose\n            of oil, bitumen, and hazardous material wastes. 5) Power:\n            store waste transformer coolant air in sealed containers,\n            pending safe disposal; and, preferably, the use of natural\n            gas should be the choice. Measures in general, include\n            health, and hygiene education, training, capacity building,\n            and monitoring criteria to ensure the ESSF is appropriately implemented."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
