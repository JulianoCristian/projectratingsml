{"cdata!": "The Emergency Community Empowerment and\n            Public Works Project aims at providing employment in rural\n            areas at a minimum wage, as a safety net, to as many people,\n            and in short a time as may be possible. Furthermore, the\n            project will commence the process of helping villages\n            rebuild their capital base through the provision of\n            sub-grants, and empower villagers to plan for, and decide\n            on, the investments to be made with the proceeds of the\n            sub-grants. The grant will finance oversight consultants for\n            both the labor-intensive works, and community grants;\n            rehabilitation of provincial and district roads, and\n            irrigation infrastructure; block grants to villages and\n            neighborhoods; and, vehicles provision. Services will be\n            provided to monitor the program, manage financial flows,\n            record-keeping and audits, and, to carry out evaluation,\n            institutional, impact, and follow-up studies. Needless to\n            say, implementation difficulties due to conditions in the\n            country are risks, that include security problems, lack of\n            legal and regulatory systems, and, a weak and distorted\n            market for skilled labor. However, project benefits - beyond\n            labor opportunities - will far outnumber those risks."}, "docdt": "2002-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
