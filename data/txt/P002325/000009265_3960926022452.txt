REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT OF TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING CAPACITY
1-okground
1.        The objective of this component is to increase the quantity of
textbooks in primary schools, improve their relevance and quality, and
reduce their cost. Each text would follow the following sequence of
development: in year one, editing/origination; prlnting and distribution
in year two; use in schools as of year three; and evaluation as of year
four.
2.        In 1983 the Government instituted a free textbook loan system
whereby each year, on a progressive basis, two or three regions are
provided with textbooks. The first cycle of the system is expected to be
completed in 1988 when the Cap Vert Region receives its allotment. The
policy also provides for "topping up" of textbook stocks in each region
during the years following the initial supply. Students use the textbooks
on a loan basis during the year and return them to school at year's end.
Those who fail to do so reimburse the cost of the textbooks.
3.        Currently, MEN's Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning is responsible for textbook procurement and distribution. It uses
the services of "Nouvelles Editions Africaines" to order the textbooks and
transport them to departmental inspectorates. The procurement and distri-
bution functions are operating adequately; what is lacking ls the capacity
to produce original material or adapt textbooks that are both relevant to
teaching/learning needs and inexpensîve. To this end, the project would
assist the Goverument to establish a Textbook Publishing Unit at INEADE
whose responsibilities would be to manage the development of appropriate
textbooks through directing the publishing process, guiding authors,
editing their manuscripte, and making arrangements for printing the text-
books. In addition, the Government plans to develop a cost-recovery system
by charging an average fee of CFAF 1,000 (about US$2.80) per student per
year, per set of books. The project would assist the Goverument to analyze
the equity implications and the potential enrollment effects in the low-
income areas of the proposed fee system.
Strategy
4.        Original wrlting or adaptation of existing textbooks.  The Text-
book Unit would assess the adaption possibilities of books that are
"largely international" in content (e.g. math and science) and negotiate
with the copyright holders. For French textbooks, although adaptation la a
posslbillity, because of cultural demanda in language and content, writing
nev textbooks is likely to be a better approach. For the national language
textbooks as vell as all of the teacher guides, the writing of new
materials ls recommended. Local authors, following their trainlng, would
do the original vriting or adaptation and would be paid a flat fee for

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Republic of Senegal
Beneficl,ary:   Ministry of Natiotial Education
Credit Amount: SDR 10.2 million (US$12.0 million equivalent)
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description:   The Government of Senegal aime to achieve universal primary
education by the year 2000. Given, however, the primary
school-age population's annual growth rate of 3% and the
current low grose enrollment rate of 52%, if the present
expenditure pattern in the education sector and its share of
the total recurrent budget remain substantially unchanged,
by the year 2000 the 52% gross enrollment rate would decline
to 38%. Therefore, the overall objective of the project is
to assist the Government in accelerating the qualitative and
quantitative development of primary education, vithin the
framework of its structural and sectoral adjustment
programs, through more effective use of education resources
and the strengthening of sector institutions.
Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Implement a phased sectoral adjustment program te lover
unit costs by improving the efficiency of resource use
through:
(a)  reducing teaeher and administrative staff costs
per student et the primary level; and
(b)  containing expenditures at the post-primary level
(reducing higher education subsidies and unit
costs, developing cost-recovery systeme) and real-
locating funds thus made available to primary
education.



- viii -
2.   Develop the planning, budgeting, cost-control and
coordination capacity of the Ministry of National
Education by:
(a) strengthening the capacity of the Directorate of
Studies, Human Resources and Planning to develop
and implement sectoral adjustment and growth plans
and cost-effectiveness measures;
(b) minimizing primary school replacement needs and
reducing new construction costs through:
(i) developing facility planning and budgeting
capacity of the new Physical Facility Management
Division; (ii) rehabili.tating 100 classrooms;
(iii) establishing a preventive mairsenance systei
and training the staff of 2,500 primary schools to
ensure regular upkeep of facilities; and
(iv) constructing 400 low-cost/low-maintenance
classrooms under cost-sharing arrangements with
communities; and
(c) developing the project coordination capacity of
the Ministry of National Education by establishing
a Project Unit.
3.   Improve teacher effectiveness, efficiency of primary
school inspectors, and relevance and availability of
textbooks by:
(a)  strengthening the National Pedagogical Institute's
ability to develop materials relevant to country
conditions, conduct teacher upgrading programs,
and prepare for the introduction of double-shift
and multigrade systens;
(b)  reinforcing the school inspE,torates to provide
teacher support and supervision and to manage
education budgets and personnel on a decentralized
basis; and
(c) creating a national capacity to prepare, adapt and
distribute textbooks and teacher guides.

Benefits
and Risks:     Through the application of sectoral adjustment policies,
primary enrollments are expected to increase by about 32%
(180,000 additional students) by the 1994/95 school year or,
in cumulative terms, by ar additional 450,000 student years
over tht' period 1987 to 1994, without increasing the share
of education in the Government budget from its 1985/86
level. The classroom construction program would help expand
primary enrollments by about 7% in the three project
regions; provide replicable classroom designs at a cost
about 35% lower per m2 than that currently incurred in
Government-constructed classrooms, and would set the pattern
for cost sharing by communities. The project would also
improve the quality of primary education through the pro-
vision of more relevant textbooks and teacher guides,
development of revised curricula, and teacher upgrading
programs. Project support to institution building at the
central and regional levels would yield the long-term
benefit of improved educational planning, budgeting and
resource management capacities. The project has two
potential risks. First, sectoral adjustment measures such
as reducing higher education subsidies or introducing
double-shift system may not be fully endorsed by teachers,
students or parents. Aware of this risk, the Government has
been pursuing a public acceptance campaign. In addition,
the project includes two joint Government/IDA reviews to
assess progress of the policy measures and make any neces-
sary adjustments. The second risk concerns possible delays
in implementing the construction program, owing to the
limited technical capacity of the Ministry of National
Education and the experimental nature of the cost-sharing
arrangements with communities. To reduce this risk, an
important criterion for selecting the target communities is
their commitment to contribute about 25% of the classroom
construction costs in cash or in kind.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATIOII DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of Senegal has requested IDA's assistance in
financing a project to increase access to primary education and improve its
quality.  Within the framework of the Government's structural adjustment
program, the project aims to develop the basis for a sectoral adjustment
program that would improve the allocative efficiency and cost-effective use
of education resources and strengthen the institutions that are responsible
for education quality and resource management. The estimated project cost is
US$19.6 million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is 62%.
The Government wou'Ld contribute about US$2.3 million. The remaining US$17.3
million would be financed by IDA (US$12.0 million) and the African Develop-
ment Bank (EJS$5.3 million). This project would be exempt from taxes and
duties. The Basic Data Sheet is at Annex 1.
II. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A.   Overview
2.1       The education system consists of (a) a six-year cycle of primary
education (along with parochial and Koranic schools); (b) a four-year lower
secondary cycle followed by a three-year upper cycle in general and technical
education; and (c) higher education through two- or four-year programs at the
University of Dakar or at specialized training schools. The Ministry of
National Education (MEN) is responsible for all formal education and training
activities (para 2.8). Professional and nonformal education/training is pro-
vided directly by about 11 ministria.  Annex 2-1 provides a flow chart of

Senegalese education system. The table of Comparative Education Indicators
is at Annex 2-4.
B.   Main Issues in Primary Education
1.   Access and Equity
2.2       Senegal ranks below the West African average in terms of adult
literacy and primary enrollments (28% and 52% respectively, according to
1984/85 school year statistics). Distribution of educational opportunity ls
unequal. While over 60% of primary school-age children live in rural areas,
they constitute only 37% of enrollments. The female participation rate is
40% nationally and about 32% in rural areas, falling to as low as 19% in the
Louga Region. Due to a lack of adequate facilities (87% of rural schools
have lesa than six classrooms), in some rural areas enrollment into Grade 1
occurs once every two or three years.



2.  Financial Constraints and Budgetary Realignment
2.3       Despite the fact that only one child out of two has a place in pri-
mary school, education consumed about 23.2% of the Government's recurrent
budget and 5% of GDP in the 1985/86 school year. At the 3% per annum growth
rate of the primary school-age population and the GDP growth rate of 2.3% per
annum projected for the next decade, additional puolic funds are not likely
to be available to enable the Government to meet its ambitious enrollment
targets for primary schooling: 60% by 1989, and universal primary education
by the year 2000. The sectoral and functional budget allocations for educa-
tion are shown in Annex 2-3. Results of simulations on alternative policy
measures are at Annex 2-5.
2.4       Per student costs.  In terms of primary education unit costs (about
US$117/year), Senegal ranks as the fourth highest country in West Africa.
This is largely attributable to three factors: high teacher salaries, low
student/teacher ratios in rural areas, and excessive administrative staff/
teacher ratios.  First, in the 1984/85 school year, 96% of the recurrent pri-
mary education budget vas consumed by the teacher vage bill, owing to high
teacher salaries (seven to nine times the GDP per capita). Senegal has two
types of formally trained teachers: "instituteurs adjoints" (associate
teachers), comprising about 47% of the teaching force and trained for one
year after the 10th grade; and "instituteurs" (teachers), comprising about
53% of the teaching force and trained for either one year after baccalaureate
or four years after the 10th grade. On average, the annual base salaries of
"instituteurs adjoints" are about 30% lower than those of "instituteurs."
One way to reduce teacher cost per student would be to shift the balance of
recruitment toward hiring more "instituteurs adjoints."  The Government  in-
tends to increase the proportion of "instituteurs adjoints" vis-a-vis "insti-
tuteurs" from the current 47:53 ratio to a 80:20 ratio by starting to recruit
candidates inte teacher training programs as of the 1986/87 school year
(paras 2.12 and 3.2). This measure would reduce the total wage bill of new
teachers employed under the 80:20 ratio by 14%. To ensure that the increased
proportion of "instituteurs adjoints" does not impair the quality of primary
education, the Goverriment intends to revise the content and duration of the
"instituteur adjoint" pre-service training program and improving the quality
and frequency of teacher upgrading programs. A second reason for the high
unit costs is the significantly lower student/teacher ratios in rural areas
as compared to those in urban areas. Unit costs vary by 40% on average and
by as much as 110% in tbe extreme cases.  Implementation of a multigrade
system in rural areas would permit more efficient use of teachers and free
them for additional students. There is also scope for lowering unit costs,
increasing enrollments, and eliminating overcrowded classes by introducing a
double-shift system whereby one teacher would teach two shifts and receive
about 25% of his/her base salary as extra compensation. Weekly classroom
hours would be reduced and to compensate, the school year would be extended
and specialized curricula developed. By initiating such a system at Grade 1
in the first year and extending it to Grades 2-4 over the subsequent three
years in about 20% of the overcrowded classrooms, by the end of the project
period, 20,000 additional students would gain access to primary education. A
third reason for the high unit costs stems from the use of teachers in
administrative positions. Of the 11,800 school teachers covered under the
primary education budget, about 11% (as compared to an average of about 7%
for Africa) do not have regular classroom teaching duties in primary schools
(an estimated 7% serve in administrative positions at inspectorates; 4% are



- 3 -
employed as monitors in secondary schools. Meanwhile, at the beginning of
the 1985/86 school year, 550 primary classrooms could not be opened because
of teacher shortages. Annex 2-3 shows student/teacher ratios in urban and
rural areas and a comparison of unit costs with those in other countries.
Annex 2-6 provides data on teacher salaries and assignments in 1983/84.
2.5       Construction costs.  In 1985, the initial investment cost for
classrooms built by the Government was about US$180/m2, which translates to
an estimated lifetime cost of about US$280/m2, taking into account repairs,
reconstruction and maintenance (over 25 years).  The high costs stem from
reliance on imported materials, inappropriate designs and techniques,
inefficient procurement, and rapid deterioration owing to lack of mainte-
nance. Simple, cheaper and low-maintenance designs, using local materials
and labor, would enable communities to construct their own achools at lower
investment and lifetime costs (about US$118/m2 and US$160/m2, respectively,
in 1986 prices). Initial outlays and lifetime costs per classroom would thus
be reduced by about 35% and 43%, respectively. Annex 2-7 provides the
detailed figures.
2.6       High subsidies and unit costs at the post-secondary level.
Generous subsidies often encourage university students to continue their
studies beyond economically efficient levels, with the result that the
estimated return to the individual is much higher (21%) than the social
return (9%).  In 1985, university fellowships and indirect subsidies (meals,
lodging, transport and social services) to the Campus Services at the
University of Dakar constituted 34% (25% and 9%, respectively) of the higher
education budget.   Of the 11,800 students, about 7,000 received fellowships
or financial assistance. Over 50% of the fellowship budget was awarded to
about 2,000 students for study abroad, the per student cost of which is five
times that at the University. Internal efficiency of higher education is
also low: only one out of five students graduates and on average it takes
7-12 years to complete the four-year cycle. From an equity and efficiency
point of view, gradual reduction of direct and indirect subsidies and the
introduction of cost-recovery measures are justified. Another cost-
efficiency issue concerns institutions that train future public service
employees. As a result of the constrained civil service hiring, these
schools have high per student costs (on average about US$4,800/year), due
mainly to low student/teacher ratios. In teacher training colleges, for
example, the ratio is about seven students per teacher. It is estimated that
by increasing the student/teacher ratio to 15:1 and reducing redundant
personnel and operating costs, the savings realized would represent 15%
(about US$350,000 equivalent) of the 1985/86 recurrent budget for teacher
training schools. Annex 2-3 provides relevant statistics on the above
points.
3.   Quality of Primary Education
2.7         The internal efficiency of primary education Js low.  The
achievement rate for the primary-level completion examination is about 59%.
A number of factors adversely affect the quality of primary schooling:
(a) inadequate teaching skills; (b) unduly academic curricula and an
inadequate capacity for developing appropriate teaching methods and
materials; (c) an inspectorate staff without the physical means to conduct
school visits and lacking up-to-date knowledge of innovative classroom
techniques to assist teachers, as well as the authority to impose sanctions



-4-
for unsatisfactory teacher performance; (d) shortages of textbooks and
teacher guides, which also are not always relevant to children's environment
and learning requirements; and (e) inadequate physical facilities, with 50%
of the classrooms lacking a sufficient number of student benches and about
25% of the classrooms in a state of disrepair.
4.   Educational Planning and Management
2.8       Previously, responsibility for formal edu^ation and training vas
shared by the Ministry of National Ed -cation (for primary and secondary
levels), the Ministry of Righer Education, and the State Secretariat for
Technical Education and Vocational Training. In January 1986 these three
ministries were consolidated into MEN. In the present structure, four key
institutions vithin the MEN organization and budget are concerned with
primary education: the Directorates of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning; Elementary Education; and School Construction and Equipment, all of
which report to the Minister of National Education; and the National
Pedagogical Institute, which reports to the Cabinet of the Minister.
2.9       The Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and Planning (DERP) is
responsible for research, educational planning, school mapping, relations
vith external agencies, textbook procurement, and the preparation of edu-
cation projects. Staff shortages and the heavy burden of routine admini-
stration have prevented DERP from preparing long-range education strategy and
development plans and from adequately performing its other responsibilities,
resulting in the work being diffused and inadequately coordinated. The
National Pedagogical Institute (INEADE), created under the Tkird Education
Project (para 2.10), has the main responsibility for educational research and
experimentation in the development/adaptation of curricula, the preparation
and implementation of in-service training, and the development of teaching
materials, tests and student assessment measures. Experience has shown that
the Institute needs further support and revision of its organizational struc-
ture and staffing to enable it to serve as the key institution for improving
the quality and relevance of primary education. Under the Directorate of
Elementary Education are 10 regional and 41 departmental inspectorates, which
have the responsibility for dissemination of educational improvements and
implementation of policies at the regional and local levels. However,
administration remains highly centralized, with even routine decisions taken
in Dakar. To remedy the problem and in line with the Government's 1972
administrative decentralization policy, MEN intends to decentralize relevant
aspects of educational planning and resource management to provide inspectors
vith adequate budgetary authority, means for teacher support, and povers of
sanction for dealing with personnel problems (paras 2.7 and 3.17). On the
construction side, since 1978, MEN's Directorate of School Construction and
Equipment (DCES) has been assigned the responsibility for all administrative
tasks and techniques concerning school construction and equipment at educa-
tional establishments, includ4.ng design work, budget estimation, elaboration
and management of school building projects, procurement, control of civil
vorks, and planning. DCES needs strengthening, as it lacks the technical
expertise to carry out its assigned tasks.
C.   Experienco with Past Lending
2.10      The Bank Group has financed four education projects to date.  The
Firat Education Project (Cr. 253-SE for US$2.0 million, 1971-78) focused on



- 5 -
improving the quality of technical and agriculturLl education. The Second
Education Project (Cr. 530-SE for US$15.0 million, 1975-84) provided assis-
tance for improved planning, and financed science facilities, vocational
training centers and low-cost rural youth training centers. The Third Edu-
cation Project (Cr. 908-SE and SAC 11-SE for US$26.5 million, 1979-present),
is supporting educational research/planning, the development of technical/
vocational facilities and teaching methods, university-level training for
agronomists, and post-graduate management training.  The Regional Management
School Project (Cr. 1638-SE for US$5.5 million), which became effective in
April 1986, is designed to transform the management school financed under the
Third Education Project into a regional school for the West African Economic
Community to train/ upgrade middle- and high-level managers and provide
consulting services to private and parapublic enterprises. The first three
projects were implemented satisfactorily, although there were some problems,
mainly delays at the architectural design and contract award stages and
inadequate coordinacing and monitoring capacity.  In light of this experi-
ence, the project proposes to finalize all preparation, especially design
work, prior to credit effectiveness and to develop the capacity of the MEN to
coordinate and monitor projects.
D.   The Government's Sectoral Adjustment Strategy and Policy Dialogue with
the Bank Group
2.11      The Government's Structural Adjustment Program for 1985-92 aims at,
inter alia, improved management of public resources through sectoral adjust-
ments to ensure more efficient allocation and use of resources. Within this
framework, the education sector has launched a reform effort, the "Ecole
Nouvelle" (the new school), whose fundamental aim is the creation of an edu-
cation system that lis equitable, efficient and responsive to national
development needs.   The main objectives are to: (a) assign top priority to
expanding primary education with the eventual goal of universal primary edu-
cation by the year 2000 and an intermediate target of 60% by the end of the
Seventh Plan period in 1989; (b) utilize existing physical and human
resources more efficiently; and (c) develop the institutional structure to
improve the quality and relevance of education. Annex 2-8 provides details
on the Government's education strategy.
2.12      The Bank Group strategy supports the Government's structural and
sectoral adjustment program through an ongoing policy dialogue and a lending
portfolio that includes the second Structural Adjustment Credit as well as
sectoral rehabilitation projects.  In addition, the Bank Group convened the
first Consultative Group for Senegal in 1984 and will organize a follow-up in
early 1987. In the education sector, the Bank Group supports the Govern-
ment's priority of expanding primary schooling and improving its quality.
Over the past three years, through discussions and sector studies, the Bank
Group has assisted the Government in defining and preparing an implementation
plan to achieve these objectives.  Accordingly, the Government has initiated,
or under the project intends to initiate, measures to:  (a) reduce recurrent
unit costs at the primary level by recruiting a larger proportion of "insti-
tuteurs adjoints," reassigning teachers currently in administrative posts
into classrooms, and introducing double-shift and multigrade systems;
(b) reduce construction unit costs by developing maintenance programs and
low-cost classroom designs; (c) mobilize private resources through cost-
sharing arrangements with communities in school construction, cost-recovery



- 6 -
systems such as student loans in higher education, and assessment of fees for
primary school textbooks; and (d) strengthen institutions that plan education
strategy and spending. As part of the policy dialogue, the Bank Group has
tested the impact of some of the measures which are planned by the GovernmenF
and embodied in the proposed project. Simulated results indicate that to
counteract the negative effect of rapid population growth on primary enroll-
ment rates and to contain education expenditures, a sectoral adjustment
program that encompasses financial measures to permit reallocation of sector
resources in favor of primary education, as well as efficiency measures to
lower unit costs, is essential.
III.  THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Description
3.1       The overall objective of the project is to assist the Government to
accelerate the qualitative and quantitative development of primary education,
vithin the framework of its structural adjustment program. To this end, the
project would (a) implement a phased sectoral adjustment program to lower per
student costs and improve the allocative efficiency of education resources;
(b) develop the planning, budgeting, cost-control and coordination capacity
of the Ministry of National Education; and (c) improve teacher effectiveness,
efficiency of primary school inspectors, and relevance and availability of
textbooks.
1.   Sectoral Adjustment Program
3.2       To permit expansion and improvement of primary education while
maintaining the share of the sector within the Government's recurrent budget
at its 1985/86 level, the project would embody a sectoral adjustment program
emphasizing financial restructuring and efficiency measures. The main
features of the program aere: (a) reduction of teacher and administrative
staff costs per student at the primary level; (b) reduction of per student
costs and subpidies in higher education and introduction of cost-recovery
systems; and ;c) establishment of budgetary growth ceilings for post-primary
levels. The policy measures of the sectoral adjustment program are outlined
below.
Proposed Sectoral Adjustment Policies
Objective:  Increase primary school enrollments from about 549,000 in the
1985/86 school year to about 726,000 by 1993/1994 by lowering
unit costs through more efficient use of teachers and facilities.
1.   Recruit candidates into teacher training programs at an "insti-
tuteur adjoint"/"instituteur" ratio of 80:20 from the 1986/87
school year (SY) onward; observe this ratio for the recruitment of
new teachers in order to eventually increase the current proportion
of "instituteurs adjoints"/"instituteurs" (47:53); and revise pre-
service training content and duration to ensure quality, while
maintaining the present entry-level grade for "instituteurs
adjoints."



-7-
2. Redeploy into classrooms 400 primary teachers presently in admini-
strative posts at inspectorates and secondary schools by 1991 (200
during SYs 1986/87 and 1987/88, and the remaining 200 between SYs
1988/89 and 1989/90), without replacing them in those adminis-
trative poste vacated by .heir transfer.
3.   Introduce a double-shift system in urban and a multigrade system
appropriate rural classrooms as of SY 1989/90, following
experimentation.
4.   Increase the student/teacher ratio in teacher training colleges
from 7:1 to about 15:1 by the 1988/89 school year.
5.   Consolidate specialized civil service training schools as of SY
1988/89 to increase student/teacher ratios to a level to be agreed
with IDA following a study to be conducted in 1987.
Objective: Increase primary education budget while maintaining the share of
the sector budget in the Government's recurrent budget at its
1985/86 level by containing education expenditures at post-
primary levels and reallocating funds thus made available to
primary education.
6.   Reduce subsidies to higher education by:  (a) reducing the fellow-
ship budget in real terms by 26% by SY 1994/95 (8% in SY 1987/88
and 3% p.a. from SY 1988/89 through 1994/95). The reduction would
be applied primarily to overseas fellowships by enforcing eligi-
bility criteria in accordance with equity, academie performance,
and national development needs; (b) introducing cost-recovery
systems such as student loans; and (c) reducing indirect subsidies
(budget for the University of Dakar Campus Services) in real terms
by 51% by 1994 (8% p.a. from SY 1987/88 through 1994/95).
7.   Establishing ceilings in real terms on budgetary growth rates of
primary administration (1%) secondary (1.5%) and higher education
(1% p.a., excluding subsidy and specialized school budgets) as of
SY 1987/88 through 1994/95 to lead to a cumulative reduction of
7.7%, 11.4% and 7.7%, respectively, by 1994/95.
The estimated impact of the above policy package is expected to increase
primary school enrollments by about 180,000 students ir. SY 1994/95 or, in
cumulative terms, between SYs 1987/88 and 1994/95, by 450,000 additional
student years. To ensure that the quality of education at all levels is
improved simultaneously with the implementation of the above operational and
financial restructuring policies, DERP would conduct studies on specific
measures to improve internal and external efficiency of education (para 3.4).
3.3       The above policies would be implemented by MEN in consultation with
the Ministries of Finance and Planning. Progress would be assessed during
two joint Govertment and IDA reviews whose timing would be linked to the
three phases of the project's classroom construction component (paras 3.11 -
3.13). Disbursements for the first phase of the construction program (50
classrooms) would be released upon effectiveness of the IDA credit. Since
progress in implementing the policy package is necessary to generate the
savings required to provide the recurrent budget for further expansion of



- 8 -
primary school enrollments, a condition of disbursement for the second phase
(175 classrooms) and the third phase (175 classrooms) of the construction
program would be realization of satisfactory progress in implementing the
above policy measures, as determined during the firat and second joint re-
vieve, respectively, in accordance with the established criteria. Annex 3-1
gives the estimated financial and enrollment impacts of the measures, as vell
as the criteria for progress reviews. Annex 3-2 provides details on the
studies to be undertaken by the Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning in support of the measures.
2.   Development of Planning, Budgeting and Cost-Control Capacity of the
Ministry of National Education
3.4       Strengthening the Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning. This Directorate would oversee implementation of the policy pack-
age, including conducting the studies in support of the sectoral adjustment
program, and would develop subsequent sectoral adjustment and growth plans
and cost-effectiveness measures. Specifically, the proposed project would
expand the support provided under the Third Education Project (para 2.10) to
help the Directorate to: (a) plan enrollment targets at each level of edu-
cation, estimate budgetary needs, and identify measures to generate necessary
financing; (b) establish a cost-control mechanism and conduct annual reviews
of education expenditures and budget; (c) collect and analyze sector-wide
demographic and budgetary statistics and publish them annually; (d) expand
school mapping to cover urban areas and secondary education; and (e) conduct
annual seminars for regional and departmental staff on collecting statistics,
school mapping, and projection of real demand for schooling. Annex 3-3
details implementation of this component.
3.5       The IDA credit would finance 52 manmonths of fellowships; 7 man-
months of local staff training; and 69 manmonths of foreign (60 manmonths)
and local (nine manmonths) specialist services. The credit would aleo
finance funds for a small-scale experimentation linked to the study on the
student loan system (para 3.2, Item 6(b)); office furniture and equipment,
including two vehicles; and incremental operating costs of equipment financed
under the project. At negotiations, the Government agreed that it will
implement the Directorate's work program as scheduled.
3.6       Minimizing primary school replacement needs and new construction
costs. To enable cost-effective expansion of primary education, the project
would support a program that would reduce unit capital costs by (a) deve-
loping a facility planning and budgeting capacity; (b) rehabilitating 100
classrooms; (c) developing a preventive maintenance system; and (d) con-
structing 400 low-cost/low-maintenance classrooms with community input.
3.7       Developing a facility planning and budgeting capacity.   In order
to minimize replacement costs and the need for new schools, the project would
help the Government to strengthen its capacity to maintain and manage exist-
ing infrastructure and to plan for physical expansion .1d its financing
through increased local government and community participation. To this end,
the project would create a Physical Facility Management Division within the
Directorate of School Construction and Equipment, and decentralize the
Directorate at the inspectorate level in the three project regions -- Louga,
Diourbel and Fatick -- by establishing technical coordinator positions. (The
three regions which comprise about 25% of the population, were selected on
the basis of a high level of community demand for schooling, territorial



- 9 -
contiguity, and low enrollment rates arising from an inadequate number of
schools.) The Division would maintain a computerized inventory of existing
infrastructure and would prepare annual plans and budgets for
maintenance/rehabilitation and, in coordination with the school aapping unit,
for school expansion. The Physical Facility Management Division would alseo,
through the Construction Division, establish basic standards for
construction. The technical coordinator and his assistant at each of the
three regions would serve as the liaison betveen the Directorate and the com-
munities. The project funds w.uld finance remodeling of office space for the
Physical Facility Management Division and for the three technical coordina-
tors; furniture and equipment, including a vehicle for each coordinator; nine
manmonths of specialist services (of which one manmonth would be for a local
specialist) to establish the inventory and budgeting systems; 20 manmonths of
fellowships on inventory management; 67 manmonths of local training for the
technical coordinators, headmasters and teachers; and incremental operating
costs related to the equipment to be provided. Annex 3-4 provides tasks to
be undertaken by the Directorate of School Construction and Equipment with
regard to the project construction activities.
3.8       Prior to negotiations, the Government issued a decree, agreed with
IDA, creating the Physical Facility Management Division and decentrallzing
the Directorate of School Construction and Equipment at the three project
regions. As a condition of Board presentation, the Governnent has issoued an
11arreté" on the organizational structure, responsibilities and functions of
DCES.
3.9       Primary school rehabilitation.  To maintain the value of existing
investments as well as support planned quality improvements in primary edu-
cation, the project would provide for the upgrading of 100 classrooms in the
three project regions and the supplement or repair of furniture. The work
would be done by local contrp tors under the supervision of the Directorate
of School Construction and E  ipment.  Furniture would be manufactured by
local artisans in accordance with existing prototypes. The proposed credit
would finance: 85% of the value of construction contracts; school furniture;
and two manmonths of the services of a specialist to help prepare bidding
documents. Details on the rehabilitation prograin are set out in Annex 3-5.
At negotiations, the Governinent agreed that counterpart financing (15% of the
value of construction contracts) vill be included in the annual school
repairs budget during the project implementation period and that the funds
vill be made available to the project.
3.10      Preventive maintenance.  Te transfer the responsibility for regular
maintenance and minor repairs to individual schools, the project would pre-
pare a preventive maintenance guide, train headmasters and teachers in the
basic techniques, furnish each school vith a basic tool kit, and on a need
basis, provide basic materials. Major repairs would remain the responsibi-
lity of the Directorate of School Construction and Equipment. The proposed
credit vould finance: building materials and craftsmen services; two
vehicles; 3,500 tool kits (one per three classrooms); four manmonths of
specialist services to develop the maintenance system; 120 manmonths of local
training for school staff; the printing of 2,500 manuals; and incremeital
operating costs related to project equipment. Annex 3-5 provides additional
details on the program. At negotiations, the Government agreed to develop a
preventive maintenance program, following a study and experimentatlon, by
June 30, 1988, and assign responsibility for the program to headmasters and
teachers as part of their regular duties.



- 10 -
3.11      Low-cost/low-maintenance achool construction through cost-sharing.
To develop a community-based school construction program, thereby reducing
central government financing, the project would: (a) develop replicable, low-
cost/low-maintenance school designs that are labor intensive and maximize the
use of local materials and traditional designs; and (b) construct about 400
primary classrooms based on these designs. The construction program would be
implemented in three phases (50, 175 and 175 classrooms) to optimize coet
efficiency through experience gained under each phase.   The Directorate of
School Construction and Equipment would evaluate each phase in terms of
design suitability for replication, cost, timeliness of completion, level of
community input, and implementation problems. Evaluation results would be
reviewed with IDA, and appropriate modifications would be made before
proceeding to the next phase.
3.12      Construction would be organized jointly by the technical coordi-
nators and communities, under the supervision of the Directorate of
Construction and Equipment. Construction would be implemented in Louga,
Diourbel and Fatick Regions at sites identtfied through school mapping.
Prior to the start of each phase, the program for that phase would be re-
viewed jointly with IDA to ensure concentration of sites to facilitate super-
vision and delivery of materials. The program would increase the number of
classrooms in these regions by 30%. It is estimated that the average cost
per student place would be reduced from the current US$184 to US$126 in 1986
prices. The share of labor is estimated at 60%, of which 54% is unskilled.
It is expected that 10 local laborers would be *t:ilized per classroom; at the
prevailing wage of CFAF 1,400/day, the addit.        Lncome generated for the
community from wage receipts alone would be - , 670,000 (US$1,860) per
classroom constructed. Communities would provide the local materials and
contribute 50% of the unskilled labor. Small local contractors would provide
the transport, technical know-how and skilled labor, and train masons and
brick-masons from among the unskilled labor provided by communities. School
furniture would be manufactured by local artisans on the basis of existing
prototypes. Annex 3-6 compares estimated per square meter cost of project
classrooms with those of other Bank Croup financed projects and indicates
that the cost ls below the average for the five regions shown. Site
selection criteria, description of construction activities for each of the
three phases, and the technology to be used are provided in Annex 3-7.
3.13      The IDA credit would finance 100% of construction materials; 80% of
skilled labor services and 50% of the unskilled labor costs; contractor
services; school furniture; 89 manmonths of specialist services (17 manmonths
foreign and 72 manmonths local architect/engineers to develop the technical
capacity of the Directorate of School Construction and Equipment and a
project officer to supervise implementation); 18 manmonths of fellowships; 96
manmonths of local training for communities; 216 manmonths of contractual
fees for field staff; and printing of construction guides and technical
documents. At negotiations, the Government agreed that (a) the 400
classrooms will be staffed by the 400 teachers redeployed from administrative
positions; and (b) the project classrooms will be located at sites agreed
with IDA. Linkage of disbursement for the construction phases to policy
progress is set out in para 3.3. In the event progress is satisfactory,
funds would be released for the next phase to permit overlapping of the
construction phases.

3.14      Establishing a project coordinetion capacity within the Ministry of
National Education. To develop capability to coordinale, support and monitor
implementation of the proposed and future education projects, the Government
has established a Project Unit within MEN. It is attached to the Office of
the Secretary General and headed by a full-time Project Director with respon-
sibility for overall supervision and coordination of project activities. He
will be supported by staff familiar with Bank Croup procedures who are
presently serving at the Project Unit of the Ministry of Equipment, which
until 1978 had the responsibility for school construction (para 2.9). In
addition, to facilitate coordination of the project's pedagogical aspects, an
educational planner who coordinated preparation of the proposed project has
been transferred from the Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and Plan-
ning to the Project Unit, and an administrator has been recruited to estab-
lish the management systems and procedural guidelines. The IDA credit would
finance furniture and equipment, including two vehicles; 87 manmonths of
specialist services; 13 manmonths of fellowships; fees for contractual staff;
and incremental operating costs of equipment financed under the project.
Prior to negotiations, the Government issued a decree, agreed with IDA, on
the responsibilities and functions of the Project Unit, and confirmed that
the Director has been appointed. As a condition of Board presentation the
Governnment has issued an "arrêté" on the organizational structure, responsi-
bilities and functions of the Project Unit. Annex 3-8 protides details on
the responsibilities and functions of the Project Unit.
3.   Improvement of Teacher Effectiveness and Efficiency of Primary
school Inspectors
3.15      Strengthening the National Pedagogical Institute (INEADE).  To
enhance INEADE's capacity to promote teacher effectiveness and increase
student achievement levels, and to ensure that the cost-efficiency measures
supported by the project (including recruitment of a higher proportion of
"instituteurs adjoints") do not dilute education quality, the project would
provide support to INEADE to: (a) adapt curricula to the Senegalese culture
and conditions and develop appropriate teaching methods and materials based
on classroom research and experimentation; (b) develop a battery of tests,
starting with French and mathematics, to assess student progress over time;
(c) prepare in-service training programs for teachers and inspectors; and
(d) jointly with the Teacher Training Colleges and the Directorate of Primary
Education, develop the structure and content of the revised "instituteur
adjoint" pre-service training program (para 2.4). INEADE would also experi-
ment with multigrade teaching in about 25 rural classrooms and various forms
of the double-shift system in 75 urban classrooms over a two-year period,
starting in th.e 1987/88 school year. On the basis of this experimentation,
INEADE would establish criteria and norms for the two systems, develop a plan
for implementation in appropriate classrooms (about 20% of total classrooms)
as of the 1989/90 school year, train teachers, headmasters and inspectors,
and prepare specialized curricula and materials. Annex 3-9 details on the
experimentation with double-shift and multigrade systems.
3.16      Project funds would finance the construction/rehabilitation of a
building for INEADE to improve its working conditions; furniture and equip-
ment, including three vehicles; 59 manmonths of local (four manmonths) and
foreign (55 manmonths) specialist services and 166 manmonths of fellowships;
100 manmonths of in-service training in double-shift and multigrade systems
and innovative teaching methods for teachers, headmasters and inspectors; and



- 12 -
incremental operating costs of the equipment provided. To remedy the
veaknesses of the Institute experienced since its creation (para 2.9), the
Governtent is conducting a study to strengthen the Institute' s organizational
structure and staffing. Accordingly a condition of credit effectiveness
would be the issuance of a decree, agreed with IDA and based on the
recommendations of a pre-investment study, specifying the reorganized
structure and revised functions of INEADE; and appointment of the key
supervisory/technical staff of INEADE in consultation with IDA. The
Government bas, as a condition of Board presentation, appointed a new
Director for INEADE, in consultation with IDA.   Progress in experimentation
with and implementation of the multigrade and double-shift systems would be
included in the two joint policy progress reviews (para 3.3).
3.17      Strengthening the role of inspectors in educational administration
and teacher support. To improve educational planning, management of edu-
cation budgets and personnel at the regional level, and support to head-
masters and teachers, the project would strengthen the regional and depart-
mental inspectorates in two ways. First, the project would complete the
study that the Governnent is currently conducting on the functions and
staffing of the inspectorates under a decentralized system. Following a
joint review of the study's recommendations, the project would experiment
with decentralization in the three project regions for two years, starting in
August 1988, and implement the new system nationwide as of the 1990/91 school
year. Redundant teachers who serve as administrative staff at inspectorates
would be redeployed into the 400 project classrooms, and assistant depart-
mental inspectors would be utilized solely as pedagogical advisers and
relieved of their general administrative tasks; and inspectors would be
provided with appropriate powers of sanction to deal with teacher absenteeism
and performance. Second, the project would provide a training program for
the staff of the regional and departmental inspectorates to prepare them for
their roles under decentralization and to upgrade their knowledge and skills
in educational and financial planning, cost control, personnel management,
school administration, pedagogical assistance to teachers, and academic
supervision. Annex 3-10 provides details on the decentralization process and
the training program.
3.18      The IDA credit would finance seven manmonths of foreign and 10 man-
months of local specialist services to assist in implementation of decentra-
lization and in the preparation and delivery of the staff training program;
50 manmonths of fellowships in school administration and 367 manmonths of
local training; reproduction equipment; vehicles for 27 of the 41 depart-
mental inspectorates, and 20 motorbikes for assistant inspectors partici-
pating in the experimentation; equipment and essential oftice furniture; and
incremental operating costs of the equipment provided under the project. In
addition, to rehabilitate offices in the 12 inspectorates participating in
the decentralization experiment, a line of credit of US$19,000 would be made
available to each one.
3.19      Provision of textbooks and teacher guides.  To increase the supply
of textbooks and teacher guides and to ensure oheir relevance for students
and teachers, the project would establish a Textbook Publishing Unit within
INEADE to create, adapt and publish textbooks and teacher guides, manage
textbook production and supply, and ensure the economical procurement of
textbooks and their safe storage in schools. The Unit would direct the pub-
lishing process, train and guide authors, and assess, revise and edit



- 13 -
manuscripts. Relevant units of INEADE would evaluate manuscripts, do
controlled testing in classrooms, and train teachers in textbook use. Over
one million textbooks, in 25 different titles in French, math, science and
local languages, and 61,000 teacher books/guides would be provided. Math and
science textbooks would be adapted and language textbooks would be written by
local authors. Each textbook would be shared by two students and the average
book life is estimated to be three years. It is estimated that by changing
production specifications the cost of a textbook developed by the Unit would
be 30% less than the current market price; the quality, however, would be
maintained or even improved. The Government is considering assessment of
fees for textbook loans as of the 1987/88 school year. Calculations indicate
that an average fee of CFAF 1,000 (US$2.80) per set of textbooks per year
would cover the replenishment cost of textbooks by 1990.   To ensure that the
fee scheme under consideration would be equitable and not discourage school
attendance in low-income areas, IDA would review the scheme with the Govern-
ment prior to implementation. Annex 3-11 provides details on the cost and
production schedules of textbooks to be developed, and a comparison of expen-
ditures and income under the current free distribution system and the
proposed fee system.
3.20      Project funds would finance furniture for the Textbook Publishing
Unit; printing and publishing of textbooks and teacher guides, including the
cost of purchasing adaptation rights from original publishers and the cost of
co-publishing; storage cabinets for schools; equipment and one vehicle; 24
manmonths of the services for a publishing specialist and production
controller; 12 manmonths of fellowships for the Unit's Director and Editor;
27 manmonths of local training for authcrs and inspectors; distribution of
the new textbooks; and incremental operating costs related to the equipment
provided.
B.   Project Cost and Financing Plan
3.21      The total project cost is estimated at US$19.6 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$12.2 million (62%). The project
would be exempt from taxes and duties. Base cost estimates have been
adjusted to July 1986, the date of negotiations, on the basis of June-
November 1985 prices. Total contingencies of US$4.7 million represent 31% of
base line costs. Physical contingencies of 10% applied to civil works,
furniture and equipment represent 4% (US$0.6 million) of base costs and price
contingencies 27% (US$4.0 million) of base costs. Price contingencies are
based on the implementation schedule and the following expected increases in
local and foreign prices: 6.8% for 1987-88, 7.0% foi 1989, 7.1% for 1990,
and 4.0% for 1991-94. Inflation rates are assumed to be equal for both
foreign and local costs because of compensatory exchange rate adjustments.
An IDA credit of Special Drawing Rights 10.2 million (US$12.0 million) and a
loan of US$5.3 million equivalent from the Nigerian Trust Fund, administered
by the African Development Bank (AfDB), would be provided towards financing
of the project. Co-financing plans were firmed up during negotiations. The
AfDB credit would finance the project's textbook, classroom rehabilitation
and maintenance components, and also the civil works, furniture, equipment
and incremental operating cost categories of the INEADE component. The IDA
credit would finance the specialist services for that component. The IDA and
AfDB credits would finance 61% and 27% of the total project cost, respec-
tively. The Government would contribute the remainder (US$2.3 million
equivalent) to include 2C% of incremental operating costs, cash and in-kind



- 14 -
contrïbutions of local governments and communities for unskilled labor, local
construction materials and manufacturing of classroom furniture. A condition
of effectiveness of the IDA credit would be that all conditions necessary for
an initial disbursement of funds from AfDB have been met. Annexes 3-12, 3-13
and 3-14 provide details on the base cost estimates, project costs, and
financing plan, respectively.
3.22      Recurrent cost implications.  The 400 project classrooms would be
staffed by 400 teachers redeployed from administrative positions without
replacing them in those posta vacated by their transfer (para 3.17). More-
over, as a result of the proposed policy measures, the estimated 40% increase
in current enrollments in the school year 2000/2001 is not expected to
generate an increase in the share of education expenditures within the
Government's recurrent budget from its 1985/86 level.  Staff for the Physical
Facility Management Division and for the Textbook Unit would be transferred
from other MEN services or ministries. The textbook component is expected to
reduce the current governiment expenditures for textbooks. Moreover, the
Government's proposal to create a revolving fund from fees charged for text-
book use is expected to cover the cost of stock replenishment, including
distribution and losses, by 1990. Also, the textbook rental fee would be
adjusted for inflation. The appropriateness of this proposed fee system
vould be reviewed with the Government prior to implementation (para 3.19).
C.  Project Implementation
1.   Preparation, Management and Institution Building
3.23      Preparation and present status.  Implementation plans and schedules
for all components have been prepared. Sites for all classroom and office
building construction/rehabilitation have been identified. The Government is
finalizing the study on the modification of the prototype classrooms, deve-
loped under the Third Education Project, and the survey for school rehabili-
tation. Contracts for classroom construction and rehabilitation, repre-
senting over 75% of the total cost for civil works, would ba ready for
tendering by December 1986, prior to the estimated date of credit effective-
ness (January 1987). For construction/rehabilitation of a building to house
INEADE (para 3.16), financing would be provided by AfDB; draft designs and
bid documents would be available by December 1986 and finalized by March
1987. Furrniture and equipment lists have been reviewed by IDA and found
acceptable. The Government has issued the decrees on the Physical Facility
Management Division and the Project Unit (paras 3.8 and 3.14). The Director
of the Project Unit has been appointed. The cros--effectiveness condition
for the AfDB credit is expected to be fulfilled prior to IDA credit
effectiveness, as AfDB intends to submit the project to its Board in October-
November 1986.
3.24      Project management.  The project period is eight years (January 1,
1987 - December 31, 1994). The project would be implemented by the relevant
MEN Directorates through a coordinator assigned to each component. The
Directorate of School Construction and Equipment would be responsible for the
primary school maintenance, rehabilitation and construction program. The
inspectorate component would be implemented by the Directorate of Elementary
Education. The Project Unit would coordinate project implementation, serve
as liaison between IDA and the project agencies, and support the Directorates
in the areas of procurement, financial administration, documentation,



- 15 -
monitoring and reporting. At negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it vill (a) appoint project staff in accordance with the staff appoint-
ment schedule; and (b) prepare an annual local and foreign training program
for project staff satisfactory to IDA and implement it thereafter. The
implementation and staff appointment schedules are provided in Annexes 3-15 and
3-16.
3.25      Specialist services and fellovships.  The project vould provide 311
manmonths of overseas fellowships and observation visite; 717 manmonths of
local training; and 360 manmonths of local (122 manmonths) and foreîgn (238
manmonths) specialist services. Terms of reference for the specialists have
been prepared. Technical assistance contracte vould be avarded to consulting
firms. At negotiations, the Government agreed that (a) fellowships will be
awarded on the basis of agreed criteria and procedures; and (b) fellovship
recipients will remain in their poste for at least five years upon completion
of their studies. A condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit would be
that the technical assistance contracte for the first year of projection
operation, have been signed, following consultation with IDA. Details of the
specialist services and fellovships programs and award criteria are provided
in Annexes 3-17 and 3-18.
2.   Procurement
3.26      Imported equipment and building materials, valued at US$1.6 million
equivalent, representing about 70% of the total value of equipment and build-
ing materials, would be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with IDA's guidelines and grouped into bid packages of at
least US$100,000 equivalent. Where ICB procedures are used, goode manufac-
tured locally would be given a preference margin, in accordance with Govern-
ment guidelines, of 15% or the applicable custome duty, whichever is less.
Contracts which are emall in size or involve videly dispersed sites are not
likely to attract foreign bidders. These contracte would be awarded through
local competitive bidding (LCB) or local shopping. Procurement through LCB,
in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA, would be applied to bid
packages valued at between US$20,000 and US$100,000 equivalent and would
comprise: (a) local building materials and construction contracts (valued at
US$1.18 milllin equivalent), and (b) contracts for furniture, equipment and
items relatei to operating expenses (valued at US$2.69 million equivalent).
Procurement through local shopping (by inviting at least three quotations) in
accordance with local procedures would be applied to local building materials
and unskilled labor contracts valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent (total
value of US$2.33 million equivalent). Specialist services and fellovships,
totaling about US$5.0 million, would be procured in accordance vith IDA's
guidelines on the use of consultants. Procurement packages (announcements,
bid documents and proposed contract awards) valued at or exceeding US$100,000
equivalent, representing about 18% of the total value of IDA-financed con-
tracte for civil works and goode, would be subject to IDA's review prior to
award. This percentage is lower than usual oving to the project's objective
to involve communities in classroom construction and utilize local materials
and craftsmen. Accordingly, the remaining 72% of the civil works and goods
contracte, or about 440 contracts, would be subject to random or post-review
by IDA. Procurement of contracte for components financed by AfDB on a
parallel basis would follow procedures acceptable to AfDB. Procurement
arrangements are summarized in the table below and detailed in Annex 3-19.

3.28       Special Account.  A Special Account of US$400,000 equivalent,
denominated in convertible CFA francs, would be established at a local bank
for disbursements under the IDA credit. The amount is estimated to cover
three months' expenses for: (a) short-term specialist services, and pet diem
travel for local and overseas training; (b) civil works, furniture, equip-
ment, and transport contracts valued at under US$20,000 equivalent; and
(c) incremental operating costs of the project. Replenishment applications
to IDA would be aggregated into packages of at least US$80,000 equivalent and
would be accompanied by the full documentation, except for expenses related



- 18 -
to in-country training, fees, incremental operating costs, and contracts
valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent, which would be reimbursed against
certified statements of expenditures (SOE). Documentation for SOEs would be
retained at the Project Unit for review by IDA and project auditors. Reim-
bursement applications would also include a statement of account movements
since the last application, with the balance certified by the bank holding
the account, and a reconciliation showing that the balance represents the
original amount less payments awaiting reimbursement or small working
advances. The Special Account would be operated under terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA, and should any disbursements made subsequently be dis-
allowed by IDA, the Government would be responsible for reimbursing the
Special Account for the corresponding amount.
4.   Auditing and Reporting
3.29      The Project Unit would maintain separate accounts for the IDA
credit, AfDB credit, and Government counterpart financing. These accounts
vould be further subdivided into expenditures incurred for each component.
At negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: (a) all project
accounts will be audited annually and all disbursement against statements of
expenditure will be audited semi-annually by an independent auditor accept-
able to IDA; (b) the Government will submit to IDA the audit reports on pro-
ject accounts by December 31 of each year and the audit reports on statements
of expenditure by June 30 and December 31 of each year; (c) the audit reports
will certify that funds were used for the purposes for which they were pro-
vided. Audit fees would be financed by the IDA credit; and (d) the Project
Unit will submit semi-annual reports to IDA on project implementation and
expenditures, special reports on a need basis, and a final report on imple-
mentation experience and project outcomes within six months of the IDA Credit
Closing Date.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
4.1       Benefits.  Through the application of the sectoral adjustment
policies the project would, in 1994, help increase enrollments in primary
schools nationwide by about 32% (an estimated 180,000 additional students or,
in cumulative terms, over the period SY 1987/88 through 1994/95, by about
450,000 additional student years) without increasing the share of education
in the Government budget from its 1985/86 level. The classroom construction
program in the three project regions would increase enrollment rates by 7%
(about 18,000 additional student places), reduce construction unit costs
by about 35%, and develop replicable classroom designs and a cost-sharing
system by communities. The cost-efficiency measures would be accompanied by
improvements in the quality of education through provision of relevant
textbooks, revision of curricula, and teacher and inspector upgrading
programs. Support to institution building would yield the long-term benefit
of improved education planning, budgeting and resource management capacities.
4.2       Risks.  The project has two potential risks.  First, sectoral
adjustment measures such as reducing higher education subsidies or



- 19 -
introducing double-shift system may not be fully endorsed by teachers,
students or parents. Avare of this risk, the Government has been pursuing a
public acceptance campaign. In addition, the project provides for two joint
Government/IDA reviews to assess progress achieved in implementing the
sectoral adjustment policy measures and to make any necessary modifications.
The second risk concerns possible delays in implementing the classroom
construction program, oving to MEN's limited technical capacity and the
experimental nature of cost-sharing with communities. To reduce this risk, a
key criterion for selecting the target communities is their commitment to
contribute about 25% of the classroom construction costs in cash or in kind.
In addition, the Government would prepare annual construction programs and
monitor their implementation to ensure timely completion.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMOENDATIONS
5.1       Prior to negotiations, the Government:
(a) issued a decree, agreed vith IDA, creating the Physical Facility
Management Division and decentralizing the Directorate of School
Construction and Equipment at the three project regions (para 3.8);
and
(b) issued a decree, agreed vith IDA, on the responsibilities and func-
tions of the Project Unit, and appointed the Director (para 3.14).
5.2       At negotiations agreement was reached vith the Government that:
(a) the vork program of the Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning will be implemented as scheduled (para 3.5);
(b) counterpart financing (15% of the value of construction contracts)
will be included in the annual school repairs budget during project
implementation period and the funde will be made available to the
project (para 3.9);
(c) a preventive maintenance program vill be developed by June 30,
1988, and responsibility for the program vill be assigned to head-
masters and teachers as part of their regular duties (para 3.10);
(d) the 400 classrooms to be constructed under the project vill be
staffed by 400 teachers redeployed from administrative positions,
and the project classrooms will be located at sites agreed with IDA
(para 3.13);
(e) project staff will be appointed ln accordance vith the staff
appointment schedule, and an annual loc^al and foreign training
program for project staff satisfactory to IDA will be prepared and
implemented thereafter (para 3.24);
(f) fellowships will be awarded on the basis of agreed criteria; and
fellowship recipients will remain in their posts for at least five
years upon completion of their studies (para 3.25); and



- 20 -
(g)  all project accounts vill be audited annually and all disbursement
against statements of expenditure vill be audited semi-annually by
an independent auditor acceptable to IDA; audit reports on project
accounts vill be submitted to IDA by December 31 of each year, and
audit reports on statements of expenditure will be submitted to IDA
by June 30 and December 31 of each year; the audit reports vill
certify that funds vere used for the purposes for which they were
provided; and the Project Unit vill submit semi-annual reports to
IDA on project implementation and expenditures, special reports on
a need basis, and a final report on implementation experience and
project outcomes within six months of the IDA Credit Closing Date
(para 3.29).
5.3       As a condition of Board presentation, the Government has appointed
a new Director for INEADE, in consultation with IDA; and issued the arrêtés
on the organizational structure, responsibilities and functions of the
Project Unit and DCES (paras 3.8, 3.14 and 3.16, respectively).
5.4       Conditions of effectiveness of the IDA credit would be that (a) all
conditions necessary for an initial disbursement of funds from AfDB have been
met (para 3.21); (b) the Government has issued a decree, agreed with IDA and
based on the recommendations of a pre-investnent study, specifying the re-
organized structure and revised functions of INEADE; and has appointed the
key supervisory/technical staff of INEADE in consultation with IDA
(para 3.16); and (c) the technical assistance contracts for the first year of
project implementation have been signed, folloving consultation vith IDA
(para 3.25).
5.5       A condition of disbursement for the second phase (175 classrooms)
and the third phase (175 classrooms) of the classroom construction program
vould be realization of satisfactory progress in implementing the policy
measures, as determined during the first and second joint reviews, respec-
tively, in accordance with the established criteria (para 3.3).
5.6       Subject to the above assurances, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of SDR 10.2 million (US$12.0 million) to the Republic
of Senegal.

A.   Background
1.        Since 1960, despite the economic problems faced by Senegal and
the low GDP growth of 2.3%, the education system has experienced
significant, although unbalanced, growth. This is attributable to two
factors: (a) the Government budget has grown much faster than the economy
(from 8.4% in 1960 to 20.3% in 1984); and (b) the education budget has
increased from 17% in the mid 1960s to 25% in 1984, representing a growth
from less than 1.0% of GDP to 5.0% (see Table 1). Given the worsened
economic situation of the country since 1980 and the excess of expenditures
over revenues, the Government has mandated the containment of public
expenditures. Consequently, further increases in the education budget in
the medium term are unlikely. Unless measures are taken to allocate and
utilize resources more efficiently and to increase the share of private
participation in education, the current low net enrollment rate of 40% in
primary educatlon can be expected to decline, given the 3% per annum
population growth rate. The importance of these measures becomes even more

ANNEX 2-3
Page 2 of 12
urgent in light of the Government's objective to achieve universal primary
education by the year 2000.
2.        In Senegal, as in many other francophone and sub-Saharan African
countries, the emphasis has been on secondary and h4gher education, where
enrollments and resource allocations have far outpaced those for primary
education. About 1980, however, this general tendency began to show signs
of changing: enrollments at the University of Dakar declined slightly
between 1980 and 1985, while enrollments in primary schools increased at an
average rate of 7.6% per year, resulting in an lncrease of 4% in the
primary enrollment ratio (see Table 2).
3.        Internal efficiency is low at all educational leveis, and the
curricula content has an academie focus rather than a practical orientation
to facilitate access to productive employment. Only 40% of pupils entering
primary school actually graduate, and to produce one primary school
graduate requires 15.9 pupil-years, compared with the ideal maximum of six
years. Similarly, at the University of Dakar only 25% of the students
receive their degrees.
B.   Cost and Financing of Education
4.        Public schools are financed primarily by the Government (87.6%),
with limited contributions (2.8%) to recurrent expenses from communities
and families (3.5%), for a total of about 94%. Private schools receive
6.1% of public funds for education. The contribution of external
assistance is difficult to quantify. France, which is the largest
contributor, provides financing primarily for post-primary levels.
5.        Salaries at all levels and cash or in-kind subsidies to secondary
and especially higher education represent the largest share of the
Government's recurrent budget for education. At the primary level, the
proportion of salaries is as high as 99.6% (see Table 3). Consequently,
expenditures for non-salary inputs such as teaching aids and textbooks are
minimal, contributing to the low level of internal efficiency.
Unit Costs
6.        Unit costs in pre-primary schooling and teacher training are
especially high in Senegal -- CFAF 94,15r (US$261) and CFAF 1,209,836
(US$3,361), respectively. The primary reason Is the low pupil/teacher
ratio in pre-primary (12:1) and in teacher training (6.6:1), the latter due
to the curtailment of growth of the civil service and major reduction of
intake to achools preparing students for public employment. Table 4
provides unit costs by level of education and compares them to those in
other country groupings.
7.        In primary education, the unit cost is estimated at CFAF 42,000
(US$117) or 26% of GNP per capita. This results from the relatively high
cost of teachers (more than 8 times the GNP per capita) and an average
pupil/teacher ratio of 46:1. There are, however, wide variations in the
pupil/teacher ratio (an average range between 31% and 66% as shown in
Table 5), and therefore in unit coste between regions and between urban and
rural areas. For example, it is estimated that in urban areas of the



- 27 -                       ANNEX 2-3
Page 3 of 12
Casamance Region, the unit cost is about CFAF 30,000 (US$83), whereas it is
over CFAF 60,000 (US$167) in rural areas of Senegal Oriental. To utilize
teachers and physical facilities more efficiently, implementation of a
multigrade system in rural areas should be considered.
8.        At the secondary level, the unit cost varies by 50% between lower
secondary schools (CEGs) that are separate from a lycée (upper secondary)
and CEGs that are physically located in lycées. The reason for this is
that more than 40% of the staff in lycées are trained teachers but have no
teaching duties. Their salaries constitute 36% of the secondary level's
personnel budget. Furthermore, in upper secondary the pupil/teacher ratio
is only 19:1, which clearly is too small. When one takes into account the
entire staff of the lycées, the pupil/staff ratio is 11:1 (see Table 6).
There is ample room for achieving significant savings at the lycées through
more efficient utilization of teachers.
9.        In hi8her education, the unit cost amounts to CFAF 812,000
(US$2,255), or five times the GNP per capita. This cost can be expressed
in two parts: the unit cost for the "pedagogical" component (academic
aspects, including personnel costs) and the "social" component (bursaries,
subsidized room and board, and transportation for students). There is a
large potential for realizing cost savings in the "pedagogical" component,
which represents 69% of the unit cost, because: (a) the average
student/teacher ratio is about 16:1, which ie low for a large university
(11,000 students); and (b) the number of non-teaching staff (875 vis-a-vis
a teaching force of 721) is excessive. Similarly, the "social" component,
representing 31% of the unit cost, offers an area for significant economies
through tightening of the eligibility criteria and introducing measures for
student participation in financing a share of their education costs.
Table 7 provides detailed breakdown of the higher education unit costs, and
Table 8 shows the functional breakdown of the higher education budget.
Economie and External Efficiency
10.       External efficiency of education and economic efficiency in
allocating resources to the various educational levels could be improved in
Senegal. As Table 9 shows, the marginal rate of return l/ is the lowest
for lower secondary education and second lowest for the four-year higher
education. They also indicate that the difference between private and
social rates of return widen as the level of education increases. For the
four-year higher education, the private rate is about 2.4 times greater
thar the social rate. These figures are indicative of the following:
(a) lower secondary education is considered as a transition to upper
secondary and does not prepare students for the job market; (b) at the
higher education level, the high private rates, relative to social returns,
result partly from the subsidy structure which tends to push studenti  to
continue beyond the level of education that is economically efficient; and
1/   In the absence of detailed employment and wage data, the rate of
return figures should be considered as orders of magnitude and
interpreted in relative terms.

ANNEX 2-3
Page 4 of 12
(c) globally, analysis of the rate of return structure shows a need for
regulating access to lover secondary and for increasing cost recovery in
upper secondary and higher education.
11.       Distribution of enrollments at the varîous levels of schooling
and the unit costs result in an unequal distribation of public resources
for education among members of a given generation. The data show that
public resources for education are highly concentrated, whereby 4.5% of the
age group whose final level of schooling is upper secondary or university
receive 50.7% of the public resources for education. The distribution of
public resources in education is, in fact, probably more skewed than these
figures indicate; but since data are not available on the socio-economic
and geographic origin of those who succeed in receiving secondary and
higher education, and thus a disproportionate share of the public
resources, this assertion cannot be verified.
12.       In sum, long-term development of the education sector in general,
and expansion of primary education in particular, will depend largely on
the implementation of appropriate policies to promote efficient and
equitable allocation and use of sector resources.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROPOSED SECTORAL ADJUSTMENT
POLICIES ON PRIMARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT RATES
1.        The Government of Senegal has declared as a national priority the
achievement of universal primary education by the year 2000. Projections
based on the 1986 estimated grosa enrollment rate of about 49% and the
growth rate of the primary achool-age population at 3%, indicate, howevers
that if the present cost structure and the share of the total recurrent
budget allocated to primary education were substantially unchanged, the
enrollment rate would decline from about 49% to 38% by the year 2000.
2.        To help the Government advance towards achieving universal
primary education within the financial constraints of the economy, the
project includes a number of sectoral adjustment policies. These policies
have been identified partly on the basis of simulations using the Education
Financing Simulation Model (EFDISIMO), which permits estimating the amount
of financial resources that could be freed up through cost-efficiency and
budget reallocation measures and the effect of these primary enrollment
rates. The model projects enrollment rates as a dependent variable of:
(a) budgetary allocations to the education sector and their distribution
among subsectors and their components; and (b) the efficiency of the
primary education subsector, as reflected in the cost per student. The
policies aimed at increasing enrollment rates have been grouped under two
categories: (a) financial measures (slowing down the growth of secondary
and higher education budgets, and direct and indirect subsidies to higher
education); and (b) operational measures (increasing the proportion of
assistant-level teachers with a lover salary scale, redeploying into
classrooms teachers who currently do not teach, and reducing class hours
required by the curriculum while decreasing class size through the
double-shift system).
3.        Simulations show that implementation of an individual policy
measure is insufficient to reduce the enrollment rate decline signifi-
cantly. Table 1 shows that even when a policy (the double-shift system),
which has the largest enrollment impact, is applied individually, it would,
at best, only halt the enrollment decline. To have a marked impact on the
enrollment rates, it is necessary to apply the policy package in total.
Table 2 shows that, with the application of the policy package, the enroll-
ment rate in the year 2000 would be about 12% higher than it would be if
there were no policy intervention. To maximize the impact on enrollment
rates, a combination of the policy package and increased budgetary
resources are needed. Accordingly, under this more optimistic scenario
which assumes that for the next five years the growth of the education
budget remains at 2.3% but then increases to 2.8% for the following five
years and to 3% thereafter, enrollment rates would increase to about 71% by
the year 2000 -- an increase of 65% in both the enrollment rates and the

total number of primary students. Bar Chart l on page 6 of this Annex
shows a comparison of budget amounts, unit costs, total number of students,
and enrollment rates by the year 2000 with and withcuc policy inter-
ventions, using a low-growth (2.3% p.a.) scenarlo. Bar Chart 2 provides
the same comparisons using a higher growth rate.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THE GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION STRATEGY
A.   Introduction
1.        The current proposal for educational reform in Senegal dates back
to 1981 vith the Government's initiative in calling the "Etats Généraux" to
discuss the state of education in the country. The initial work vas
developed and detailed by the "Commission Nationale de Réforme de
l'Education et de la Formation" (CNREF), which submitted its proposals to
the Government in mid-1984.
2.        The major proposals of the CNREF vere grouped around the three
commissions which undertook the bulk of the vork: the first dealt vith
educational philosophy and policies; the second vith the examination of
resources and structures necessary for the education system; and the third
commission dealt vith the personnel involved in the system.
3.        With regard to the philosophy and policies of education, it vas
proposed that the availability of education should be extended to the age
group 3 to 16 with a common content for all during this period. All
specialization or differences in content vould begin after orientation upon
completion of the common core at the end of the current lover secondary
cycle (3rd secondary). As regards content, it vas stressed that education
should be adapted to reflect closely the realities of the nation. It vas
proposed that this could be achieved through the introduction of a
comprehensive polyvalent type of education which vould include: practical
work; the eventual use of national languages as medium of instruction; the
promotion of Arabic as a language in all schools; and the introduction of
religious education as a way to improve the ethical and moral content of
education. It vas suggested that coordination of the management of the
education and training sector should be under a single ministry, that
nevertheless decentralization of the management and resources needed for
education should continue, and that private education should be eliminated.
4.        The proposals of the CNREF vith respect to resources vere less
exhaustive and suggested taking two main directions: first, the creation
of a series of measures which vould allow all parties involved in education
to participate in the implementation of the proposed reform; and second,
the rationalization of resources allocated for education, insofar as the
management of financial resources is concerned. The creation of a national
fund for education vas proposed in order to generate additional resources.
5.        As regards personnel, the CNREF proposed a series of measures
aimed at providing the education system vith high-quality teachers,
motivated and fully avare of the importance and responsibilities attached
to their poste, who vould have passed through adequate pre-service and
in-service training courses staffed by competent teacher trainers. These



- 49 -
ANNEX 2-8
Page 2 of 4
proposals for raising the status of the teaching profession included
propositions to redefine the teaching personnel statutes.
B.   The Reform Proposals
6.        The Government's reaction to the vork of the "Etats Généraux" and
the CNREF vas positive but cautious. Certain reservations were expressed,
points of detail questioned and a general endorsement of the proposals
made. The major reservation vas that, since the CNREF vas unable to
examine the cost implications of its proposals, these would require further
study before substantive change could be expected. The Government's
strategy vas elaborated as one based on an experimental, progressive and
step-by-step approach, vith each step conditioned by the availability of
resources for the subsequent step, and also as a strategy which built on
existing experience and the current situation, rather than trying to create
a system from scratch.
7.        As regards the philosophy and structure of the education system,
the role of the school as a national, democratic and popular institution
reflecting the national heritage and culture vas accepted. The proposed
organigram of the education system vas approved, but the proposed extension
of compulsory schooling vas postponed until the necessary resources become
avaîlable. A target of four years of education for all vith entry at age 7
vas substituted for the CNREF proposal (para 3). The disappearance of the
distinction between general academic secondary education and technical
secondary education proposed by the CNREF was questioned. At the level of
higher education, the Government accepted the reform proposals but
suggested additional vork ln order to integrate work already done by both
the faculty committee and the university committee.
8.        In examining the proposal aimed at modifying the content of
education and certification issues, the Government expressed interest in
the notion of comprehensive education as a means of enhancing the
importance of manual and productive vork at school and adapting the school
to the national and regional situation; however, there appears to be some
confusion over use of the terms "polyvalent, polytechnic, practical and
productive." As regard religious education, it was not retained as a
compulsory examinable subject, but the introduction of civics and moral
values into the curriculum vith examination at all levels vas substituted.
The question of the role and importance of national languages was
approached by the Govermnent with some caution. The long-term final
objective of the use of national languages parallel with French as eventual
languages of instruction vas tentatively approved.  But movement to this
stage was to be through a series of vell-defined experimental phases, each
undertaken under conditions which would maximize the possibility of a
succeassful outcome. The idea of a language of unification among the
national languages vas discussed but not decided upon, but as a first step
the experimental introduction of certain national languages as subjects of
study in primary school was accepted by the Government. It was decided
that Arabic would remain an optional subject at the primary level and its
use at the secondary level would be revised. As regards examinations, the
Goverument rejected the proposal of the CNREF to suppress or eliminate
exams, but expressed willingness to experiment in certain cases for only a
limited period with the entrance exam for lover secondary school.

9.        The proposals of the CNREF concerning both personnel and other
reaources vere subject to the reservation that the full financial
implications of all the proposals had not been thoroughly examined. The
Government concluded that extension of the pre-service training period for
teachers could be done only on a progressive basis as resources become
available. Separation of the teachers' statute from the "Fonction
publique," as vell as cumulative increases in the special indemnities for
teachers, is not possible at present. More efficient use of personnel
through multigrade and double-shift classes was approved but choice of the
precise method vas not made. The Government agreed with the idea of
establishing a national educational fund, but indicated that this could not
be supported by fiscal resources. As regards private education, the
proposal to eliminate this vas not accepted, on the grounds of democratic
choice and the large number of students currently enrolled in private
schools. Finally, the extension of resources to cover the social costs of
education, to expand both boarding and school canteen facilities, vas seen
to be of differing importance depending on the type and level of education
concerned. Nevertheless, the current financial situation limited the
possibility of such an extension for some time to come.
10.       The content of the Educational Reform is summarized below:

-    Basic education cycle of 13 year's duration -  pre-school from 3
teo 6 years, followed by comprehensive compulsory schooling of 10
year' s duration;
-    Secondary and professional cycle of 3 yearts duration;
-    Higher education and research of varying duration.
Quantitative targets: The full enrollment of the 7-12 age group by
the year 2000, with consideration given to the demand for education at
other levels which would result from this expansion.
Content of education: In order to adapt educational content to
reflect closely the culture, heritage and realities of the Senegalese
situation, three innovations in content vere proposed: (a) the
introduction of national languages into education; (b) the
introduction of a polytechnic orientation to the curriculum through
the integration of productive vork in educational establishments; and
(c) the introduction of moral and religious education in the
curriculum:
11.       A strategy vas adopted which fixes as a minimum target the gross
enrollment ratio of 60% of the 7-12 age group at the end of the 1985-89
Plan period. At the same time, the experimental phase of reform in the
content of the curriculum would be started. Rence the initial task vould
include detailed programmlng and organization of the reform. A further
activity vould be the development of detailed programming and planning of
the experimental phase of the reform, to be followed at a later stage by
the start-up of the initial experimental phase in the introduction of

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STRENGTRENING THE DIRECTORATE OF STUDIES, HUMAN RESOURCES AND PLANNING
1.        Objective.  The project would assist the Directorate of Studies,
Human Resources and Planning (DERP) to improve its sectoral planning,
budgeting and resource management capacities and to develop appropriate
financing mechanisms for cost-effective expansion of primary education.
2.        Background.  The current imbalances in enrollment rates and
budgetary allocations between levels of education result, to a large
extent, from inadequate planning, which in turn is attributable to three
factors: (a) until recently the Government had not articulated its objec-
tives nor an overall strategy for the education sector ind therefore plan-
ning lacked a central focus; (b) the existence of three ministries for
formal education and training -- each with its own planning directorate and
poor communication between the ministries, together with the absence of a
structure for synthesis and coordination -- has impaired integrated plan-
ning; and (c) staffing of the planning directorates primarily with
inspectors and teachers who have had no formal training in educational
planning, economics or statistics has hampered efficient planning.
3.        In 1985 the Government tackled the first of these problems when
it formulated a broad strategy for the sector, in which the priority objec-
tive is the development of primary education. More recently, it has
addressed the second problem by merging the three ministries into a single
Ministry of National Education and placing their respective planning units
vithin DERP. The remaining issue to be addressed is the strengthening of
the technical and analytical capacity of the newly integrated planning
staff.
4.        Strategy.  In its current role, DERP would be responsible for
ensuring effective implementation of the sectoral adjustment program. It
would also have responsibility for planning sectoral growth strategies, and
developing further measures towards the control of capital and recurrent
costs and cost-recovery. Within the framework of these responsibilities,
DERP would undertake studies aimed at:
(a) Analyzing demographic, qualitative and cost aspects of each sub-
sector in terms of enrollment rates; pupil/teacher ratios, number
of teaching, administrative and support personnel, internal and
external efficiency, unit costs, budgetary allocations, and
patterns of resource use; and identifying measures for cost-
efficiency and savings.
(b) Developing a school locat4o,n planning system by extending
coverage to urban areas and post-primary levels, and by improving
the capacity of the School Mapping Unit to plan the number, type
and geographic distribution of schools at each level vithin the



- 64 -
ANNEX 3-3
Page 2 of 3
framework of sectoral growth targets; and establishing criteria
for physical expansion.
(c) Developing sectoral plans to identify optimum enrollments for
each level of education; regularizing flows into secondary
schools resulting from the expansion of primary schooling; and
identifying corresponding resource requirements.
(d) Developing a cost-control system and financing mechanisms by
establishing an ongoing expenditure review procesa for each
level; introducing cost-efficiency measures and monitoring their
implementation; and identifying areas and amounts of budgetary
reallocations.
5.        In addition, DERP would develop a quantitative data base through
the collection and analysis of sector-wide statistics and publish them
annually. Statistical data would include: enrollment, promotion, repe-
tition and dropout as well as pass rates at the end of each cycle by grade,
sex and milieu (urban or rural); age pyramid by grade and sex; annual
changes in students' cohorts (to measure the effect of quality inputs);
available physical facilities by district; pupil/teacher ratio by grade:
primary schools with double-shift and multigrade classes; number of
teachers, administrators and support staff; and disaggregated budgetary
allocations and expenditures. The first annual educational statistices
would be published for the 1987/88 school year by November 1988.
6.        To improve the quality of field input into the planning process,
DERP would train regional and departmental staff in educational planning,
statistics, and achool mapping.
7.        The specific content and target dates of the studies to be under-
taken by DERP in implementing the sectoral adjustment program are set out in
Annex 3-2.
8.        Means.  The IDA credit would finance office furniture and equip-
ment, including two vehicles; 69 manmonths of specialist services (of which
9 months local) in education economics, planning, school mapping,
statistics, budgetary and financial analysis, and student loan systems; 52
manmonths of fellowships in educational planning, cost and financing, and
statistics; and 7 manmonths of local training in statistics, planning,
school mapping, and computer use. In addition, as part of the study on
cost recovery measures, the credit would finance a small-scale
experimentation with a student loan system.

PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SITE SELECTION CRITERIA AND DESCRIPTION OF CONSTRUCTION
TECHNOLOGY AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL BUILDING
Site Selectïon Criteria
1.        Rehabilitation of 100 and construction of 400 classrooms would be
implemented in three regions: Diourbel, Louga and Fatick. The selection
of these regions has been based on: (a) geogr.iphic congruity with respect
to cost-efficiency and facilitating supervision; (b) low enrollment ratios;
and (c) proven demand for primary schooling. The minimum number of class-
rooms to be constructed per site would be two. The attached Table 1
provides the enrollment ratios, physical statue of achool facilities, and
number of sites identified for extension and new construction in each of
the three regions. Table 2 shows the general criteria applied in identi-
fying the sites. Of the 400 classrooms to be constructed, 75% would be
located in rural areas. About 294 of the 400 classrooms to be constructed
vould be three-classroom clusters and the remaining 106 would be two-
classroom clusters.
Construction Program
2.        The program would be implemented in three separate phases, as
followis:
(a)  Phase I (Construction of 50 experimental classrooms).  To develop
the technical and managerial basis for construction of classrooms
on a larger scale, the experimental phase would include:
(i) a survey of existing construction designs and methods in
local communities;
(ii) an evaluation of typical designs used during the last
decade;
(iii) preparation of standardized designs and construction methods
based on (ii) above;
(iv) preparation of a construction guide and all standard bid
documents providing the necessary details;
(v)  site surveys and soil testing, where necessary;
(vi) training of site supervisors, craftsmen and masons, plus the
provision of appropriate equipment;
(vii) mobilization of community resources (estimated at 27% of the
investment cost); and

Page 2 of 8
(viii) development of DCES capacity to plan and manage decentra-
lized construction.
(b) Phases II and III (construction of 175 clasarooms during each
phase). Prior to proceding with the next phase, DCES would
evaluate the experience of the previous phase in terms of:
(1) design suitability for replication; (ii) cost; (iii) time-
liness of completion; (iv) level of community input; and
(v) implementation problems. Evaluation of results would be
reviewed jointly with IDA, and appropriate modifications would be
made.
3.        Classrooms would be constructed with stabilized earth brick and
fired brick, since clay is readily available at all project sites.
Construction Technology
4.        T e Government decided during the Third Education Project
(Cr. 908-SE, to use the intermediate technology of fired brick and/or
ram-pressed cement-earth brick construction as an alternative to conven-
tional construction methods in order to: (a) reduce high unit costs
associated with new construction and with repair and maintenance of
existing schools; (b) minimize difficulties in transport of materials to
remote areas; (c) expand community-implemented construction programs;
(d) reduce capital input by using labor-intensive construction methods (64%
of total cost) to cushion against cost increases in imported materials;
(e) provide facilities that are relatively more heat resistant; and
(f) develop construction technology and services at the regional level to
reduce dependence on Dakar and on expatriate technical assistance.
5.        Within these objectives, 86 classrooms using pressed and fired
brick and an arch/vault design vere constructed in the Kolda Region.
Evaluation
6.        The particular technology described above offers several economic
and social advantages:
(a) Savings in costs and foreign exchange. The use of brick would
reduce costs significantly, given that it can be manufactured
locally for about USé6 versus purchase of cement block for USi58
(see table on page 7). Since the bulk of the construction
materials is based on selected clay/laterîte soils as close to
the building site as possible, transport coset and delays due to
road conditions are significantly reduced. The estimated foreign
exchange component of this technology (about 28%) compares with
52% for alternative construction forme. Construction base costs
of US$106/m2 are estimated at about 60% of comparable alter-
natives, and in remote areas this cost advantage is expected to
be even greater.
(b) Development of construction skills. Based on previous experi-
ence, teaus of brick-imakers and masons attain acceptable levels
of construction skills and productivity vithin a two-week period

under the supervision of a qualified foreman. An important bene-
fit of the construction program would be income generation for
the communities and development of local artisans' construction
skills to enable them to eventually become omall-scale rural
contractors. In al., a total of 74 "construction teams" con-
sisting of 522 masons, 348 brick-makers, and 5,220 laborers vould
be employed at construction sites and given on-the-job training.
Tt is expected that the project would provide the basis for
development of construction teams that vould be able to meet the
communities' construction needs.
(c) Employment and income generation. Overall, the construction
program is expected to provide about 12,880 manmonths of employ-
ment to communities where the program vould be implemented. At
the utilization rate per classroom site of 10 local laborers, of
which five would be paid vith project funds and five contributed
gratis by the community, and the prevailing vage rate of CFAF
1,400/day (US$3.9), the income generated for the community from
wage receipts alone would be about CFAP 670,000 (US$1,860) per
classroom constructed.
(d) Adaptability of buildings to the local climate. The high thermal
mass of construction tempers the high daytime temperatures and
of fers students the possibility of relative interior comfort
vithout resort to mecharical ventilation or cooling.
Nethodology for Organîzing Community-Implemented Construction
Step 1: Information (1 day)
7.        The villages targeted for s<hool construction vould be visited
between February and June during project implementatior by a team composed
of the regional and departmental inspectors, the technical inspector, and a
Governument representative. l/ This team would meet with the village chief,
his adviser, and the village notables to explain the purpose of the visit,
provide an overview of the proposed activity and the responsibilities of
all parties involved, and answer immediate questions. A simiple brochure
outlining the project vould be left with the village.
Step 2: Village Deliberation (2 weeks)
8.        The village chief could call an assembly of the population,
including the parents' association if there is one, to elicit ideas and
questions from the community and to list the priorities as seen by the
villagers. For recording purposes, the village would be encouraged to
involve a notable who is literate.
l/  District administrator/Sous-prefet/chef d'arrondissement.



- 74 -                       ANNEX 3-7
Page 4 of 8
Step 3: Second Visit (1 day)
9.        Approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit, the same
group would pay a second visit to the village for more in-depth discussions
vith the villagers, explaining technical details, showing standardized
design samples, the long-term implications of the program, the financial
participation expected, and the mutual responsibilities of all parties
concerned. Village concerns and questions would be addressed first. If
the village continues to manifest interest in a village school, the idea of
a contract would be introduced.
Step 4: Village Commitment
10.       If the village has decided to participate in the program, it will
have chosen an individual, a group of individuals or a committee to repre-
sent the village in negotiations with the regional and project authorities.
The village would also have devised a means of raising the funds required
(not less than 27% of total cost) before construction can commence. The
technical inspector or the technician locally assigned to the regional
program would be responsible to register: (a) the names of the village
representatives; (b) the amount of village contribution collected and
evaluated on the basis of collected funds, laborers and materials; (c) the
names and capacity of eventual skills/masons; (d) the number of laborers
available; (e) the description of the proposed site including water avail-
ability; and (f) the type and quantity of clay/laterite/sand/gravel avail-
able in a close radius. A contract stipulating conditions and responsi-
bilities of each party would be concluded between the designated repre-
sentative of the project, the Government representative, and the village.
Step 5
il.       Only after all preliminary steps have been completed would the
contractor and his equipment/materials and construction materials arrive at
the village. It would require four to six months to complete construction
of a three-classroom school.

PRINARY EDUCATION DEVELOPNENT PROJECT
EXPERIMENTATION WITH DOUBLE-SHIFT AND MULTIGRADE SYSTENS
Background
1.        The decline in the achievement rates in the primary completion
exam from 59% in 1966 to 42% in 1983 and the high repetition rate ln
Grade 6 (34%) are partly attributable to overcrowded classes. In 1983/84,
in the urban areas 27% of the classrooms (1,666) had between 70 and 120
students per classroom. To alleviate this problem, MEN has been experi-
menting since 1982 with a double-shift system based on tvo cohorts, tvo
teachers and one classroom of about 60 students each.  Some subjects are
taught inside the classroom and others outside in the courtyard; since the
latter method proved non-effective, iuainly because of inclement veather,
many classes svitched to half-days. Evaluation of the experimentation vith
this form of double-shift system in 61 classrooms (mostly primary Grades 1
and 2) indicated that preparation for introducing it vas inadequate, for
the following reasons:
(a) Parents vere not informed and sensitized to the nev system; they
reacted negatively since it disrupted their regular achedules;
(b)  Choice of the classrooms vas left to the primary education
iuspectors vithout any precise criteria for selection; and
(c) Teachers involved vere not provided vith training and materials
for double-shift teaching, and they received little or no super-
vision aftervards in the majority of the schools.
Nevertheless, the results of student performance in the classrooms experi-
menting vith double-shift system, compared to the results in regular class-
rooms, vas positive; student scores in tested areas (reading, writing,
math) vere generally higher. Hence, it can be concluded that reduction of
the teaching time did not have adverse consequences on student learning
levels, perhaps due in part to the lover student/teacher ratio.
2.        In rural areas, the problem is reversed.  Student/teacher ratios
are unacceptably lov, leading to low enrollment rates, and high unit costs
due to the inefficient use of teachers and physical facilities. In
1983-84, 8% (350) of rural classrooms had less than 20 students each.
Also, most of the rural schools are incomplete: in 1983/84, out of 1,993
rural schools, 71% vere incomplete (476 vith one grade, 327 vith tvo
grades, and 366 with three grades). Consequently, lutake into Grade 1 is
doue on an irregular basis, once every tvo or three years. To address this
problem, ln 1982 NEN began experimenting with a multigrade system of two
grades, one teacher and one classroom. As in the case of the double-shift
system, experimentation with multigrade suffered from inadequate prepa-



- 82 -                    ANNEX 3-9
Page 2 of 4
ration in that the teachers, lacking information, training and materials,
were unable to organize their teaching.
Objectives
3.        The primary objective is to support Government efforts to imple-
ment the multigrade system in appropriate rural classrooms and the double-
shift system in Grades 1-4 in overcrowded urban classrooms on a nationvide
basis, in order to:
(a) increase access to education, and in the rural areas enable
regular intake into Grade 1;
(b) facilitate the teaching and learning process by eliminating over-
crowded classes; and
(c) improve the efficiency of teacher and classroom utilization,
thereby reducing unit costs.
Strategy
4.        The program would be implemented in two phases:  (a) experi-
mentation over a two-year period (1987/88-1988/89); and (b) large-scale
implementation in appropriate classes starting in the 1989-90 school year.
5.        Phase I.  INEADE would have the lead responsibility for imple-
menting Phase I activities.  It would set up a team of five persons,
composed of two representatives from the Teacher Training Division of
INEADE, one from DERP, a senior instructor from a teacher training college,
and one departmental inspector. Depending on the nature of the activity,
the team would be assisted by local or foreign specialists in curriculum
development and timetabling, teacher training, experimental pedagogy,
evaluation and measurement (all from INEADE), and an economist (DERP).
Phase I activities would consist of the following:
(a) Development of methodology and experimentation criteria. The
team would examine the curricula and the extension of the school
year to compensate for the reduced weekly hours under the double-
shift system; identify the optimum class sizes for both the
double-shift and multigrade systems; and select the experimental
classrooms (about 25 rural and 75 urban) from a stratified
simple. (The statistics and school mapping services of DERP
would help identify these classrooms.)
(b)  Development of evaluation criteria.  The team would develop a
monitoring and evaluation system to include criteria for
assessing teacher performance, student achievement, and other
indicators such as student/teacher contact hours, weekly teacher
preparation time, use of textbooks and teaching aids, and
pedagogical support from inspectors. For comparison purposes, a
control group would also be selected. The team would produce an
annual evaluation report and present recommendations. These
reports would be reviewed with IDA and necessary modifications
would be made in the program for the following school year.



- 83 -                     ANNEX 3-9
Page 3 of 4
(c)  Sensitizing program.  The team would continue with the "awareness
campaign" already started to sensitize parents and teachers to
the need for implementing these systems.
(d) Revision of curriculum and development of appropriate pedagogical
methods. With input from the curriculum development section of
INEADE, the team would adapt the curriculum and prepare a set of
modified timetables that can be used in urban and rural schools
participating in double-shift or multigrade experimentation. In
addition, it would prepare teacher guides which provide practical
techniques to facilitate the teaching process.
(e) Teacher training. As in the case of the experimental classrooms,
teachers would be selected from a stratified sample. They would
undergo a seven-day initial training prior to the start of
experimentation and a five-day follow-up training during the
second year of experimentation.
'f) Review of experimentation results. The team would produce its
final report on the experimentation by April 1989. The report
would recommend the criteria fcr selection of multigrade and
double-shift classes and the appropriate double-shift models.
The report would be reviewed jointly with IDA and the program for
nationwide implementation prepared.
6.        Phase II.
(a) Teacher training. During 1989, 100 teachers and headmasters
would be trained in the multigrade and double-shift teaching
methods. The same program would be incorporated into the pre-
service training curriculum at the teacher training colleges.
(b) Implementation of multigrade and double-shift systems in
appropriate schools nationwide. Starting in the 1989/90 school
year, multigrade and double-shift systems would be implemented
nationwide in classrooms meeting the selection criteria.
Neans
7.        The IDA credit would finance a total of 100 manmonths of training
for 200 teachers and headmasters during Phases I and II through the funding
of transportation and subsistence expenses of the participants and the cost
of preparing the training sessions, including the services of specialists
and documentation. The attached table provides details on the training
program.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF INSPECTORATES IN EDUCATION
ADMINISTRATION AND PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT
Background
1.        At the national level, the management and control of primary
education are assured by the Primary Education Directorate ("Direction
Enseignement Elementaire" - DEE). Operational responsibility is delegated
to 10 regional inspectorates, which work closely with the regional
governments. At the local level, there are a total of 41 departmental
lnspectorates, which are responsible for administration and management of
the primary school network, control and supervision of all pedagogical
aspects, and community relations as concerns pre-primary and primary
education.
2.        The 1972 Administrative Reform is based on the principle of
decentralization to bring government closer to the people. Within the
framework of this principle, the Ministry of National Education has decided
to decentralize education administration to the regional and departmental
inspectorate levels. To this end, personnel and budgetary management has
been decentralized at the level of the regional inspectorates. All
teachers are assigned to and covered under the regional inspectorate
budget. The decentralization, however, is incomplete in the sense that the
organiza.ional structure and vertical and horizontal relationships between
central, regional and departmental levels have not been clearly
articulated. More specifically, the departmental inspectorates have
neither adequate budgetary resources nor the authority to manage those they
receive. Further, their decision-making authority is limited, including
matters of personnel assignments and absences, which are best handled at
the local level but which they are required to refer to higher levels; this
not only causes lengthy delays in decision-making but also prevents the
inspectorates from utilizing resources more efficiently.
3.        Regarding pedagogical aspects, overloading of the departmental
inspectorates with administrative and community relations tasks, plus the
large number of untrained support staff, severely curtails the time
available for pedagogical supervision and control. Means of transportation
for making school supervision visits are very limited, with a reported
total of only 28 vehicles, in varying states of repair, for the 41
departmental lnspectorates. A lack of reproduction and other documentation
facilities hampers their capacity for providing guidance and retraining for
the teaching staff under their control. Further, the lack of in-service
training for the inspectors themselves makes it difficult for them to
fulfill their pedagogical support responsibilities adequately, particularly
with respect to innovative teaching methods.



ANNEX 3-10
- 86 -                       Page 2 of 7
Strategy
4.        In light of these problems, the Government has commissioned a
study, financed under the Third Education Project (Cr. 908-SE), to redefine
the roles and responsibilities of the regional and departmental inspector-
ates. This study is expected to clarify the relationshîps between the
central, regional and departmental levels and to recommend indicators of
performance and appropriate personnel coefficients (currently, on average,
for each inspectorate 15 prlmary school teachers are provided as adminis-
trative staff). The performance indicators would include the frequency of
school supervision, clear separation of administrative, personnel manage-
ment and pedagogical supervisory tasks. An examination of the level at
which resources are managed, the level at which personnel management
decisions and sanctions may be taken, and the internal organization of
regional and departmental inspectorates would also be undertaken.
5.        Following an agreement between the Government and IDA on the
recommendations of the study to be adopted, the decentralization would
undergo experimentation in the three project regions of Louga, Diourbel and
Fatick between August 1988 and June 1990, and the findings of an ongoing
monitoring and evaluation would be integrated into the training program to
be offered to all inspectorates. New administrative texts and organigrams
vould be issued and decentralization implemented nationwide as of August
1990.
I4eans
6.        To assist in making these changes operational, the project would
finance: supplementary resources for transportation (27 heavy-duty
vehicles and, for the experimentation, 20 motorbikes for assistant depart-
mental inspectors); rehabilitation of the 12 inspectorates in the project
regions; basic office furniture; and equipment for the production and
duplication of materials needed by the inspectors in their pedagogical
support functïons. In addition, to assist the Government in elaborating
the necessary documentation and in preparing the in-service workshops and
seminars, the project would finance 17 manmonths of specialist services (of
which 10 manmonths would be local specialists) in education administration,
personnel management, and organization and planning; and 50 manmonths of
fellowships in school administration. Also, the cost of 367 manmonths of
local training for regional and departmental inspectors, assistant
inspectors, and the administrative staff would be covered under the
project. The following table provides details on the training program for
the experimental and other inspectorate staff.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT OF TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING CAPACITY
1:kground
1.        The objective of this component is to increase the quantity of
textbooks in primary schools, improve their relevance and quality, and
reduce their cost. Each text would follow the following sequence of
development: in year one, editing/origination; printing and distribution
in year two; use in achools as of year three; and evaluation as of year
four.
2.        In 1983 the Government instituted a free textbook loan system
vhereby each year, on a progressive basis, two or three regions are
provided with textbooks. The first cycle of the system is expected to be
completed in 1988 when the Cap Vert Region receives its allotment.  The
policy also provides for "topping up" of textbook stocks in each region
during the years following the initial supply. Students use the textbooks
on a loan basis during the year and return them to achool at year's end.
Those who fail to do so reimburse the cost of the textbooks.
3.        Currently, MEN's Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and
Planning is responsible for textbook procurement and distribution. It uses
the services of "Nouvelles Editions Africaines" to order the textbooks and
transport them to departmental inspectorates. The procurement and distri-
bution functions are operating adequately; what is lacking is the capacity
to produce original material or adapt textbooks that are both relevant to
teaching/learning needs and inexpensive. To this end, the project would
assist the Government to establish a Textbook Publishing Unit at INEADE
whose responsibilities would be to manage the development of appropriate
textbooks through directing the publishing process, guiding authors,
editing their manuscripts, and making arrangements for printing the text-
books. In addition, the Government plans to develop a cost-recovery system
by charging an average fee of CFAF 1,000 (about US$2.80) per student per
year, per set of books. The project would assist the Government to analyze
the equity implications and the potential enrollment effects in the low-
income areas of the proposed fee system.
Strategy
4.        Original writing or adaptation of exlsting textbooke.  The Text-
book Unit vould assess the adaption possibilities of books that are
"largely international" in content (e.g. math and science) and negotiate
with the copyright holders. For French textbooks, although adaptation is a
possibility, because of cultural demanda in language and content, writing
new textbooks la likely to be a better approach. For the national language
textbooks as well as all of the teacher guides, the writing of new
materials is recommended. Local authors, following their training, would
do the original vriting or adaptation and would be paid a flat fee for



- 93 -                         ANNEX 3-11
Page 2 of 9
their work. They would assign the copyrights to MEN. Relevant units of
INEADE would provide the basic data, primary research and results from
which the authors would develop the manuscripts. INEADE's "Division des
Actions Scolaires" (Division of Educational Matters), as well as inspectors
and teachers at teacher training colleges, would assess draft manuscripts
for content, pedagogic suitability and conformity to curriculum.
5.        Co-publishing.  The project would enter into co-publishing
arrangements to the extent possible to ensure speed, accuracy, cost
efficiency, and on-the-job training for the Textbook Publishing Unit staff.
For those titles %here adaptation of an existing book is the most efficient
and cost-effective method, the publishing partner could be the copyright
holder. For most textbooks which are original works, the Textbook Pub-
lishing Unit would advertise for a publishing partner or invite a limited
number of bids. !or teacher guides, the Textbook Publishing Unit would
undertake the publication of a limited number of titles by itselt and
duplicate them at INEADE facilities.
e.        Printing.  Printing would be performed using the cheapest source
on the international market. For printing of books and booklets of up to
10,000 copies, bids would be invited through local competitive bidding.
For very shurt print runs, such as teacher guides for national languages,
for up to 2,000 copies, the reprographic unit at INEADE would be used.
7.        Evaluation.  INEADE's "Division des Recherches Psychologiques at
Docimologiques" (Psychological Research and Instructional Materials
Division) would conduct controlled texting of manuscripts or textbooks in
the classroom.
8.        Revolving Fund.  This fund would have two sources of revenue:
author royalties, and fees from the contributory textbook loan scheme.
Author royalties from sales to the private sector would be assigned to MEN
and deposited in the fund. With regard to the contributory textbook loan
scheme, the details have not yet been finalized. It is estimated that an
average of CFAF 1,000 (about USS2.80 would be charged per one set of books
per year starting in 1987. It is expected that by 1990, the year after
termination of the Government's free textbook loan policy, the revolving
fund would be sufficiently large to maintain the current student/textbook
ratio and finance teacher books and guides. Increased revenues expected
beyond 1990 would also help offset shortfalls in fee collection, the cost
of the collection and administration, and more importantly, increased text-
book prices.
9.        Textbook storage.  To ensure against losses, two storage cabinets
would be provided to those schools which do not have storage facilities.
The assistant departmental inspectors would verify stock levels periodic-
ally, including controlling the number of damaged books.
10.       Training.  To assist the Textbook Unit Director and Editor to
develop their publishing and printing procurement capacity, a publishing
specialist and a production controller would be recruited for a period of
12 and 8 months, reepectively. In addition, both the Project Director and
Editor would each receive six months of fellowship training abroad to study
publishing. Further training would also be likely under co-publishing



- 94 -                           ANNEX 3-11
Page 3 of 9
arrangements. To ensure that authors are informed of the manuscript
specifications and royalties, as vell as pedagogical aspects, the Textbook
Unit and INEADE representatives w>uld conduct workshops for the authors.
Finally, when the new textbooks are distributed to departmental inspec-
torates, a one-day training program would be offered to assistant
inspectors on the content of the textbooks and ways to use them effici-
ently. Assistant inspectors would, in turn, train the teachers vithin
their area of jurisdiction on the use of textbooks.
11.       Means.  In addition to the items listed above, project funds
would finance minor renovation of office space; furniture; equipment,
including one vehicle; publishing and printing coste of textbooks and
teacher guides; distribution of the new books developed, and incremental
operating costs related to the equipment financed.
12.       The attached tables provide details on comparative costs of
current textbook purchases and those to be developed under the project, the
production schedule, coste and quantity of books to be developed, and
comparison of income and expenditures under the current free loan system
and proposed rental fee system.

Note: The comparison is not based on identical production specifications.
Textbooks to be developed under the project would be of the same or
improved pedagogical quality but would be more basic in terms of
production specifications as listed on page 7 of this Annex.

Tab'.e 4 - Book Costs and Amount of Cost Recovery Through the
Fee System between 1987 and 1990 -- A Hypothesis
The following table shows the hypothetical balance sheet during a
transition or start-up period. It assumes an average fee of CFAF 1000 per
student per set of books per year, starting in 1987 for those regions which
vill have already benefitted from the free book loan policy and the
progressive application of the fee system to the o'her regions.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
BASIS OF COST ESTIMATES
1.        Construction costs vere estimated on the basis of (a) schedules
of accommodation; (b) detailed architectural drawings, specifications and
quantities developed for the construction of 86 prototype claserooms;
(c) construction contracts (1984-86) for similar facilities; and
(d) published official prices. The net surface per student place (1m2) is
based on experience in 2xisting similar facilities and are comparable to
the median unit areas in the last low-cost IDA-assisted institutions. Area
and capital costs per specialist/ student place and schedule of
accommodation are provided on pages 3 and 4-6 of this Annex, respectively.
The estimated base costs, in 1985 prices, per square meter of gross
construction area, which average US$555 equivalent for the National
Pedagogical Institute and US$115 for the classrooms, are reasonable for the
utilitarian standards of construction allowed for.
2.        Furniture and equipment costs were derived from preliminary lists
prepared for this project and from costs obtained in recent equipment con-
tracts for similar items and furniture prototypes developed during project
preparation. These were reviewed during appraisal and found to be appro-
priate in scope and cost, even allowing a substantial savings. Furniture
and equipment lists and costs are provided on pages 9-11 of this Annex.
3.        Feea for design and supervision of the Pedagogical Institute (9%
of estimated construction costs) vere estimated on the basis of consultant
contracts and typical supervision fees of Senegalese consulting architects
and engineers.
4.        Foreign exchange component.  The foreign exchange component of
the project is US$12.2 million (62%) of estimated total project cost, or
US$9.6 million (64%) of the estimated base cost. The following represents
the estimated foreign exchange percentages of total base cost for
individual categories:
(a)  Civil works 1/                                                 34%
Building Materials                                            (62%)
Office building and classroom contracts                       (50%)
Unskilled labor services                                       (0%)
(b)  Furniture                                                      49%
Imported                                                    (89%)
Locally produced                                            (38%)

5.        For civil works and furniture, the percentages are based on the
composition of local and foreign cost for materiale, labor, overhead, and
transport. For equipment, the percentage is derived on the basis of con-
tracta awarded under the previous IDA credit (for some civil works this
source is aleo used). It is estimated that 100% of the civil worke con-
tracts vould be awarded to local firms, all equipment/vehicles would be
directly imported, and about 75% of the furniture would be manufactured
locally.
Disbursements
(a)  Civil works:  80% of total expenditures for office buildings; 70%
of total expenditures for claseroons (averaged from 100% for
building materials, 80% for contractors and 50% for unskilled
labor services);
(b) Furniture and eguipMent: Office furniture: 100% of the foreign
cost of directly imported items and 100% of locally manufactured
goode procured through LCB; Tables/benches for claserooms: 80%
of costs of locally manufactured goods procured through LCB;
(c)  Specialist services, fellowships and local training:  100%; and
(d) Operating coste: 80%.
Special Account
6.        Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be
signed by the Project Director and forvarded to IDA through the Directorate
of Debte and Investuents, Ministry of Finance. All disbursements would be
fully documented except those against contracts valued at US$20,000 equiva-
lent or less; disbursemente against these contracta would be made on the
basis of statements of expenditure. The documentation for disbursements
made against statements of expenditure would be attached to the related
withdrawal application and would remain on file in the Project Unit and

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES
A.   Senegalese Public Procurement Rules and Procedures
1.        The Senegalese public procurement rules and procedures are
generally acceptable to IDA. Wherever ICB procedures have been specifled
ln the credit documents, IDA's guidelines take priority over local rules.
In the case of LCB, the Senegalese procurement code provides for a vell-
structured and complete system. In the section below, some of the LCB
procedures, such as selection of the appropriate procurement procedure ln
borderline cases (i.e., use of "adJudication" or "appel d'of_res") and
speciflc criteria for granting preferences for locally produced goods and
registered contractors (artisans), are discussed.
2.        Adjudication is a competitive procedure which uses simple tech-
nical evaluation method to select a supplier or a contractor. It is
applicable to procurements which are easily quantifiable and have clearly
specified technical characteristics. There are three types of
adjudications:
(a) Unrestricted: Places no restrictions on bidders and has public
bid openings. Offers may vary only in price, and the lowest
bîdder is selected.
(b) Restrlcted: Limits bldding to a list of qualified contractors or
suppliers established by a special committee (prequalification).
Offers may vary in price only and the lowest bidder is selected.
(c)  Rating based:  Allows consideration of both price and technical
merit, using quality ratings expressed as coefficients. A sum-
mation of the coefficients leads to an automatic selection of the
most advantageous offer.
In all cases, the evaluating and selecting body is the "Office of Adjudi-
cation" consistlng of at least three nominated members, one of whom must be
the financial controller.
3.        "Appel d'offres" is the most elaborate competitive procedure for
selecting contractors or suppliers on the basis of lowest evaluated bid.
Bld opening is usually closed to the general public; for projects flnanced
by IDA, however, in accordance wvth IDA's procurement guidelines, the bid-
ders or their representatives are invited as observers. "Appel d'offres"
may be either open or restricted. In the first case, "appel d'offres dit
restreint," bid invitations are issued to a selected group of candidates
(after prequalification). The second case, known as "appel d'offres dit
ouvert," is a vide-open call to the public to submit bids. In both cases,



- 135 -                    ANNEX 3-19
Page 2 of 6
open and restricted, the bidders must prove their technical and financial
qualifications for carrying out the contract.
4.        Depending on the size of the contract, either a seven-member
National Tender Board (for contracts over CFAF 20.0 million, or about
US$55,555) or a six-member Regional Tender Board (for contracts below
CFAF 20 million where the procurer is in that region) opens and evaluates
the submitted bids. The composition of the Tender Boards has been
specified by Decret No. 82-620, eated September 7, 1982.
5.        In addition, the procurement legislation allows negotiated con-
tracts in the following cases (which can be accepced by IDA, where appro-
priate, for contracts below CFAF 8.0 million or about US$22,222):
- if only one supplier carries the needed item;
-  if, following two calls for bids, no offer is received; and
- defense-related procurement.
6.        All draft contracte, as vell as contract amendments (extension,
change in quantities, etc.) must be submitted to an advisory and control-
ling body called "Commission Nationale des Contrats de l'Administration
(CNCA)" or, in the cases of contracts awarded by the Regional Tender Board,
to a "Commission Regionale des Contrats de l'Administration." As part of
its control function, CNCA muet give its opinion on all proposed contracts
involving an expenditure of CFAF 20 million or more.
7.        Margin of Preference to Registered Craftsmen:  According to
Article 110 of Decret 82-690, for civil works contracts to be awarded under
the LCB, a preference (7.5%) may be given to craftsmen registered as indi-
viduals or as joint ventures with the Chamber of Artisans.
B.   Procurement Procedures Under the Project Civil Works
S.        Civil works contracts for remodeling of administrative buildings
together valued at about US$257,000 equivalent, which are not likely to
attract overseas foreign firms, would be procured under LCB procedures
acceptable to IDA. Civil works contracts for the rehabilitation of 100
classrooms, for small repairs of classrooms, for textbook storage facil-
ities, and for the construction/rehabilitation of the INEADE building,
together valued at US$1.6 million equivalent, would be procured under
procedures acceptable to AfDB.
9.        Civil works for the construction of 400 rural primary classrooms,
scattered in remote areas, totalling about US$4.0 million equivalent which
are unsuitable for conventional and international competitive bidding,
would be carried out under separate contracts for (a) skilled worker
services (including masons, brickmakers, on-the-job training and super-
vision, site preparation and materials); (b) construction materials; and
(c) unskilled labor services. These contracts would be procured in
accordance with IDA's guidelines as follows:
(a) All purchases of construction materials that can be grouped into
packages valued at or more than US$100,000 equivalent, totalling

Page 3 of 6
about US$800,000 equivalent would be procured through ICB and in
accordance with IDA's guidelines;
(b) Contracte valued at between US$20,000 and US$100,000 equivalent,
totalling about US$1.0 million would be procured through LCB
procedures acceptable to IDA; and
(c) Items that cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least
US$20,000 equivalent, provided the aggregate amount of such
procurement shall not exceed US$2.3 million equivalent, would be
procured through local shopping or direct contracting on the
basis of quotatiox.s from at least three reliable suppliers.
Furniture
10.       Furniture, valued at US$1.1 million equivalent, would be procured
through LCB according to procedures acceptable to IDA. Restricted "adjudi-
cation" would be suitable, which allows restrictive bidding to a list of
qualified suppliers established after a prequalification.
il.       Furniture for INEADE, rehabilitation of 100 classrooms and text-
book components, valued at US$630,000 equivalent, would be procured through
procedures acceptable to AfDB.
Eguipment
12.       Equipment, including vehicles, valued at about US$800,000 would
be procured through ICB. All goods would be grouped, wherever possible,
into bid packages of US$100,000 equivalent or more.
13.       Items that cannot be grouped into bid packages of US$100,000
equivalent but valued at between US$20,000 and US$100,000 equivalent,
totalling about US$100,000 equivalent, would be procured through LCB
procedures acceptable to IDA. Items that cannot be grouped into bid
packages of at least US$20,000 equivalent provided the aggregate amount of
such procurement shall not exceed US$90,000 equivalent, would be procured
through local shopping or direct contracting on the basis of quotations
from at least three reliable suppliers.
14.       Equipment for INEADE, rehabilitation of 100 classrooms, preven-
tive maintenance and textbook components valued at US$390,000 equivalent,
would be procured through procedures acceptable to AfDB.
Textbooks
15.       Printing of textbooks, valued at about US$970,000 equivalent,
would be procured through procedures acceptable to AfDB. The purchase of
textbooks and of adaptation rights would be procured after contract negoti-
ations with the publishers whose titles have been found suitable.

Specialist Services and Fellowshîps/Local Training
16.       Specialist services, including audit services, valued at US$4.0
million equivalent, would be contracted in accordance with IDA's guidelines
and on the basis of invitation for proposals from three to six qualified
and experienced consultant firms and on an exceptional basis, from indi-
vidual specialists. Fellowships, valued at US$920,000 equivalent, would be
contracted in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Local training represents
US$670,000 and consists of indemnities. Services of trainers are covered
under specialist services.
17.       Specialist services for the rehabilitation of 100 classrooms,
preventive maintenance and textbook components, valued at US$380,000
equivalent, would be procured through procedures acceptable to AfDB.
Consumables
18.       Consumables (office supply, spare parts, gasoline, other consum-
ables), would be procured through LCB according to procedures acceptable to
IDA. All goods or services would be grouped, wherever possible, into bid
packages of at least IUS$20,000 equivalent, totalling about US$1.5 million
equivalent.
19.       Items which cannot be grouped in bid packages of at least
US$20,000 equivalent would be procured through comparative shopping and
direct contracting on the basis of at least three quotations, according to
procedures acceptable to IDA, provided the aggregate amount of such
procurement shall not exceed US$1.1 million equivalent. Consumables,
valued at US$500,000, for AfDB-financed components would be procured under
procedures acceptable to AfDB.
Contract Review
Prior Review
20.       For all contracts or bid packages of at least US$100,000 equiva-
lent, each of the following stages in the procurement process would be
subject to IDA's prior review and commented upon by IDA staff before they
are implemented and finalized:
- Advertisement
- Prequalification (if called for)
- Bidding documents and addenda
- Bid evaluation and proposal for award of contract
- Contract documents
- Subsequent major modifications of the contract
Initial Review
21.       Fo'` ail contracts valued at up to US$100,000 equivalent, an
initial review, followed by a post review or a random review depending on
size of contract, by IDA staff would be required for standard documents
which are common to a number of procurement operations, for example:



- 138 -                    ANNEX 3-19
Page 5 of 6
-  the general format of advertisements and their circulation;
- the prequalification questionnaire and method of evaluation;
- standard registers or Drequalified contractors; and
- standard bidding documents, including instruction to bidders,
general conditions of contract, and in some instances technical
specifications.
Post Review
22. -    For all contracts or bid packages estimated at between US$20,000
and US$100,000 equivalent, two copies of the final contracts, together with
the bidding documents, bid evaluation and award decision, would be fur-
nished to IDA for post review before the first application for withdrawal
of credit funds against these contracts.
Random Review
23.       All contracts valued at under US$20,000 equivalent would be sub-
ject to random review by IDA during supervision missions. Contracts would
not be submitted to IDA, but held by the Project Unit for such random
review and for auditing.
Eligibility for Domestic Preference
24.       The preference allowed by IDA for local manufacturers in the
award of contracts under IOB does not apply to LCB even in cases where
foreign firms, including those from neighboring countries, are permitted to
bid.
25.       For goods procured under ICB, a margin of preference of up to 15%
vould be granted to bids offering goods which are manufactured to a
substantial extent in Senegal, in accordance with and subject to the
following provisions:
(a) Bidders are required to state in their bids the c.i.f. (port of
entry) price of imported goods and the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured goods.
(b) Except to the extent hereinafter provided, bids will be compared
on the basis of their ex-factory or c.i.f. price, excluding any
customs duties and other import taxes on goods to be imported and
any sales and similar taxes on locally manufactured goods.
(c) After evaluation, responsive bids vill be classified into one of
the following groups:
Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Senegal, if the
bidder shall have established that the manufacturlig cost of such
goods includes a value added in Senegal equal co at least 20% of

to determine the lowest evaluated  id in each group.  The lowest
evaluated bids of each group will  nen be compared wîth each
other and if, as a result of thit comparison, an evaluated bid
from Group A or Group B is the lowest, it will be selected for
the purpose of award.
(e) If the lowest evaluated bid in the comparison under paragraph
(d) above is a bid from Group C, all Group C bids will be further
compared wîth the lowest bid from Group A, as determined under
paragraph (d) above, For the purpose of this comparison only,
each Group C bld will be compared on the basis of the sum of its
c.i.f. price adjusted in accordance with the provisions of para-
graph (b) above, and an amount equal to the smaller of (i) the
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-
exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of goods
offered in such Group C.bid; or (iî) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price
of such goods. If the Group A evaluated bid in such further
comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the purpose of
award; if not, the lowest evaluated bid from Group C, as deter-
mined under paragraph (d) above, shall be selected.
