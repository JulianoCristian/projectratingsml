The\n            project conforms to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)\n            objectives, in support of the government's long-term\n            strategy for the rehabilitation, and sustainable development\n            of irrigated agriculture, and, in the construction of basic\n            rural infrastructures in the Senegal River Valley. To\n            accomplish these objectives, the main components will: 1)\n            create the policy, legal, and, institutional frameworks to\n            ease the development of irrigated agriculture; 2) develop\n            basic public and private infrastructures. Research and\n            development will be supported under this component; 3)\n            improve management and organizational skills within farmers,\n            as well as farmer associations; 4) strengthen the\n            traditional irrigated agriculture sub-sector, supporting\n            traditional crop production; 5) develop agricultural\n            diversification, through promotion activities, focusing on\n            quality control. Infrastructure development will also be\n            supported; 6) implement mitigation measures, in response to\n            adverse environmental impacts caused by the project; 7)\n            provide management, and, monitoring and evaluation for\n            project related issues."}, "docdt": "1999-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
