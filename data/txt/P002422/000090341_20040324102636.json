cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was unlikely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the risk\n            assessment needs to be taken into account in the\n            project's scope and innovative design particularly in\n            post-conflict settings. Ensuring flexibility in project\n            design: the flexibility in the initial project design\n            (annual plan basis) allowed for immediate financing of\n            emergency activities when needed, without immediate\n            restructuring. Distributing funds over too many activities\n            can lessen the project's overall impact, specially when\n            resources are limited, and should be avoided. The financing\n            by the project of contractual staff for key implementation\n            positions has ensured continuity of project implementation,\n            in a conflict/post-conflict environment where most civil\n            servants were no longer in place. Activities should not be\n            included in the project when funds to finance them are not\n            secured. In the project planning process, it is crucial to\n            ensure that required counterpart funds are commensurate with\n            the country's capacity to make them available. The need\n            to recruit local consultants for long-term assignments\n            whenever feasible. The need to further tighten internal\n            fiduciary control measures. It is particularly important\n            when project management is fully integrated within a\n            Ministry to assign specific responsibilities for project\n            implementation and decision-making on the Ministry's\n            more permanent staff rather than on those who are likely to\n            change more often such as political appointees. Finally, in\n            post-conflict settings, one cannot expect short/medium term\n            sustainability and it is important that Donors commit their\n            resources over long periods to give a sector a reasonable\n            chance for take off."}, "docdt": "2004-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
