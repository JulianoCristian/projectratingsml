and Henan in the North China\n            Plain. It is designed to overcome the main agricultural\n            constraints of soil salinity, waterlogging, and surface\n            flooding. The project includes construction and improvement\n            of main, lateral, sublateral and on-farm drains and\n            irrigation ditches; construction of and equipment for\n            pumping stations and tubewells; additions to existing rural\n            electrification systems; construction and improvement of\n            rural roads; provision of agrochemicals and agricultural\n            machinery and equipment; establishment of orchards and wood\n            lots; strengthening of research and extension services in\n            the project areas; comprehensive soil and water studies; and\n            a North China Plain Agricultural Study."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
