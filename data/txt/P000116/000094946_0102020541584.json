Among the lessons learned, it is reinforced that\n            stakeholders ownership is crucial for successful outcomes,\n            as is an effective steering committee in coordinating the\n            multiple interventions of capacity building within a\n            project. However, training should be a permanent, ongoing\n            activity for capacity building to succeed, particularly in\n            an environment of frequent staff transfers. Moreover,\n            consideration should be given to the sustainability of\n            institutional development projects, who are substantially\n            dependent on the availability of budgetary funds to meet\n            recurrent costs; likewise, the costly undertaking of small\n            technical assistance projects - compared with total\n            disbursements - should raise overall investments questions.\n            Lessons also convey that the implementation delays as of the\n            early start of the project, could have been avoided, had\n            conditions of effectiveness been minimal."}, "docdt": "2000-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
