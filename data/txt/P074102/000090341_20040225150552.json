The specific\n            objectives of the DCDP are: Implementing a mechanism to\n            decentralize planning, project cycle management and\n            financial management to District and Community Development\n            Committee (CDC) level, to enable local governments and\n            communities to identify and finance their own development\n            priorities. Testing the mechanism for decentralization, to\n            reinforce their ownership of these investments, and\n            Strengthening the capacity of CDCs, local and central\n            government levels to facilitate and implement the\n            community-demand-driven development projects. Following are\n            some of the negative impacts and mitigation measures.\n            Negative impacts: deforestation; land degradation, including\n            soil erosion; water contamination; disturbance of natural\n            habitats and wildlife; degradation of wetlands; social\n            discrimination. Mitigation measures: fully implement this\n            ESMF; addressing specific mitigation measures such as\n            training and capacity building to use modern and appropriate\n            technologies for design, and implementation of district sub\n            projects, efficiency use, environmental restoration, regular\n            and suitable maintenance of infrastructure/equipment/plant."}, "docdt": "2004-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
