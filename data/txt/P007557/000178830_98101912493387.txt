APATZINGAN IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
The Resource Base
1.01      Mexico has a land area of about 2 million km2 with a population
of almost 67 million (mid-1978 estimate), growing at an annual rate of 2.9%.
Approximately 40% of the total population (25 million) secures its livelihood
from agriculture. Agriculture is also an important foreign exchange earner,
comprising approximately 22% of the total value of exports in 1977. The
wide range in latitude and altitude permits the growth of a great diversity of
crops and fosters livestock output. The extent of arid and mountainous lands
is so large, however, that only 18% of the total area (35 million ha) is
considered cultivable. Of this, only about 15 million ha are harvested, of
which an estimated 5 million ha are under irrigation. On a worldwide basis,
Mexico ranks sixth in terms of land under irrigation.
Agricultural Production
1.02      From 1945 to 1965, the value of agricultural production grew more
than 5% per year. After 1965, however, production growth rates of major
cereal crops fell behind the growth in domestie demand. As a result, agricul-
ture's contribution to the GDP declined from 16% in 1960 to about 10% in
1976/77. Nonetheless, in contrast to the slow growth in crop production,
livestock production increased steadily throughout the 1970s at an average
annual rate of about 4%.
1.03      The main reasons for the fast growth rate in agricultural production
between 1945 and 1965 were the rapid expansion of irrigated lands and the
results of successful research on irrigated crops. After 1965, however, a
drop in agricultural production occurred when the physical complexity and cost
of large-scale irrigation schemes rose sharply and private investments declined.
The latter situation was caused by the uncertainty of many landowners in regard
to titles to their land.
1.04      Maize is Mexico's most widely grown crop, accounting for about 8
million ha, or over half the country's cultivated area. Most of it is grown
under rainfed conditions along with smaller areas of beans by small-scale
farmers in the central and southern highlands along the Gulf Coast and in
Chiapas State. In the humid tropical region along the southern Gulf Coast
and in Chiapas State, sugarcane, bananas, cacao and coffee are grown.
1.05      Livestock is also an important component of Mexican agriculture.
In the past, most of the commercial output came from the arid and semi-arid
range lands of the north, where extensive cattle breeding took place. Cattle-
men earned relatively high income from the sale of feeder cattle, mainly to
the United States market. Milk, hogs, and poultry were produced in small
quantities, primarily in the central highlands, mainly for subsistence. The



- 2 -
increase in domestic demand, however, caused a rapid expansion in production
throughout the country. The growth of Mexico City in the central plateau also
contributed to this rapid increase in demand for milk, pork, poultry and beef.
In response to this demand, new cattle producing areas were developed mainly
along the Gulf Coast where better rainfall and improved pastures enabled a
much higher stocking rate than was possible in the more arid regions.
1.06      Since 1965, the gross value of crop production has been growing
moderately at approximately 1.3% per annum in real terms, mainly because
of the relatively slow rise in average yields, increased limitations on
agricultural exports, unfavorable market situations, and a relatively slow
expansion of irrigated lands. While the gross values of cotton and sugarcane
virtually declined or remained the same, those of grains and oilseeds increased
by 1.5% to 3.0%, respectively. If average yields are used to measure relative
performance, the best results have been obtained in the northern region
where yields, primarily grains, rose by 36%. Wheat accounted for most of
the growth as its yield doubled from 1.5 tons per ha in 1965 to 3 tons per
ha in 1974. In the Pacific and Central Regions, yields of all crops rose by
20%. This has been due mainly to a substantial decrease in the area devoted
to low value crops (maize and beans) which was partly compensated by an
increase in high yielding crops, mainly sorghum in the Central Region and
sugarcane in the Pacífic Region. In the Northwest, the fastest growing
region in terms of gross value of production, yields increased by 7%. Account-
ing for most of this growth was the introduction of oilseeds (soybeans) as a
second crop in the commercially oriented irrigation districts of the region.
The Gulf Region and the state of Tamaulipas had the lowest performance.
In the Gulf Region, only sugarcane showed an upward trend, confirming the
suitability of the zone for that crop.
1.07      Since 1965, in contrast to crops, livestock has maintained, and,
in recent years, even increased its growth. This was mainly a response to
an increase in demand for livestock products, which far exceeded supply
capabilities of some areas. Consequently, Mexico has been importing powdered
milk since mid-1970.
Rural Population, Employment, and Income
1.08      The agricultural sector provides the livelihood for a rural popula-
tion of some 4 million families scattered among 95,000 villages, totalling
more than 25 million people. Unemployment and under-employment are serious
problems. With a rural labor force of between 8 and 12 million people and a
harvested area fluctuating around 15 million ha, the ratio of cropped area to
potential active population is between 1.3 and 2.0 ha per person. This is
quite low when the land use pattern (about two-thirds of the cropped area
devoted to grains) is considered. This ís one of the major causes determiníng
the level of income in the agricultural sector, which is lower than that of
other sectors, as the following table shows:

GDP Per Worker (1975) 1/
US$      Index
Agriculture                         120       100
National average                    384       320
Industry and services               504       420
1/   Based on data of "Prontuario Estadistico de la Secretaria de Recursos
Hidraulicos" (SRH) Mexico, D.F., 1976.
Moreover, the income distribution pattern within the agricultural sector is
skewed, since 50% of the rural families account for only about 20% of the
agricultural output, while the upper 10% of the agricultural population
provides 50%.
Government Policies
1.09      Withín the agricultural sector, Government policies are dírected
primarily toward increasing production of basic food crops (maize, wheat
and rice) so as to reach self-sufficiency by 1982  and increasing income
levels as well as generating rural employment.  Because of favorable prospects
for increasing petroleum revenues and export earnings, Mexico now has the
means to diversify its agricultural development program. Such action would
enable more farmers to reach higher levels of productivity, thereby providing
a higher sector growth rate similar to the earlier periods. To meet these
objectives, Government is pursuing the following strategies:
(a) planning large-scale irrigation projects to develop areas
where a hydraulic potential exists, expanding irrigated
lands through small-scale irrigation systems, improving per-
formance in presently irrigated areas through rehabilitation
of old conveyance systems, reclaiming saline lands, and making
more efficient use of available water;
(b) expanding rainfed cultivation in under-utilized lands, mostly
along the Gulf Coast. The latter will require investments
in drainage and flood control, but it will also necessitate
a strong effort by its research services to develop adequate
crop technologies and an expansion of extension services in
order to encourage farmers to adopt better cultural tech-
niques;
(c) improving productivity in existing rainfed agriculture by
expanding the area and developing a more effective extension
service (Government in 1977 created "Distritos de Temporal," or
rainfed districts, adjacent to existing irrigation distriets);
and
(d) using price support programs to induce changes in cropping
patterns favoring increased production of food crops.

1.10      The Bank's lending program to Mexico's agricultural sector, on-going
or under preparation, contains a number of projects that would promote the
policies of the Government as outlined above. The proposed project, designed
to expand irrigated land and rehabilitate an old existing irrigation system,
would mesh with the Government's strategy.
Previous Bank Projects
1.11       In the past six years (FY 1974/79), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$1.0 billion distributed over 11 projects
as follows:
(a) Irrigation (Panuco, Sinaloa, Fuerte/Sinaloa and Bajo Bravo/Bajo San
Juan) - US$291 million;
(b) Rural Development (PIDER I and II and Papaloapan Basin) - US$280
million;
(c) Credits V and VI - US$325 million;
(d) Area Development (Tropical Agriculture) - US$56 million; and
(e) Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Development - US$60 million.
Implementation of the irrigation projects was delayed, mainly because of
budgetary constraints. Accentuating these delays were large price increases
unforeseen at appraisal. Thus, the Government and Bank agreed that the
projects should be financed over a longer period of time. This decision led
to the reformulation of the Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan project, with subsequent
cancellation of US$100 million (from an origínal loan of US$150 million).
To assist in financing cost overruns of the Panuco Project, a supplementary
loan of US$25 million was approved by the Bank on July 11, 1978. With these
actions, implementation of the above projects is progressing satisfactorily.
PIDER I and II are multí-sectoral projects designed for improving living
conditions and increasing productivity in localized areas of rural poverty
(micro-regions). After some difficulties inherent to the nature of such
projects and decentralization of the decision-making process, overall progress
of these projects is improving. The success in carrying out the different
project components varies with the implementation capacities of the agencies
involved. The Papaloapan project had a slow start due to severe shortage of
funds, a situation that was corrected by increasing the appropriations,
beginning in early 1979. The disbursement pace of the Fifth Credit Project
was faster than projected. Full dísbursement was reached by June 1979, seven
months ahead of the original schedule of January 1, 1980. The Sixth Credit
Project became effective on January 12, 1979, and by January 1980 more than
65% had been disbursed. The Tropical Agriculture Project also became effective
on January 12, 1979, and, although implementation is behind schedule, the pace
is accelerating. The Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Project became
effective on April 13, 1979 and is just now starting. In May 1979, the
Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project was appraised and became effective
on October 5, 1979.

1.12      The Bank has completed audit reports on the first four agricultural
loans to FIRA, and a completion report on the fifth loan is now being prepared.
The trend in Bank lending has stressed increased lending to low-income produ-
cers, increased emphasis on crop rather than livestock production, and less
emphasis on models and more emphasis on sector orientation in loan preparation.
Altogether, the credit loan series has absorbed US$600 million of Bank funds,
making the program one of the largest in the Bank's agricultural portfolio.
An audit report, was made on the Mexico Third Irrigation Project (Loan 450-ME),
showed that performance of the borrower was generally satisfactory and no tech-
nical organizational or managerial difficulties were experienced. The audit
cited, however, that the borrower had not fully complied with two loan conditions:
controlling ground water extraction and recovery of operation and maintenance
in part of the project area, and recovery of additional investment charges in
the whole project area.
1.13      In view of the above, recognized difficulties have been overcome
in that technical services and on-farm investments, which are essential in
meeting project objectives, are now included in project costs, and sensitivity
analyses are being made on construction delays and effects of price changes
and benefits. The Bank has also become more involved in project preparation and
in the determination of the readiness of projects for preparation and imple-
mentation than it has been previously.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project is located in the central part of Michoacan State
(see Map IBRD 14852) between 18 51' and 19 15' North latitude and the western
meridians of 101 55' and 102 54' where altitudes range from 320 to over 400 m
above sea level. The project area is in a valley formed by the Tepalcatepec
River and its tributaries. The Tepalcatepec River is itself a tributary to
the Rio Balsas, which flows into the Pacific Ocean.
Climate
2.02      The project area is a frost-free zone with plenty of solar radiation,
and a year-round growing season.  Data taken from two of seven meteorological
stations, Apatzingan and Piedras Blancas, presented in Annex 2, Table 1 shows
the annual average maximum temperature to be 34.6 0C and 38.4 0C, respectively;
the annual median is 27.90C for both stations, while the annual minimum is
17.70C and 18.0 0C, respectively. Average annual rainfall is 726.0 mm and
645.2 mm, respectively, for the two stations, with 90% of it occurring between
June and October. Average monthly rainfall for the remaining seven months
ranges from 0.2 mm to 20.0 mm.
2.03      The evapotranspiration rate is high and critical.  Using the
Thornthwaite method, it amounts to 1,732 mm, 58% of which is associated
with the March to August period. Of significance is the fact that only in
July, August and September is precipítation greater than the potential evapo-
transpiration rate (Annex 2, Figure 1). This underscores the need for full
irrigation to achieve adequate yields.



-6-
Solís
2.04      A soils survey covering approximately 198,000 ha in the project
study area has been carried out by the consulting firm, Estudios y Proyectos,
S.A. (EPSA). Approximately 81% of the soils are vertisols, 11% are fluvisols,
6% are gleísols and 2% are solonchacks. The vertisols are deep, black, volcanic
soíls whose color is due to magnetite. They are low in organic matter (1%),
but well supplied with bases and are considered the most fertile soíls in
this region. However, because these heavy clay soils shrink and swell with
changes in moisture content, they can be difficult to handle. Fluvisols are
well suited for agricultural development, and, in general, they present no
soil management problems. The gleisols are hydromorphic soils, and deficient
drainage ls the major limiting factor. The solonchacks are alkaline soils
with high watertables. Nitrogen ís the major nutrient lacking in all soila.
2.05      For irrigation purposes, the soils have been classified, following
very closely the classes established by the US Bureau of Reclamation. Taken
into consideration were such limíting factors as degree of stoniness, soil
depth, relief, drainage and salinity (Annex 2, Table 2). Using these criteria,
over 130,700 ha, or about 66% of the land, are in Classes 1 to 3. These soils
have no seríous limitations for irrigation, and yields on these soals can be
hígh. The area in Class 4 is over 36,500 ha, or 18% of the total land. These
saols are marginal for irrigation and present certain restrictions as to the
kinds of crops that can be grown. Approximately 31,000 ha (15%) are in Class
6, due mainly to terrain, and they are unsuitable for irrigation. Drainage
is not a major problem in the project area because of the numerous natural
outlets and slope of the land.
Hydrology
2.06      The principal source of water for the Apatzingan Valley is the
Tepalcatepec River. Throughout its course, it receives a number of tributaries,
of which only the El Marquez River and its tributaries, the Cupatitzío and
El Cajones, can be considered as suitable for irrigating large tracts of land.
Most of the other streams are small and are utilized to irrigate only small
scattered areas. Wells and streams are also major contributors of water.
Including all sources, it is estimated that there are 3 billion m3 of water
available yearly. Of this amount, about 1.7 billion m3 comes from the
Tepalcatepec River and the Cupatitzio-El Cajones Rivers; 0.7 ballion m3
is from the aquifer in the central part; and the balance of 0.6 billion m3
comes from small rivers, the main ones being the Cancita, Buenavista and Otates.
Water quality of the rivers, streams, springs and wells, at their sources or
upper reaches, is suitable for all purposes, domestic, industrial and irrigation.
2.07      The catchment area of the Tepalcatepec River, upstream of the
proposed dam at Chilatan, ls about 5,350 km2 and brings an average annual flow
of 1,196 mullion m3 to the dam site. About 81% flows during a six-month rainy
season--June to November. During the remaining six months, the flow is quite
stable, being about 35 millíon m3 per month, originating mainly from upstream
springs. Details of monthly flows over the last 27 years are in Annex 2,
Table 3. Present annual extraction from the river is estimated to be 500



- 7 -
million m3 of which about 400 million m3 is through the diversion of PSedras
2
Blancas, 7 km  downstream qf the proposed dam, with a capacity of 18 m /sec.
The balance, 100 million m , is extracted through direct pumping from the
river to irrigate isolated areas along the river banks.
2.08    2 Although the catchment area of the El Marquez River is almost
3,000 km , only its Cupatitzio ald El Cajones tributaries, with a combined
catchment area of about 1,150 km , now contribute water to the project area.
The Cupatitzio River is used upstream to generate electricity at three different
locations, and its flow is, therefore, well regulated. The El Cajones River
receives part of its water from pe ennial springs and thus has a stable
monthly flow of about 15 million m during the dry season.
2.09      The El Cajgnes River has a diversion dam and a 27-km canal with a
capacity of over 8 m /sec, ¡.e., capable of carrying only the dry season flow
and not the winter floods. At the 27-km point, the El Cajones Canal merges
with the Cupatitzio diversion tunnel (El Cobano) and from thereon, for 28.8 km,3
it is known as the El Marquez Canal, its capacity haviíng been increased to 20 m /sec.
Details of the monthly flows at El Cajones diversion dam during the past 25 years
and those at the El Cobano diversion on the Cupatitzio River are in the project
file (Annex 3). The combined flows after.passing the El Marquez Syphon, which
is the amount of water available for the project, are in Annex 2, Table 4.
At present, most of the water diverted is utilized for irrigation purposes
and the system serves more than 30,000 ha. Because of low irrigation efficiency
and over-utilization of water in the upper reaches of the system, however,
water shortages do occur in parts of the area.
2.10      Three other streams on the right bank of the Tepalcatepec River, the
Guadalupe, Taixtan and El Cajon, are not perennial streams and flow only
during the rainy season. Most of the tributaries along the left bank of the
Tepalcatepec River are utilized by erecting diversion structures along their
courses.
2.11       Springs that supply water for irrigation thr ughout the year have
a combined average annual yield of about 280 million m . Yields from the most
important among them (Buenavista, Cancita and Paracuaro), with monthly
fluctuations, are presented in Annex 2, Tables 5 and 6.
2.12      Over 300 wells are located along the central part of the Apatzingan
Valley between Los Dolores in the west and Apatzingan in the east. The aquifer,
according to a hydr9logical survey made during 1978/79, has 3a safe yield of
about 640 million m /year and a vo Sume of about 4 billion m .  Annual extrac-
tion is about 250 to 300 million m , but this amount, however, does not cause a
significant drawdown due to the aquifer's huge volume. All wells are equipped
with electric pumps connected to an electric grid.
Present Irrigation Systems
2.13      The Capatítzio/Tepalcatepec Irrigation District, for administrative,
operational and development purposes, is divided into four units (see Map
IBRD 14582, and Annex 2, IBRD Chart l). With the exception of water pumped



- 8 -
from wells and the small Los Olivos dam, none of the irrigation systems has
atorage capacíty. Therefore, although many of the diverted river flows are
perennial, only 62,000 ha can be fully irrigated throughout the year out of a
total 96,000 ha in the area served by the irrigation systems. The balance,
amounting to 13,000 ha included in the project area, has never been irrigated.
The hectares irrigated by each system, with their water sources, are presented
in Annex 2, Table 7.
2.14       Unit I theoretically has ample water available (600 million m3/year)
to meet the requirements of its 30,000 ha. In practice, however, more than
half of the land, all of which ja located in the lower part, does not receive
the quantities required and, in many cases, not even sufficient water for one
crop per year. The main reasona for this situation are lack of measurement
and control structures throughout the conveyance and distribution system,
over-utilization of water in the upper lands, and low irrigation efficiency at
farm level because land ís not leveled and/or contour lines are not formed.
2.15      Unit II and III systems and subsystems and wells command 54,000 ha.
Out of the irrigated 44,000 ha, more than 25% of the land does not receive
enough water to meet its full needs and about 5,000 ha are not irrigated.
2.16      Unit IV on the right bank of the Tepalcatepec River is the only
unit that has a substantial amount of unirrigated lands and must rely on
water delivered from outside its boundries. Out of its 10,500 ha, only 10% of
the land has a stable water supply, which js through the Los Olivos reservoir.
Approximately 8,000 ha are partially irrigated from seasonal local streams
and springs (norias).
2.17      The overall efficiency of the systems is low, estimated to be 30%,
and it can be attributed to lack of: (a) control structures and measurement
devices; (b) maintenance of the conveyance and distribution systems; (c) land
leveling in most of the area; (d) storage facilities; and (e) night irrigation.
Land Tenure
2.18      Land reform was carried out in the project area in the 1930s and, as
a result, only 18.5% of the cultivated land is now in farms larger than 50 ha.
These farms, however, are controlled by only 2% of the land holders. Approxi-
mately 75% of the land is held by "ejidatarios,` who comprise about 90% of the
land holders, while the balance of the land (25%) is owned by private farmers.
The tables below show farm distribution by families and size of holdings in
actual numbers and by percent in the project area. Details are in Annex 2,
Table 8.

2.19      Under the Agrarian Reform Law and a new Federal Water Law dated
January 11, 1972, single-owner holdings in excess of 20 ha in a Federal
Irrigation District are subject to expropriation for redistribution to ejidos.
In Apatzingan, however, such farms are not subject to the 20-ha limit on
irrigated lands because they predate the 1972 Federal Water Law. The new
lands to be irrigated are already part of the lands owned by ejidos and private
farmers.
Population and Employment
2.20      Approximately 280,000 people live in the region, about 47%, or
130,000, of whom are urban and around 53%, or 150,000, are rural. Of the
urban population, about 60,000 are concentrated in the city of Apatzingan,
while the rest (70,000) are in smaller towns of 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants.
Between 1960 and 1970, the annual population growth rate was around 4.9%,
but since 1970 it has been estimated at about 3%.
2.21      Out of about 26,800 families in the project area (average of 5.5
persons per family), approximately 8,900 belong to ejidos. The ejidos are
legal entities which permit rural communities to enjoy the use of lands
while ownership remains with the Federation. Their charters also establish
the rights of individual members (ejidatarios) to share in the usufruct land
rights of their community. About 920 families have title to land while the
balance, amounting to around 17,000 families, have no land holding rights of
their own. This is not expected to become a problem in the project area.
2.22      Employment varies with land tenure.  Families who hold up to 10 ha
4          need use only 51% of their potential 2.34 million man-days in labor on their
own farms and, therefore, have to seek off-farm employment for the remaining
1.14 míllion man-days. On farms from 11 to 20 ha, families can use about
1.05 million man-days on their farms and 0.18 million man-days off the farm.
On farms larger than 20 ha, around 0.25 million man-days are employed on the
farm, which includes all the family labor available.
2.23      Based on analysis of the present situation, annual income per
family holding up to 10 ha is estimated to be Mex$86,733 (US$3,854). For
11- to 20-ha farms, it is Mex$172,500 (US$7,666) and for farns larger than
20 ha, it is Mex$776,600 (US$34,515). These estimated figures include both
on-farm and off-farm incomes.



- 10 -
Present Production
2.24      At present there are approximately 97,300 ha of cultivable cropland
in the project area but only 94,100 ha are actually used. About 13,600 ha are
in industrial crops (cotton and sugarcane); 51,200 ha are in grains (maize,
sorghum, rice, beans); 5,850 ha are in oilseeds (sesame); 5,460 ha are in
vegetables and melons; 13,250 ha are in fruits (bananas, limes and mangos);
and 4,740 ha are in pastures. Cropping intensity is around 96% (Annex 2,
Table 9). Yields are generally low throughout the district and crop husbandry
is relatively poor. Some lands are double cropped, especially those where
water supply is available and dependable.
2.25      Livestock in the project area is important.  Most of the activity
centers around raising cattle, mainly for milk and to a lesser extent, for
meat. Fattening is done outside the region. Also found in the area are
goats used for milk and meat, hogs, poultry, horses and bees. Animal husbandry
is rudimentary, with little attention being paid to breeding, sanitation and
feeding. The major cattle breeds are Creole, Swiss, and Zebu crosses.
During the rainy season, cattle graze on natural pastues and, in the winter
and fall, they depend on crop by-products. Pasture management is poor, whích
results in a low carrying capacity, and practically all farms with irrigated
pastures also cultivate crops.
Agricultural Support Services
2.26      Extension.  Extension services in the Irrigation District are provided
by 14 agronomists who supervise 40 technical assistants. Each agronomist has
a bachelor's degree while the technical assistants are intermediate school
graduates. The agronomists are usually inexperienced when they join the staff
and tend to remain for only two years. Lack of supervisory personnel, short
tenures and insufficient experienced agronomists, coupled with inadequate
equipment, as well as supplies, have limited the effectiveness of the extension
staff. In addition to the technical assistance provided by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH), the region has several other agencies
designed to assist the farmer. They are, however, not very effective because
of undefined purposes, insufficient coordination between agencies, duplication
of functions, and lack of technical personnel, equipment and supplíes.
2.27      Research.  Research is performed by the Agricultural Experiment
Station for Apatzingan Valley (CAEVA), located in the project area, and this
station also serves the Central Pacific Region of Mexico. It has a capable
support staff and highly trained personnel holding PhDs in charge of the major
fields of investígation such as agronomy, horticulture, pathology, entomology
and pedology. The station has published bulletins on the region's traditional
crops (cotton, beans, maize, bananas, melons) and new crops (sesame, mangos,
soybeans, sorghum), and it has demonstration plots on its land and also
conducts a small training program in cooperation with the local Extension
Service. Field equipment and other facilities appear adequate for the program
in force. Although the station's adaptive research program addresses itself
to farmers' problems, there is a need for more field demonstrations where
farmers can see results and thereby benefit more from the program. Moreover,
feedback from the farmers appears to be lacking.



- 11 -
2.28      Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit is provided mainly by the
two branches of Banco Rural, one in Apatzingan and the other at Nueva Italia.
The staff in both branches includes about 45 professionals wíth support
personnel. This staff processes both short-term and long-term loans, and, in
1978, around Mex$300 million was advanced in short-term loans to about 25,000
borrowers, and an estimated Mex$70 million for long-term loans was provided.
At present, there is no shortage of credit, and none is expected, even with an
anticipated increase in demand due to the proposed project. The data from the
regional bank, Banco de Credito Rural del Pacifico Sur S.A., operating in the
project area, show overdues for 1977 of 21%. There are indications, however,
that repayment is improving.
2.29      Crop Insurance.  Crop insurance, a Government-sponsored program
implemented by the National Crop and Livestock Insurance Agency (ANAGSA), is
operative in the project area. About 45,000 ha were insured in 1978, covering
crops such as cotton, sorghum, sesame and rice. In fact, all credits made on
crops by the National Rural Credit Bank (BNCR) are contingent on the farmer
carrying appropriate insurance. The insurance plan covers a maximum of 70% of
the estimated production costs for irrigated crops and 50% for non-irrigated
crops. Premium rates vary from 4% to 8.25% of the total production costs,
which are estimated by the BNCR agronomists. Generally, the program is
working well. Rates are based on actuarial studies and the premium is collected
by BNCR.
2.30      Marketing.  Well established marketing organizations handle the
major commodities produced in Apatzingan.  The National Marketing Corporation
(CONASUPO), established by the Government to regulate the price and supply
of basic food items, purchases the main crops from farmers at the official
support prices. These prices are generally in line with the free market, but
for commodities such as maize and sorghum for which there is a national
shortage and imports are increasing, support prices are appreciably higher.
A second important marketing organization is the Regional Agricultural Union
(UAR), which deals mainly with marketing of melons but also handles other
fruits sold on the local market and to the United States. Production of melons
for export is regulated through the UAR which employs about 18 marketing
agents abroad. There are approximately 3,000 farmers from the project area
involved with this organization.
2.31      Price Policy.  The Government's price policy is geared to provide
basic foods to urban dwellers at low prices. Since 1974, however, the farmgate
prices of basic food crops has more than doubled. In 1980, CONASUPO announced
a support price increase of 20% for corn and wheat and 30% for beans.
Generally, support prices are set prior to the planting season and reflect
(a) the cost of food in urban areas; (b) minimum wage rates in urban and
rural areas; (c) cost of fertilizer, fuel and electricity; and (d) producer
incentives. Milk and beef prices are controlled by the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry, and the annual exports of young steers are regulated by the
National Livestock Confederation.
2.32      The Government is currently undertaking several studies relating
to wholesale and retail marketing and delivery systems and plans to invest
in a marketing project to facilitate the flow of goods and services.



- 12 -
2.33      Storage.  Storage is provided mainly by CONASUPO and the National
Storage and Warehouse Agency (ANSA), which is a private organization. Both
agencies have silos and warehouses for all grains, including rice. CONASUPO,
however, ¡S involved also with buying and selling farm commodities, providing
even the transportation from the farm to storage facilities as well as to the
major consumption centers. ANSA is engaged mainly with storage of crops.
Transportation
2.34      The project area is well served by roads and railways.  Federal
Highway 37 runs 260 km north-south on the east side of the project and is
intersected by several state roads and a number of other paved as well as
unpaved roads. Federal Highway 120 runs east-west for 281 km on the project's
north side, and it also is intersected by several paved and unpaved roads.
All roads are passable throughout the year. A railroad coming from Uruapan
outside the project area in the east serves Apatzingan, and another railroad
is under construction, linking Nueva Italia in the project area with the
Pacific port of Lazaro-Cardenas. Apatzingan, Cuatro Caminos, Tepalcatepec
and El Cobano all have landing strips but only the El Cobano strip is paved.
The Apatzíngan strip is the end point for a regular commercial air route but
íts condition is below the minimum safety requirements.
Social Services and Infrastructure
2.35      Many agencies provide social services in the project area.  Educa-
tional opportunitíes appear to be good, with six pre-schools, 183 primary, and
28 secondary schools, plus two centers at the pre-university level. The
secondary level includes vocational training in agriculture, livestock,
industrial and commercial fields. In each municipality, there is at least one
clinic which adequately handles minor ailments. At Apatzingan and Nueva
Italia, the Mexican Institute for Social Security operates two clinics where
the more serious cases can be treated. Potable water is avaílable in all
municipalities, and sewerage systems exist in all but one. Because of the
increase in population, however, both potable water and sewerage faciíities
have been severely strained. Electrical power reaches approximately 60% of
the population, and the postal service operates in all municipalities.
Communication is handled by two regional telephone centers that are connected
to local stations in each municipality, and there are two telegraph centers.
III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      The proposed project was prepared by the Planning Division of
SARH, with the assistance of a Mexican consulting firm, EYPSA. A Master Plan
for the Apatzingan area had been prepared in 1975 by another Mexican consulting
firm, but no action was taken, probably because of budgetary constraints that
existed at that time and some technical reservations on the proposals presented
by the consultants. In July 1979, a Preparation Report was made by Bank staff
and the project was pre-appraised in October 1979. Final appraisal was in
November-December 1979.



- 13 -
Project Objective
3.02      The objective of the project is to provide suitable irrigation
facilities for the proper allocation of water to the valley's irrigable land,
with respect to location and season of the year. This will permít the expansion
and intensification of agriculture in the Apatzingan Valley. At present, within
the proposed project area, there are about 198,000 ha, but approximately only
109,000 ha can be fully irrigated. About 30,000 ha are in Unit I in the
eastern part, around 58,000 ha are in Units II and III in the central part,
and approximately 21,000 ha are in Unit IV in the west, along the right bank
of the Tepalcatepec River. Water from rivers, springs and wells, is abundant
(paras 2.06 to 2.17), but irrigable soil is the limiting factor in the expansion
and development of agriculture in the Apatzingan Valley, particularly the
western and central parts.
Project Design Alternatives
3.03      The Cajones System.  Three ways to deal with the local water shortage
in Unit 1 (para 2.14), were analyzed: (a) storage of the rainy season flows;
(b) diversion of adjacent water resources; and (c) improvement of the existing
system. Because of the high investment, water storage was rejected. Even
utilizing part of the water in other units could not justify the cost.
Diverting adjacent water resources into the exísting system could not be
adopted because of lack of data on the size and duration of their flows, as
well as on their present use. The improvement or rehabilitation of the
exísting system, therefore, was selected as the best solution.
3.04      The Chilatan System.  To overcome present shortages of water in the
central and western parts of the valley, Units II, III and IV (paras. 2.15 and
2.16), two alternatives were considered: (a) full utilization of the aquifer
(only about 30 to 35% of its annual replenishment is now used), plus use of
other streams, and additional diversion of water from the Tepalcatepec River
provided during the rainy season; and (b) erection of a reservoir on the
Tepalcatepec River at Chilatan, combined with the construction of two main
canals which would serve 66,000 ha. The networks of drains and roads and
extent of land clearing and land leveling are similar in both alternatives.
3.05      The two alternatives were studied to determine which one would yield
the higher present value of incremental net benefit. The cost of electric
energy was analyzed under four scenarios, ranging from US$0.014 to US$0.07 per
kwh. The data show (Annex 2, Table 10) that, with the cost of electric power
at US$0.014 and US$0.027 per kwh, alternatíve (a) is better than (b). As
energy costs increase from US$0.04 to US$0.07 per kwh, however, alternative
(b) is better than (a). Although the current price of electricity for agricul-
ture is about US$0.02 per kwh, the actual cost of producing electric energy,
as reported by the Federal Commission for Electricity (CFE) using 1979 prices,
is US$0.03 per kwh. The economic price of electricity, however, is signifi-
cantly higher and could be interpolated from the international price of oil.
In 1979, this price was estimated by the electricity authorities in Mexico to
be US$0.06 per kwh. Since the economic price of electric energy indicates
that alternative (b) is superior to (a) and Bank projections show that the
price of oil will continue to increase, alternative (b) was selected for

developing Units II, III and IV. Although not considered in the study nor
included in the benefits, the construction of the dam would involve a temporary
diversion tunnel 1/ that could be used at a later date for generating electricity.
Project Description
3.06      The project would include:  (a) rehabilitation of the exísting
El Cajones system in the eastern part of the valley, with a possible back-up
for diverting additional water from local streams; and (b) construction of the
Chilatan dam and two main canals in the Tepalcatepec River to replace the
existing system and to irrigate new lands in the central and western parts of
the valley; and (c) inclusion of local subsystems within the irrigation
facilities of the valley. Under the proposed project, only about 70% of the
3 billion m3 of water available per year would be utilized in the proposed
project.

3.07      The project would consist of:
(a)  Chilatan System
(i)  Construction of a rock-filled clay core dam, 103 m high on
the Tepalcatepec River. The reservoir would have a storage
capacity of 600 million m3, only 350 million m3 of which would
be live storage, yielding approximately 1,000 míllion m3 per
year and providing sufficient water to irrigate 66,000 ha;
(ií) Construction of a spillway on the left bank to discharge the
excess flood waters (a maximum of about 7,000 m3/s and
an intake tower on the right bank of the dam site;
(iii) Building and lining (where required) of two main canals,
53.2 km on the right bank of the Tepalcatepec Ríver and
93.2 km on the left bank;
1/ If provided with suitable facilities; otherwise it would be useless
because of sedimentation.



- 15 -
(iv)  Construction of distribution systems totalling 1,224 km and
drainage canals totalling 628.2 km; and
(v)  Building 1,455 km of new and improved roads in the project area
and constructing other civil works including access roads, a
labor camp, six small pumping stations, office buildings and
telephone lines.
(b)  Cajones-Paracuaro System
(i)  Rehabilitating the El Cajones diversion structure and the main
canals for El Cajones (27 km) and El Marquez (28.8 km) as well
as the Las Burras diversion structure;
(ii)  Constructing and lining (where required) 26.1 km canals to
link the El Cajones and Paracuaro systems, 629.5 km of
distribution systems and 203.5 km of drainage canals; and
(iii) Building 691.9 km of roads, houses and telephone lines.
(c) Entire Area
(i)  A technical assistance program which would provide needed
additional staff, equipment and supplies for the existing
program; funds to improve the skills and knowledge
of extensionists as well as to expand on-farm demonstra-
tions and development;
(ií)  Studies in the region for development of future projects;
(iii) Review and analyses of the utilization of local water sources,
specifically in the Cajones system;
(iv)  Funding for required machinery and equipment for the operation
and maintenance of project facilities;
(v)  Land clearing (11,500 ha) and land leveling (74,000 ha); and
(vi)  Indemnification for resettlement of farmers, acquisition of
rights-of-ways and payment to farmers for crop damages associated
with project implementation.
Design Criteria
3.08      The irrigation works would be designed for water delivery to 60-ha
blocks. Water control and measuring structures would be part of the canal
network and distribution systems and would permit monitoring of water up to
the 60-ha block turnouts. Some of the conveyance and distribution systems
would be lined. Although project costs include lining for all new major canals,
SARH has agreed to avoid such works whenever they are not needed. All farm
land would be leveled, and technical assistance on irrigation practices would



- 16 -
be provided. Because of this, high irrigation efficiencies have been assumed:
80% for the conveyance systems and 75% for the field, giving an overall effi-
ciency of 60%. High efficiencies of this level have been reached in several
irrigation project.s in northwest Mexico. If, however, this should prove
difficult to achieve, each system could be reinforced with additional water
from adjacent wells and streams. In the Cajones system, US$5.0 million has
been included in project costs for additional diversion structures. In Chilatan,
water from wells and streams would be used as back-up sources if ever necessary,
with only an increase in operation and maintenance costs. Water requirements
were determined by the modified Blaney-Criddle method. The proposed cropping
patterns were analyzed, considering constraints of: (a) available water in
each system (Annex 2, Table 11) and (b) water requirements of each crop (Annex
2, Table 12). The water delivery system would supply about 1.5 1/sec/ha. The
cropping patterns showing the land cultivated by month for each system are
presented in tables in the project file (Annex 3).
3.09      Drainage works would comprise rehabilitation and deepening of
existing surface drains as well as construction of new drains. The drains
would vary from 2 to 4 meters in depth, permitting water from the heaviest
storms to be drained from the land within 48 hours, i.e., 3.0 1/sec/ha. The
main feeder roads would be 5.7 m wide and service roads, 3.4 m wide, and both
would run beside the main drains and canals. The criteria used for the
different components of the Chilatan dam, taking into account all safety
measures and meeting the Bank's requirements, are presented in Annex 1, pages 1
and 2. Detailed designs for the dam and its components are being prepared.
3.10      In accordance with Bank Guidelines (OMS 3.80), a panel of independent
experts, already in existence in Mexico, will review the final design of the
Chilatan Dam prior to tendering.  The panel consists of high level experienced
personnel in dam design and construction. Dam construction will be periodically
inspected by at least one panel member or a staff member of the Bank. The terms
of reference for the panel of experts will include making recommendations for
maintenance, inspection and safety precautions to be followed during operation of
the dam. Assurances were obtained at negotiations on these points.
3.11      The El Cajones system and Paracuaro-Cancita subsystem would obtain
their water directly from the river. Since these systems do not have storage
facilities, prudent water management would require night irrigation, and
careful water allocation to farmers during the critical months of high
consumption.
Implementation Schedule
3.12      Project implementation would commence in June 1980 and be completed
by December 1986. The initial work for Chilatan would be preparation of detailed
designs for the dam, clearing of the dam site, and building of the access road
and field camp, land leveling and land clearing, as well as construction of the
temporary tunnels and coffer dan. Action can be taken on most of these items
immediately after Board approval. The civil works for the Chilatan system,
comprising two-thirds of the required project investment, are expected to be
completed within a six-year period, while the rehabilitation of the Paracuaro



- 17 -
and El Cajones systems should be completed in about four years. Primarily for
the purpose of monitoring project progress, the implementation schedule,
presented in Annex 2, Table 13, shows the percentage of each actívity expected
to be completed annually for each system.
Cost Estimates
3.13       The proposed project is estimated to cost, based on 1979 prices,
US$408.8 míllaon for the six-year implementation period, including price and
physical contingencies. The foreign exchange component is US$160 million, or
about 39% of total project cost. The costs of imported equipment and materials
reflect international market prices, while costs of civil works have been
estimated from experience gained from similar projects now being implemented.
Physical contingencies are 15% for equipment and 15% for most civil works.
Based on past experiences, civil works contingencies for the dam were taken at
25%. Price contingencies, for local and foreign costs, are based on the
Bank's revised guidelines, startíng in 1980 at 10.5%, and 9.0% for 1981, 8.0%
for 1982, 7.0% for 1983-85 and 6% for 1986. Physical and price contingencies
are about 60% of the base cost. Import duties, taxes and other levies are not
included in project costs. The implementing agency, SARH, is exempt from
import duties. Project costs are summarized below and details are presented
in Annex 2, Tables 14 and 15.
Financing
3.14       The bank loan of US$160 mill]ion would be made to NAFINSA to finance
the estimated foreign exchange component, or about 39% of the project cost.
The Government would finance the remaining cost, amounting to US$249 million
equivalent, or 61% of the total, through standard budgetary allocation. The
Bank loan would be for a period of 17 years, including four years of grace,
with interest and commitment charges paid by the borrower.
Procurement
3.15       About 85% of the contracts for the principal irrigation and drainage
works, amounting to about US$342.5 million, would be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procure-
ment. Civil works would, insofar as possible, be grouped into contracts
having a minimum value of US$2.0 million. Small jobs (telecommunications,
buildings, houses), which, because of the timing or nature of the work, could
be better handled if not included in major contracts, would be contracted
following ordinary Government procedures. This process would also expedite
the construction of minor civil works under local competitive bidding (LCB).
The maximum value per contract would be US$0.22 million, with the total of
all such contracts not to exceed US$50 million.
3.16       Contracts for on-farm development works, about US$40.0 million,
would be procured under LCB, or through negotiations following Government
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. In the project region,
farmers frequently organize themselves into partnerships to contract for land
clearing and leveling on small tracts up to 250 ha using their own machinery.

This work provides income to the farmers, but, more importantly, it trains
them in proper leveling procedures and prepares them to maintain their fields
in good condition for irrigation in the future. SARH provides engineering
services and supervises such contracts. It is intended that large tracts of
land and part of the reclamation of new lands be included in the packages of
ICB contracts.
3.17      The estimated cost of vehicles, farm machinery, and operation and
maintenance equipment is about US$7.2 million, of which about US$5.0 million
would be subject to ICB, according to Bank Guidelines for Procurement (March
1977). For bid evaluation, a 15% margin of preference or the prevailing
custom duties, if lower, would be allowed for equipment and vehicles produced
in Mexico. About US$2.8 million worth of minor equipment not suitable for ICB
would be purchased through normal local procurement procedures. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that Government would follow procurement procedures
for ICB and LCB presented above.
Disbursements
3.18      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed, with normal documentation,
against categories presented below. A summary schedule of expenditures for the
entire project is presented in Annex 2, Table 16, while the details for the
three areas are given in Tables 17 and 18. A disbursement schedule, based on
the project commencing in the latter part of 1980, is presented in Annex 2,
Table 19. The table below sets forth the categories of items to be financed
from loan proceeds, the amounts of the loan allocated to each category and the
percentage of expenditures for items so financed in each category:

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Institutional Framework and Management
4.01      Design, construction and operation of the project would be carried
out according to well established institutional arrangements and procedures
of SARH.  Three undersecretariats are responsible for the formulation and
implementation of an irrigation project: (a) the Undersecretariat of Planning
(SP), throughout the preliminary stages up to the completíon of the feasibility
report; (b) the Undersecretariat of Hydraulic Infrastructure (SIH), during
the design and construction of the project; and (c) the Undersecretariat of
Agriculture and Operations (SAO), during the operational phase of the project.
Within each undersecretariat, specifíc responsibilities rest on General
Directorates (GD). Those relevant to the project are: in SP, the GD of
Studies and the GD of Planning; in SIH, the GD of Large-Scale Irrigation;
and, in SAO, the GD of Irrigation Districts. The above administrative struc-
ture corresponds to the national level of SARH, whose office headquarters
are in Mexico City (Annex 2, Chart 2).
4.02      SARH maintains offices in each state under the authority of the
State Representative, who is the Secretary's delegate to that state. From
a functional poínt of view, however, state offices are organized following
headquarters pattern. Thus, an Irrígation Works Section (Programa Hidraulico)
is in charge of carrying out the construction activities under the responsi-
bility of a Resident Engineer (Jefe del Programa Hidraulico), who reports to
the GD of Large-Scale Irrigation. Similarly, all activities related to
project operation are carried out by Irrigation Dístrict No. 107, whose Chief
reports to the GD of Irrigation Districts.
Project Execution
4.03      Land acquisition for the dam site and rights-of-ways for roads
and canals would be handled by the Legal Department of SARH. The erection of
the Chilatan dam requires the displacement of approximately 80 farm families,
engaged mainly in livestock raising. Government intends to resettle these
families in a similar area nearby where they can continue to raise their stock.
Resettlement plans were presented at negotiations. Indemnification for land,
destroyed crops and other associated legal compensations have been included in
project cost. To the extent possible, Government is expected to incorporate
into the new system the existing water distribution facilities of Tepalcatepec
and Paracuaro-Cancita. In addition, canal lining would be deferred when
considered appropriate by project management. The actual construction of the
dam, canals and distribution works would be done by contractors. Supervision
would be done by representatives from the Undersecretariat in Mexico City.
4.04      Technical assistance, and the operation and maintenance of the dam
as well as all other irrigation works, once completed, would be the responsi-
bility of the Chief of Cupatitzio/Tepalcatepec Irrigation District. The



- 21 -
irrigation district has three sections, namely Operations and Development,
Maintenance, and Administration Services (see Chart 3 in Annex 2). The
district also has an active Steering Committee, consisting of representatives
of all sectors of the agricultural community--ejidatarios, private farmers,
and public and private agencies. In order to achieve better coordination
with the research station's program, the farmers and extension services, it
is recommended that a senior staff member from CAEVA become a member of the
Steering Committee. The Steering Committee advises and assists the Chief
of the Irrigation District to develop the district's annual agricultural
program, which is then submitted to the General Director of Irrigation Dis-
tricts, under the Undersecretariat of Agriculture and Operations of SARH in
Mexico City, for approval. The review at this level is only to assure that
the program is within Government guidelines and policy. The Operations and
Development Section is further dívided into four uníts (see Annex 2, Chart 1)
and each unit into three groups, one for the distribution and control of
water, one for technical assistance, and the other for collection of levied
fees and water charges.
Operation and Maintenance
4.05      At the unit level, operation of the irrigation system is carried
out by the canaleros (ditch riders) and dam operation by preseros. Mainte-
nance is performed by the Maintenance Section of the district in cooperation
with each unit. Under the project, the annual operation and maintenance costs
would be US$57 per ha. Details are shown in Annex 2, Table 20. Maintenance
in the district has been poor and the major factor responsible is lack of
suitable equipment. Under the project, maintenance equipment amounting to
US$3.66 million would be purchased. The equipment list with costs is shown in
Annex 2, Table 21. Irrigation District 107's maintenance program prepared in
December 1979 would be updated annually to reflect that all existing and new
irrigation works and facilities would be properly maintained.
Technical Assistance
4.06      The extension service would be expanded and improved, studies
would be performed, staff would be trained and a PLAMEPA would be carried out.
Buildings, office equipment, vehicles, as well as supplies and equipment for
technical assistance personnel, would also be provided under the project
(see Annex 2, Table 22).
4.07      Extension service support would be expanded; six extension centers
would be established in the project area, located at Cuatro Caminos, Apatzingan,
Buenavista, Tepalcatepec, Lombardia and Paracuaro. The incremental personnel
would consist of four chiefs in charge of technical assistance in each unit,
two agronomists, six economists, 12 social workers, six sociologists, 20
agriculture and livestock agents, 52 junior agriculturalists, and 20 support
staff. The additional staff would become regular employees of SARH. The
program in each unit would be supervised, a much needed input, by the Chief
of Technical Assistance for the unit, who would report to the Chief of the
District. After the Ilth year, the number of agents per center could be phased
downward and some of the experienced agents could be transferred to other



- 22 -
districts. It is expected that by the llth year, the farmers in the project
would not require as close a degree of support as the staff level now
indicates.
4.08      A new extension program would be prepared by the District Chief
with inputs from the Steering Committee and from the Chiefs for Techncial
Assistance in each of the four units. The program would be similar to that
developed for the Rio Fuerte and Rio Sinaloa Projects. Included in the
program would be the technical packages prepared by CAEVA. These technical
packages cover use of improved seeds, land preparation, fertilization, timeli-
ness in planting and insect and disease control. Also included in the extension
program would be demonstrations in farmers' fields, which would enable research
results from CAEVA to be quickly transferred to the farmers. This system would
also establish the feedback for the researchers, which should foster the imple-
mentation of a more effective extension program. Fortunately, all technical
inputs required for the program are available in the project area through
public as well as private sources.  Sufficient credit from sources outside the
project is available (para 2.28). Because of training facilities inside and
outside the region, recruitment of trained personnel is not expected to be a
problem, but turnover of personnel could be high.
4.09      When terrain and stoniness and other soil factors such as shallow-
ness, salinity and alkalinity become limiting factors in land use, irrigated
pastures appear to be the best way to profitably utilize such land. It is
on large-scale farms that have stoney and/or relatively shallow, undulating
Class 3 soíls and Class 4 soils that pasture development would be promoted.
These farms would also raise crops on their better soils. To assist the live-
stock farmers to expand, reorganize and improve their operations, livestock
specialists would be included in the technical assistance program. These
agents would be well trained in animal husbandry (breeding, sanitation
and feeding) as well as in pasture establishment and maintenance. The major
portion of their efforts would be directed toward the development of livestock
enterprises that deal primarily with the production of cattle for milk and
meat (fattening operations). They would, however, support and assist in the
development of other livestock enterprises such as hogs and poultry, which
are part of the average farm complex.
4.10      Staff training would be undertaken by using local resources and,
when necessary, overseas expatriates and institutions. All extension agents
would be given at least six months of additional training, either by attending
training centers operated by SARH, or through visits or enrollment in special-
ized short courses. It is expected that incentives such as grade and salary
increases would follow completion of training courses.
4.11      Studies would be carried out in the region for development of future
projects. They would also cover the review, analysis and utilization of
local water resources, specifically in Unit I, as well as pertinent data
collection, hydrological investigations and examination of identified factors
in other units. The Planning DG of SARH would conduct most of this work, and
specialists from other institutions in Mexico would be consulted and used as
need arose.



- 23 -
4.12      PLAMEPA (On-Farm Improvement Plan in Irrigation Districts) would
provide farmers with a much needed service.  Teams would be formed within the
Distriet to make soil and topographical surveys at the farm level. The
program is designed to provide advice to farmers on installation, supervision
and operation of on-farm irrigation and drainage works, crop irrigation,
and land leveling. This service would assure that each farmer's irrigation
and drainage system would be operating at the level needed to obtain the
highest possible results and efficiencíes.
4.13      Funds for a credit component have not been included in the project
because of the Government-sponsored credit prograns available in the project
area (para 2.28). It is expected, however, that Government would take all
measures necessary to ensure that the beneficiaries of the project would
be provided with short-term, medium-term and long-term credit, as and when
needed, so as to be able to use the facilities in the project. Assurances
were obtained on this point at negotiations.
Accounts and Audits
4.14      SARH would maintain separate records to reflect the financial
situation of the project. Such accounts are subject to periodical internal
audits conducted by a special audit division of SARH. Government would:
(a) maintain or cause to be maintained separate accounts adequate to reflect
ín accordance with consistently maintained sound accounting practices, resources
and expenditures, in respect of the project, of the department and agencies of
the Government responsible for carrying out the project or any part thereof;
(b) annually furnish to the Bank a summary statement of such accounts; and
(c) furnish to the Bank such other pertinent information concerning such
accounts as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to time. Assurances
on the above practices were obtained at negotiations.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.15      Monitoring and evaluation of the proposed project would be an essen-
tial component during and after the development period. During the development
period, monitoring of the construction works would be done by the Chief Engineer
of the project, who would provide written reports. Progress would be based on
percentage of completion reached on each task or job (Annex 2, Table 13).
4.16      Monitoring and evaluation of operation and management would be
handled by the office of Drainage and Irrigation already established in the
Irrigation Distriet. As this office has staff at the field level in each
unit, it would be able to prepare suitable reports on its activities.
4.17      The technical assistance program would be monitored and evaluated
primarily through monthly reports prepared by the Extension Service. The
reports would be concerned with the Extension Agents, the progress of the
farmers, and the effect of the project on the environment. Staffing of the
extension program, training the agents, and receipt of supplies and equipment
would be matters of interest. For the farmers, changes in yield, cropping



- 24 -
intensity, cropping patterns, applications for credit, loan repayments, and
the spread and use of improved inputs would be valid indicators of project
impact. Also, extension agents would monitor effects of chemicals on the
fauna, flora and water in the project area. Because each unit would have
social workers, sociologists and economists, family budget data would also
be secured.
4.18      As standard operation procedures at SARH, quarterly reports will be
made on the progress of construction, operation and maintenance, agricultural
development and the technical assistance program.  These reports will be avail-
able to the Bank for review and comments. Assurances, however, were obtained
at negotiations, that, no later than one year after the final Bank loan
disbursement, a project completion report would be submitted to the Bank of
such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FARM INCOME
Cropping Patterns, Yields and Production
5.01      Cultivable area under the project would rise from 97,300 ha to
109,000 ha, an increase of 12%. At the same time, the net cropped area would
move from 94,100 to 158,400 ha, an increase of 68%. At full development,
expected in year 10, overall crop intensity would gradually increase from
about 96% to 158%. As a result of these changes, net value of production
would rise slowly during development from US$32.9 million to US$80.2 million
per annum, an increment of US$47.3 million (Annex 2, Table 23).
5.02      The cropping patterns projected for each area within the project were
planned to maximize returns, subject to the constraints of water, soil, labor,
cost and marketability of produce (Annex 2, Tables 12 and 24 to 27). Data on
total cropped area, yields and production with and without the project are
summarized in Annex 2, Table 9. The detaíls for the three areas, Tepalcatepec,
Paracuaro-Cancita and Cajones, presented by hectarage, crop, volume and cost
of production, season and year of development are in Annex 2, Tables 28 to 35,
with more details in tables available in the project file. Most of the increase
in production would be due to an expansion of cotton, grains, vegetables and
pastures. The project cropping pattern would also bring about a moderate
expansion in the area planted with oilseeds by introducing such relatively new
crops as soybeans and peanuts. The area devoted to fruits and melons would
increase only slightly, and sugarcane is expected to decline.
5.03      Yield increases play a significant part in the benefits that would
be derived from the project. Without the project, yields are expected to
increase in time. At full development, however, there would be a noticeable
difference in yields between the situation with and without the project.
Some examples are increases in cotton from 2.80 m tons/ha to 3.50 m tons/ha;



- 25 -
maize, 3.00 m tons/ha to 5.00 m tons/ha; sorghum, 4.00 m tons/ha to 6.00 m
tons/ha; vegetables, 14.50 m tons/ha to 18.00 m tons/ha; bananas, 28.00 m
tons/ha to 38.00 m tons/ha; and citrus, 12.00 m tons/ha to 14.00 m tons/ha.
In Annex 2, Table 36, the yield changes for each crop over the years of
development are presented. The differences between yields at full development,
without and with the project, are a reflection of: (a) the enlargement of the
technical assistance program (para 4.07); (b) the significant improvement in
irrigation efficiency from 30% to 60% (para 3.08), all of which would be
achieved through land leveling and the improvement of on-farm delivery systems
provided under PLAMEPA (para 4.12), through training of farmers to make
judicious use of water, and through the installation of water control devices.
The projected yields are being achieved and surpassed now by some of the
better farmers in the area.
5.04      Because of new and improved major water delivery systems, land
leveling on each farm and an expanded Extension Service program, the signif-
icant limiting factors to achieving high yields, would be removed by the project.
Farmers would be able to have the required amount of water available at the
time needed by the plants. The projected yields would be reached gradually
over a period of eight to 10 years and they are below those projected by
the highly trained and experienced agronomists, horticulturists, pathologists
and entomologists at CAEVA (para 2.27). For cotton, the new program recently
ínstituted for insect control appears to be effective. Cotton is now being
planted by farmers at specific times in large blocks, and aerial spraying is
practiced. In addition, post-harvest sanitation procedures are being encouraged.
Insecticides are to be changed periodically to prevent as much as possible the
build-up of insect resistance to any one chemical.
5.05      At full development, annual production of cotton is expected to
increase from 37,710 m tons to 70,245 m tons; maize from 49,300 m tons to
199,560 m tons; sorghum from 114,100 m tons to 245,100 m tons; vegetables from
14,442 m tons to 63,720 m tons; and citrus from 87,760 m tons to 121,450
m tons. For small livestock farms, AU/ha would move from 2.47 to 4.00 and on
the large units, from 2.00 to 3.66. Incremental production for the project
area is summarized below. Full details by area, crop and year of development
are shown in Annex 2, Tables 9 and 28 to 30.
Incremental Production at Full Development
(m tons)
Cotton           32,530        Melons and Watermelons         9,760
Oilseeds          9,630        Citrus                        33,700
Vegetables       49,280        Other Tree Fruits             21,900
Grains          327,170
5.06      Under the project, a shift is expected to take place, particularly
on the larger farms, from livestock as only a part of the general farm activi-
ties to intensive livestock production on irrigated pastures. Since these
farms will also grow grains and fruits, the crop by-products would be utilized
as supplementary feed. These enterprises would raise dual-purpose cattle for
milk and meat and also fatten purchased calves. Breeds such as pure Swiss and
Swiss Zebu crosses appear to make satisfactory gains on Bermuda grass pastures.



- 26 -
The increase in livestock production would therefore be substantial (para 5.08
and 5.09). It is anticipated that the calves for fattening would be purchased
from farms that surround the project area as well as from those within, thus
eliminating the need for the sellers to transport their animals long distances
for fattening.
Farm Modela
5.07      Changes anticipated in the livestock (cattle) operations can best
be seen in the livestock models developed for a relatively small-scale
private farm (15 ha) and for a large one (50 ha). It is expected that the
pastures would shift from predominately Star grass, because of irrigation, to
the more palatable and higher yielding Bermuda grass.
5.08      With the relatively small-scale farm, the carrying capacity (AU/ha)
would move from 2.47 to 4.00 at full development. At the same time, the herd
would increase in size from 53 to 103, with the average liveweight of steers
and cows increasing 18% and 7%, respectively. Milk production would rise
from an annual average of 12,400 liters (3 l/day/cow) to almost 47,000 litera
(6 l/day/cow), and calving rates would increase, while mortality rates would
decrease. The full impact of these changes would be to gradually increase net
income from US$3,022 to US$14,675 at full development in the llth year (Annex 2,
Table 37.)
5.09      On the large-scale farm averaging 50 ha, the AU/ha would move from
2.00 to 3.66 at full development. At the same time, the number of animals
would íncrease from 133 to 253 per farm, with the average liveweight of steers
and cows increasing 18% and 7%, respectively. Milk production would rise
from an average of 34,500 liters per annum (3 l/day/cow) to 165,000 liters
(8 l/day/cow) and calving rates would increase, while the mortality rate
would decrease. As a consequence of the above changes, the average net income
would gradually increase from US$4,635 to US$47,827 at the llth year at full
development (Annex 2, Table 37).
5.10      In order to properly reflect conditions in each of the three areas
of the project, i.e., Cajones, Paracuaro and Tepalcatepec, farm models have
been developed for each area. Because of the different cropping patterns
employed by the farmers and constraints associated with each area such as
land tenure, soil, water and stage of development, five models, corresponding
to the land tenure distribution, have been prepared for each area and are
designed to maximize income. Table 38 in Annex 2 summarizes the cash flows
for representative farms, in the three areas, without and with the project at
full development. These models are broadly grouped into small-scale (less
than 10 ha), medium-scale (10 to 20 ha) and large-scale farms (21 ha and
above). Tables with full details on all farm models are in the project file.
Small-Scale Farms
5.11      Among the small-scale farms, comprising about 61.5% of the land
holding families in the project area, there would be a major increase in
sorghum and vegetables and, to a lesser degree, in corn. There would also
be moderate íncreases in cotton and rice. Beans would also be increased in



- 27 -
Cajones and introduced in the Paracuaro-Cancita area. With the project, the
total family income, including off-farm labor, would about double at full
development (year 10), compared to the without project situation in Cajones
and TepalcateDec, and would increase by about 50% to 60% in Paracuaro. Family
income per annum is expected to range between US$4,700 and US$5,100 in the
smallest type of farms (about 22% of the families) and between US$10,700 and
US$12,200 in the next smaller type (about 39% of the families), depending on
the area. On the small-scale farms, particularly on the smallest units, famíly
members are under-employed. They secure about 10% to 28% of their total income
from off-farm activities though generally only 50% of the available off-farm
labor is employed.
Medium-Scale Farms
5.12      For the medium-scale farms, comprising about 32% of the land holding
families in the project area, there would be significant increases in corn and
sorghum and moderate increases in cotton and rice. Total famíly income with
the project, including off-farm income, is expected to range, at full develop-
ment (year 10), between US$15,800 and US$18,300. In Cajones and Tepalcatepec,
the increase is expected to about double, compared to the without project
situation, while in Paracuaro it would increase by about 65%.
Large-Scale Farms
5.13      For large-scale farm families, comprising 6.5% of the land holding
families in the project area, there would be a substantial increase in pastures,
thus making livestock raising an important enterprise. At the same time, as
a result of labor-saving efforts, the area devoted to citrus and other fruit
trees is expected to be reduced, except for bananas, which would increase,
especially on the larger farms. Oilseeds would be introduced into the cropping
pattern, and in Cajones and Tepalcatepec, cotton production is expected to
increase significantly. With the project, total family income would range
between US$37,500 and US$40,000 in the medium-large-scale farms (between
20 and 50 ha per family and comprising about 4.5% of the families) and between
US$98,000 and US$145,000 in the largest size (above 50 ha and comprising about
2% of the families). As a result of the project, the income levels in Cajones
and Paracuaro-Cancita are expected to more than double, while Tepalcatepec is
expected to gain an income increase of 80%. On the large-scale farms, family
members are fully employed but labor shortages do occur at certain seasons of
the year. Farm labor is, however, readily available in the project area.
5.14      The farm models show that the project has a significant impact on
family farm income.  However, it would take about 10 years to realize the
full potential of project development, and, at the end, the small-scale
and the small-medium-scale farms (between 2.95 and 8.35 ha), which constitute
more than 60% of the farms, would then earn an income that would range between
US$4,700 and US$12,100 per annum, compared to the GDP per family in Mexico
in 1978 of about US$5,500.



- 28 -
Cost Recovery
5.15      Rent and cost recovery analyses have been conducted for small-scale,
medium-scale and large-scale farms in Cajones, Paracuaro-Cancita and Tepalcatepec
(Annex 2, Tables 39 to 41). Considering farmers' contribution to the invest-
ment of 30% over 25 years, 1/ the cost recovery index for Cajones was found to
be 23%; for Paracuaro-Cancita, 40%; and for Tepalcatepec, 14.5%. Operation
and maintenance costs in Paracuaro-Cancita are higher than the other areas,
because of the cost of electrical energy that ís needed for pumping water from
wells. Because of the energy costs and the fact that the investment per hectare
in this area is the smallest, Paracuaro-Cancita has the highest cost recovery
index. For the very large-scale farms (over 50 ha), a cost recovery rate
based on the present stipulation would represent about 15% of the farm family
income in the Cajones area, 32% in Paracuaro-Cancita, and 26% in Tepalcatepec.
Increasing the cost recovery rate to 100% would bring the percentage to 66% of
family income in Cajones and 80% in Paracuaro-Cancíta, but exceed the family
income in Tepalcatepec. Therefore, it would appear that farms less than 5 ha
in size would pay according to the Mexican stipulation, whereas farms of
larger size in Cajones and Paracuaro-Cancita could pay the full investment
cost over 25 years, and, in Tepalcatepec, farms larger than 5 ha could pay
about 50% of the investment cost over 25 years.
5.16      The Government would recover from the beneficiaries of the proposed
project total operation and maintenance costs plus as much as possible of the
investment costs. Also, the Government intends to see that the large land
holders (50 ha or more) pay their share of the investment costs. Therefore, it
would carry out no later than December 31, 1985 a socio-economic study in the
project area to determine farmers' ability to pay. Assurances on this matter
were obtained at negotiations. This study would be started as soon as possible
so that initial levels of water charges could be established soon after delivery
of the first project waters to beneficiaries. It is also expected that the
rates would be reviewed periodically to ensure their continuing applicability
as provided by Article 71 of the Federal Water Law dated January 1972.
Marketing and Storage
5.17      Except for cotton, there would be no increase in area under the
project for export crops such as melons and watermelons, which are subject
to Government controls. There would be an increase in production of melons,
however, due to an increase in yield, but the amount could readily be absorbed
by domestic markets. The same applies to cotton production. The increase
in production of the other crops such as grains, oilseeds, and meat products
would only counterbalance growing imports of these products. Since the
movement of food products out of the region is rapid and easy, present
storage facilities are expected to be adequate to handle the anticipated
increase in production as a result of the project.
1/   This js a stipulation under which the cost recovery system in Mexico
operates.

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits and Justification
6.01      Substantial benefits would be realized by the farmers participating
in the project as well as by inhabitants of the Apatzingan Valley as a whole.
The project would increase family farm income (paras 5.08 to 5.14) and agri-
cultural production (food, fiber and meat) by expanding the cropped land from
97,300 ha to about 109,000 ha and by increasing the cropping intensity from
about a factor of 1 to about 1.5 in most areas. The project would also improve
the technical assistance delivery system, water distribution and management,
while provision for agricultural extension would lead to more intensive culti-
vation and productíon, partícularly by the small-scale farmers. In additíon,
the project would eliminate under-employment on the small-scale farms and
increase employment opportunities in the Apatzingan Valley by about 1.4 million
man-days per year at full development. There are also a number of indirect
benefits likely to accrue from the project such as the stimulation of agro-
industries that extract oil from cotton seed and soybeans, with the cake being
made available for livestock feed. With the increase in meat and milk produc-
tion, there would be a potential for local industry to become involved in
processing these products. Also, the temporary diversion tunnel that would
be constructed for the dam could be used for generating electricity at a later
date, a contribution that has not been included in the benefit stream.
Economic Rate of Return
6.02      The economic rate of return for the whole project has been estimated
at 15.5% (Annex 2, Table 42). By area, however, the economic rate of return
for Cajones was 21%, for Paracuaro-Cancita 16.0%, and for Tepalcatepec 13.5%
(Annex 2, Tables 43 to 45). The rate of return estimates are based on the
following: (a) agricultural production figures were derived from the expansion
of land and yield projections in Annex 2, Table 9; (b) economic prices for
cotton, maize, sorghum, rice, soybeans, bananas, and citrus were based on the
Bank projections, but adjusted to farmgate level, while for other products,
prevailing farmgate prices were used (Annex 2, Table 46); (c) production costs
were priced at local market prices; (d) all project works, equipment, technical
services and physical contingencies were included in investment costs; (e) the
labor component in ínvestment and cost of production was shadow priced at
70% of the financial cost; and (f) costs of production reflect a 1978 situation
adjusted to a 1979 level, or 1979 costs if such information was available.
6.03      Since the farmers in the area are well established, use modern
inputs, and are receptive to advice from extension agents, it should be
relatively easy for them to achieve output levels anticipated in the project.
Moreover, as the infrastructure and organizational bodies needed to deliver
inputs and services to the farmer are already in the area, project implemen-
tation should experience no major delays. The operation and maintenance
costs derived in the engineering section for equipment and operation and
maintenance for the various irrigation system are summarized in Annex 2,
Table 20. For replacement charges without project, capital cost per ha



- 30 -
was assumed to be Mex$5,000, depreciated over eight years. With the project
at full development, the capital cost was Mex$15,000 per hectare, also depre-
ciated over an eight-year period.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.04      The results of a sensitivity analysis to test the impact of differing
levels of costs, prices and/or revenues for the three areas, and the project
as a whole, are presented below:
Economic Rate
Return, %
Expected (best estimate)                              15.5
One year delay in benefits and operating costs    13.5
Costs increased by 10%                                14.0
Costs increased by 20%                                13.0
Benefits down by 10%                                  14.0
Costs up by 10% and benefits down by 10%              12.5
A sensitivity analysis including other factors not presented above has been
carried out for each area. These details are presented in Annex 2, Table 47.
A switching value test indicates that if total project costs increased by
about 23%, the project economic rate of return would be 12% (the opportunity
cost of capital in the country), or the benefits could decrease by 22.5% to
yield an economic rate of return equal to 12%.
Environmental Impact
6.05      The project is not expected to have any harmful effects on the
environment. By improving the drainage, particularly in the lower parts of
the Central Region, and with better water management, the area influenced by
the project should have its environment improved. While the technical assis-
tance program would be designed to increase the production of food, it is, at
the same time, through the social workers, that the way of life of the people
would be improved.
6.06      Since the applications of pesticides would increase in the project
area, all chemicals used would be restricted, to the extent possible, to those
that have low mammalian toxicity.  All extension agents would stress safety
when training farmers and others in chemical use. In addition, the extension
agents would be expected to monitor pesticide levels in soil and water, being
particularly alert to the effects of the cotton pest control program on fish,
birds, and beneficial insects, which are likely to be susceptible to pesticides
with low mammalian toxicity.
Project Risks
6.07      Because of the experience possessed by SARH with irrigation and dam
building, there are no major risks associated with the project. There are,
however, several potential problems. The past performance of the District in
maintaining its irrigation systems has not been good, but since provisions are
being made for maintenance equipment and new plans are being formulated for
conducting maintenance in the proposed project, it is believed that future



- 31 -
performance would improve significantly. In the El Cajones system, Unit I,
which does not have storage facilities, there is a danger that there would not
be enough water to expand crop production on the 30,000 ha. Thís condition
can be alleviated by (a) putting in the diversion back-up (paras 3.06 and
3.08), (b) irrigating at night to use the water available at that time, and
(c) achieving a higher irrigation efficiency. The area around Chilatan is
subject to tectonic forces, but this has been taken into account in designing
the dam. With the availability of water, there is also the danger of over-
watering, thereby creating drainage problems. Furthermore, since pumping from
the aquifer will be substantially reduced, water-logging in some locations
could become a problem. However, monitoring the wells and training the
farmers to irrigate judiciously should reduce the probability of drainage
becoming a source of concern in the project area.
VII.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would:
(a) use its established panel of independent experts to see that
dam design and construction meets Bank Dam Safety Guidelines,
construction would be periodically inspected by at least one
panel member or a Bank staff member, and that the panel would
make recommendations for maintenance, inspection, and safety
precautions to be followed during operation of the dam
(para 3.10);
(b) cause SARH to follow the procurement procedures as outlined in
paragraphs 3.15 to 3.17;
(c) continue to take such measures as shall be necessary or advisable
to ensure that the beneficiaries of the project would be provided
with such short-, medium- and long-term credit, as and when required,
to utilize adequately the facilities included in the project
(para 4.13);
(d) cause SARH to maintain separate records to reflect the financial
situation of the project in accordance with sound accounting
practices and annually send to the Bank a summary statement of
such accounts and other information as reasonably requested by
the Bank from time to time (para 4.14);
(e) ensure that a completion report on the project would be submitted
to the Bank no later than one year after the completion of Bank
loan disbursements (para 4.18); and
(f) in order to recover from beneficiaries full operation and maintenance
costs of irrigation and drainage works, plus as much as possible
of investment costs, carry out by December 31, 1985, a socio-economic
study to determine the farmers' ability to pay (para 5.16).



- 32 -
7.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to NAFINSA for US$160 million on standard
terms for Mexico.

Criteria of Chilatan Dam
Spillway
1.        The spillway discharge of 7,171 m /s is designed for a 10,000 m /s
inflow. The additional storage of the top of the da3 above the spillway
surcharge, a height of 2.32 m, provides 78 million m  of additional safety.
The spillway shute has a flip bucket at the discharge end which will throw
the water down the hill below the structure. The remainder of the spillway
is in a natural channel. Nothing is planned to be done to this channel. As
the spillway will be used each season, there will be considerable erosion
downstream from the discharge. There should be no danger to the structures,
but there will be some erodable material and plant life which will cause minor
problems downstream. The spillway cut in the rock is not deep and should
not cause serious problems.
Intake
2.        There is to be constructed an intake tower on the right bank of the
dam site, 32 m high controlled by 3four gates with a 200-m tunnel, 4.5 m in
diameter, to discharge about 65 m /s irrigjtion water. The amount of waSer for
the right bank would be approximately 20 m /s and for the left bank 45 m /s,
through Piedras Blancas diversion dam. The bottom of the entrance to the
intake is 408 m.a.s.l., which is the same as the top of the proposed silt
storage, and also the maximum drawdown level indicated in the reservoir routing
analysis. It will be necessary to lower the level of the intake about 3 meters
to obtain the required discharge through the tunnel.  The intake must be
submerged or nearly so in order for it to accommodate the required discharge.
Dam
3.        The dam was analyzed by using the values of strength and cohesion
as obtained from laboratory testing of the impervious material.  These were
developed with use of critical cirele analysis. As the project is located in
an area of high earthquake intensity and frequency, a value of 0.15 g was used
for earthquake forces. Analysis was made for both the upstream saturated
conditions and the downstream slope.
4.        The dam consists of a central core protected by filters on each
side, with rock shells both upstream and downstream.  The slopes upstream
and downstream are each two horizontal to one vertical. The factor of safety
based on the analysis is satisfactory.
5.        A central core of an earth or rock fill dam tends to heal itself
due to earthquake forces or other settlement forces.  Settlement in the
foundation should be nil. Settlement of the fill is provided for in the
design. For protection and convenience of construction, the filter material
is to be extended upwards, at a width of 4 meters miníimu  on each side to
the top of the dan.

6.         There is a large rock fill dam located near Infiernillo on the
Rio Balsas. of which the Tepalcatepec is an upstream tributary.  This site
is approximately 100 km from Chilatan, and both sites are located in an
area highly sensitive to frequency and magnitude of seismic forces.
Seismic measuring equipment has been installed at Infiernillo dam, and
measurements recorded at Infiernillo are to be checked to substantiate the
criteria used.
7.         It is suggested that, in accordance with Bank Guidelines (OMS 3.80),
a panel of experts be formed to review the final design of the Chilatan dam
prior to tendering. The panel should consist of experienced personnel in
dam design and construction, and an engineering geologist should be one
member of this panel. The construction should be periodically inspected by
one panel member or a Bank staff member.
Temporary Diversion
8.         A temporary diversion consisting of two unlined tunnels, 12 m in
diameter, and a coffer dam about 25 m high, is to be constructed.
