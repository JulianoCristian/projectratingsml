possible back-up for diverting additional\n            water from local streams; (c) construction of distribution\n            and drainage systems, rehabilitation of diversion\n            structures, and irrigation canals and drainage works,\n            construction of feeder roads and other infrastructure works\n            to service the irrigation district; (d) land clearing on\n
