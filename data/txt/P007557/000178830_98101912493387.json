(a) construction of\n            the Chilatan dam, on the Tepelcatepec river, in the western\n            part of the valley; (b) rehabilitation of the existing\n            Cupatitzio system in the eastern part of the valley, with a\n            possible back-up for diverting additional water from local\n            streams; (c) construction of distribution and drainage\n            systems, rehabilitation of diversion structures, and\n            irrigation canals and drainage works, construction of feeder\n            roads and other infrastructure works to service the\n            irrigation district; (d) land clearing on about 11,500 ha\n            and land leveling of about 74,000 ha of the project area;\n            (e) strengthening of agricultural support services\n
