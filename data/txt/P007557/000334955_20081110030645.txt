       MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRE(=TORS AND THE PRESIDENT


        Subject:            Project Completion Report on Mexico
                            Auatzinean Imeation Proiect (Ln.1858-ME)


                   Attached is the Project Completion Report on Mexico Apatzingan Irrigation Project
(Loan 1858-ME) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office, with Part II
contniuted by the Borrower.

                   Implementation of this project was slower than planned because of counterpart
funding constraints on the Borrower in the early 1980s, shortly after appraisal. The Bank and the
Borrower adapted flexlily to these conditions, separating the project into two phases in 1984, and
canceling one phase in 1987. The project closed in 1991, four and one-half years late, after four
extensions. Major construction work proceeded rapidly on those parts of the project which did go
ahead. Nevertheless, the reduced project is still incomplete. Major and minor imgation works, and
local institutional arrangements, must be put in place before significant project benefits become
evident. The Project Completion Report appears to anticipate these, but it may be premature.
Slower than p l a ~ e implementation has, however, permitted progressive technical improvements to
                          d
be made to the water control systems, making it a possible model for similar projects elsewhere. The
project contained a small resettlement component which raised no special concerns.

                   The project is considered to be satisfactory and sustainabilityis likely if the project
is completed as planned. The Project Completion Report is adequate, given the incompleteness of
the project. The project may be audited.

      This document is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Apatzingan
Irrigation Project in Mexico, for which Loan 1858-ME in the amount of USS160
million was approved on May 29, 1980.   The loan was closed on June 30, 1991,
four years behind schedule.  Only US$64.4 million of the loan wae diebursed
and the last disbureement wae on June 30, 1991; USS95.6 million was canceled
by the Borrower.

      The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division,
Country Department 11, of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and 111), and the Borrower (Part 11).

      Preparation of thim PCR wae started during a Bank supervision miasion in
June 1990, and ie based, inter a l h , on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan,
Guarantee, and Project Agreements; Supervision Reports; correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

                                    BVALUATION SUMMARY,




1.           project Ob-                 DeScri~tion[Darae* 3-01 3=07L -      .  The
objective of t h e project was t o improve irrigation i n t h e Apatzingan Valley t o
permit expansion and intensification of agriculture.             The project would
benefit some 9,800 farm families, mostly small-scale landholders (909
ejidatarios and 109 private farmers) on a t o t a l area of 109,000 hectares (ha).

2.     The project's component8 were tor

       (a)   build t h e Chilatln dam on t h e Tepalcatepec river;

       (b)   rehabilitate t h e Cajonea and Paracuaro irrigation aystems, with a
             poseible back-up for diverting additional water from local
             atteams;

       (c)   construct two main canals and the distribution and drainage
             systems f o r t h e Chilatln system; rehabilitate diversion
             structures, irrigation canals and drainage works; construct feeder
             roads and other infrastructure works t o service t h e Irrigation
             District;

       (d)   clear about 11,500 ha of land and level about 74,000 ha;

       (e)   strengthen agricultural support services (extension, reeearch and
             training); and


       ( f ) provide equipment and machinery f o r operation and maintenance.


3.           Im~lementationExaerience I ~ a r a e .5.01-5.12L.         The project had a
delayed start-up and an extended implementation period.              This waa because of
counterpart funding constraint. resulting from t h e adverse macroeconomic
environment caused by t h e 1982 economic crisis triggered by t h e o i l price
slump.   The project became effective i n December 19, 1980 and was cloeed i n
June 30, 1991, a f t e r four extensions, f i v e years l a t e r than t h e expected
implementation period of seven years (July 1980 t o June 1987).              The Government
had t o adjust t h e timing and acope of its investment program and project
implementation.     I n 1984 t h e project was amended and separated i n t o two phaaes
under t h e Government's stabilization program, which was i n i t i a t e d i n 1982.
Phase I, which included works and a c t i v i t i e s i n t h e ChilatAn aystem (with t h e
Chilatan dam a s t h e main objective of implementation), was t o be completed by
December 31, 1988.     It was t o be financed under the project through Loan 1858-
ME.  Phase 11, which included t h e Cajones and Paracuaro systems, t o t a l l y
independent of t h e Chilatan system, was t o be completed by December 31, 1994,
without financing from Loan 1858-ME.        By loan closing (June 30, 1991), Phase I
was partly completed: t h e Chilatan dam was completed, t h e r i g h t bank main

canal wae 42% completed, and the left bank main canal 16% completed.  A eecond
amendment to the project on Auguet 18, 1987 eliminated Phaee 11.  The loan
aamunt had been reduced from USS160 million to USS64.4 million after loan
cancellatione in 1987 and 1988, totalling USS95.6 million reflecting the two
amendments in the project ecope.  The total project coat of the Chilatan
eyetem ae of September 1991 wae USS145.33 million, only 23.5% of the
appraieal'a coat estimate of USS407 million.  This wae mainly due to the
radical reduction in the project's ecope.  Phaee I continues to be implemented
by the National Water Commieaion (CNA). If the current accelerated rate of
progreae continues, Phaee I will be completed in 1995.  An additional
inveetment of eome USS150 million will be required which would be eligible
for financing under the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project (IDSP), Loan
3419-ME, approved in December 5, 1992.

4.          The overriding cauee of slow project implementation wae inadequate
budget allocation.  Secondary factors were delays in completing final deeigne
and extended contracting procedures.  The implementation capacity of the
executing agency, initially the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic
Reeourcee (SARH) and later CNA, would have been adequate if eufficient
financial reeourcee had been available at the right time.

5.          Implementation of the exteneion program for famere in the project
area wae affected by a elow etart-up and a major reorganization of SARH, which
altered the reeponeibilitiee for technical aeeietance and impoeed restrictions
on hiring pereonnel.  Deepite theee limitatione, a relatively eucceeeful
program was eetabliehed, with the Dietrict of Rural Development being
reeponeible primarily for agronomically related aeeietance and CNA for water
uee and management.  Since 1990 a national policy has emerged baaed on a
gradual transfer of technical aeeietance from the public to the private
eector.  By late 1991 private technical aeaiatance was initiated in the
project area through the packing houeee and the agroinduatrial eector.

6.          Implementation of the original on-farm development program of land
clearing, land levelling or smoothing, and deetoning wae eignificantly cut
back (28%) due to a reduction in the ecope of the project.  An evolving
cropping pattern dominated by orchards, unforeeen at appraisal, has also
reduced the need for thie type of work.  Final figures for land clearing and
destoning wae cut to 28% and the other iteme were eliminated.

7.          Peeulte (~arae.6.01-6.06L.   The main phyeical achievement wae the
completion of the Chilatan dam, which will be capable of irrigating 66,000 ha
when the Chilatan eyetem ie completed in 1995.  By loan closing in mid-1991,
the etorage dam wae 100% completed, the right bank main canal 42%, the left
bank main canal 16%, and the dietribution worke 11%.  Portions of the Cajonee
and Paracuaro-Cancita irrigation eyeteme (Phaee 11) were rehabilitated. Along
with the Chilatan system, they will eneure reliable eources of water for about
82,000 ha when the project ie completed.  By the end of 1992 eome 34,000 ha
will have benefitted from the project.

8.          The cropping pattern ie divereified to high value crope and well
adjusted to market demande.  There ham been rapid expansion in fruit and
citrus fanning, moetly mango and lime, though appraisal projected increaeee in
cotton, graine, vegetablee, and paeturee and eome smaller increaeee in
eoybeane, and peanute.  The latter two crope and cotton are abeent from the
cropping pattern.  Thie new cropping pattern will benefit farmere' income and

project euetainability.  Full agriculture development ie now expected in the
year 2000--a lag of ten years compared to appraisal.

9.          The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Cupatizio-Tepalcatepec
(Chilatan System) Project was calculated with Bank assistance by consultants
for CNA at about 15.9%, higher than the 13.5% ERR expected in the SAR for the
Tepalcatepec area.  This result is consistent with the new cropping pattern of
high value crope.  The estimate was made in a new feasibility etudy undertaken
during 1990-1991 as part of the preparation for the IDSP Project.

10.         Sustainabilitv taaras. 7.01-7.04).  The project ie expected to
be eustainable as a result of:  (a) an increasing emphasis on high-valued
tropical fruits and vegetables, (b) the value-added and employment
opportunities.in the packing industry, (c) the potential for industrialization
of produce within the Apatzingan Valley, and (d) diversification into table
grapes, tropical fruits, and seed production.

11.         pindinas and Lessons Learned (paras. 13.01-13.07L.  The project
was negatively affected by an unfavorable macroeconomic environment,
inetitutional instability, and severe funding constraints. This finding
confirms the importance of a sound macroeconomic and institutional context as
a condition for successful project implementation. Despite the macroeconomic
problems, the project demonstrates what can be achieved if Borrower and Bank
are flexible in revising a project's original scope.  The main achievements
were the completion of a major etorage dam (Chilath), the advanced stage of
construction of the left and right irrigation systems and entrepreneurial
development of high value cropping systems.

      (a)   Apatzingan is a typical multipurpose water project that includes
            irrigation as a major objective but brings significant benefits in
            power generation, flood control, and municipal water supply.
            These benefits were not taken into account in the SAR.  It had
            been decided that the power plant would be included later to
            maximize benefits from the water in the Chilatgn reservoir.
            Agricultural and non-agricultural activities are complementary and
            ehould therefore always be considered at the planning phase,
            particularly when heavy investments such as dams are at stake.
            These benefits were not considered ex-ante due to the lack of
            completed multipurpose studies during preparation.

      (b)   The project exemplified small implementation problems caused by
            tardy completion of designs for major civil works in the main
            canal system, which, in this case, were not ready at the time of
            project effectiveness.  The acceptance of thie delay contributed
            for a tardy implementation of the left main canal.

      (c)   A significant lesson learned from implementation concerns the
            coat-effectiveneee and timely conetruction obtained by CNA by
            1990-91 in awarding largo contract8 for civil worke am opporred to
            numeroue emall onee.  The small contract bias wae the eetablished
            practice of SARH in moat of it8 hydraulic infraetructure projecte.
            Thie wae achieved through etrong Bank persuaeion especially during
            1989-1990.


      (d)  A good lesson for other eimilar irrigation eyetems ie to adopt new
           water-control technology (hydraulic automatic structures and

      telemetric controls).               This technology was introduced i n t h e r i g h t
      bank main canal and its d i s t r i b u t i o n eyetem and wae an excellent
      example of t h e way i n which modern technology can be applied t o
      t h e new Mexican systems.              The f i n a l construction f i g u r e s
      demonstrated t h a t t h e additional coets w e r e negligible compared t o
      t h e b e n e f i t s from efficiency and f l e x i b i l i t y of t h e operation, and
      from water savings.

(e)   The s i g n i f i c a n t growth of t h e processing s e c t o r i n t h e p r o j e c t
      area, d i r e c t l y r e l a t e d t o a g r i c u l t u r a l production (packing
      f a c i l i t i e e and o i l extraction p l a n t s ) , i n d i c a t e s t h a t s u b s t a n t i a l
      secondary b e n e f i t s can occur from i r r i g a t i o n projects.


( f ) A f u r t h e r lesson hae been t h e d i f f i c u l t y of a n t i c i p a t i n g changes
      i n t h e cropping pattern.            The appraisal r e p o r t (based on t h e
      temperate climate and on r e s u l t s obtained from other p r o j e c t s )
      projected production increases i n cotton, graine, vegetables, and
      pastures, and some increases i n soybeans and peanuts, but t h e
      l a t t e r two crops and cotton a r e completely absent from t h e
      cropping p a t t e r n mostly because t h e s e a r e not a s p r o f i t a b l e and/or
      marketable a s f r u i t s and vegetables.                     The most rapid expansion has
      been of c i t r u s and other f r u i t , mostly mango and lime, and t h e
      o v e r a l l p a t t e r n is now w e l l d i v e r s i f i e d and adjusted t o market
      demands.          The Mexican I r r i g a t i o n Projecte c l o s e r t o t h e t r o p i c a l
      area could be oriented t o higher-value cropping patterns.

(g)   Another lesson r e l a t e s t o a g r i c u l t u r a l extension.           Experience
      highlight6 t h e d i f f i c u l t y of etrengthening an extension agency i n
      a project area when t h e agency is subject t o i n s t i t u t i o n a l and
      administrative norms and t o r e s t r i c t i o n s imposed a t t h e national
      level.         Attempte f o r shortcomings have a b e t t e r chance of success
      through a nationally focused project, a s i n t h e case of t h e

                                                2.      Proiect Backsround

2.01                  Mexico's a g r i c u l t u r a l s e c t o r contributes about 8% t o GDP, employs
about 25% of t h e labor force, and provides some 26% of non-oil exports.                                           Only
about 18%of t h e t o t a l land is cultivable.                                An estimated 21 million hectares
(ha) a r e cropped, about 6 million ha under i r r i g a t i o n .                            During 1950-1965,
a g r i c u l t u r a l GDP growth averaged 4.3% a year, w e l l ahead of population growth,
but it s t a r t e d t o decline i n t h e l a t e 1960s.                        This decline was i n response t o
t h e higher c o s t of bringing marginal land i n t o production, a slow-down i n t h e
expansion of i r r i g a t e d areas, excessive water use and inadequate drainage on
many i r r i g a t e d lands.         These f a c t o r s r e s u l t e d i n s a l i n i z a t i o n and reduction of
cropped areas and yields.                     Agricultural GDP growth f e l l t o an average of 2.4%
during 1965-80, below t h e r a t e of population growth.                                From being food s e l f -
s u f f i c i e n t and an a g r i c u l t u r a l exporter before 1970, Mexico became a major
importer of b a s i c foodstuffs by t h e end of t h e decade.

2.02                  To r e s t o r e a g r i c u l t u r e ' s performance and ensure food security, t h e
Government introduced some important policy measures and took decisive s t e p s
t o revive t h e i r r i g a t i o n subsector.                   A federal water law was enacted i n 1972
and a nationwide i n s t i t u t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e established under t h e Ministry of
Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) t o control, manage, and coordinate
t h e use of t h e country's water resources.                                A number of i r r i g a t i o n projects,
some of which w e r e supported by t h e World Bank, w e r e launched during t h e 1970s
t o r e h a b i l i t a t e and expand t h e subsector.                      During t h e f i n a l years of p r o j e c t
implementation ( l a t e 1980s and e a r l y 1990s) t h e a g r i c u l t u r a l p o l i c i e s s h i f t e d
toward t h e elimination of subsidies, i n l i n e with agreements made under Bank-
financed AGSAL I and I1 projects.                              This has r e s u l t e d over t h e p a s t t h r e e
years, i n a more competitive a g r i c u l t u r a l sector.

2.03        The Apatzingan Irrigation Project implemented this development
strategy by:  (a) eupporting rehabilitation of previously inefficient
irrigation systems, (b) bringing new lande under irrigation, (c) etrengthening
technical assietance to farmers, (d) contributing to increaeed crop and
livestock production, and (e) increaeing employment opportunitiee.

2.04        The project ie located in the froet-free Apatzingan Valley.
Though it was noted for ite fruit and vegetablee, the valley had been unable
to realize its potential because of a lack of reliable water sourcee for year-
round irrigation.  Annual rainfall average8 685 mm, 90% falling between June
and October.  Irrigation usee a variety of unconnected water eourcee,
including from springe, streams, river divereione, tube welle, and a small
dam.  Land reform was carried out in the project area in the 19300.   The
project area was occupied by 9,800 farm familiee.  Approximately 75% of the
land is held by "ejidatarioe," A/ who make up 90% of the land holdere, while
the other 25% is owned by private farmere.  The lande to be irrigated are
already part of the land owned by "ejidoe" and private farmere.


                    3.  Project Obiectivee and DeecriDtioq

3.01        The purpose of the project, to be carried out in the Apatzingan
Valley in the Cupatizio-Tepalcatepec Irrigation Dietrict in the central part
of the State of MichoacAn, wae to provide irrigation facilitiee and agronomic
technical assistance for approximately 40,000 hectares in the Cajones and
Paracuaro irrigation eyetems, and 69,000 hectaree in the ChilatAn irrigation
system.  The project wae approved by the Board in May 29, 1980 for a total of
USS408.8 million, of which the Bank would finance USS160.0 million and the
Government USS248.8 million.

3.02        The project wae to provide for the conetruction of the Chilatan
Irrigation System (Phaee I),a/ Rehabilitation of the Paracuaro and Cajonee
Irrigation Syeteme (Phase 11),a/ and other activitiee related to acquieitione,
extension, and studiee.

3.03        ChilatAn Irrioation Svetem (Phaee I).  The main work was
construction of a rock-filled clay core dam on the Tepalcatepec river, about
103 meters high and with a otorage capacity of 600 million cubic metere (of
which no more than 350 million cubic metere would be live etorage).  The dam
was to yield approximately 1,000 million cubic metere each year and to provide
sufficient water to irrigate about 66,000 ha.  Other worke were:

      (a)   construction of



f/    Eiidatari~ -      emall farmer, member of an w,entitled      to use a

equivalent, of which 80.1% (USS325.8 million) wae for the Chilatan Syetem and
19.9% (USS81.2 million) for the Paracuaro and Cajonee Syeteme.  (For more
detaile eee Table 4-D).

                     4.  Proiect Deeian and Oraanization

4.01        The project concept eucceeefully addreeeed the major conetraint to
irrigation in the Apatzingan Valley.  The farmere in the project area were
well eetabliehed and organized and benefitted from reaeonably good marketing
facilities.  Nevertheleee, only 62,000 ha of a total command area of 96,000 ha
could be fully irrigated throughout the year, and the balance of 13,000 ha in
the project area had never been irrigated.  Overall efficiency of the eyetem
wae eetimated at only 30% due to a lack of:  (a) control etructuree and
meaeurement devicee, (b) maintenance of conveyance and dietribution eyetems,
(c) land levelling, (d) water etorage facilitiee, and (e) night irrigation.

4.02        After analyzing different project deeign alternativee, the project
consultante together with the Bank and SARH coneidered the beet eolution to
providing adequate water to the valley'e irrigable land to be the improvement
and rehabilitation of the exieting eyeteme in one part of the project area
(Cajonee and Paracuaro) and the erection of a dam on the Tepalcatepec river at
Chilatan, combined with the conetruction of two main canale in the remaining
area (ChilatSn system).  Ae a complement to the civil worke, agricultural
support services were to be inteneified through expaneion of the exteneion
service, cloeer collaboration with the local agricultural experiment etation,
and on-farm improvemente through a program called PLAMEPA (On-farm Improvement
Plan in Irrigated Dietricte or "Plan de Mejoramiento Parcelarion).  The only
environmental ieeue envieaged at project appraieal wae the involuntary
reeettlement for the reeidente in the area of the future lake to be formed by
the Chilatan Dam (eee end para. 5.05).

4.03        Deeign, conetruction, and operation of the project were carried
out according to well eetabliehed institutional arrangement6 and proceduree

first by SARH and then by CNA (1989-1991) when the hydraulic infrastructure
branch of SARH was incorporated into the CNA in early 1989.  The project was
satisfactorily prepared initially by SARH and a Mexican consulting firm.  The
responsibilities of the various project entities were clearly defined.
Initially, the irrigation district was responsible for all aspects of
technical assistance to farmers.  In 1985, this activity, along with operation
and maintenance, passed to the newly formed Rural Development Districts which
were based on municipal boundaries.  When the CNA was formed, the irrigation
districts were reestablished to handle operation and maintenance and to
provide technical assistance to farmers in water use and management.
Agronomic technical assistance remained with the Rural Development Districts,
but the quality was considered inferior to the extension provided by the
Irrigation District.  The present trend in Irrigation Districts is that
agronomic technical assistance will be provided by private agents.

4.04        The scope and scale of the project were appropriate.  Project
preparation could have been more thorough in the final designs for civil
works.  This was particularly the case with the design of the Chilatan dam,
which started after project implementation and was finally completed by
consultants at the end of 1982.  The studies and designs for power and
municipal water supply projects were not completed by the time of project
preparation.  A small modification in the dam design was introduced later in
1987 to provide an additional penstock for power generation.  Designs for the
two main canals should have been more advanced at the project preparation
stage.  They were completed only by late 1989.

4.05        The strongest element in project organization and management was
construction and the weakest was agronomic technical assistance for the
project farmers.  This is characteristic of hydraulic infrastructure projects
in CNA's portfolio, including those financed by the Bank.  There has been a
tradition of expertise in the management of construction projects, but support
for public sector extension to farmers has varied over the past decade.
Despite project specific efforts, public extension has generally suffered from
a lack of resources, inadequately trained technicians, and high personnel
turnover.  These shortcomings are now being addressed in the Agricultural
Extension Project (Loan 2859-ME) approved in June 25, 1989 and in the
Agricultural Technology Project (Loan 3465-ME) approved in May 4, 1992.




5.01        The most critical discrepancies between planned and actual project
implementation were in the completion date and project scope.  Appraisal
estimated December 31, 1986 as the completion date.  Amendments to the legal
documents on January 14, 1985 separated the project into two phases.  Phase I,
which included works and activities in the Chilatan Irrigation system, with
financing from the loan, wae to be completed by December 31, 1988.  This was
partly completed by June 30, 1991, the final completion and closing dates.
Phase 11, which included the Cajones and Paracuaro systems, was to be
completed by December 31, 1994, without financing from the loan.  A second
amendment on August 18, 1987 eliminated Phase I1 and canceled USS90.0 million
from the loan amount. An additional USS5.6 million was canceled in 1988.   Due
to budget constraints Phase I could not be completed in 1988 and it is now
scheduled to be completed by late 1995.  These were considered by the
Government and the Bank the right decisions to face the budget constraints,
delays and priorities in the CNA portfolio of investments.  Phase I of the

project continuee to be implemented by CNA, and if the current rate of
progreee continuee, it will be completed in 1995.  (It ie financed partly
(50%) by the Bank under the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project (IDSP),
Loan 3419-ME) on one of the priority eubprojecte to be initiated in the firet
implementation year.al  Total project coat ae of September 1991 wae
USS145.33 million, 23.5% of the appraieal eetimate of USS407 million.  Thie
was mainly due to the reduction in the ecope of the project (Table 4A) and
extent of completion in part of the right and left bank canale of the Chilatan
Syetem.  To complete the project (Chilatan Syetem) an additional investment of
eome USS15O million ie required.  The original SAR eetimate for the Chilatan
Irrigation Syetem wae USS325.8 million (gee Table 4-D), very close to the
actual figuree.
5.02        The overriding cauee of elow project implementation wae inadequate
budget allocation.  Secondary factore were delaye in completing final deeigne
and extended contracting procedures.  Even without theee latter two
difficultiee, the lack of funding would etill have been a problem.
Implementation capacity of the executing agency wae adequate, provided
eufficient financial reeourcee that had been available at the right time.

5.03        The reduction in project ecope reeulted from the Government'e
etabilization program intended to addreee the underlying ieeuee of financial
crieie of 1982.  The project had been prepared and appraieed when the economic
climate wae much more favorable and when it wae anticipated that oil earninge
would relax the financial conetrainte on growth.  Bank mieeione during 1982,
recognized the elow progreee in project implementation.  They euggeeted
concentrating only on rehabilitation worke and postponing conetruction of the
dam and part of the Chilatan eyetem to a later etage.  The Government
conducted ite own in-depth analyeie and decided not to change the order of
implementation.  It began conetruction of the dam (in mid-1983) in the firet
phaee, including plane to concentrate on worke related to the damfe command
area in the Chilath eyetem.   The eecond phaee wae to cover rehabilitation of
existing echemee (Paracuaro-Cajonee).  The Bank, in turn, conducted an
independent evaluation of both alternative6 in mid-1984 and found the
Government'e propoeal (reasonable and) acceptable.  Given the advanced etage
of work, it became the moat economic alternative (ERR of 13.4% for the firet
phaee and 13.5% for the entire project).  The legal document6 were amended
accordingly on January 14, 1985.

5.04        Lack of counterpart funding after the 1985 amendment continued to
be the major conetraint to project implementation.  Counterpart funding during
the yeare of 1988 and 1989 wae extremely difficult to obtain due to eevere
reductions in public eector inveetment under the "Economic Solidarity Pact".
Periodically, there were injection6 of funde to eupplement the original budget
allocatione to keep the project progreeeing at a minimum acceptable pace.  The
cloeing date wae extended on four occaeione: two for one year each (June 30,
1988 and June 30, 1989), one for one year and a half (December 31, 1990) and
the laet one for eix monthe (June 30,1991), at which time the final loan
amount of USS64.4 wae fully diebureed.

5.05                   Ae t h e p r o j e c t wae being reformulated ( i n 1984) t h e Bank became

report on t h e dam design had not been elaborated and furnished t o t h e Bank
before bidding invitatione, (b) bidding and contractual decieione concerning
t h e dam had been taken without Bank approval, and (c) an unexpected l a y e r of
reeidual material (rock) more permeable than expected wae found i n t h e l e f t

with i t 8 procurement requirement8 i n t h e Chilatdn Dam by Mexican a u t h o r i t i e s ,
any complaints of mie-procurement should focus on substantive grounds, not
only on procedural ones.                         On t h i e basie and upon f u r t h e r analysie, t h e Bank
approved t h e contract f o r t h e dam with t h e understanding t h a t t h e Bank would

compatible with t h e new cropping p a t t e r n of t h e project.                                  It is expected that

given p r i o r i t y t o construction over maintenance.                              Reeponeibility f o r

1990 the farmere agreed to a fee of Mex$8,500 per hectare, and in 1991 it roee
to Mex$30,000 per hectare.  The dietrictVm target under the IDSP project ie to
reach eelf-eufficiency in 1994.  CNA'e local administration expects to reach
it earlier by late-1992.  The ultimate goal ie to tranufer operation and
maintenance function8 to the water ueere organizatione.

5.08        Agricultural exteneion activitiee were to begin with a revised and
expanded program immediately after loan effectivenees (December 19, 1980),
under the direction of the irrigation district.  The program wae expected to
produce benefite before the dam and other infrastructure were completed.
Before 1983, little progreee had been made in terme of exteneion programe,
deepite the repeated concern of eupervieion mieeione.    Then, in 1983, the
program began to advance. Leaderehip, organization, etaffing and programming
began to improve, and the agriculture experiment etation played a eupporting
role.  A manager of exteneion wae appointed by SARH to the Irrigation
Dietrict, and the Irrigation Dietrict was divided into five unite, each with a
chief and aeeietante plue field extension agente.  Unfortunately, eince 1984
the Government hae impoeed eevere reetrictione on hiring.    Today the exteneion
program, which eince 1985 hae been run by SARH'e Rural Development District,
has eettled at 22 univereity-graduate-level epecialiete plue 50
technical-level exteneion etaff, about half the number anticipated at
appraieal.  Thie diecrepancy may not be eerious ae it eeeme becauee of the
trend among producere and their aeeociationr towards contracting with
coneulting firme for exteneion eervicee or hiring their own epecialiete rather
than relying on the public sector.  Capable coneulting firme are beginning to
meet the demand.  Thie ie a good eolution for the farmere that can afford
private exteneion.

5.09        The extension program formerly concentrated on agronomy, through
field vieite and training.  At appraieal it wae envieaged that very limited
aeeietance would be offered to farmere in irrigation and drainage.    CNA has
pureued a policy of encouraging the producere themeelvee to contract
epecialized firme for help with on-farm irrigation and drainage plane and
eyetems.  Only a limited service ie provided by CNA.   Thie approach ie good
and it ie gradually gaining acceptance.

5.10        The original on-farm development program of land clearing, land
levelling or emoothing, and deetoning hae been only partly implemented.    The
main contributing factore have been (a) a reduction in project eize,
(b) delaye in completing the major conveyance and distribution worke for
bringing water to the farme, and (c) the positive adoption of a high-value
cropping pattern dominated by orcharde, which wae unforeeen by appraieal,
under which the need for theee on-farm worke ie being reduced.

5.11        A eocio-economic study to determine the capacity of the project's
beneficiariee to pay for operation and maintenance ( O M ) wae submitted in
September 1986, about nine monthe late.  Its relevance hae been reduced by the
delay in completing the project.  The main finding wae the confirmation of
farmere' capacity to pay the O W coete.  Other mtudiee concerning the further
development of hydraulic works in the Cupatizio-Tepalcatepec river baein were
the topographical eurveye and the deeignm of the left and right bank eyeteme,
including its modernization (mentioned in para. 5.06).    The overall evaluation
of the etudiee and deeigne ie eatiefactory.

5.12               Becauee of t h e experience of SARH and CNA i n i r r i g a t i o n and dam
conetruction, t h e appraisal correctly concluded t h a t t h e r e w e r e no major riske
associated with t h e project.          However, nobody could have anticipated t h e
severe financial constraints due t o t h e eharp deterioration of Mexico's
macroeconomic situation t h a t affected project implementation.                     The encouraging
sign is t h a t conetruction of t h e right bank main canal has greatly accelerated
i n 1991.        Four major contractors a r e a t work.       Construction w i l l commence on
t h e l e f t bank main canal i n 1992, and t h e Chilatln i r r i g a t i o n system is
expected t o be completed i n 1995 under t h e IDSP.

                                       6.  Proiect Reeults

6.01                The principal phyeical achievement of t h e project has been the
construction of t h e Chilatln dam, which i e f i l l e d t o capacity and w i l l be
capable of i r r i g a t i n g 66,000 ha when t h e right and l e f t bank main canals and
t h e distribution systeme a r e completed i n 1995.             By loan closing i n mid-1991,
t h e r i g h t bank main canal was 42% completed, t h e l e f t bank main canal 169, and
t h e distribution system 11%. Construction is continuing a t an accelerated
pace with financing from t h e IDSP.           About 14,000 ha w e r e rehabilitated i n t h e
major Cajones-Paracuaro system before project revision i n 1985.                       Appraisal
envisioned t h a t t h e project would i r r i g a t e about 109,000 ha.            A s revised, t h e
project w i l l eneure r e l i a b l e eources of water for a t o t a l of about 82,000 ha
of i r r i g a t e d cropped land when it is completed.          By t h e end of 1992, some
34,000 ha w i l l have benefitted from t h e project's works.                 Obviously, t h e f u l l
e f f e c t of t h e project'e investments w i l l accrue only a f t e r completion of t h e
e n t i r e Chilatan system ( r i g h t and l e f t banks).

6.02               The most significant impact of t h e project on agricultural
production has been on t h e cropping pattern.              A t appraisal, it was projected
t h a t most of t h e increase i n production would be from cotton, grains,
vegetables, and pasturee and t h a t some increases would come from soybeans and
peanute ( r e l a t i v e l y low-value crops).     In fact, t h e increaees i n production
output and value have come from a rapid expansion of c i t r u s and other f r u i t e ,
mostly mango and l i m e .        The area under grain (maize, eorghum, r i c e ) increaeed
by an average of s l i g h t l y over 3% f o r t h e f i r s t f i v e years (1987-1991),
compared t o t h e average f o r t h e preceding f i v e years, whereas t h e area planted
with mango and l i m e increased 76% and melon and vegetables increaeed 18%
(Table 5B).         The aforementioned crops constitute approximately 75% of t h e
cropping pattern, t h e remainder spread among beans, pasture, forage and broom
eorghum, eesame, papaya, and banana.               Cotton, soybean and peanuts are abeent.
The divereified cropping pattern is apparently adjusting t o market demands.

6.03               Agricultural production of staple grains has been below appraisal
eetimatee, which w e r e based on completion of a larger project by t h e end of
1986 and t h e attainment of f u l l agricultural development by 1990.                    Full
agricultural development is now expected i n 2000--a                  l a g of t e n yeare.   To
date, average f i e l d crop yields have been below appraieal expectation8 and
w e l l below t h e potential of t h e area.       For example, both maize and eorghum
yields a r e about 1 ton per hectare l e e s than t h e yields obtained regularly by
t h e b e t t e r farmers i n t h e area (3 tons per hectare f o r maize and 4 tone per
hectare f o r sorghum).         The local experiment s t a t i o n obtains 7 tons per hectare
i n maize t r i a l s with farmere.     The appraisal tended t o overestimate f i e l d crop
yielde and t h e epeed a t which output would increase, which i e why it made
overly optimietic production projections.               For example, i n t h e e a r l y project
years, incremental production was expected t o come immediately and exclusively

from a etrengthened exteneion program.   Thie wae unrealietic given the poor
exteneion service and the absence of support from the experiment etation at
project start-up, coupled with the length of'time it normally takee to
eetablieh an effective exteneion program.

6.04        There are two dietinct planting periods in the froet-free valley:
fall-winter and spring-summer.  With a reliable eource of water, it wae
considered poeeible at appraisal to plant a second crop in spring-ewer on
the eame fields that were planted in the previoue fall-winter.   To date,
double cropping hae been insignificant, although it ie projected to build up
to about 10,000 ha of maize and sorghum in 1996 ae conetruction of the right
bank distribution eyetem ie completed.

6.05        The project ie not far enough along to permit an ex-poet ERR.
Completion of the Cupatizio-Tepalcatepec project (right bank and left bank) ie
continuing ae part of the IDSP.  The project ie expected to be complete by
late 1992 (for the right bank) and by late 1995 (for the left bank).   The ERR
of 15.9% wae aeeeeeed again by coneultante,%/ with Bank aeeietance, under a
new feasibility etudy financed by the Bank and produced in 1990-1991 ae part
of the preparation of the IDSP project.

6.06        While power generation benefits were not anticipated in the SAR
nor in the original deeign of the dam due to the lack of complete etudiee and
designs at appraisal time, later in 1990, CNA and CFE (Comieibn Federal de
Electricidad) made a etudy while the dam wae being built and agreed to modify
the project slightly to provide a penstock for a future power houee.
Adaptations in the deeign were made accordingly.  The cost of the adaptation
wae incorporated into the dam coete.   CFE now hae a schedule to implement the
small power generation facility that will operate in coordination with
irrigation demands.  The power plant will have two Francie turbines of 14
megawatts each and ie expected to generate 121 million kilowatt houre per
year.  At the time of PCR preparation, the power project coete were not
available to the Bank but a range of USS10 million to USS12 million ie likely.
The value of annual power generation (about 120 million kilowatt houre)
estimated by the marginal value of electricity (US$60/1000 per kilowatt houre)
which ie about USS13 million/year.  In mid-1992 CFE put out the conetruction
of the power facility to tender ae a "turn-key" project eyetem, expected to be
completed by late 1993.  (For more technical details, eee Part 111, Table 5C).

                          7.  Pro1ect Sustainability

7.01        The outlook for the project'e viability ie good.  one of the main
reaeone for optimiem ie the increaeing emphaeis by producere on high-value
fruit and vegetablee, combined with increased value-added and employment
opportunitiee in the produce-grading and packing induetry.  There are about 50
emall and medium-eize packing houeee for fruit and vegetables, two big oil
extraction plante proceeeing limee, and 12 packing plante for mangoe.  Theee
plante utilize production that comee primarily from the project area.  Limee
are harveeted almost year round, and mangoe for about four months.  The
valley, with it8 divereified cropping pattern, ha8 a dietinct advantage over
many other irrigation districts, which grow mainly graine and will probably

need to switch from grain production to other crops in anticipation of
effects future competition of grains will have in a free market with USA and
Canada.

7.02        Besides the expansion of existing agricultural and related
activities, there are new opportunities for the future. One example is fruit
and vegetable processing.  At present, industrialization consists only of
grading and packing fruit.  Apart from oil-extraction plants for limes, there
is one plant in the valley for pulping limes.  The pulp is shipped outside the
region for the extraction of pectin and the juice is discarded as waste.  With
a steady production of fruit, such as limes and mangos, opportunities exist
for a fully integrated industry within the Valley of Apatzingan.

7.03        Maintenance of the irrigation eystem is a concern because
inadequate maintenance could affect the availability of irrigation water.  The
public eector hae generally performed thie taek poorly in the past.  The
current policy of CNA eupported by the on-going IDSP project is to transfer
this function gradually to the water ueers.  Already there are eome 22
Irrigation District6 (two thirds of the total area in Irrigation Districts) in
the country that are traneferring irrigation operation and maintenance to the
users organizations.  Considering the high level of organization and
progressive nature of farmers in the project area, a similar transfer of
responsibility should take place in the near future.  In the meantime, CNA's
irrigation district has strengthened its efforte to maintain project
infrastructure.  There has been a great improvement in the collection of water
fees since 1991 and the District is now 72% self-sufficient for operation and
maintenance.  In 1988 this figure was only 7%.

7.04        The Apatzingan Agriculture Experiment Station ie conducting
research on alternative crops in addition to working on crops already being
grown.  Possible alternatives include table grapes, tropical fruits,
sunflowers, and soybeans.  For table grapes and tropical fruite, which can be
produced in the winter off-season, work is centered on variety testing.  For
sunflowere, new varietiee for irrigated condition6 are being inveetigated. A
technical package already existe for soybeane, but the abeence of an oil-
extraction plant impedes its development. Climatic conditions favor the
production of seede for many graeses and legumes, most of which are still
imported.

7.05        Technical aseietance for the development of orchard6 has been
provided mostly through the private sector, in particular by the packing
houses for the mango and lime industries.

                             8.  Bank Performance

8.01        One strength of the Bank's performance was its conetructive
reaction to the financial constraint6 that elowed project implementation.
This was manifeeted by the Bank's:  (a) continuing support for the project in
spite of substantial delaye, (b) increasing diebureement percentage8 on
several occaeions, and (c) granting extension6 to the closing date.

8.02        The Bank's input in project preparation was minimal becauee the
project was reasonably well prepared by SARH and a local consultant firm.
Appraisal was appropriately staffed for the task and included an engineer, an
agriculturalist, and an economiet.  The appraisal task was carried out in a

profeeeional manner--the major reservation being overly optimietic projections
of agricultural development, as explained in paragraph 6.03 above.  Power
generation and water eupply were not considered at appraisal time due to the
lack of etudiee and deeigne.

8.03        Supervieion missions were adequately staffed, ueually with an
irrigation engineer and an agriculturaliet, who were joined by an economiet on
occaeione when the economic viability of the project wae checked.  The
mieeione were thorough, but the intervals between them were somewhat erratic.
For example, 12 monthe elapeed between the second and third mieeione, and 15
monthe between the fourth and fifth missions.  There wae, however, one ehort
mieeion in between the fourth and fifth mieeione to Mexico City to diecuse the
implementation probleme of numeroue projects in the portfolio at that time.
The 15-month interval was a critical period.  The project wae being
reformulated by the Government, and the Bank ehould have been more directly
involved.  The fifth mission in early 1984 was compreheneive and included an
in-depth ex-poet analyeie of the Government's scheme for project revieion that
eventually led to a major amendment to the legal documents in January 1985.
The intervale between the majority of the remaining mieeione up to 1988 were
eix monthe.  From 1988 to loan closing in mid-1991 the intervals extended from
eight to 12 monthe.  In the face of investment reetrictione during much of
thie latter period there was no need for cloeer supervieion.

8.04        Continuity of Bank staff dealing with the project wae leee than
ideal, that eleven yeare elapeed from appraieal to loan cloeing undoubtedly
contributed. During thie period eix different engineers, five different
agriculturaliete, and three economiete participated in 15 mieeione.

8.05        Final deeigne for major civil worke in the right and left main
Chilatan canale were not ready at the time of loan effectiveneee, which
resulted in implementation and diebureement delays.  (Financial reetrictione
overehadowed the problems caused by deeign delays, however.)  Thie wae the
classic leeeon of many similar infrastructure projects and it prompted the
Bank to introduce the requirement of submitting final designs at the time of
Board presentation (OMS 2.28 - October, 1978, State of Project Preparation
Neceeeary for Loan Approval).

8.06        Another leeeon relates to agricultural extension.  Experience
highlights the difficulty of strengthening an exteneion agency in a project
area when the agency ie subject to institutional and administrative norms and
reetrictione imposed at national level. Attempts to overcome ehortcominge
have a better chance of success through a nationally focused project, as in
the case of the Agricultural Extension Project and the Agricultural Technology
Project.

                           9. Borrower Performance

9.01        The major strength of the Borrower was the executing agency's
(SARH, later CNA) dedication and expertiee in construction. Continuity of
thie expertise wae maintained despite budget constraints and two major
reorganizations of SARH.  The main weaknesses were in contracting proceduree,
maintenance of canale, and exteneion.  The eetabliehed practice of SARH in
moet of its hydraulic infrastructure projecte including Apatzingan was to
divide the conetruction of irrigation civil works into small eegmente.  The
result wae a large number of small contractors working on the same worke,

thereby complicating taupervieion, prolonging construction, and usually
resulting in increased costa.  One of the leseone learned by the Borrower in
this project (as well as in the Rio Fuerte-Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project,
Loan 1706-ME) was the coat-effectiveness of changing (in 1990-1991) to larger
contracts that attracted bigger contractors in a more competitive basis.  The
deficiencies associated with maintenance and agricultural extension were
discussed in paragraphs 5.07-5.09.

9.02        Except for the fault with contracting practices, the civil works
component of the project was generally well managed by SARH and later by CNA.
Supervision missions were initially concerned about the inadequacy of the
management and coordination of extension and agricultural planning.  By the
end of 1983, however, improvements were apparent in the management of these
programs but budgetary resources became scarce, thus delaying project
implementation.

9.03        Performance in reporting wae initially poor.  The first
semi-annual report was received almost two yeare after loan effectiveneee, and
it included information only about civil worke.  Timelineee of the reports
improved, but reporting on aspects other than civil works was spotty.

9.04        The executing agency deployed ite own staff effectively.  CNA
relocated project construction headquarters in early 1991 from Apatzingan to a
new building near Tepalcatepec, closer to the construction site.  The
Irrigation District office is expected to move there in the near future.
Management of local consultants was mixed.  Mention has been made of the tardy
completion of the final designe for main canals and the final report of the
panel of experts for the dam.  By contrast, use of an international firm to
design the automated irrigation eyetem has been exceptionally effective.




10.01         The main strength of the Bank-Borrower partnership was the
common recognition of the pragmatic need to reduce the scope of the project
given budgetary constraints related to the adveree macroeconomic environment.
The main weakness was the breakdown in communication between the two as the
project was being reformulated during 1983, which resulted in the Bank
accepting the decieion of the Government on the bade of an ex-poet evaluation
in 1984.  The relationships of the Bank and the Borrower with other Government
agencies such as the Secretariat of Finance and Public credit (SHCP) and the
Secretariat of Planning and Programing (SPP) worked along well established
lines of authority.

                           11.  Coneultina Services

11.01         The Borrower employed national consulting services during
project preparation to provide the feasibility etudy, the final designs for
the left and right bank irrigation systems, the Chilatan dam and to meet the
Bank's and Government's requirement for verifying dam deeign and safety (panel
of experts).  Their technical performance wae eatiefactory, although delivery
of the final designs wae late, ae already mentioned.  An international
consulting firm wae  contracted later during project implementation (1990-
1991) to design a fully automated eyetem for a portion of the project area
(chilatan right bank system).  It hae performed well, and CNA is now
installing the eyetem in accordance with the firm'e recommendations. In 1991

another national coneulting company was contracted to update the feasibility
etudy on the new project conditionalitiee.  There were no unusual probleme
with the conetruction contractore.

                      12.  proiect Documentation and Data

12.01       Project preparation and ite SAR were baeed on satiefactory
baseline data regarding eoil, hydrology and engineering and provided good
guidance for implementation.  The only problem was the delay in the
preparation of the detailed deeigne for the Chilatan Irrigation Syetem.

12.02       The legal documents for the project adequately reflected the
agreements reached during negotiations.  One of the weaknessee of the legal
documente, for thie project and others, which was brought to the attention of
the Bank by the Borrower, was the variation in threehold amount6 for ICB
procurement among similar irrigation projecte in Mexico.  Thie variation
caueed eome confueion and made monitoring difficult.  Threehold amounts were
eubeequently standardized among projects.  There wae one major amendment in
January 1985 reflecting agreement on reducing the ecope of the project to be
financed from the loan.  Subsequent amendments reduced loan eize, increased
disbursement percentages, and extended loan cloeing datee.

12.03         The Staff Appraisal Report wae comprehensive and detailed, and
eerved ae a ueeful tool for project implementation.  Supervision reporte
provided satiefactory information neceeeary for the preparation of the PCR.
The information the Bank aeked to be made available before the final combined
eupervieion and completion mieeion in November 1991 was incomplete.
Coneiderable additional input was required to calculate project benefits,
particularly on investment coete and etatietical data on agricultural
production.  The semi-annual progress reporte submitted to the Bank by the
Borrower should have been more complete in their coverage of agriculture
eupport eervicee and agricultural production (para. 9.03).

                             13.  Leesons Learned

13.01       The project wae negatively affected by an unfavorable
macroeconomic environment, inetitutional instability, and severe funding
conetrainte.  Thie confirme the importance of a sound macroeconomic and
inetitutional context ae a condition for eucceeeful project implementation.
The project aleo demonstrates what can be achieved in the face of severe
financial conetrainte if both Borrower and Bank remain flexible in revising a
project'e original scope.  The main achievements were the completion of a
major storage dam (Chilatan), the advanced implementation etage of the left
and right canal and the entrepreneurial developmente of high value crope
integrated with markets and the industrial sector.

13.02       Apatzingan is a typical multipurpoee water project that includes
irrigation ae a major objective.  Significant benefits also can come from
power generation, flood control, and municipal water eupply.  Theee benefits
were not taken into account in the original project design.  A power plant wae
included later in the project implementation period to maximize benefits from
the uee of water of the Chilatan reservoir.  Agricultural and non-agricultural
activities are complementary and should be considered together at the planning
phaee, particularly when large inveetments euch as dams are at stake.

13.03       The project experienced some small implementation problems
resulting from tardy completion of designs for major civil works in the main
canal system.  In this case, the designs were not ready at the time of project
effectiveness (see para. 8.05).  The acceptance of this delay contributed to
the tardy implementation of the main canals.  Final designs of major
components should always be required before effectiveness.

13.04       A major lesson learned fron implementation concerned the gains in
cost-effectiveness and timely construction resulting from CNA's switch to
large contracts for civil works instead of numerous small contracts.  The SARH
had regularly relied on small contracts in most of its hydraulic
infrastructure projects.  The result of switching to larger contracts (1990-
1991) was cost-effectiveness thus attracting larger contractors on a more
competitive basis.

13.05       A good lesson for similar irrigation systems is the adoption of
new water control technology (hydraulic automatic structures and telemetric
controls).  This technology was introduced in the right bank main canal and
its distribution system and demonstrated how modern technology can be applied
to the new Mexican systems.  The final construction costs demonstrated that
the additional costs were negligible compared to the gains in efficiency and
flexibility of operation and in water savings.

13.06       The significant growth of agricultural processing in the project
area directly related to agricultural production (packing facilities and oil
extraction plants) indicates that substantial secondary benefits can be gained
from irrigation projects.  Despite the project's shortfalls, it was able to
bring about substantial economic development in the region.  In particular, it
reflects the great potential of the area for tropical agriculture and shows
that further investment aimed at improving the efficiency of water use (the
limiting factor for expansion) would be worth considering.

13.07       A further lesson is the difficulty of predicting changes in the
cropping pattern.  The Project Appraisal Report projected production increases
in three crops (soybeans, peanuts and cotton) that are not being produced in
the area now, mostly because these are not as profitable and/or marketable as
fruit and vegetables.  And the most rapid expansion has been in crops not
highlighted in the Project Appraisal Report.  The overall cropping pattern is
now well diversified and adjusted to market demands.  The Government's market-
oriented policy during the final project years (1989-91) favored the
development of competitive commercial crop production along with the expansion
of private technical assistance.  This had positive effects on the performance
of large-scale irrigation in Mexico.

13.08       Another lesson relates to agricultural extension.  Experience
highlights the difficulty of strengthening an extension agency in a project
area when the agency is subject to institutional and administrative norms and
to restrictions imposed at the national level.  Attempts for shortcomings have
a better chance of success through a nationally focused project, as in the
case of the Agricultural Extension Project and the Agricultural Technology
Project.


                        APATZINGAN IRRIGATION PROJECT
                                (LOAN 1858-ME)

                                    PART 11
                           PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT



                               1.  Introduction

1.01        On the behalf of the Borrower (NAFIN), the Comisi6n Nacional del
Agua (CNA), Subdirecci6n General de Planeaci6n y Finanzas, prepared an ex-post
evaluation of the project and delivered a draft copy of the summary (Part 11)
to the Bank, translated into English, by mid-February, 1993.  The full
evaluation report in Spanish so far was not delivered to the Bank but is
expected to come soon.  This section contains a summary of the main report,
focusing in the Government's view and the conclusions reached regarding its
own and Bank's performance and the lessons to be learned from the Apatzingan
Project (Cupatitzio-Tepalcatepec).

1.02        The progress established with respect to the construction of the
works included in the project, indicate that at present, the storage dam of
Chilatan is finished, which represents the most important head work of the
projected irrigation system.  The water conveyance works and the irrigation
zones are still in process of being constructed, with limited headway, though
completion of these works is expected around 1995.

1.03        Due to this stage of advance in the implementation of the Project,
and the time required for the full development of the agricultural activities
of this kind of project, the conclusions that can be drawn up to the present
cannot be terminating, especially in relation with issues such as cost
variations, the project's impact on local agricultural production and the
present, and the lessons that can be obtained.

1.04        For the above reasons, the comments expressed in the following
text will place greater emphasis on the project development observed up to the
present, and the lessons that can be obtained.



                             2.  Bank Performance

2.01        Bank performance during the presentation and initial evaluation of
the project, as well as during the implementation period in which the credit
was disbursed, was considered, in general, satisfactory, and in some aspects,
even outstanding.

2.02        Especially when confronted by the adverse circumstances that
brought about the severe funding constraints that the project had to cope with
during the disbursement of the credit, and that provoked serious delays in the
contruction process, the Bank demonstrated great adaptability and dedication
to the project's implementation.

2.03        These attitudes of the Bank permitted the Government to rely on
its participation during a much longer period than that originally foreseen.

In this way, the project benefitted from considerable funding support that,
under other circumstances, would have been negligible.  Moreover, it must also
be recognized that these same positive attitudes made possible the important
changes that were required during the adjustment of the project's scope
because of the financial crisis of that time.  The aforementioned changes
implied a considerable reduction in financial costa that would have been
incurred under the original loan conditions.

2.04        The Bank also played the role of promoter of technological
changes, by recognizing, and decidedly supporting, the modification of the
systems for water metering and control structures in the conveyances and
dietribution network of the irrigation system.  This facilitated the change to
automatic systems with greater operations efficiency that, at relatively low
cost, will permit in the future to cover greater cropped areas and
consequently, generate additional benefits for the Apatzingan Irrigation
District.   The installation and operation of these systems will be useful for
demonstration purposes for other irrigation systems in Mexico.  It will not
only be useful for training technical staff in the use of modern technology in
this kind of operations, but also will serve to foment the introduction of
those techniques that prove to be most adequate for the development of
irrigated areas.

2.05        The financial participation of the Bank in the project's cost was
appropriate.  On several occasions, the disbursement percentages were modified
in order to help solve the problems brought about by the financial crisis, and
in order to be able to adapt to the changes provoked temporarily in the cost
structure of the Project by the occurrence of sudden important variations in
the exchange rate of the Mexican currency.  Otherwise, the procedure and
completion of the disbursements were done efficiently and without undue
difficulties.  Moreover, the Bank has accepted to continue collaborating in
the funding of the Project after the conclusion of its participation under the
Loan 1858-ME, through a credit supporting the Irrigation and Drainage Sector
Program.

2.06        The Bank's supervision of the project was most useful as it
propitiated valuable technical interchange and collaboration for a better
instrumentation of the Project.



                          3.  Government Performance

3.01        The preparation of the project was carried out successfully by the
Mexican Government.  Studies were carried out with appropriate depth and
scope, sufficiently so as to be able to propose correctly and exactly,
according to the criterion of that time, the best options for the works
required for the improvement and expansion of the District that would permit a
rational exploitation of the available hydroagricultural resources of the
zone.  However, it must be recognized that there were probably certain
deficiencies in the inter-institutional activities that sought to achieve
multiple benefits from the hydraulic potential for irrigation and the
generation of electrical energy.  Perhaps the design of the Chilatan Dam could
have obtained more benefite of the runoffe it regulatee.  Nevertheless, it
should be pointed out that the omission of the generation of electricity in
the preliminary stage of the project was due, at leaet in part, to the
abundant existing supply of electricity at that time and market conditions

t h a t indicated t h a t t h e installment of a generating plant i n Chilatan was not
sufficiently attractive.

3.02                The coneiderable delay and redeeign t o which t h e project was
submitted during its implementation w e r e t h e direct effect6 of t h e economic
c r i e i e t h a t occurred i n Mexico a t t h e beginning of t h e decade of t h e eighties.
Given t h e d i f f i c u l t y of foreeeeing euch circumetancee and t h e i r duration, it
would eeem unjuetified t o coneider t h a t t h e planned implementation program was
too ambitioue.          In t h i e eenee, it ehould be taken i n t o account t h a t t h e main
problem t h a t affected t h e implementation of t h e project, ae i n t h e caee of
many othere, even on an international ecale, wae derived from a macroeconomic
context t h a t eurpaeeed t h e poeeibilitiee of internal maneuvering.               From t h i e
perspective, it i e clear t h a t t h e adjuetmente made i n t h e project'e ecope,
w e r e eolutione demanded by circumetancee, adopted i n order t o be able t o
continue t o give an Fmpulee t o t h e development of t h e d i e t r i c t e ,
notwithetanding t h e limitatione m e e d by funding conetrainte.                  Under theee
terme, t h e Mexican Government demonetrated t o be flexible and pragmatic i n i t e
decieione regarding t h e implementation of t h e project.

3.03                The project has been put into operation following t h e normal
procedure6 of t h e Government, t h a t i n general, eeem t o be functional.
Certainly there have been probleme during t h e implementation of t h e
agricultural technical aeeietance programe and t h e coneervation of t h e
Dietrict.          Theee have been t h e reeult of, apart from t h e already mentioned
funding conetrainte, t h e modificatione i n national policiee, which now expreee
t h e need t o place emphaeie on greater beneficiary participation i n t h e payment
of t h e coete of irrigation-related activitiee.            Although with t h i e i n i t i a t i v e
it can be expected that farm activitiee w i l l become more eelf-eufficient,                    and
t h e eervicee more efficient, it i e aleo t r u e t h a t theee policiee have implied,
i n t h e caee of t h i e project, t h a t t h e inteneity of t h e reepective worke hae
been lees than t h a t programmed.          However, it i e coneidered t h a t there has been
progreee i n t h e improvement of t h e eervicee and it i e foreeeen that, with t h e
etimulue t h e Government hae given t o t h e tranefer of t h e Districte t o t h e
ueere, and t h e organization of t h e l a t t e r t o operate, coneerve and administer
t h e i r eyeteme, i n a relatively short time, theee w i l l reach eatisfactory
levele of operation, especially with reepect t o t h e coneervation of t h e
infraetructure.

3.04               The construction of t h e worke of t h e project is coneidered t o have
been carried out i n accordance with approved technical c r i t e r i a and with
adequate quality.            Moreover, during t h e implementation of t h e Apatzingan
Project, with Bank eupport, t h e Government opted f o r t h e inetallation of
equipment and infraetructure correeponding t o an advanced and eeldom ueed
technology which offere coneiderable advantage6 f o r irrigation water
management and permite reaching higher efficiency levels than those obtained
with t h e traditional techniques included originally i n t h e project.               The
Mexican Government decided t o modify t h e deeign of t h e Chilatan Dam i n order
t o permit t h e inetallment of an e l e c t r i c a l energy plant t h a t w i l l produce
important additional benefite, beeidee thoee related with irrigation.


                                       4.  peeulte Achieved

4.01               The completion of t h e Chilatan Dam and t h e progreee achieved i n
water conveyance and dietribution eyeteme have already permitted t h e

incorporation into irrigation of soma areas and an improved supply of
irrigation eervicee t o a considerable area.         These effects are becoming more
noticeable i n the farm production of the area as the project keeps progressing
and the agricultural production processes begin t o consolidate.

4.02           Up t o the present, there are more positive modifications i n the
production schemes.         The cropped area has increased, especially that of crops
with high commercial value euch as orchards and vegetable..           However, thie
progress should be judged with precaution, as due t o its recent existence and
yet limited ecale, it is not easy t o determine up t o what extent the mentioned
changes have occurred as the reeult of the implementation of the project, and
t o what extent they are the reeult of other promotion activities implanted by
the Mexican agricultural sector and market changee.

4.03           A t present it is foreseen that the real cost of the project, up t o
its completion, w i l l be less than that calculated in the original studies,
that is, nearly 1.2 t r i l l i o n peso., a t 1991 prices, instead of the original
budget of 1.5 t r i l l i o n pesos, also a t the same prices.  In spite of the above,
due mainly t o the delays i n obtaining benefits, as the result of the slowdown
of the works in the irrigation zone and the limited impact on farm production,
and due also t o the discapitalieation of the agricultural sector and delaye in
the availability of technical amsietance, it is considered that the income
return of the project w i l l be modest, i f we exclude the benefits from the
generation of electricity.         These additional benefit. w i l l mean an important
increase i n the t o t a l net benefits, improving the global income return of the
project   .

                         5.   -8               and Lasons Learned

5.01           It is obvious that an important recommendation derived from the
Project is t o give a etimulu. t o multipurpose projects for the exploitation of
available resources. In thie sense, it is coneidered necessary t o concentrate
on an analysis of multiple objectives in the preliminary investment etudy
stage, when the scale and general characteristic. of the projecte are
determined.

5.02           Moreover, given the positive results i n Apateingan, the analysis
and application, when pertinent, of more modern methods of water control and
metering in the conveyance and distribution networks in other Mexican
Irrigation Districts are t o be reconmended, especially i n thoee syeteme with a
limited supply of water and high productivity potential.

5.03           In new projects as -11 as other operation systems with important
but underexploited potential, it is urgent t o mearch for new alternatives that
would guarantee the availability of the other support services for production,
euch as credits and technical aesietance of adequate intensity and quality.
The availability of these services, up t o now, has frequently escaped the
control capacity of the local authorities that implement the projects, and
t h i s shortcoming, has had an important impact on the targets of farm
production that have been only partially reached.          Because of the primordial
importance of theee services for the success of the projecte, it is
recommended t o analyze alternative mechanisms in order t o assure their
availability i n the project areas.
