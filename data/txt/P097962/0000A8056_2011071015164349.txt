                         Implementation Status Overview
                         TThe overall implementation pace of the Education Rehabilitation Program (ERP) has continued to improve as reflected in the substantially increased disbursement rates. The
                         quarterly disbursement rates have been steadily increasing over the four quarters of 2011. The quarterly disbursement from the Grant increased from $1.97 million in Quarter 1 (Q1)

                         to $1.13 in Q2, to $3.58 million in Q3 and to $3.03 million in the first half of Q4. The overall disbursement from the Grant reached $9.7 million in mid-May 2011 compared to $3.4
                         million in 2010 and $3.0 million in 2009. As at mid-May 2011, the total disbursement from the Grant has reached $19.6 million (77% of the total Grant). Including Government

                         contribution, the overall disbursement reached US$35.0 million, leaving about $11.0 million of undisbursed balance from the total project funds.

                         Implementation has been highly satisfactory across most components, with the exception of the in-service teacher training program which has to be suspended to address its
                         implementation and management problems and the survey of alternative education program, which cannot be implemented within the current closing date.
