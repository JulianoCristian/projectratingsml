                         $834,066 leaving an estimated unexpended balance of US$491,184 from the Grant funds. This is due the payment not yet made to the recently completed two CECs that are
                         awaiting inspection for final payment, and mainly because of the delay in delivery of school furniture to 27 schools by Panrual Contractors. A restructuring request has been received
                         by the government of South Sudan to revise the percentage allocation of the MDTF versus the government contribution to ensure that MDTF funds are fully utilized till December
                         2012.

                         ERP has made significant implementation progress in the last two years. The project has been implemented by the Ministry of General Education and Instruction and as such has
                         been integral in building the capacity within the MoGEI. The MoGEI was supported by some specialist consultants on procurement and Financial Management during the period of
                         implementation, and during the time staff capacity was strengthened. Capacity of the country in terms of self-reliance, for instance with the procurement of a printing press to develop
                         and print their own examination can be seen as a major step for the young country. A number of activities under the MDTF supported project has helped South Sudan in improving
                         the quality of education in terms of learning and teaching environment. The major activities already completed include: Educational Management training of 317 head teachers and
                         State Ministry of education officials and 40 Ministry of Education head office staff and officials; an Intensive English Training of 917 teachers and education staff with Arabic Education
                         background; a fast-track training of 1217 new teachers and a pre-service training of 951 teachers; a pilot pastoralist education of 6417 youth and adults and training of 1000
                         Alternative Education teachers and 150 Local Education authorities. In addition, the construction of 52 Primary Schools is completed, and 1 school being in defects liability period due
                         to insecurity in the region. Starting from a low base, the progress during the period of the MDTF has been substantial.
