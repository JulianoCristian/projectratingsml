A. SUMMARY
1. The percentage of expenditure to be financed from MDTF SS-Grant No TF056452
   for the South Sudan-Education Rehabilitation Project (ERP), Project ID P097962 will
   be amended to 100% from November 30, 2012 up to the Project closing date of
   December 31, 2012.

B. PROJECT STATUS
2. The development objective of ERP is to improve access to enhanced quality of
   education, alternate learning opportunities, development of life skills and basic
   occupational skill training to primary school students, IDPs, demobilized soldiers,
   and other non-traditional learners. Currently, implementation of project activities is
   on track with almost all the main project activities have either been completed or
   nearing completion. The current overall implementation progress is rated as
   satisfactory and the project’s development objectives continue to be largely
   achievable. A total of 3179 teachers were trained (1228 through fast-track program,
   951 through pre-service and 1000 through in-service training). The project built 52
   Primary schools and 14 County Education Centres, with final inspection and payment
   pending for four schools and three CECs. Two contracts are also underway, to furnish
   the 52 schools but with major delay in the execution one of these two contracts.
   Under the Alternative Education System (AES) component, the project provided an
   intensive English training course for 2417 teachers and staff with Arabic Education
   background. AES also supported the training of 6146 pastoralists, accelerated
   learning program and procurement of Alternative Education System (AES) centres’
   educational supplies. Survey of AES was also completed. Under the capacity building
   program, 367 education managers were trained, five staff residences were
   rehabilitated and contract is underway to procure a printing press for the Examination
   Centre.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
3. The total Grant allocation of US$25.5 million and the full Government contribution
   of US$20.4 million have been transferred to the Project account and fully committed.
   However, as of November 31, 2012, there are unexpended balances of
   US$1,499,197.38 from the Grant and US$1,175,587.00 from the Government. While
   the percentage of expenditure to be financed by MDTF has been increased for all
   MDTF supported projects to an average of 75%, the only exception was ERP, which
   has been financed by only 56% (See the attached Table). This percentage will be
   further reduced, as it is unlikely for the full amount of the outstanding unspent
   balance from MDTF to be used by December 31, 2012. This is mainly due to the
   delay in the execution of one of the two contracts for the delivery of furniture to 27 of
   the 52 schools built under the Project. Deliveries to all of these schools might not be
                                             4
   completed within the closing date due to capacity of the supplier and the logistical
   challenges caused by the poor road network. Payments may subsequently not be
   made from the grant funds.


4. The proposed amendment is therefore necessary to increase the percentage of
   expenditure to be financed out of grant funds from the current 56% to 100% for the
   period November 30 to December 31, 2012 to allow for full disbursement of the grant
   funds and to allow for the Government contribution to be used for the payment of the
   remaining deliveries beyond December 31, 2012, and thus providing more time for
   delivery. Recipient's request fulfills the general requirements for the extension of the
   closing date as indicated in OP 13.30.
