                             Extension of Grant Closing Date

      SOUTH SUDAN — EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT (P097962)
                         MDTF-SS TF056452

1.    The closing date for South Sudan-Education Rehabilitation Project (ERP), MDTF
SS-Grant No TF056452, and Project ID P097962 will be extended from June 30, 2012 to
December 31, 2012.

2.       The development objective of ERP is to improve access to enhanced quality of
education, alternate learning opportunities, development of life skills and basic
occupational skill training to primary school students, IDPs, demobilized soldiers, and
other non-traditional learners. The project has the following components: (i) enhance and
expand the management and delivery of education services at the county level; (ii)
provision of alternate education and/or skill development for non-formal learners; (iii)
institutional capacity development; (iv) construction and rehabilitation of schools and (v)
program management, monitoring and evaluation.

3.      Currently, implementation of project activities is on track. Most of the main
project activities have been completed or nearing completion. The current overall
implementation progress is rated as satisfactory and the Project Development Objective
(PDO) continues to be largely achievable. Results achieved to date include: 702,500
direct beneficiaries of the project against a target of 750,000; textbook-pupil ratio of 4:1,
against a target of 5:1; almost 183,000 demobilized soldiers, returning population,
overage learners, and other non-formal learners enrolled in alternate learning programs
against a target of 50,000; 1.4 million children enrolled in school up from 669,000 in
2006, against a target of 1.5 million in June 2012; 52 schools built and furniture for the
schools contracted out; almost 183,000 individuals in total enrolled in Alternative
Education System; and 3096 teachers trained through pre- and in-service teacher training.
The Project has also supported the training of 6146 pastoralists, accelerated learning
program and procurement of Alternative Education System (AES) centres’ educational
supplies. The survey of AES is also underway.

4.     Out of the total Grant allocation of US$25.5 million, US$24.8 million has been
disbursed as at end of June 2012 while the undisbursed balance is fully committed.

5.      The proposed extension is necessary to achieve the PDO, through the completion
of the following ongoing activities:
     Final inspection and payment of the last/retention payments for the two completed
        schools and three County Education Centres, whose defect liability period ends
        beyond June 30, 2012;
     Provision of more time for the delivery of the school furniture, which has already
        been procured, to the respective schools; and
     Completion of the Survey of Alternative Education System Programs and
        Intensive English Course and closing the contracts.

6.      The audit for 2010 is unqualified and identified some minor issues that have been
resolved. Audit for the year ended December 31, 2011 is in progress. The Interim
Financial Report (IFR) for the quarter ended April 30, 2012 did not indicate any
significant financial management issue.

7.     This will be the fourth extension of the project and will result into a cumulative
extension of the project for 39 months from the original closing date.
