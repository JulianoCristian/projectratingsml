to\n            improve the quality and content of higher technical\n            education in Korea, so that it can contribute effectively to\n            the country's technological needs in the eighties. The\n            sector program to be financed under the loan covers three\n            aspects of higher education, viz, engineering education,\n            management education and technician training. The program\n            will create a flexible system of supplying technical skills,\n            remove the principal constraints on quality improvement and\n            reduce the investment gap in private higher technical\n            education. Policies to be implemented include establishment\n            of systematic manpower monitoring; adoption of flexible\n            enrollment control; introduction of accreditation of set and\n            maintain quality standards; adoption of adequate incentives\n            to improve the supply and quality of teaching staff; and\n            improved financing of private institutions. The overall\n            program, of which a part would be financed under the\n            proposed loan, would comprise about 10 national programs for\n            organization, curricula and staff development, and about 55\n            subprojects for development of physical facilities at\n            specific instituitions."}, "docdt": "1980-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
