Power\n            Development Project's objectives are to assist the\n            Government of Kenya (GoK) in formulating and implementing\n            major policy and institutional reforms aimed at creating an\n            efficient and environmentally sustainable energy sector and\n            to support investments needed to meet power demand and\n            increase operational efficiency. The project's specific\n            objectives are to: 1) finance investments needed to meet\n            power demand and improve the operational efficiency in the\n            sub-sector; 2) reform the organizational structure of the\n            power sub-sector to enable the operating entities to\n            function efficiently and on a commercially sustainable\n            basis; 3) create a legal and regulatory environment\n            necessary for private sector participation in the supply of\n            electricity; 4) support GoK's adoption of economic\n            pricing of both electricity and petroleum products and\n            implementation of demand and supply-side efficiency\n            improvement measures; and 5) develop indigenous geothermal\n            energy resources and a strategy for sustainable household\n            and rural energy development. The project will consist of\n            the following six components: (a) sector restructuring and\n            reform; (b) other institutional support; (c) efficiency\n            improvements; (d) power system expansion and upgrading; (e)\n            geothermal resource development; and (f) future project preparation."}, "docdt": "1997-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
