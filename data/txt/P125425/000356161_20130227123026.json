Recovery\n            Support Operation Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory\n            and borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: the Bank needs to engage more actively,\n            albeit indirectly, in the Kyrgyz reform process, especially\n            in cross cutting policy areas requiring inter sectoral\n            coordination. The government remains fragmented and poorly\n            coordinated, which hinders its ability to take coherent\n            decisions efficiently. A single tranche operation can be an\n            adequate response to an emergency or crisis, but its\n            effectiveness and impact may ultimately be a function of the\n            prospect for follow up operations. A well designed\n            development policy operation can send a powerful signal to\n            the international community about the commitment, if not the\n            capacity of the authorities, to mitigate the impact of a\n            crisis. Both political will and the government's\n            ability to finance reforms in the medium term are essential\n            for sustainability. A number of medium term outcomes are\n            currently contingent on the availability of external finance."}, "docdt": "2013-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
