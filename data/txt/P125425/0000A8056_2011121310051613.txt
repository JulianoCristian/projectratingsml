                         The Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) supports policy actions implemented between April 2010 and June 2011 aimed at stabilizing the economy,
                         strengthening governance and safeguarding social protection. These areas are rooted in the governments near term priorities and medium term vision, and are
                         critical for improving private sector confidence and reviving the economy. The PDOs include (i) Strengthened governance in the management of public assets
                         and revenues through maintaining Ministry of Finance's control over all capital spending by abolishment of the off-budget development fund and asserting
                         stronger budget control, enhancing transparency in privatization process, establishing proper accounting and improving operational performance in the energy
                         sector, and maintaining financial sector stability; and (ii) Safeguarding social spending by ensuring essential social protection spending, and re-establishing
                         livelihoods and providing social compensation for the conflict-affected population and businesses. The reform program supported by ERSO has been
                         implemented satisfactorily and development objectives have been achieved. The ERSO is expected to be followed by a programmatic series of multi-year
                         development policy operations provided the authorities stay the course on fiscal consolidation, ensure macroeconomic stability, and implement medium term
                         structural reforms centering on governance and other relevant areas in line with an adequate medium term development strategy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) supports implementation of the Kyrgyz government policy reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy, strengthening governance,
                         and safeguarding social protection. These areas are rooted in the governments' core priorities to revive the economy and rebuild trust in the government and confidence in public
                         institutions. The program is built on two pillars in line with key reform measures adopted by the government:
                         (i)        Strengthening governance, transparency and accountability in the management of public assets and revenues. The authorities have taken measures to re-assert ministerial
                         control over capital spending and have tightened standards and enhanced transparency on the management of the budget and public assets # all areas of weakness under the
                         previous administration. The off-budget Development Fund was abolished in support of transparency and good governance and an audit of its accounts conducted and published.

                         New resolutions have been passed to improve management of public assets. Critically, first steps have been taken towards establishing greater transparency over energy sector
                         accounts and operational performance. Supervisory Councils which include representatives from civil society have been established in many ministries and government agencies to
                         oversee activities. Efforts to raise transparency standards in mining have resulted in the country's achieving full compliance with the norms of the Extractive Industries Transparency
                         Initiative (EITI). Measures taken to ensure financial stability allowed the NBKR to provide timely response to manage the financial stress within a major bank and prevent contagion.

                         (ii)       Safeguarding social protection and supporting conflict affected population. The authorities have raised the level of general social benefits and reformed the eligibility criteria
                         to improve targeting. They have also provided additional support for conflict-affected families and businesses. Moreover, livelihoods and housing for such families are being
                         supported. Social protection spending directed at post-conflict needs was rights-based in nature and now has to be incorporated within a targeted means-based system.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ERSO, a single tranche budget support operation in the amount of US$30 million, was approved in August 2011 based on several policy actions undertaken by the new authorities
                         between April 2010 and June 2011. Presidential elections took place on October 30, following which the Parliament ratified ERSO and the law on ratification of the agreement was
                         signed by the President, and the operation was declared effective by the Bank on November 23, 2011. Funds are expected to be disbursed by end November/early December 2011.
                         The reform program supported by ERSO has been implemented satisfactorily and development objectives have been achieved.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
