                        ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT OPERATION

Recipient             Kyrgyz Republic
Implementing          Ministry of Finance
Agency
Financing Data        IDA Credit (55%) of 40 years to maturity including a 10-year grace period and IDA Grant (45%).
Operation Type        Development Policy Operation (DPO)
Main Policy Areas     (i) Governance, (ii) Safeguarding social protection.
Key Outcome            Ministry of Finance’s control over all capital spending restored and maintained.
Indicators             Energy sector finances are managed in more transparent manner and the sector performance has
                          not deteriorated.
                       Comprehensive information available to fully assess fiscal stance over the medium term (PEFA
                          indicator PI-7).
                       Privatization implemented in an open and transparent manner in line with best practice.
                       Targeted social support provides adequate living standards for the poor and conflict affected
                          population.
                       Central bank better equipped to monitor the banking sector, address vulnerabilities in a timely
                          manner, and resolve troubled banks efficiently.
Program               (i) Strengthened governance in the management of public assets and revenues through maintaining
Development           Ministry of Finance’s control over all capital spending by abolishment of the off-budget
Objective(s) and      development fund and asserting stronger budget control, enhancing transparency in privatization
Contribution to CAS   process, establishing proper accounting and improving operational performance in the energy sector,
                      and maintaining financial sector stability; and (ii) Safeguarding social spending by ensuring
                      essential social protection spending, and re-establishing livelihoods and providing social
                      compensation for the conflict-affected population and businesses.
                      The proposed operation is rooted in the Bank’s assistance strategy as outlined in the Joint Country
                      Support Strategy (JCSS 2007-2010) and the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The JCSS Progress
                      Report (October 2009) envisaged budget support lending. An ISN covering August 2011 to June
                      2013 Bank strategy is to be discussed by the Board of Executive Directors jointly with this operation
                      in August 2011. The ISN provides the background and context for the Bank’s intervention through a
                      single tranche budget support operation in 2011 to help the government protect its high priority
                      expenditures in light of its continued recovery and reconciliation challenges and envisages the
                      resumption of support for long-term economic development.
Risks and Risk        Continuation or even intensification of social strife in the south of the country, in light of the
Mitigation            Presidential election towards the end of the year, remains a major source of internal risk that could
                      jeopardize political stability in the country. The external risks stem from continued border closures
                      with Uzbekistan, with severe disruptive effect on production and trade. Keeping open the channels
                      for trade flows as well as ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted operation of the common electricity grid
                      that links these three countries are important contributors to stabilization. Economic risks arise from
                      weaker economic growth than projected and high inflation driven by rising food and energy prices,
                      which would result in greater fiscal pressures and a possible threat to maintaining essential social
                      expenditures, particularly if the anticipated donor financial support does not materialize. These risks
                      would be addressed during the medium term engagement planned by the World Bank and other
                      Kyrgyz Republic development partners through a combination of decisive and sufficient external
                      financing of the budget to ensure implementation of the reconstruction and recovery program over
                      the medium term and by continued prudent fiscal management. The authorities have identified clear
                      priorities in public spending and have successfully protected the essential. Clearly, not all risks of
                      the complexity and gravity that are faced by the Kyrgyz Republic are amenable to mitigation through
                      an operation such as the ERSO.

                                  IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
                         PROPOSED ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT OPERATION
                                       TO KYRGYZ REPUBLIC


                                                               I.   INTRODUCTION

1.      The document describes a program of policy actions taken by Government of
Kyrgyz Republic to promote economic recovery that are supported by the proposed
Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) in the amount of US$ 30 million. The
actions taken are aimed at stabilizing the economy, strengthening governance and safeguarding
social spending in the face of fiscal pressures arising from the impact of political and civil
conflict during April and June 2010.1

2.       Prior to the conflict, the country had a track record of macroeconomic stability,
economic growth and poverty reduction. Between 2003 and 2008, GDP growth averaged 5.7
percent a year and the share of population in poverty fell from 50 percent to 31.7 percent. The
government maintained a relatively stable macroeconomic environment in the face of several
internal and external shocks. As the only Central Asian member of the WTO, the country put in
place a liberal trade and investment regime, but progress in implementing structural reforms in
general and in improving transparency of government operations in particular was weak or
absent as evidenced by World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, Transparency
International’s Corruption Perception Index and other authoritative assessments. The global
crisis in 2009 reduced growth to 2.9 percent, but this performance was better than most due, in
part, to a bumper harvest and the strong fiscal stimulus.

3.      The political and civil conflict resulted in an economic contraction of 1.4 percent in
2010 and worsened the near term growth prospects and the fiscal situation. The protests in
Bishkek and other cities (April 2010) and the internal clashes in the south (June 2010) took their
toll in life and property, and temporarily displaced 400,000 people at its peak. The conflict
disrupted trade flows, agricultural production, construction and tourism, strained public finances
to meet conflict-related expenditures and inflicted large losses on the banking sector. In addition,
increases in world food and fuel prices put more pressure on public sector wages and social
assistance programs.

4.      The post-conflict governments have taken actions to ensure social and political
stability. The interim government (April-December 2010) shifted from a presidential system to
parliamentary democracy and reversed what were perceived as severe governance failures of the
pre-conflict regime. The elected government that succeeded the interim government in
December 2010 is expected to contribute to political stability, post-conflict healing and private
sector confidence. It has announced its intention to formulate a medium term development
strategy, including reforms in such key areas as governance, social assistance and private sector
development, and has requested development partners to provide technical support for its
preparation and financial support for its implementation. This augurs well for the continuity of
policies supported by the proposed operation, over the medium term.

                                                                        1
 
 


5.      The proposed ERSO supports policy actions implemented between April 2010 and
June 2011 aimed at stabilizing the economy, strengthening governance and safeguarding
social protection. These areas are rooted in the governments near term priorities and medium
term vision, and are likely to be critical for improving private sector confidence and reviving the
economy. On governance, the policy actions will support the government’s efforts in addressing
some of the key governance failures of the previous regime and in addition make modest
advances in several parts of the agenda for greater transparency and accountability. On social
protection, the actions aim not only to safeguard benefits for the poor but also provide,
temporarily, social assistance to the conflict-affected population. The ERSO could be followed
by a programmatic series of multi-year development policy operations provided the authorities
stay the course on fiscal consolidation, ensure macroeconomic stability, and implement medium
term structural reforms centering on governance and other relevant areas in line with their
medium term development strategy currently being prepared.

6.            Specifically the two pillars of the proposed ERSO are:

                     Strengthening governance and transparency in the management of public assets and
                      revenues. The authorities have taken measures to re-assert ministerial control over
                      capital spending and have tightened standards and enhanced transparency on the
                      management of the budget and public assets – all areas of weakness under the
                      previous administration. Thus, public investment choices and financing are now
                      integrated with the national budget, and the off-budget Development Fund has been
                      abolished in support of transparency and good governance. Critically, first steps have
                      been taken towards establishing greater transparency over energy sector operations.
                      Efforts to raise transparency standards in mining have resulted in the country’s
                      achieving full compliance with the norms of the Extractive Industries Transparency
                      Initiative (EITI). Measures taken to ensure financial stability allowed the NBKR to
                      provide timely response to manage the financial stress within a major bank and
                      prevent contagion.

                     Safeguarding social protection and supporting conflict affected population. The
                      authorities have raised the level of general social benefits and reformed the eligibility
                      criteria to improve targeting. They and have also provided additional support for
                      conflict-affected families and businesses. Moreover, livelihoods and housing for such
                      families are being supported. Social protection spending directed at post-conflict
                      needs was rights-based in nature and now has to be incorporated within a targeted
                      means-based system.

7.      The development partners have been providing timely and well coordinated support
to the Kyrgyz Republic. Following the conflict in 2010 the multilateral development partners
prepared a Joint Economic Assessment (JEA) that assessed the impact, analyzed the financing
needs over 2010-12 and provided the basis for a donor conference in July 2010 that pledged $1.1
billion2 in financial support. As a result, the budget for 2010 was adequately financed by donors
and the financing need for 2011 budget is expected to be met by IDA, the IMF, the EU, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Anti-Crisis Fund of the Eurasian Development Bank.

The Bank also provided an Emergency Recovery Project (ERP), an additional financing project
and restructured existing projects in 2010 to support the government’s emergency program. In
June 2011, the Fund board approved a three- year program under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) in the amount of $106 million.

8.      The proposed operation is in line with the Bank’s assistance strategy as outlined in
the proposed Interim Strategy Note (ISN)3 that covers fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The ISN
will be discussed by the Board of Executive Directors jointly with this operation in August 2011.
The pillars of the interim strategy – economic stabilization, improved governance, and social
stabilization – are the areas of policy focus in the ERSO.


                                                               II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                                               A.    POLITICAL BACKGROUND

9.      Since independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic has advanced towards the
creation of a liberal market economy. The aim was to promote sustained economic growth
and reduce poverty and seek international integration through trade and investment. The country
has met with some success in fostering openness, but has struggled to embed lasting democracy
and civic freedom. In the three year period to April 2010, the president took specific measures to
concentrate power in his own administrative apparatus, which resulted in the weakening of
authority of the national assembly ministries. Thus, checks and balances were removed,
consultation over policies and accountability greatly reduced, and governance standards lowered.

10.     In April 2010, anti-government demonstrations took place in various cities. This
was directed at centralization of power within the presidency, economic decisions taken without
public consultation and a strong perception of corruption as evidenced by the Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index, particularly related to evidence of diversion of assets
and revenues of the energy and telecommunications sectors. The protests culminated in riots in
Bishkek and several other cities, resulting in a crackdown by the government. The president was
subsequently removed from office and an interim administration, headed by a coalition of
opposition political and civic leaders, came to power.

11.     In June 2010, civil clashes took place over three days, particularly in the southern
cities of Jalalabad and Osh. These two cities and some neighboring areas erupted in a spasm of
internal clashes. It was officially reported that over 300 persons were killed, over 2500 injured,
nearly 400,000 temporarily displaced, and significant material damage to property occurred.

12.    The interim government put into effect a new constitution that shifted the balance of
executive power from a presidential system to a parliamentary one. The elections of
October 2010 were conducted on the basis of the new constitution; international observers
characterized the conduct of the general elections as substantially fair and proper. The elected

 A Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) guided Bank’s program over 2008-10. It was an early example of a
partnership of seven bilateral and multilateral donors: the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission, the
IMF, United Nations agencies and the World Bank, together with the governments of Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom.

                                                                           3
 
 


government that took office in December 2010 is a three party coalition, which has a comfortable
majority in parliament, and is committed to macroeconomic stability and market-oriented
reforms. But security conditions are fragile, social tensions continue to run high in the south and
peace remains vulnerable. The presidential elections are due later this year.

                                                B.             RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

13.    The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the two least developed economies in Central Asia
(next only to Tajikistan). Its GNI per capita is equivalent to $880 in 2010. Around 51 percent of
value added in the economy is generated in the services sector and 28 percent in industry. The
production of gold in the Kumtor mine (Centerra Gold) amounts to as much as 7 percent of GDP.
Agriculture sector contributes 21 percent of value added and nearly half of total employment.
With nearly two thirds of its population in rural areas, Kyrgyz Republic is still a largely rural
economy, characterized by subsistence agriculture and low-value-added services.

14.      Kyrgyz Republic has adopted liberal economic policies and enjoyed strong growth
coupled with macroeconomic stability in the years preceding the global economic crisis. It
joined WTO as early as 1998 with around 5 percent Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff, and it
has a very liberal trade regime compared to the rest of the CIS countries. The privatization
process is also largely completed save the telecommunications and energy sectors. Prior to the
crisis, between 2006 and 2008, the Kyrgyz economy grew at the average rate of 6 percent per
annum, largely driven by an expansion in construction and services sectors. Inflation was kept in
check by prudent monetary policy and the external public debt burden dropped to 41 percent of
GDP by 2008 from as much as 100 percent in 2002.4

15.     Economic performance deteriorated significantly during the global crisis, but a
recession was avoided largely due to a large fiscal stimulus. As external demand, remittances
and capital inflows dropped due to the global crisis, the authorities responded by relaxing fiscal
and monetary policies. On the revenue side, the key measure was the reduction in the rate of
VAT from 20 percent to 12 percent; public expenditures were stepped up sharply from 29
percent of GDP in 2008 to 36 percent in 2009 across the board, but more heavily on the side of
current expenditures largely through increases in pensions and public sector wages. The overall
fiscal accounts moved from a balance in 2008 to a deficit equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP in
2009. Economic growth dropped from 7.6 percent to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2009, but a
recession was successfully averted.

16.     Poverty reduction in recent years was impressive. The incidence of overall poverty
fell from 40 percent in 2006 to 32 percent in 2009, and extreme poverty from 9 percent to 3
percent. Although the incidence of poverty is still much higher in rural areas (37 versus 22
percent in 2009), the rate of reduction in rural areas was faster. The drop of extreme poverty in
rural areas from 11 to 3 percent during this period was particularly impressive as it is now
similar to urban areas. Strong economic growth coupled with rising inflow of worker
remittances contributed to this decline in poverty although the slowdown in growth and the sharp
decline in remittances in 2009 reduced the speed of poverty reduction.

Economic, Social, and Poverty Impact of the 2010 Upheavals

17.     In 2010, the political disturbances in April and the outburst of civil conflict in June
dealt a large shock to the economy and caused a recession. The events led to loss of life and
injuries to persons, damage to infrastructure, the destruction of private and public property, and a
weakening of confidence within the private sector. Economic activity was disrupted, particularly
in the south of the country; the financial sector was severely stressed, trade and services
adversely affected by weak security and several key border closures. Consequently in 2010, the
economy contracted by 1.4 percent. While investment activity dropped in many sectors,
particularly in construction, total private investment to GDP increased by 1.4 percentage points,
due to large investments in the Kumtor gold mine by Centerra Gold, which amounted to around
3.3 percent of GDP or 17 percent of total private investment. The current account went from 0.7
percent surplus to 2.1 percent deficit. New fiscal pressures emerged and the deficit5 widened.

18.     The crises-related and to a lesser extent other policy measures led to an increase in
government expenditures from 36.1 to 38.1 percent of GDP and a worsening of its
composition. Attempting to deal with the immediate impact of the crisis and address the issues
that were thought to have caused it, the authorities decided to step up several categories of public
expenditures. However, because of various constraints on implementation capacity the
expenditures directly related to the crises amounted to 1.7 rather than the originally projected 4.5
percent of GDP (Table1). Prior to political disturbances, the Social Fund expenditures were
increased by as much as 2.4 percent of GDP as a result of pension increases intended to offset
the earlier rise of utility tariffs. . The pensions remained in place even though the tariff increases
were reversed following the 2010 events. Non-pension social expenditures were steady for
several years at around 1.6 percent of GDP, but increased in 2010 to 2.6 percent.6 Overall,
current expenditures increased by 3.8 percentage points of GDP.

However, relatively well-targeted non-categorical social benefits have remained steady at around 0.7 percent,
which is low and results in low coverage.

                                                                     5
 
 


19.    Tax revenues performed surprisingly well, but grants dropped compared to 2009.
Tax revenues rose counter-cyclically by 1 percentage point of GDP for four reasons:

              (i)        The base for levying fuel taxes increased sharply because of the Russian-imposed
                         export duty on fuels.7

              (ii)       The depreciation of the som combined with inelastic demand for imports led to
                         higher import-related revenues, particularly VAT receipts.

              (iii) High gold price and the prepayment of taxes by the major gold mining company.

              (iv) Administrative measures led to exceptional performance of income tax and Social
                   Fund contribution revenues. Grants, however, were reduced by 2.1 percentage
                   points, following a steep increase in 2009, when Russia alone provided $160
                   million of economic crisis-related grant assistance to Kyrgyz Republic. In sum,
                   revenues and grants dropped around 0.4 percentage points.

20.    The deficit increased, but turned out lower than it had been anticipated. The deficit
increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.5 percent. However, it turned out significantly
lower than 12 percent, which was predicted in the 2010 post-crisis Joint Economic Assessment
because of stronger than expected revenue and output performance, cautious approach to
spending, and lower than planned capital spending due to capacity constraints.

21.     External public debt increased faster than GDP for the second year in a row and
reached an estimated 57.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Debt increase in both 2009 and 2010 was
not only caused by public sector foreign borrowing to meet the financing gap related to the
budget deficit and non-budgetary public investments, it was also driven by som depreciation
against the dollar of 26 percent over the period, as most of the debt is dollar denominated.

22.     The failure of the largest bank, where serious governance failures and strong
evidence of corruption were found, threatened the stability of the Kyrgyz financial sector.8
Seven banks faced serious problems in 2010 and were placed under NBKR administration.
Among the seven, one was systemically important: AsiaUniversalBank (AUB) which accounted
for a significant share of the banking assets and deposits. The AUB was a good example of the
failures of governance and transparency of that era. It saw a fall in mostly non-resident deposits
from 50 percent of total to 20 percent between March and June 2010. It also became obvious that
a large share of AUB’s assets, invested through asset management companies abroad, was by
and large unrecoverable. Of the other six banks, which were placed under central bank’s
administration along with AUB, one has been removed; of the remaining five, one is under
conservation, while the other four are still under temporary administration. However, these
banks are small and will not affect the overall health of the financial system. Primarily because
of problems at AUB, the health of the financial sector deteriorated substantially between
December 2009 and June 2010: net total capital/risk-weighted assets dropped from 33 percent to
                                                            
7
 Russia resumed the supply of duty-free fuels in early 2011.
8
 Given lack of transparency that existed in the AUB’s operations, the authorities have discovered problems with
data accuracy in AUB as a result of its audit. As such, the accuracy of the financial sector data is under review by
NBKR.

                                                               6
 
 


25 percent; liquidity ratio dropped from 87 to 76 percent; the share of non-performing loans
increased from 8 to 14 percent. Thus a profitable banking system quickly became a loss making
one, as return on assets went from 2 percent to -10 percent.

23.     The actions taken by the authorities helped prevent contagion to other important
banks and the rest of the financial sector has started to recover. Following the intervention
in AUB, the rest of the banking sector stabilized: the capital adequacy ratio remained at 2008
level of around 31 percent at the end of 2010; the liquidity ratio was 73 percent and the excess
reserves at 51 percent (up from 30% in December 2008). The remaining banks also remained
profitable at the end of 2010. However, non-performing loans increased to 16 percent (5.3% end
2008). Finally, although all banks temporarily suspended lending in the south, overall credit to
the private sector as a share of GDP remained roughly the same at 26 billion som or 13 percent
of GDP.

24.     The fiscal relaxation and financial sector measures provided stimulus to economic
activity and employment. Outlays on essential repairs and rehabilitation to infrastructure and
the capital stock strengthened the supply base of the economy and in particular led to
improvements in the reliability of energy supply that is vital to continued economic growth and
maintenance of social peace. Stepped up public expenditures for reconstruction in the south also
helped restore disrupted livelihoods. Confidence in the financial sector has not been lost and
companies have been able to borrow. Without these measures, the economic effects would have
undoubtedly been worse, as important sectors like construction, tourism, and trade all suffered
significant losses due to physical clashes, lack of confidence and border closures.

25.     Nonetheless, the 2010 events have had a serious social and poverty impact. The
conflict in the south created social tensions that left a residue of bewilderment and fear that is
typical of post-conflict situations. At its peak, an estimated 75,000 refugees fled to neighboring
Uzbekistan and an added 300,000 were temporarily internally displaced within the southern
oblasts of the Kyrgyz Republic. While the refugees and internally displaced have returned to
their homes and their immediate needs have been addressed, efforts are still needed to complete
long term housing reconstruction and repairs, livelihoods-restoration and social services
programs. There was a large-scale destruction of public and private property, especially housing
and commercial enterprises. The JEA estimated private housing costs related to the destruction
and damage at $105 million. For commercial and public property, the estimate is $240 million.
Other physical damage relates to destruction of power transmission, as well as gas and heating
distribution systems in the south. These items are estimated at $145 million. Thus, total physical
damages amount to $490 million or the equivalent of 13 percent of GDP. The associated need
for housing, livelihood support, social reconciliation and peace-building continue to be critical
priorities.

26.     After years of steady reduction, poverty increased by 2 percentage points as a result
of the 2010 events. The closure of the border with Kazakhstan for six weeks, the restrictions on
trade imposed by the Kazak authorities as well as the persistent closure of the Uzbek border,
have affected border trade carried out by communities with a high incidence of poverty.
Farming was disrupted by delays in supply of inputs, especially during the sowing season in the
north of the country, as well as sustained drop in bank lending and cut-off of credit to the south,
leading to a 3 per cent drop in the agriculture output. Finally, the sectors that bore the brunt of

                                                7
 
 


the disruptions and the growth slowdown, construction (-23% drop in output) and tourism, are
labor-intensive sectors. The tourism sector has been badly hit by the April and June events and
the perception of lack of security. In particular, tourism has all but dried up in the important
region of Issykul, with highly significant losses in income and employment. On the other hand,
the reversal in April 2010 of the energy tariff increases that came into effect at the beginning of
the year had a positive impact on poverty; it bolstered household incomes, especially of the
urban poor, with the effect being much more muted for the rural poor who though dependent on
electricity are not beneficiaries of the district heating and hot water systems. Moreover, the
earlier rise in tariffs was accompanied by increases in public sector wages, pensions, social
allowances for privileged groups, and targeted cash transfers for the poor, but these have not
been reversed. According to latest data9, poverty and extreme poverty reached 33.7 percent and
5.3 percent in 2010, respectively.

                                 C.             MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

27.     Economic growth is expected to average 6 percent over the next four years if the
political situation stabilizes and security improves. With relatively strong quarter one
performance, we project real GDP growth of 6 percent in 2011 and for three years thereafter.
The growth will be driven by the recovery in agriculture, trade, and other services, as well as a
significant increase in gold production enabled by recent and planned investments in the Kumtor
mine, which currently accounts for 7 percent of GDP. Strong growth of private remittances,
which is expected to reach around 16 percent in 2011, based on first quarter data, and to continue
thereafter, together with the planned fiscal stimulus, will provide support to demand for goods
and services. In 2011, private investment is expected to remain unchanged at around 19 percent
of GDP, but higher government investment spending by 1.5 percentage points is expected to be a
stronger driver of growth. As of 2012, growth will be primarily driven by investment and output
increases in the private sector, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors,
and not least $450 million of investments planned in the energy sector, which alone would add 1
percent to GDP growth for 4-5 years starting in 2012.

28.      Growth will be supported through a number of important reforms. First,
privatization presents significant potential for increasing FDI and productivity. The authorities
have committed to privatizing telecommunication companies, the Zalkar Bank (a spin off from
the AUB), and a number of resorts that could drive private investment in the tourism industry.
Second, reforms and activities to attract investment in the energy sector are also part of the
government’s plans and already ongoing discussions with China are expected to result in the
financing of $450 million for the Datka-Kemin transmission line connecting power generating
capacity in the south of the country to consumers in the north. In addition, the Ministry of
Energy is taking a number of initiatives to increase profitability, improve transparency, and
attract investments in this high-potential sector (particularly hydro), but deep-seated reforms in
regulation and pricing will be needed if private capital is to be attracted. Third, a number of
activities have been initiated to support access to credit for the private sector (more details
below). Finally, other reforms to improve the business environment are also currently discussed
in the context of recently commenced work on a medium term development strategy, the first
draft of which is expected in June this year. These reforms are expected to generate significant

new investments across a relatively wide range of private sector activities, including mining,
agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors.

29.     Inflation is expected to moderate, but remains a concern. Following a sharp rise in
2010 to 19 percent, almost entirely driven by international food and fuel price increases (see
chart above), inflation is projected to decline to 12-13 percent range in 2011, assuming
international commodity prices stabilize. The increase in domestic prices would moderate with
more stability and security, especially in the south. However, high inflation in the first quarter
may result in higher inflation expectations, which poses a challenge for monetary policy. Thus,
the authorities have already started tightening monetary policy by raising the policy rate by
almost 500 basis points and the sale of NBKR notes, as well as by increasing the reserve
requirement in February by 1 percentage point. Monetary policy will be tightened further if
needed. By 2012, inflation is expected to drop to a range of 7-8 percent, but uncertainty is
significant with risks on the upside.

30.     To support growth and complete the reconstruction process in the south, the
authorities will continue their fiscal stimulus in 2011, but undertake significant
consolidation from 2012 onwards (see Table 2). The fiscal expansion will enable the
authorities to carry out increases of wages in health and education sectors where average wages
are close to minimum consumption level, and complete reconstruction in conflict-affected areas
in the south, which was not completed in 2010 as originally planned. The stimulus will be
followed by a sharp fiscal consolidation, particularly in current spending. Capital expenditures
(including net-lending) will remain high, at around 7 percent until 2015 because of the expected
investments in the energy sector to be financed by China.

    The fiscal stimulus will, in addition to promoting growth, support social safety nets in the face of
    higher food and energy prices. The planned fiscal stimulus, in addition to supporting growth, will provide
    support to social safety nets and poverty reduction. Specifically, the authorities plan to increase the
    threshold for the means tested unified monthly benefit by 19 percent as of July 2011 to offset coverage
    erosion and purchasing power of monthly benefit payments due to recent inflation. Furthermore, the
    increase in salaries for teachers, health sector employees, and technical level civil servants, starting in May
    2011, is also expected to improve the social safety nets within their families. Currently, average salary of
    $84 and $89 for education and health sector employees, respectively, are just above the minimum
    consumption level of $75, while those of technical level staff are significantly below $75. Finally, the
    reconstruction activities in conflict affected areas in the south will have a positive effect on social safety and
    poverty. The increase in social spending is particularly important given the 25 percent increase in food
    prices in Kyrgyz Republic in 2010, the impact of which on poverty has not been measured, but has no doubt
    been negative.

31.     Public expenditures are projected to increase from 38 percent to 42 percent of GDP
in 2011. About three-quarters of the expected expenditure growth is attributable to the
government’s plan to increase salaries in health, education and social sectors by up to 250
percent. Capital expenditures are set to increase by 1.5 percentage points, primarily as a result of
reconstruction activities in the south and a small increase in pension expenditures. On the other
hand, the government will cut non-essential spending on goods and services by 1 percentage
point of GDP.

32.    Revenues are also expected to increase, but more modestly and the deficit will widen
to 7.7 percent in 2011. With economic recovery, non-grant revenues are expected to increase
1.4 percentage points; grant revenues will increase by an equal amount. Based on the above
expenditure and revenue projections, the deficit is set to widen from 6.5 to 7.7 percent.

33.   The authorities aim to bring the fiscal position back on a sustainable path in the
medium term. They recognize the necessity to undertake significant fiscal consolidation
from 2012 onwards. Specifically, the reconstruction program in the south is expected to be

                                                           10
 
 


largely over in 2011, which would reduce capital expenditures by 1.4 percentage points of GDP
in 2012. The wage bill in 2012 will be contained through a nominal freeze and planned civil
service reform, with only limited pay increases granted thereafter. By 2014, the wage bill will be
reduced by around 1 percentage point, expenditures on goods and services by 1.5 percentage
points, and capital expenditures on non-energy-projects by 2.6 percentage points of GDP.

34.     Reforms to improve efficiency and ensure fiscal sustainability will need to be carried
out in the social sector, including pensions. Pension expenditures have increased significantly
in recent years due to government decisions to ensure a certain level of consumption capacity for
the retired population and are expected to amount to just below 9 percent of GDP in 2011. As
the revenues from social contributions are projected to drop by 0.7 percentage points, the
government plans to restrain the growth of pensions as a share of GDP, but the exact mechanism
is not clear yet. As transfers from the government budget to the pension fund have been on the
rise in recent years (2 percentage points increase between 2008 and 2010), a clear reform path
will need to be developed to ensure not only fiscal sustainability over the medium term, but also
long-term sustainability of the pension system.

35.     On the revenue side, several policy and administrative measures will be
implemented to increase tax revenues to by around 1.5 percentage points by 2014. These
measures will broaden the tax base and reduce or eliminate a number of tax exemptions. For
instance, weight-based customs valuation will be replaced by value-based, excise taxes on
tobacco and alcohol will be reformed and the number of exemptions for VAT and turnover taxes
will be reduced. As a result of the expenditure and revenue measures discussed above, and in
spite of the expected significant reduction in grants, the non-energy-projects deficit will drop to
4.4 percent in 2014 (Table 2).

36.      The financing for 2011 fiscal deficit has been identified, and a contingency plan has
been prepared in case of a shortfall. The 2011 budget foresees financing from a mixture of
external sources amounting to 5.4 percent of GDP (Table 2) and 2.3 percent in domestic
financing (1.6 percent from privatization proceeds, -0.1 percent NBKR, and 0.9 commercial
banks). Foreign financing is expected from the ACF, EU, ADB, IMF, WB, and bilateral donors,
primarily Turkey. Financing from the ACF, could be as large as 2 percent of GDP, but its timing
is not yet certain. The government plans to generate 1.5 percent of GDP in financing by
privatizing Kyrgyztelecom. A contingency plan has been developed, should there be a financing
or revenue shortfall. Although not part of the planned budget financing, the government intends
to sell its 49 percent stake in the mobile phone operator MegaCom, estimated at $200 million. If
it becomes necessary, the government will consider a supplementary budget proposing cuts in
non-essential current and capital expenditures. Finally, the government has committed to save
75 percent of the dividend payment by Centerra Gold, as well as any other windfall revenues.
These measures will be sufficient to finance the deficit in case some planned sources of
financing fail to materialize in time.

37.     In the financial sector, reforms will continue to support bank resolution, enhanced
supervision, and other activities aimed at securing its stability and easier access to credit.
With outstanding loans amounting to around 12 percent of GDP, the banking sector is relatively
small. However, its stability needs to be restored following the 2010 shakeup and significant
increase in NPLs. Several aspects of the banking system will undergo reform. First, the recent
crisis has exposed weaknesses in the bank resolution framework and the authorities are now
taking steps to strengthen it with measures to prevent undue court interference and to improve
the clarity of triggers for intervention. Second, efforts are underway to strengthen bank
supervision which will have to be intensified, particularly in case of systemically important
banks. Third, a number of legislative reforms will be carried out to strengthen independence,
accountability, and technical capacity of NBKR through amendments to the Law on NBKR and
the introduction of a new banking code.10 Finally, measures are being taken to strengthen the
deposit protection system. Several of these measures will be directly supported through this
operation and others will be supported by the IMF through the three-year ECF.

38.     The current exchange rate policy of managed float has served the country well and
will be continued into the future. The flexible exchange rate policy has enabled the authorities
to manage significant internal and external shocks in recent years, while they have been able to
smoothen the exchange rate shocks. The evolution of real exchange rate has been in line with
fundamentals and does not pose an issue for the growth of exports. Therefore, inflation
management in combination with flexible exchange rate policy, with interventions only to
smoothen shocks, remains appropriate.

39.     Driven by demand recovery and high international commodity prices, the current
account deficit will widen in 2011, but is expected to slowly narrow thereafter. Net exports
are likely to make a slightly negative contribution to growth in 2011, as import growth is
expected to outweigh that of exports by 7 percentage points. The planned fiscal expansion
coupled with high international commodity prices and new investments in the Kumtor mine will
be the primary driver of import growth in 2011, projected at 31 percent. Consequently, the
current account deficit is expected to widen significantly to 8.9 percent in 2011, but will start
narrowing thereafter, as export growth is projected to pick-up. However, planned large-scale
investments in the energy sector with substantial import component will prevent a faster
reduction in CAD.

40.     Most of Kyrgyz’s public debt is external and highly concessional. Virtually all
external debt is contracted on concessional terms with average interest rate equal to 1.3 percent
of the debt stock. Of the total external debt, 66 percent is owed to IFIs and 33 percent to bilateral
creditors.

  The new banking code will ensure that only constitutional laws will supersede the banking laws, it will strengthen
NBKR powers related to early intervention and banking supervision, it will limit the scope of judicial review for
actions taken by NBKR and provide legal protection for its staff and agents, and secure adequate protection of
shareholders and creditors in the banking sector.

1/ Budget support loans and grants are included in the financing gap. For 2011, they are sufficient to cover the gap.



41.     Under the baseline scenario, external public debt will start falling over the medium
term. The government intends to prepare a new medium-term debt management strategy
covering 2012-2014. The key elements of the new strategy are to maintain the share of grant
financing to GDP at the same high level and to pursue the planned fiscal adjustment. In
particular, the authorities will seek concessional terms for $208 million for the power sector loan
from China and possibly another $240 million for related projects, but in a few years time; the
grant element of these loans is expected to be 35 percent. The authorities have also been active in
pursuing debt write-offs and have reached preliminary agreement with Turkey on the write-off of
a $49.5 million debt, which is expected to become effective in late 2011. Discussions are also
ongoing on debt relief of about $194 million owed to Russia. Under the baseline scenario, which
assumes GDP, export, and deficit targets shown in Table 2, as well as grant element of public
borrowing of 34 percent and nominal interest of around 1 percent, external public debt will be on
a declining trajectory (Table 4) with a small exception of 2013, when significant borrowing for
energy sector projects is expected to take place.11

   Recent negotiations with the Chinese have resulted in an increase in the grace period and hence in the grant
element of planned foreign borrowings from China to 35 percent.

                                                                    14
 
 


42.     The Joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis conducted in 2011 shows that
public sector debt is sustainable with moderate risk of debt distress. Under the baseline
scenario, as discussed, as well a scenario where key variables are kept at their historical
averages, present value of debt is on a downward trajectory. Stress tests show indicative
thresholds for debt level would be exceeded under certain shocks. PV of external debt-to-GDP
ratio would exceed the indicative risk threshold of 40 percent in the medium term under shocks
to a) export growth, b) increase in borrowing by 10 percent in 2012 and 2013, and c) a shock that
would combine lower GDP and export growth, currency depreciation, and increased borrowing
in 2012-2013. The indicative threshold for PV of debt-to-revenue ratio would be breached under
the last two scenarios, but the PV of debt-exports ratio would not be breached under any
scenario. Debt service to revenue ratio is the most sensitive to an increase in borrowing in 2012-
2013 by about 10 percent and the combined shock mentioned above, both of which would
increase debt service to revenue ratio from 5 under the baseline scenario to 8 in 2014.
Importantly, debt service thresholds would not be breached under any of these scenarios. In
sum, sustained growth, fiscal consolidation, and prudent debt management/borrowing strategy
remain essential for debt sustainability.

43.     The macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for the proposed ERSO. The
risks – political, social, and economic – and the implementation challenges are discussed in the
final section of this document. The policy framework will support economic activity in 2011 and
thereafter lead to fiscal consolidation. An impressive beginning with governance reforms has
been made. Measures to safeguard social spending will create the conditions for stability and
social reconciliation.


                                III.     GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

44.     The post-April government concentrated on strengthening security across the land
and in particular, reasserting central control over the entire country following the clashes
in the south in June. Rebuilding trust in the government and confidence in public institutions
was a high priority, as was embarking on social reconciliation. The social agenda required the
government to strengthen protection for the conflict-affected and aid the restoration of
livelihoods. The main economic challenges required the government to stem the downward
spiral in economic output and employment through a fiscal stimulus, prevent a possible crisis in
the financial system, and at the same time to continue market-oriented reforms to bolster private

investment. A firm grasp over macroeconomic policies was maintained and the authorities
obtained rapid, large-scale donor assistance to finance budget and investment needs.

                                                           A.   POST-CONFLICT RECOVERY

Response to the Crisis

45.     Protecting essential social expenditures was given top priority. In view of the
anticipated fall in tax revenues in line with the contraction of the economy, the authorities took
prompt action to define a new category of essential expenditures which includes wages of public
sector workers, pensions, social protection transfers, expenditures on health and education, and
capital expenditures related to rehabilitation and reconstruction of the conflict-affected areas.

46.     Addressing the needs of the internally displaced and the vulnerable was seen as
urgent. The government responded to the June events by establishing a Commission for the
Assessment of Damages to address restoration of livelihoods, the reconstruction of housing and
commercial enterprises, as well as the restoration of markets to provide critical support to the
economy and create jobs. Current priorities are being established through an open process of
wide participation and a strategy for reconciliation in the south is being drawn up. Focus will be
on the recovery of businesses and agriculture, rehabilitation of basic and vocational education,
provision of cash transfers for vulnerable groups, generation of employment through labor-
intensive public works, initiation of inter-community reconciliation, and establishment of
psycho-social support for victims of clashes.12

47.    The authorities took important commitments and actions to enable safe return of
the displaced. The government announced its commitment to provide full choice to displaced
individuals and families in the design of housing solutions for them and not to resort to
involuntary resettlement of any affected individual or family. The clashes and its aftermath
revealed the weakness of the state and its lack of control over the security apparatus and the local
administration. A precondition for stability and recovery is therefore the reestablishment of an
impartial security regime capable of protecting all citizens.

Priorities in 2011

48.     The new government developed a one-year plan of actions highlighting its priorities
in 2011, and is currently formulating the 2012-2014 Medium Term Development Strategy
(MTDS) with technical support from the development partners. The main focus of the strategy is
to restore political and macro-economic stability, and to address the stress factors that brought
out the internal conflict of June 2010.13 Strengthening governance and reducing corruption is the
overarching theme of the government reform agenda.

                                                            
12 For example, returnees while rebuilding their homes and/or businesses, people who lost employment, elderly /

pensioners, female headed households, and people dependent on seasonal labor.
13
   Key drivers of instability are believed to include (i) poverty and socioeconomic disparity; (ii) disputes over farm
land, irrigation water and commercial assets triggered by the high population density; (iii) harsh border regime with
disputed boundaries and several territorial enclaves; (iv) the trade in narcotics; (v) youth unemployment; and (vi) an
ineffective administrative and security system.

                                                                       16
 
 


49.     To address the social reconciliation issues, a new Department on Ethnic
Development Issues, Religious Policy and Public Relations has been established at the
President’s Administration which is currently working on a Concept of Ethnic Development and
Integration of Kyrgyz Republic to be presented to the Parliament. An early draft of the Concept
recommends an increased emphasis on a shared national identity, integration of the population,
increased inter-regional links, the protection of different ethnic identities, equal employment
opportunity for all regardless of ethnicity, non-discrimination, the need for a multi-cultural and
multi-lingual curriculum, reform of the educational curriculum, and support from the Office of
the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.

                                  B.     ECONOMIC REFORMS

50.    The strategy for recovery and sustained growth was based on the recognition that
the post-conflict shocks to business confidence would lead to falling private sector
investment and, thus, to a sharp decline in the rate of economic growth. Falling domestic
demand would affect fiscal revenues, reducing the capacity of the state to undertake vital
expenditures, including additional outlays on social spending. The authorities saw the need to
undertake additional public expenditures as a bridge to the period when private confidence is
substantially restored through:

          a combination of external financing for the budget and some counter-cyclical fiscal
           policy, implying a relaxation of the original fiscal deficit targets, so as to finance
           additional current expenditures, largely associated with the events;
          external support for essential reconstruction and rehabilitation needs to be undertaken
           largely by the public sector to substitute for the private demand shortfalls, and to
           safeguard production and employment; and
          external support for key priorities in the revival of private sector growth and financial
           support for the banking sector.

51.     The elected government that took office in December 2010 represents a continuity of
central objectives. Its program places macroeconomic stability and a reduction of the fiscal
deficit over the medium term, as core priorities. Sustained growth would require reforms to
contain the expansion of public expenditures on pensions and the wage bill and to attract
investment and innovation. These reforms would aim to improve management of public
enterprises, energy and infrastructure services, and the business climate. The government will
need to raise budget revenues through tax and customs policy and administration reforms. In
several areas, policy work conducted in the past will provide guidance and impetus to reforms; in
others (such as pensions and some aspects of the governance agenda, regulatory reforms) fresh
policy thinking will be required.

Governance

52.     The interim government took immediate steps upon coming into office in April 2010
to improve governance. The goal was to create conditions for higher standards in public
accountability, enforcement of control over budget expenditures, and the management of public
assets. The government confirmed that governance will continue to be a major focus of reforms
over the medium term, with particular emphasis on the energy and the mining sectors.

53.     The new authorities decided to adopt a parliamentary system of government to
replace the presidential one in light of the experience of abuse of presidential powers. The
constitution was amended to this effect later in the year following a popular referendum. A
cabinet system of government headed by a prime minister answerable to parliament and with the
powers of the president greatly attenuated is an innovation for the country. This constitutional
change was motivated by a widely-felt need to disperse executive power and bolster
accountability to parliament. It was also driven by the need to widen consultation and debate
within parliament, engage with the public at large, and allow a range of opinions within
government to be expressed and evaluated before executive decisions were taken. The
Parliament is already beginning to hold the government to account; the budget committee in
particular subjected the 2011 budget to a close scrutiny and successfully enacted amendments to
it.

54.    To make a parliamentary democracy work, institutions have to be built and
governance practices re-engineered including the strengthening of local government as well.
The responsibilities of local self-governing bodies and revenue-raising authorities were rolled
back in recent years. Now opportunities exist to strengthen citizens’ participation in local
planning and decision making.

55.      The government is committed to following principals of budget transparency. The
MoF publishes approved budget laws, revised budget laws, changes to budget laws, mid-term
budget framework, and monthly and annual budget execution reports on its website
(www.minfin.kg). The website of the Treasury (www.kazna.gov.kg) has detailed execution
reports with the breakdown by republican and local budgets, reports on nonfinancial assets and
liabilities, cash flows, sources of financing budget deficit, and annual consolidated financial
statement. The Parliament’s website (www.kenesh.kg) also has links to submitted draft laws,
draft laws under consideration, approved and refused draft laws. This is expected to continue.

56.     In fact, the new Parliament has introduced budget hearings prior to budget
approvals. The budget committees involved civil society organizations, professional
associations, mass media (including press and television, which broadcasted budget hearings),
ministries, and independent experts. As a result the degree of openness practiced during the 2011
budget approval process was unprecedented.

                                            Box 2: Governance: Challenges & Efforts to Improve
     There are substantial governance challenges facing the Kyrgyz Republic, especially as the country
     recovers from recent conflict. The country compares poorly with other countries of the region on
     accountability, control of corruption, government effectiveness and regulatory quality according to the World
     Bank Governance indicators, and is in lowest quintile of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception
     Index as of 2010 ( ranked 164th out of 178). In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for
     2010-2011, the average rating for institutions in Kyrgyz Republic is 113 out of 139 countries, but only 132 out
     of 139 with respect to the question on irregular payments and bribes. Improving transparency and
     accountability and reducing corruption remain important for achieving strong growth and poverty reduction.
     Efforts to meet the challenges have progressed gradually with occasional slippages. The government has
     been taking actions to increase transparency and accountability in public finance management as well as in
     energy and mining sectors. There have been reductions in restrictions on starting businesses thereby reducing
     bureaucratic discretion, but earlier perceptions about the country continue to inhibit private investment.
     Specifically, in respect of public finance management, the government publishes the proposed budget, the
     approved budget and the executed budget. This year, the government has reversed the previous regime’s
     arrangement of keeping a significant share of public investment expenditures outside the budget process,
     strengthened the medium term budget framework, and took steps to improve monitoring and regular reporting of
     budget execution.
     The authorities continue to take steps to improve governance within mining and energy sectors. The
     Kyrgyz Republic joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and a recent EITI assessment
     found it fully “EITI Compliant” and gave an award for “Successful implementation under challenging
     circumstances.” In the energy sector the authorities have taken steps to improve transparency and governance
     through the Fuel Energy Sector Transparency Initiative whereby its receipts and expenditures are monitored
     frequently and will be available to the public.
     The country has a liberal trade regime and has made progress in opening up the business environment. It
     is the only Central Asian country to be a WTO member and is among the best in Central Asia in Doing
     Business, ranking 44th out of 183 countries in 2011.

57.      The government has committed to enhancing transparency and accountability in the
country, starting with four areas that are significant for the economy. These four areas
include public financial management, privatization and state-asset management, mining as well
as energy. These actions comprise of reversing inappropriate actions taken by previous regime as
well as actions to take the country forward in improving governance. The abolition of the
Central Agency for Development, Investments and Innovations (CADII) created by the former
regime reduced centralization of power that CADII was meant to implement as all policy and
investment decisions and management of borrowings were concentrated in one body that the
former President operated without public scrutiny. The Development Fund was also put in
liquidation. In addition, privatizations completed under the previous regime covering the two
electricity distribution companies, Severelectro and Vostokelectro, and the telecommunications
company Kyrgyztelecom, were cancelled when the new government found clear evidence of
procedural breaches.14      The governments’ agenda also included actions to strengthen
transparency and accountability in mining and energy sectors. The Energy Sector Transparency
Initiative (ESTI) has already been adopted and the mining sector has already become compliant
with the internationally recognized Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and their
continued implementation is expected increase transparency and accountability in areas that are
economically significant (for more details see section V).
                                                            
14
  . These privatizations were carried out in early 2010 and assessed to fall short of international good practice as it
allowed privatization of state assets by auctioning/bidding but without an established pre-specified minimum
reservation price and without proper valuation of assets of these companies.

                                                                   19
 
 


58.    The authorities have taken systematic actions to avert the impact of the global crisis
on the Kyrgyz financial system. Over the course of 2008-10, the authorities implemented
various crisis contingency measures:

       (i)    launched a deposit protection system in August 2008 that became effective in
              November 2009;

       (ii)   the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) required banks to prepare anti-
              crisis contingency plans starting in October 2008, and banks increased liquidity,
              tightened lending standards, and increased provisioning;

       (iii) the government and NBKR issued a joint resolution in December 2008 on Measures
             for the Rehabilitation of Banks of Systemic Importance that identified the roles of
             the NBKR and the MoF and allowed for capital injections into systemic banks
             through the budget;

       (iv) NBKR set up emergency liquidity support for banks by establishing the Specialized
            Banks Refinancing Fund in January 2009;

       (v)    NBKR required banks to perform stress tests;

       (vi) NBKR increased the number of its targeted bank inspections, and required all banks
            to send a weekly report on their liabilities and expected outflows; and

       (vii) NBKR lowered the discount rate from 14.4 percent in January 2009 to 1.6 percent
             in November 2009 to facilitate lending.

59.     The April and June 2010 events led to substantial financial instability, revealing
deficiencies in the governance and supervision of the banking system. Prompt interventions
were required by the interim government to restore stability and improve governance in the
banking sector. There is evidence that the banking sector was the main channel that was used by
the previous regime to channel funds out of the country, including fraudulent schemes at AUB.
NBKR introduced temporary administration in AUB, the large insolvent bank, and six other
banks (two of which later returned to normal operations) and direct supervision in 12 banks
(which was later withdrawn from eight of these banks) to stem the fraud and transfers. AUB was
nationalized in August, put under liquidation and then restructured into a new bank named
Zalkar Bank on December 24, 2010 which is currently undergoing a thorough review of its assets
and liabilities. In the absence of a sound bank resolution legal framework, the intervention in
AUB has engulfed the authorities in a complicated legal process and has absorbed much of the
capacity of NBKR. In the meantime, NBKR has prepared and initiated implementation of
special bank supervision strategies for problem banks and issued an instruction to its supervision
committee to enhance its supervisory response mechanism by end-August 2011. These actions
should enable NBKR to better monitor and preempt similar potential risks in the future.

Social Protection

60.    A significant reform of the social protection system was initiated at end-2009 with
the aim of expanding the recipients’ choice through the provision of cash instead of notional (but

                                               20
 
 


often unavailable) or badly targeted benefits, simplifying administration (cash privileges as
compared to in-kind privileges), and mitigating the effects of energy and heating tariff increases
on vulnerable households. Moreover, the reforms would improve transparency of public
spending. Specifically, the reform process is aimed at:

          Monetization of in-kind benefits. Categorical benefits that were mainly provided in-
           kind, through direct payment of costs to the providers, are either cashed out or
           abolished.
          Elimination of certain categories of (poorly targeted) categorical benefits. Of the
           previous 39 groups of beneficiaries receiving over 40 in-kind benefits, 25 beneficiary
           groups are still eligible for assistance in the form of cash benefits, but no in-kind
           benefits remain.
          Improving targeting of the current transfer systems to reach the poor and reducing the
           leakages to non-poor. Specifically, the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI), which
           determines the eligibility threshold for the means-tested monthly benefits for poor
           families with children (previously known as UMB), was raised significantly.
           Eligibility remains limited to households with children, which fits the country’s
           poverty profile well. Monthly benefits for poor families with children were
           instrumental in helping respond to the global food crisis.
          Providing increased payments to vulnerable households to soften the impact of the
           price increase. In January 2010, electricity tariffs were raised by 56 percent and 114
           percent for industrial and household consumers, respectively, and increases of 186
           and 110 percent were put into effect for hot water and district heating in urban areas.
           Specifically, the monthly social benefits (MSB) are transformed into flat-rate benefits
           no longer related to the GMI and increased from an average 524 som to 1,000 to
           2,000 som per month. MSB remains rights-based rather than needs-based, but the
           beneficiary categories (e.g. children with special needs, people with different degrees
           of disability, old age people not entitled to any pensions fall into high vulnerability
           groups. In addition, the government established top-up payments to low wage public
           sector workers and low pension recipients, and indexed military pensions.

61.      The social benefits established earlier to cope with higher electricity tariffs were
preserved. Although the interim government rolled back both the rise in household electricity
tariffs (fully) and the rise in industrial tariffs (substantially) in light of heavy social pressure
following the April events, the rise in benefits was not reversed. During 2010, changes in the
eligibility criteria for the monthly benefits for poor families with children were put into effect so
as to direct the benefit towards low income families with children; as such families were most
vulnerable to poverty. The elected government adheres to the reform principles above.

                       IV.            BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

       A.          LINKS TO PROPOSED INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE (ISN) AND EARLIER COUNTRY
                                    PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY/JCSS15

62.     The proposed policy based lending (ERSO) is envisaged in the proposed Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) and in the earlier Joint Country Support Strategy Progress Report (2007-08).
This is in response to the impact of events of April and June 2010, whereas earlier it was to be
mainly in response to the 2008/2009 food-fuel price hike and the global crisis, both requiring
financial support to the budget from its development partners, including the Bank.

63.    As part of this response, the Asian Development Bank, the IMF, and the World
Bank in partnership with other IFIs16 prepared a Joint Economic Assessment (JEA) of the
impact of the April and June events. The JEA identified the need for external support in three
major areas:

                     Essential public expenditures and services. With emergency expenditure needs
                      rising, the budget would have to address these while maintaining other spending in
                      line with authorities’ regular spending plans.
                     Social needs. The resettlement and integration of the internally displaced and the
                      needs associated with other affected populations has put an unsustainable burden on
                      fiscal resources. Through support for housing, livelihoods, social protection and
                      other social programs identified in the JEA, donors can make an important
                      contribution to economic and social recovery.
                     Critical investments. The JEA found that needs associated with destroyed private
                      commercial and public buildings were closely tied to recovery prospects. Moreover,
                      critical needs in energy and transport exist and if financed would make a large
                      contribution to reconciliation and building peace. Financing need for such
                      investments would be needed as a bridge to the period when the private sector
                      resumes investing and enhance the economic security of the country by strengthening
                      energy and transport.

64.    The JEA formed the basis for a donor conference, co-chaired by the government and the
Bank, on July 27, 2010 in Bishkek during which donors pledged $1.1 billion over a three year
program for reconciliation, recovery, and reconstruction.

   The Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (JCSS), 2007-2010 was one of the first in the World
Bank Group. The eight development partners constituting the JCSS were the Asian Development Bank, Swiss
Cooperation, UK Department for International Development (DFID), United Nations, World Bank Group, European
Commission, Government of Germany, and the IMF. The JCSS supported the Kyrgyz Country Development
Strategy (PRSP equivalent).

Commission, the International Finance Corporation, and the United Nations.


                                                               22
 
 


65.     As its contribution to the JEA-based donor effort, the Bank pledged $80 million in
IDA support in fiscal year 2011. It rapidly prepared an Emergency Recovery Project (ERP)17
in the amount of $70 million so as to provide urgently needed funds into the economy in the
interests of maintaining essential social expenditures, and to restore and ensure continuous
provision of basic energy services for the affected areas of the south. The credit supported
economic output and employment by generating local works and ensuring adequate heating
during the winter. Additional financing in the amount of $10 million was provided for the
National Road Rehabilitation (Osh-Batken-Isfana) project with the objective of improving access
through expansion of secondary roads to the conflict affected areas in the south. This project
supported the recovery of livelihoods in agriculture and the rural areas, and enhanced
employment opportunities. It is estimated to create 5500 person-weeks of employment for
unskilled workers.

66.     In late 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic obtained a special allocation of IDA-15 funds in
the amount of $56 million. These funds, to be committed in the current fiscal year, are devoted
to additional financing for a health swap project ($24 million), focusing on access to health
services in conflict-affected areas, additional financing for an irrigation project ($15 million),
additional financing for a disaster hazard mitigation project for clean-up of uranium tailings in
the mining sector ($1 million), and additional financing for the roads project ($16 million). The
proposed budget support operation is designed as a single tranche operation aimed at supporting
actions in policy areas identified by the new government as priorities. It will lay the ground for
implementing a medium term reform program that would be supported by another Development
Policy Operation that could either be another stand-alone operation or the first in a series of
programmatic Development Policy Operations from fiscal 2012 onwards.

67.     The ERSO is being presented to the Board together with the Interim Strategy Note
that covers the period August 2011 to June 2013. As explained in the ISN, the focus of the
IDA assistance effort will be on countervailing the major stress factors that underlay the conflicts
of 2010 and on building institutional capacity to strengthen governance and public management.
The ERSO -- together with a possible series of programmatic development policy loans -- will
ensure adequate financing for the budget (taking into account the contributions of other donors)
so that essential spending, especially in the social sphere, is protected, and support is provided
for economic stabilization over the medium term. Greater economic and social stability will
contribute to the prospects for social peace. The new government has emphasized that it saw the
Bank playing a key role as an advisor and financier of its post-conflict recovery and
reconciliation program as well as long term investment needs. The Interim Strategy Note defines
the proposed IDA program.

   This was an investment operation prepared under operational policy guidelines on rapid response to crises (OP
8.00), with a retroactive element of $35 million that financed past budget expenditures and hence had the character
of being fast disbursing budget support. The remainder financed energy repairs, rehabilitation and investments.

                                        B.     CONSULTATIONS

68.    A number of meetings were held with various stakeholders, including civil society,
government and donors during February and March 2011 to describe the economic program
being supported by the ERSO as a part of overall consultations on the Interim Strategy. The
subjects that received the most attention were governance and energy sector reforms -- and civic
society organizations in particular looked for firm monitoring of the budget and accountability
for all budget spending. Bank staff explained the role stakeholders could play in the
development of the official medium term development strategy (MTDS). The process of
consultations will be deepened in the course of the preparation of DPO series, and active
mechanisms for participation in the formulation and implementation of the MTDS will be used.

                 C.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

69.    The World Bank has been collaborating closely with the IMF and other donors to
support the Kyrgyz Republic’s reform agenda. This collaboration has been particularly active
through the process of preparation and update of the Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) led
by the World Bank jointly with seven development partners; Asian Development Bank (ADB),
European Commission (EC), the German government, IMF, Swiss Cooperation, UK DfID, and
United Nations agencies. In addition, the World Bank collaborates with DfID, the EC, the Swiss
Cooperation, and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) through a
multi donor trust fund (MDTF) established to support the reform agenda on Public Financial
Management (PFM). The World Bank and the IMF have also been coordinating their respective
interventions in the banking sector, with the IMF providing a resident advisor to NBKR while
the World Bank has provided technical assistance in complementary areas of bank resolution,

                                                      24
 
 


prompt remedial actions, and problem bank action plans. In addition, the World Bank and the
IMF collaborate on regular conduct of the Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).

70.    The World Bank and the Fund took the lead amongst donors to ensure adequate
funding for the budget in 2010. The IMF Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) approved in August
2010 provided $34 million in support of the 2010 budget. These resources have helped Kyrgyz
government maintain its macroeconomic stability while mitigating the impact of crisis in 2010.

71.    A three-year program with the Fund under the extended credit facility (ECF) in the
amount of $106 million was approved in June 2011. It supports fiscal consolidation over the
medium term, with Fund resources to be used as needed for budget support. Budget financing
from the ADB of $40 million approved in December 2010 was disbursed in March 2011.
Support to the 2011 budget is also expected from the Anti Crisis Fund (ACF) of the Eurasian
Development Bank in the amount of around $106 million and the European Union in the amount
of €32 million in grants.

                    D.    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

72.     The reforms supported under this operation will add to effectiveness of several on-going
projects in the Kyrgyz Republic:

73.     The Capacity Building for Economic Management (CBEM) Project is assisting the
government in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for
formulating and implementing sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity
of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
formulate and carry out the policies. There are strong synergies with areas of reform under the
budget support operation: macroeconomic policy coordination, regulatory environment, fiscal
policy and capacity and institution building in various public agencies.

74.     The Payments & Banking System Modernization Project is developing a modern
integrated national payments system that is accepted and used by the commercial banks and their
clients. This is providing basic infrastructure that is essential for the development of a modern
banking system that will increase the efficiency of payment services and facilitate the growth of
financial intermediation, areas which will strengthen the implementation of the banking and
financial sector reforms supported by the budget support operation.

75.     The Governance Technical Assistance Project is strengthening institutional capacity to
implement the measures under the program outlined in the GSAC Program Document and to
assist with Treasury modernization. The public finance management reforms supported by this
operation are advancing the implementation of the Governance TA project by supporting full
operation of the Treasury Management Information System.

76.    The operation was designed as a single stand-alone budget support to address the needs
of the budget in 2011 in an environment that economic recovery and social reconciliation and
peace building efforts have taken the center stage. Nonetheless, the formulation of the proposed
program draws on the lessons learned from the implementation and mid-term review of the
CAS/JCSS and the ICR of the GSAC project, both of which reflect the generally weak
governance environment in the Kyrgyz Republic.




                                                         26
 
 


77.     Ownership is a key lesson. The preparation of the proposed budget support operation has
involved working closely with the most senior levels of the new government in trying to build a
program that is aligned to the government priorities in the area of recovery and reconciliation
strategy. The operation focuses on areas which are of priority to the government.

78.     The design of this operation also builds on the lessons from the ICR of GSAC in avoiding
complex structures which strain the reform commitment and implementation ability of the
government. This operation has built a program which is solid yet not complex. Moreover, the
government’s implementation capacity and supporting TA are important elements for a
successful implementation of the reform program. The team has assessed the TA needs across
pillars of the reform program and has built in TA support through some of the ongoing projects
and TAs (e.g. GTAC and PFM MDTF, Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) TA
projects for NBFI and for Deposit Protection Agency capacity buildings, Health SWAP, Social
Protection), and plans to seek additional TA possibilities. Donor coordination related to the
provision of technical assistance in support of achieving the objectives of the program will be an
important determinant of its success. The JCSS has succeeded in stimulating donor partnership
and in presenting a joint approach to reform to the government.

                                     F.        ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

79.   The preparation of this operation has been supported by recent economic and sector
work.

80.     The JEA, prepared in July 2010, has provided the main platform for the Bank
activities in the Kyrgyz Republic, including the preparation of the ERSO program. As a
multi sector report, the JEA addressed post crisis needs of the country and relied heavily on the
existing and ongoing AAA and TA work in the energy, financial and social protection sectors.

81.     Recent AAA in the financial sector underpins the ERSO program. An early
assessment under the Financial Sector Monitoring study in 2009 highlighted the vulnerabilities in
the banking sector, including the high concentration of deposits in AUB. It noted deficiencies in
the supervisory response mechanism and recommended an assessment of the adequacy of
NBKR’s contingency plans and crisis management framework to ensure that they were
comprehensive, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders,
including NBKR, MoF, and DPA. The study also noted deficiencies in the bank resolution
framework, which allowed bankrupt banks to linger for years unresolved and recommended
further strengthening of the legal framework for bank resolution. A comprehensive vulnerability
assessment was completed in March 2010 before the crisis of April 2010, which identified many
of the risks that subsequently materialized.18 In response to the crisis, the World Bank quickly
mobilized additional TA to strengthen the Deposit Protection Agency’s capacity in case of
deposit payouts in failed banks, to identify vulnerable banks and to develop bank-specific action
plans, to enhance the legal framework for bank resolution, and to strengthen NBKR’s
supervisory response mechanism. In these activities, the World Bank has been coordinating
closely with the IMF to avoid duplication of efforts and to ensure that all critical issues were
being addressed.


           V.          THE PROPOSED ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT OPERATION

82.     The proposed operation supports Kyrgyz Republic’s post-conflict recovery and the
transition to medium term growth and poverty reduction. Following the political and civil
strife of mid 2010, the country met the immediate challenges of security and reconstruction, and
now faces the task of recovering from economic contraction. The government has placed a
strong emphasis on combining limited fiscal expansion with reforms to strengthen governance
and safeguard social protection. The proposed operation supports the budget and implementation
of government’s reforms (between April 2010 and May 2011) and thus provides a bridge to
medium term policy actions that the government plans to take once its medium term strategy is
adopted. There are twelve prior actions that the proposed operation supports; all of which have
already been implemented.

                A.             THEME I: STRENGTHENED GOVERNANCE IN MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC
                                               ASSETS AND REVENUES

83.     Strengthening transparency and accountability in the public sector, is supported by
the operation. The newly elected government is committed to improving governance as a means
of restoring confidence of the people and the private sector. Thus implementing actions to
increase transparency and accountability comprise this component of the operation. The
activities relate to the areas of public investment, privatization, and mining and energy. Given
                                                            
18
     See Banking Sector Vulnerability Assessment: Kyrgyz Republic, June 2010 (final draft).

                                                               28
 
 


significant weaknesses in governance in the Kyrgyz Republic, the actions supported by the
operation are a bridge to a larger program of reforms that will feature prominently in the
government’s medium term development strategy that is under preparation.

84.     The ousted government had centralized power in a new agency, established a
Development Fund (DF) outside the budget and privatized state enterprises in ways that
indicated weaknesses in process. This was part of a general trend under the previous regime
when the role of parliament was reduced, consultations on policies limited, and overall
transparency and accountability of government actions reduced. The Central Agency for
Development, Investment, and Innovation, (CADII), was made responsible for decisions on
public investment, policy/strategy formulation, the mobilization of external finance and the
coordination of policy implementation, thereby disempowering the ministries. A Development
Fund (DF) was also set up to hold and allocate incoming external finance to investment projects
outside the budgetary process as well as to place its liquid balances into instruments of less than
investment quality in an opaque manner. Several large SOEs were privatized without a due
competitive process thereby increasing opportunities for corruption. There is strong evidence
that connected lending also grew rapidly during that period, especially in AUB, resulting in a
rapid increase in non-performing loans thereafter.

85.     The new government abolished the off-budget DF, re-established budgetary
accountability for public investments and adopted better norms, standards and processes
for privatization and state asset management. The responsibility for the development of the
public investment program, the choice of projects, and the management of public capital
spending will be firmly in the hands of the MoF. The DF has been put in liquidation and its
holdings placed in a special account in the central bank. An international auditor has been
identified to conduct a financial audit of the DF. The government intends not to establish any
extra-budgetary funds. All capital spending will form part of the budget and submitted to the
Parliament on a consolidated basis.

86.     In both these areas there is a significant medium term agenda for reforms to
improve governance. In public finance management, despite progress in selected areas, the
system still has some substantial weaknesses to overcome. In respect of privatizations and
management of state enterprises, the State Property Committee has been elevated to a ministry
and is constitutionally responsible for the management of government shares in state owned
enterprises. The proposed ERSO supports the following prior actions:

          The Development Fund that was designed to hold and allocate incoming external
           finance to investment projects outside the budgetary process has been placed under
           liquidation pursuant to Interim Government Ordinance Number 31, dated April 30,
           2010, and the audit of said Development Fund by an external auditor appointed by the
           Recipient has commenced.
          The following Resolutions of the Recipient have been passed to establish improved
           asset management norms and practices for the Ministry of State Property: (i)
           Resolution Number 178 of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, dated August 27,
           2010; and (ii) Resolution Number 309 of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic,



                                                29
 
 


           dated December 8, 2010; and (iii) Resolution Number 104 of the Government of the
           Kyrgyz Republic, dated March 14, 2011.

87.     Mining sector. Improved management and transparency of the country’s mining sector
is required, to avoid allocations of mining titles in an arbitrary manner. Non-transparency also
inhibits international investment. Despite excellent mining potential, the Kyrgyz Republic has
been unable to move beyond a one-operator country for the last 15 years. A number of investors,
despite having exploration or production licenses, are unable to access the mineral deposits
because of social unrest and opposition by the local communities. Implementation of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) which covers the full publication and
verification of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas, and mining, has
somewhat helped to increase transparency and accountability. EITI implementation will have to
be followed by increased outreach in remote parts of the country, beyond Bishkek and Issyk Kul.

88.   The interim and newly elected governments reaffirmed their commitment to the
standards of transparency contained in EITI. The country has recently taken steps to
complete EITI compliance with the global standard against 20 criteria and a special prize for
“achieving remarkable progress in implementing the EITI in difficult circumstances” was presented to
President Roza Otunbaeva at the 5th Global EITI Conference in Paris on March 2-3, 2011. The
authorities plan to continue implementing EITI beyond the period of the proposed operation,
with technical assistance from the World Bank.

89.     The government has also focused on improving the management of mineral
resources in line with international best practices. Social aspects of mining are receiving
more attention because of a challenging situation in the regions that has at times blocked access
to the mining sites. The new government is determined to implement a transparent system in
line with high international standards for mining tenders. The World Bank is currently working
with the authorities to put in place a system for mineral tenders that will meet international
mining sector best practices and attract new investment to the sector.

90.    The proposed ERSO supports the following prior action:

          The Recipient has achieved compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency
           Initiative’s (EITI) global standards for improved transparency in the oil, gas and
           mining sectors as evidenced by the declaration made by EITI at the March 2011
           Global EITI Conference.

91.    As a result, Kyrgyz Republic is now one of the 11 countries having the status of
EITI Compliant. The number of mining enterprises that provide EITI reports that are subject to
independent reconciliation has increased from 25 to 46. These reports, which reflect the
companies’ financial flows from mining activities, have been available to public and provide a
mechanism to implement the principles of transparency and public participation in monitoring.

92.    Energy sector. This sector, overwhelmingly public, accounts for 4 percent of GDP and
16 percent of the industrial production, and its performance is critical for the performance of the
Kyrgyz economy. The sector has a significant potential for export that is unrealized. Other
advantages of the power sector are relatively low cost of power generation, reliance on clean

                                                30
 
 


sources of energy, and the near universal access to power supply. However, the sector is hobbled
by extremely weak governance, equivocal regulatory environment, and lack of transparency in
its operations and its accounts. Large commercial losses, coupled with evidence of significant
theft of power by vested interests and unrecorded exports under the previous regime are some
examples of key governance problems. Persistently weak governance led to significant
deterioration of the energy assets, poor sector performance, and inadequate financial viability.
The current authorities have taken major steps to initiate a process of improved governance and
transparency in the sector.

93.    Transparent management of electricity revenues is important to the public whose
life and work depend on reliable supply of electricity. The full cooperation of the public is
also needed to make the sector financially viable. There is a very low degree of trust in the
energy sector among the local population, foreign financiers and other investors. The authorities
recognize that reforms in the energy sector are central to removing a key structural impediment
to growth; and that with energy reforms under way and given the low cost of energy production,
Kyrgyz Republic would be highly competitive for investment in the sector, and more broadly in
the economy. There is also a clear understanding of the need for an integrated approach towards
reform in the sector including specific policies to reduce losses and measures to enhance
transparency of accounts for electricity companies. The government has already taken a number
of important steps to improve the sector’s management. The main focus is currently given to
improved governance of the sector both from points of increasing transparency and
accountability as well as improving the state regulation. The following actions have been taken:

94.     First, the authorities established a Supervisory Council at the Ministry of Energy in
mid-2010 to raise standards of disclosure and transparency in the sector. Half of the
membership of the council consists of representatives of the civil society. The council exercises
surveillance over the sector. Major actions by energy companies, e.g., tariff changes, exports,
new investments are to be disclosed to the council and agreed, with the major objective of
making all developments transparent.

95.     Second, in mid-2010, the authorities established special escrow accounts at power
generating and transmission companies where all export receipts are to be deposited. These
funds are then allocated for specific purposes such as the purchase of fuel for winter heat and
power generation. The use of proceeds from the escrow accounts is to be monitored by
representatives of the Supervisory Council. Clear rules and procedures for managing the cash
collected on these special escrow accounts are established through the Ministry of Energy.

96.     Third, the authorities have introduced Performance Agreements as a new
performance management and accountability tool. These agreements are signed between the
state regulator and the energy companies. This is a first attempt of the state in ensuring
accountability of the companies’ management. The performance agreements establish clear
responsibilities and obligations of the companies’ management in improving the companies’
performance and achieving the agreed targets. Indicators have been established for measuring
improved performance by companies.

97.   Going forward, the authorities need to develop longer-term policy and investment
measures to improve the energy sector’s governance and performance. The government

                                               31
 
 


realizes that the key to strengthened governance is establishing proper mechanisms for reporting
and accountability of the sector entities – generation, transmission, and distribution companies.
As licensed natural monopolies, the power sector entities should have a regular reporting
requirement to the state authorized body in charge of sector regulation; as joint stock companies
the power sector entities are required to undergo annual financial audits under the Kyrgyz
Republic laws. Given the weaknesses in governance and related deficiencies in the internal
control systems of these entities, it is essential that the financial audits be conducted by
independent and reputable audit firms. Further, the authorized regulatory body should disclose
and publish the key technical and financial data about the sector’s performance.

98.     The authorities need to take further actions to improve the regulatory function of
the state. While the introduction of Performance Agreements is a very welcome step, these
agreements need to be further strengthened to clarify the system of incentives and penalties. To
properly carry out the sector regulation, there is a major need to establish adequate metering and
data acquisition system to enhance the sector accountability and strengthen internal controls. At
a minimum, the metering needs to be improved to validate power inflows at commercial nodes of
the network, from generation plants to transmission company, wholesalers and large consumers,
with special attention to exports and imports and from distribution companies to end users.
Additionally, a Metering Protocol needs to be established to stipulate clear rules and procedures
for the collection of power flow data for planning and billing purposes. Once the metering and
related accountability and transparency issues are addressed at the wholesale level, the metering
system can be rolled down to the distribution segment.19

99.     There is a need to increase predictability of the revenue streams and establish clear
rules to manage centralized escrow accounts at the Settlements and Savings Company
(SSC). These accounts hold the proceeds of utility payments made by consumers, and these
proceeds are then allocated across the entities by the Ministry of Energy. The reformed rules
must be totally transparent and incorporate objective criteria that would incentivize greater
efficiency. As part of the reformed rules, the following will need to be considered: (i) the escrow
accounts remain blocked for sector entities till the bills of outside suppliers (including suppliers
of natural gas) are settled; (ii) the entities are rewarded for good performance, i.e. the entity that
performs better (lower losses, higher collections) get larger share of the collected cash.

100. Improving financial viability by reducing losses, improving collection rates, and
rationalizing the pricing system is critical over the medium term. Both the level and the
structure of the power sector tariffs have to fundamentally change to ensure that tariffs reflect the
true cost of supply that incentives are in place for sector entities for efficient operation and end-
users for energy savings. Also, while the subsidies in the power sector can be maintained as a
matter of policy choice, any subsidies maintained should be compensated from the state budget.
Given the lack of reliable information about sector costs and the severe under-valuation of assets
in the sector (no asset revaluation has been carried out and the assets are carried at their historical
cost) an in-depth tariff study is needed to reveal the structure and level of costs in the sector. The
government has set up a commission (jointly with parliament) to study the optimal way of

                                                            
19
   Development of a metering program including installation of automated metering and data acquisition system for
the wholesale electricity transactions as well as the supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) is
being supported by the ADB Power Sector Improvement Project.

                                                               32
 
 


raising tariffs. A policy of gradual increases over the medium term with protection for the
vulnerable and clear communication will be a part of the Medium Term Development Strategy.20

101. The authorities need to take urgent steps to ensure energy security including a
strategy to meet winter energy needs and a power export plan. Given that both base and peak
loads in the Kyrgyz Republic are covered by hydro-generation year-round, developing a base-
load thermal capacity to address the issue of the winter deficit is important. Furthermore, given
that the country has summer surpluses, the power sector has significant potential for export of
power even without major investments in generation. Such exports could compensate for imports
of gas and coal and ensure timely payments to avoid supply disruptions and improve the
country’s trade balance. Finally, the country’s authorities need to address the existing inadequate
transmission capacity to supply both southern and northern territories that increases dependence
on neighboring countries and electricity wheeling costs. The country is heavily dependent on the
Soviet-era regional water and power network, also involving Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and
Tajikistan. Power was supplied to southern and northern Kyrgyz Republic through the regional
grid. However, neighboring countries are moving toward national energy self-sufficiency. The
Kyrgyz energy sector with constrained funding is much behind.

102.          The proposed ERSO supports the following prior actions:

                     The Kyrgyz Republic has adopted the Energy Sector Transparency Initiative (ESTI)
                      pursuant to Presidential Decree Number 49, dated July 20, 2010, and the following
                      measures have been carried out: (a) the Supervisory Council (SC) of the Ministry of
                      Energy, comprising representatives of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic,
                      power companies and civil society, has been established to supervise ESTI
                      implementation; (b) the SC has adopted internal regulations for its governance; and
                      (c) a transparent and rules-based mechanism for managing and monitoring financial
                      flows, particularly, electricity export proceeds in the escrow account, has been
                      established.
                     Performance Agreements that include indicators pertaining to losses and the
                      collection of revenue in the energy sector have been signed and are in effect between
                      the Energy Regulatory Authority and the energy companies.

103. These measures for increased transparency and accountability are only initial steps
in a medium term agenda to restore public trust and to operate in the public interest.
Setting up the Supervisory Council has established a basis for dialogue between the government,
energy professionals, and the civil society that is expected, in a longer term, to help build trust
and lay a foundation for further reforms in the sector. Increased transparency and improved
management of power export proceeds are expected to help partially address the issue of winter
deficit through timely payments for the critically needed fuel (coal, mazout, gas) for winter heat
generation. The transparent and rules-based mechanism for monitoring and managing financial
flows, especially electricity export proceeds instituted by way of opening escrow accounts at the
power plants and the Kyrgyz National Electricity Grid companies will enable the power export
                                                            
20
   The USAID Regional Energy Security, Efficiency and Trade (RESET) project in Central Asia is conducting a
management diagnostic study of the main energy companies in the Kyrgyz Republic which involves a separate Cost
of Electricity Review expected to be finalized by end-2011.

                                                               33
 
 


proceeds and its use to be accounted for and managed transparently. The Ministry of Energy is
expected to submit to the government and to the Supervisory Council (which have representation
from civil society) under the Ministry of Energy, quarterly reports on balances of and use of
funds from the escrow accounts for their recommendation. Finally, the introduction of the
Performance Agreement has helped to restore the accountability of the energy companies by
clarifying the responsibilities of the companies, setting clear indicators and targets for the energy
companies that would, ultimately, lead to improved operational performance of the energy sector
reflected in reduced losses and improved collections.

104. Financial Sector: Establishing a clear framework under which actions can be taken
to maintain financial sector stability is a key requirement for economic recovery. Reforms
supported jointly by the IMF and the World Bank to establish such a framework so that banks
and their customers have clarity in terms of the rules under which the banks operate and address
banking system distress, are important. . The cumulative effects of the 2009 crisis and 2010
conflict highlighted the relevance of these reforms to avoid a full-blown banking crisis and
contagion, as well as to promote orderly resolution of problems.

105. The authorities have taken bold measures to restore stability and avoid contagion.
They have implemented temporary administration in seven banks, direct supervision in twelve
banks, and nationalization of the AUB followed by its liquidation and restructuring into the new
Zalkar Bank. The NBKR has intensified supervision and in some cases suspended certain bank
operations when needed. These efforts, however, have stretched the NBKR’s capacity.
Supervising the still-fragile banking sector will continue to be highly demanding for the
foreseeable future.

106. Improving legislative frameworks to address problem banks and establish an
effective deposit protection system are important for stability and development. The NBKR
plans to redefine the role of the Supervision Committee, introduce a revised supervisory response
mechanism, and prepare and initiate the implementation of action plans and bank-specific
supervision strategies with respect to each of the problem banks in early 2011. The government
will re-establish the independent status for the Deposit Protection Agency (DPA) with an
appropriate supervisory board providing oversight, thus paving the way to improve governance
in the deposit protection system through clarified roles, responsibilities, and accountability of
DPA, NBKR, and the government. Amendments to the Law on the Protection of Individuals’
Deposits will, inter alia, ensure that deposit protection will be available for depositors in all
banks, including those that violate prudential norms.

107. In the medium term, continued reforms to strengthen frameworks for bank
resolution, supervision, contingency planning and regulation will be needed. The crisis
simulation protocol has to be strengthened. The deposit protection system will be strengthened
to ensure prompt payment on a level playing field of protected deposits in banks under
liquidation. The authorities realize the importance of protecting access to finance during periods
of economic stress, as well as the crucial role that both banks and non-bank financial institutions
play. As noted above, the microfinance industry came under pressure as its main source of
currency swaps, the AUB, was required to suspend operations. NBKR stepped in to roll over the
existing stock of such swaps and offered guarantees to other commercial banks offering swaps to
MFOs. It lowered capital requirements on MFOs, inter alia by permitting deposits placed by

                                                 34
 
 


MFOs in banks that were used for hedging to be subtracted from the asset base of the MFO, as
well as allowing risk-based classification of assets. Moreover, MFOs’ provisioning requirements
for loans secured with a group guarantee were reduced.

108. There will have to be measures to strengthen the legal and institutional frameworks
for microfinance lenders and parts of the non-bank financial sector. NBKR will revisit
minimum capital requirements for existing and newly entering banks with the aim to strengthen
competition. Reforms to modernize the secured transactions system (i.e., use of collateral to
secure loans) will be undertaken to re-invigorate bank credit for enterprises and households.
Reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic Post Office will be undertaken to expand its provision of
financial services. Both Aiyl Bank and the Finance Company for the Support and Development
of Credit Unions will be privatized to enhance their governance structure, enlarge their range of
products and services, and increase their access to commercial funding sources.

109.    The proposed ERSO will support the following prior actions:

       The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), as the banking supervisory
        authority, has restructured the financially distressed OJSC AsiaUniversalBank (AUB)
        into a new entity, the Zalkar Bank, and has introduced direct supervision and temporary
        administration procedures for the rehabilitation of financially distressed banks.

       NBKR has issued Directive Number 30, dated May 26, 2011, for improving supervisory
        response mechanisms to identify shortcomings in, and initiate prompt preventive and
        corrective action to, financially distressed banks in the Kyrgyz Republic.

       The Deposit Protection Agency has been reconstituted as an independent legal entity by
        Government Resolution Number 269, dated May 31, 2011.

110. These actions will strengthen governance, enhance stability, and increase access to
finance. For example, by managing the insolvency of a major bank and preventing contagion to
the rest of the financial system by introducing temporary administration or direct supervision in
vulnerable banks, NBKR helped to restore stability and confidence in the banking sector. By
initiating the implementation of action plans and bank-specific supervision strategies to
strengthen problem banks, NBKR has helped to restore financial health in some banks while
initiating resolution of other banks. When the bank supervisory response mechanism for
identifying critical shortcomings in banks and initiating prompt responses is adopted, NBKR will
be better equipped to supervise the banking sector, address vulnerabilities in a timely manner,
and resolve troubled banks efficiently.         By issuing a decision reestablishing DPA’s
independence, DPA’s legal status will be clear, paving the way for needed reforms to strengthen
the deposit protection system. Finally, by improving the CAR calculation for MFOs, MFOs will
need to set aside less capital, thus freeing up more resources to increase access to financial
services and enhance competition in the financial sector.

        B.             THEME II: SAFEGUARDING SOCIAL PROTECTION AND SUPPORTING CONFLICT-
                                          AFFECTED POPULATION

111. Safeguarding social assistance to the poor and to conflict affected families in the face
of fiscal pressures and improving targeting is a priority. This component seeks to maintain
real benefits of targeted programs and to rationalize the less well targeted ones. In addition, it
supports the provision of social assistance temporarily to conflict affected families because of
their heightened vulnerability and disruption in livelihoods.

112. The 2010 conflicts and economic downturn have caused new challenges to poverty
alleviation and heightened the need to strengthen targeted social assistance. The poor in
Kyrgyz Republic had been hit by a series of shocks: the food crisis in 2007-08, the global energy
price increases in 2008-09, the continuing global economic and financial crisis, and now in 2010-
2011 by political upheaval and instability affecting the entire economy and labor markets as well
as by recent food price inflation. The June events disrupted livelihoods by loss of life,
displacement, loss of employment, large-scale disruption of markets and economic activities.
Prior to the onset of crisis in 2010, poverty incidence was around 32 percent (2009 data); and the
most recent data reported by the National Statistics Agency indicates an increase to 33.7 percent.

113. Social assistance provided by the government that is targeted to the poor was far
from adequate to cover the vulnerable population. While the means-tested monthly benefits
to poor families with children was instrumental in helping respond to the global food crisis, this
was largely due to rapid donor assistance channeled through increases in the program to help
smooth consumption for poor households with children. When this emergency support faded, the
Government retained the responsibility to strengthen this monthly benefit so that it is a
meaningful tool to protect the poor in the face of shocks, including the current food price
inflation and future crises.

114. The current social safety net system consists of two targeted benefits (MSB &
monthly benefits to poor families with children (previously known as Unified Monthly
Benefit - UMB21) and a number of rights-based in kind benefits. The MSB with 65,000
recipients, is a cash income-replacement program that is categorically targeted (but not means-
tested) to disadvantaged groups, including children with disability up to 18 years of age and
other categories of people with disabilities, orphaned children, mothers of large families22, as
well as elderly who have reached pension age but do not qualify for pensions from the state
pension insurance system. The monthly benefits to poor families with children is a targeted cash
allowance program that is means-tested and has been provided to low income families with
children to bring the household low income to the level of Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI)
considered as minimum for basic needs. It is well targeted, with over 70 percent of funds going
to the lowest two quintiles and 54 percent to the first quintile.


                                                            
21
   The program is targeted to families with children from 1.5 to 16 years of age (or up to 23 years of age when still
studying). The monthly benefits to poor families with children also includes payment of a fixed birth grant and an
increased allowance for children from birth to 3 years of age, who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to
poverty.
22
   Mothers of 7 or more children.

                                                               36
 
 


115. Both the amount of the monthly benefits to poor families with children and its
coverage of the poor are low. The benefit covers the gap between the GMI (recently raised to
310 som per capita) and the household per capita income and fluctuates around 120 – 150 som
($2.7-$3.3) per capita in an average recipient household. This amount is far from sufficient to
cover the basic needs of poor families. Coverage of the poor is also low, as only 8.7 percent of
the population participates in the program (too low given the high level of poverty). More will
have to be done over the medium term to improve targeting given limited fiscal envelope and
high poverty.

116. The authorities have taken measures to prevent the erosion of monthly benefits to
poor families with children in the face of inflation. Given the relationship between the GMI
and the monthly benefit, the authorities raised the GMI by 10 percent in mid-2010 so as to
preserve the value of the benefit in real terms. However, with rising inflation in the rest of the
year, there has been a significant erosion of the monthly benefits. The government has then
committed to raising the GMI from mid-2011 by 19 percent and to significantly raise the MSB
targeted to children with special needs. The government revised the eligibility criteria for the
monthly benefits to poor families with children to tilt it more sharply towards families with
children taking the view that poverty was concentrated in such households. Also imputed
income from certain assets such as livestock and agriculture land was revised to reflect reality
more closely.

117. The authorities have also taken actions to reduce the number of poorly targeted
categorical benefits, but much more remains to be done. The number of poorly targeted
categorical benefits was reduced from 39 to 25. The remaining 25 categories are non renewable
and are expected to be extinct in several years. In addition, the monetization of benefits has taken
place with the transformation of the major categorical benefits to direct payments in cash.
However, more will need to be done in the future to move away from a system that is still
partially rights based to one that will be predominantly needs based.

118. In the post-conflict period, the government provided significant support to the
affected people. Social assistance package in the form of cash compensations, support to re-
establish livelihoods, efforts towards recovery of private businesses and to stimulate investment
and trade were provided by the authorities in the conflict affected areas. Suffered businesses
were granted exemptions from profit tax, sales tax, immovable property tax and land tax, and
reduced payments of patent tax, unified tax and payments under tax contracts. To further
stimulate employment, businesses in the south were granted lower payments towards social fund
contributions. The re-establishment of essential infrastructure and utility services such as public
transport in Jalalabad and Osh and electricity repair has also helped significantly to raise output.

119.   The proposed ERSO supports the following prior actions:

          In its respective national budgets for 2010 and 2011, and pursuant to Resolutions
           Number 131 of July 20, 2010, and Number 134 of April 4, 2011, respectively, the Recipient
           has increased the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) by ten percent (10%) during
           the mid-2010 to mid-2011 period, and by 19 percent (19%) from mid 2011 onwards,
           in order to maintain the value of Monthly Benefits for the Low Income Families with
           Children in real terms.

                                                37
 
 


          Pursuant to Presidential Decree Number 795, dated December 22, 2009, On Providing
           Monetary Compensation to Selected Categories of Citizens in Connection with Changing
           Energy Prices, in-kind social benefits that would have been provided to beneficiaries
           have been monetized as direct cash payments to be made to beneficiaries, with the
           number of rights-based categories of said beneficiaries reduced from thirty-nine (39)
           to twenty-five (25).
          Pursuant to Interim Government Decree Number 124, dated August 24, 2010,
           additional monthly social benefits for families affected by the national crisis of 2010
           have been introduced.

120. These prior actions will contribute to improved targeting and increasing the level of
assistance for the most vulnerable categories of the population, as well as towards
addressing the immediate social and poverty needs caused by the 2010 conflicts. The
increase in GMI will help offset the negative income effects of recent food price inflation on the
poor segments of the population. The monetization of benefits and reduction in the number of
categorical benefits increase efficiency of government’s efforts to tackle poverty and provide
social safety nets, given very scarce public resources. The additional monthly social benefits
introduced as compensation to families affected by the 2010 events will reduce the poverty and
social impact on beneficiary families. They will also contribute to the efforts to restore
livelihoods and build an enduring peace.

121. Over the medium term, a comprehensive reform of the social safety net is required
for reasons of efficiency and sharper targeting. It also would prevent actions to contradict the
main policy principles. Having a strategy is needed to address the gap in development of social
services for the poor and the vulnerable. It would also mean that the government makes a
consolidated policy statement for social protection to the general public and the donor
community, who can direct their efforts around the proposed pillars.


                    VI.        OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

                          A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

122.    The core policy actions under the operation’s Theme I will have a positive social
impact. These measures address reforms in the category of “strengthening governance in
management of public assets and revenues”. The specific proposed reforms improve (i) capital
budget management, transparency in privatization process, and asset management; (ii)
transparency of the energy sector operations; and (iii) financial sector stability. These reforms
have a positive social impact as they signal greater accountability of the government to the
population and its commitment to greater transparency in the use of public funds.

123. The first of the three policy actions under Theme II is expected to have a positive
impact in reducing poverty. The first policy action is raising the Gross Minimum Income
(GMI) by 10 percent which has two beneficial consequences. First, it allows a greater number of
poor families with children to be eligible for the monthly benefits to poor families with children;
this is particularly important at a time where the number of recipient households has been falling.

                                                38
 
 


Second, it serves to increase the nominal value of this monthly benefit such that the real value
remains constant. The in depth poverty and social impact analysis report prepared for this project
showed that the increase in the GMI and the subsequent impact on the program of monthly
benefits to poor families with children would have a positive impact on reducing both poverty
and extreme poverty.

124. The second policy action in this area pertains to monetizing in-kind benefits and will
have a positive social impact by improving transparency and degree of usage of social
transfers. Benefits were monetized for selected groups (about 38 individual categories) such as
war veterans and disabled persons. The monetization resulted in a net gain for the recipient
groups (poor and non-poor) because their choice was no longer limited to particular goods or
services provided through the in-kind programs. Although, persons living at high elevations were
cut from the program, reducing the total number of beneficiaries by 83 percent, they were
eligible to apply for the monthly benefits to poor families with children. These changes in the
program led to both transparency and predictability of these expenditures in the budget but also a
de facto increase in income for the remaining beneficiaries. However, this greater transparency
has had a cost. Expenditures on social transfers have increased by 140 million KGS between
2008 and 2009 due to the monetization and have created greater fiscal pressure. Second, because
only 29 percent of these benefits go to those in the poorest quintile of the population, in
aggregate non-poor beneficiaries have benefited even more than the poor.

125. The policy matrix also includes the objective of re-establishing livelihoods and
providing social compensation to the south, with expected positive poverty and social
impact. The first policy action is the provision of additional monthly social benefits to conflict-
affected families. The poverty and social impact of these actions were positive since they were
likely to have prevented many of the conflicted-impacted households from falling below the
poverty line, especially since the majority of victims were working age males.

126. This operation is expected to have an overall positive impact on poverty through its
support for achieving fiscal sustainability and growth and also its protection of key social
sector expenditures, especially in social protection. In the Kyrgyz Republic, economic growth
has gone hand in hand with poverty reduction. The elasticity over the period 2006 – 2009 has
been 1.13 percent indicating that an increase in growth has led to an even greater fall in poverty.
Thus, with the added actions on reforming the safety net, especially raising the cash transfers to
those living in extreme poverty, the poverty impact of growth is likely to sharpen.

                                 B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

127. The specific policies supported by the operation are not likely to have significant effects
on Kyrgyz Republic environment and natural resources. The measures contemplated under the
ERSO operation are intended primarily to ensure growth, stability and fiscal prudence, and to
support the government in strengthening governance in management of public assets and public
finances, promoting private sector development, and nurturing post-conflict recovery and
safeguarding social protection. No negative effects on the environment can be foreseen from
these measures.

                    C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

128. The MoF which has the responsibility of coordinating donors’ activities and all external
assistance to Kyrgyz Republic will be the World Bank counterpart on the ERSO implementation,
as well as on the management and coordination of implementation of the proposed policy
measures among various ministries and agencies. Other key counterparts will include the
Ministry of Economic Regulation, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of State Property, Ministry of
Natural Resources, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, State Directorate for Rebuilding and
Reconstruction of Osh and Jalalabad, and National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.

                                     D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

129. Accounting, recording and reporting. Kyrgyz Republic has reasonably strong systems
of accounting, recording and reporting. Computerisation of treasury functions now enables
regional treasuries to agree expenditure details with the local transit banks daily before
submitting details to the central treasury which then agrees the total with the National Bank.
Revenue details are also received by regional treasuries which pass information to local tax
offices to enable them to update taxpayers’ accounts. There are established arrangements for
monthly and quarterly reconciliations between budgetary organisations’ records and those of the
central treasury that leads, each quarter, to reports to the President, the Parliament and the Prime
Minister. Although the arrangements are cumbersome and probably do not resolve all data
errors they are the only possible arrangements in the absence of a fully integrated system.

130. The introduction of a GFS 2001 compliant chart of accounts in 2007 has improved the
level of information available on a quarterly basis. No reports are made available to line
ministries or other bodies, neither are reports produced on resources received by local delivery
units. Annually a cash-based budget execution report, in respect of the previous financial year, is
produced by the government for submission to the Parliament by the middle of May. This report
is the nearest there is to financial statements, and, though it includes extensive information on
revenues and expenditures, in accordance with GFS 2001, it does not include accounting
policies. The huge amount of numerical data it does contain is not supported by any useful
summaries or commentary that would assist in their interpretation.

131. National accounting and reporting standards for the public sector are not fully developed
yet. However, the government issued a resolution in July 2009 on reforming accounting and
reporting in the public sector with the aim of introducing Cash-basis IPSAS in the public sector.
This was followed by a government Resolution in December 2009 on the introduction of unified
accounting software in budget organizations. These measures, if fully implemented, will go a
long way in improving accounting and reporting in the public sector.

132. Public sector auditing. Public sector auditing is performed by the Chamber of Accounts
(CoA), the equivalent of supreme audit institution (SAI) in the country. The Chamber of
Accounts is responsible for auditing the budget execution report, prepared by the MoF by mid-
May, and submitting its findings to the Parliament. No audit opinion is given; instead a report of
errors and violations is produced which is laid before the Parliament in September or October
following the year of account. The absence of a set of financial statements prepared in
accordance with internationally recognised accounting standards represents a limitation on what

                                                40
 
 


the Chamber can do. Its audit of revenues and expenditure each year is not complete with only
the consolidated statement of the MoF audited annually; the policy in relation to other financial
statements is not transparent. In addition to work on the annual budget execution report, the
Chamber undertakes audits of budget organisations, but does not separate reporting on its work
on the financial statements from compliance and the efficient use of resources.

133. The World Bank is supporting the Chamber of Accounts, through an IDF grant aimed at
supporting capacity building activities, including development of appropriate audit methodology.
It is expected that sustained technical assistance will enable the Chamber of Accounts to develop
sustainable capacity to conduct audits in accordance with international standards. Capacity
strengthening of the Chamber of Accounts is running in parallel to the efforts being made to
develop financial reports in the public sector that can be subject to audit resulting into expression
of audit opinion.

134. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has been audited regularly by
reputed international audit firms. The 2010 audit of the consolidated financial statements was
conducted by Grant Thornton (Armenia), who issued unqualified opinion on the financial
statements. Previous audited financial statements have also been unqualified with no major
issues raised in the management letter. A safeguards assessment of the NBKR is in progress and
will be completed before the end-2011. The last safeguards assessment was completed in 2009.
The authorities have updated the February 6, 2010 memorandum of understanding between the
ministry of finance and the NKBR on the management of foreign exchange reserves, including
those for budgetary support.

135. Public procurement. Public procurement has gone through some reform through
revisions introduced in the Public Procurement Law to bring it in line with international
standards; introducing principles and stages of an efficient procurement process, and defining the
mandate and authority of the State Procurement Agency. However, this agency, which was
established as an independent public procurement oversight body, was abolished in October
2009 as a part of the government reorganization which took place under previous government.
Instead, a new Department on Public Procurement Methodology has been established under MoF
while the procurement supervision function was not assigned to any organization. In addition,
the National Procurement Training Center has been taken over by a private ownership and the
range of procurement training has been gradually decreasing.

136. As such, budget entities have become solely responsible for the procurement process,
with no regular oversight from other government bodies. Random external audits are conducted
by the Chamber of Accounts once every two years. This decision seriously undermines a system
of checks and balances in public procurement and creates a responsibility gap for assuring the
quality of public procurement, especially given that the public sector internal audit is weak. This
heightens corruption risks in procurement.

137. The MoF has improved its website to bring more transparency to the procurement
system. The procuring entities can place their procurement plans, bidding opportunities and
contract award results on this website. However, the process for redressing tender violations
remains unclear. Given that public procurement carries a risk of high corruption, appropriate
oversight and transparency will need to be established as a priority. The MoF recognizes this

                                                 41
 
 


priority, but its capacity and current legal basis are the main constraints for immediate
improvements. The MoF Public Procurement Unit includes only five staff, whose major
responsibility concerns methodology of public procurement. Recently, the unit began to request
the minutes of tender commission meetings in an attempt to check accuracy of the tender
process; however, the unit’s capacity clearly is not sufficient to do this promptly and with
acceptable quality. The unit also drafted a new public procurement law that is intended to re-
establish appropriate procurement oversight. The process of approving the draft law will take
quite some time. Even once approved, there will be a need for extensive capacity and institution
building.

138. The treasury is developing a database of contracts, but there is an institutional gap in
monitoring the adherence to procurement rules. The Chamber of Accounts reviews procurement
process only during the regular assessment of budget organizations once every two years. The
government had noted that the supervision function in procurement had been reportedly a source
of administrative corruption. The provisional government will need to establish the procurement
oversight function to foster credible state institutions and to develop mechanism of dispute
resolution and handling of complaints to reduce corruption in procurement.

139. The World Bank maintains dialogue with the government on public procurement reform.
The government has actively participated in the Regional Public Procurement Forum.23 The
World Bank would provide more assistance through the on-going PFM project to facilitate
further reform, institutional development and capacity building in public procurement.

                                                               E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

140. The Recipient is the Kyrgyz Republic. The credit and grant proceeds would be made
available to the Recipient upon the effectiveness of the Financing Agreement between the World
Bank and the Kyrgyz Republic.

141. Disbursement. The Recipient will submit a withdrawal application to the International
Development Association (IDA). Upon receipt of the withdrawal application IDA will disburse
the amount in (one tranche) into a foreign currency deposit account that forms part of the
country’s official foreign exchange reserve and is opened for the purpose in the National Bank of
Kyrgyz Republic (the Central Bank). This account is available for budget financing and will be
managed by and subject to the control of the MoF. The Recipient will report to the World Bank
on the amount deposited in the foreign currency account and confirm its availability to finance
budget expenditures, within 30 days of receiving such funds. If, after depositing funds in this
deposit account, the proceeds of the credit and/or grant are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Financing Agreement, the World Bank will require the Recipient to either: (i)
return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (ii) refund the amount directly

                                                            
23
  The Regional Public Procurement Forum, an annual event initiated by the Bank in 2005, provides a platform for
public procurement officials from Central Asia and neighboring countries to share knowledge and learning,
exchange views and experiences, and discuss policy issues in public procurement reforms. Countries from other
regions (such as Korea, Singapore, Brazil) as well as relevant international organizations were also invited to share
experiences and good practices. The Government of Kyrgyz Republic has actively participated in the Forum
including hosting two of them.

                                                                            42
 
 


to the World Bank, in which case the World Bank will cancel an equivalent un-disbursed amount
of the credit.

142. The administration and accounting of the credit will be the responsibility of the MoF. The
proceeds of the credit and grant deposited at the Treasury account with NBKR will be converted
into local currency to cover budget expenditures or will be used for refinancing foreign debt
repayments. The MoF will be responsible for the credit and grant administration and for
preparing the withdrawal application, and maintaining the withdrawal application as required.
The MoF, with the assistance of NBKR, will maintain records of all transactions under the credit
in accordance with sound accounting practices.

143. No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The World Bank will not
require an audit of the designated account but will require the government to provide
confirmation to the World Bank in the form of an official letter from the MoF on the amounts
deposited into the foreign currency account within 30 days of receiving the funds.

144.    The closing date of the proposed operation will be June 30, 2012.

                                F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

Risks

145. Political risks. The country is still going through a peace and state building process. The
main political risk relates to the viability of the constitution, with some political parties
hankering for a return to a presidential system. A poorly managed political transition following
the late 2011 presidential elections and the constitution of a new government thereafter could
increase domestic instability and exacerbate regional fragility. Power sharing between the
executive and legislative branches is still to be properly defined, and the give and take of
coalition government is still to be fully internalized. Continued geographical polarization of the
country on ethnic lines or along a religious/secular divide are risk factors.

146. Social risks. A major source of internal risk arises from the continuation or even the
intensification of social strife in the south of the country that led to clashes and massive loss of
life in mid-June. Social tensions reflect competition for resources and are exacerbated by the
links between entrenched criminality (itself based on the lucrative drug transit trade in the south),
and rent-seeking political structures. Parts of the south are effectively out of the control of the
central authorities. Security forces, which like the civilian administration in the south are largely
mono-ethnic, continue with low-level harassment and extortion of minorities.

147. A continuation of social tensions will damage economic activity and lead to higher
reconstruction and recovery needs. It will also be a source of political instability and could
poison the climate for the efficient absorption of donor financial support.

148. Risk of macroeconomic and financial instability. As a small, open, and landlocked
economy, the country remains highly vulnerable to economic destabilization through external
shocks – prices, foreign demand, interest rates and capital flows. In addition, the current high
inflation and the need for fiscal consolidation whilst safeguarding essential social spending pose

                                                 43
 
 


risks to economic stability. Banking sector risks have diminished, but bank supervision needs to
be vigilant and the financial sector reforms are urgent. Although donors have pledged sufficient
support through the JEA and other channels, failure to deliver on external financing, particularly
budget support, is a risk – the consequences of which would be destabilizing for the economy.

149. External risks. The external risks stem from border closures with Uzbekistan. The
border with Uzbekistan continues to be closed or is open on occasions but with severe
limitations. Such border closures have a severely disruptive effect on production and trade as
well as local small-scale border trade, and lead to impoverishment of border communities.
Keeping open the channels for trade flows as well as ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted operation
of the common electricity grid with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that links these three countries
are important contributors to stabilization. Progress with the difficult agenda on regional
cooperation on energy and water sharing is essential in the interests of common prosperity.

150. Risks related to institutional capacity and governance. Severe shortcomings in
capacity at all governmental levels, partly the result of political changes and rapid staff turnover,
bedevil prospects for efficient program implementation. As noted, governance weaknesses and
potential corruption also constitute dangers to the proper use of public funds. In the event of
delays and difficulties in forming an effective coalition government following elections in late
2011, governance problems could well multiply during the power vacuum. The buildup of
human capital and knowledge in the public services is a major focus of donor assistance in
central government, the line ministries and the financial sector with large trust funds being used
for public financial management, governance, central bank supervision and surveillance of the
financial industry, standards in mining and health. Governance will be the major focus of the
development policy series.

Mitigating Risks

151. Clearly, not all risks of the complexity and gravity that are faced by the Kyrgyz Republic
are amenable to mitigation through an operation such as the ERSO. Nevertheless, the ERSO,
together with the interventions of other development partners, can make an important
contribution. Macroeconomic risks could be mitigated through a combination of fiscal prudence
and adherence to the medium term fiscal consolidation plan without any slippage as well as
sufficient external financing of the budget and of the recovery program over the medium term.
The authorities have identified clear priorities in public spending and have successfully protected
the essential. The authorities have shown flexibility in responding to the social tensions in the
south by combining dialogue with law enforcement measures, but clearly they have been
stretched to their capacity and beyond. The neighbors can play a significant confidence-building
role by announcing their determination to open borders or to keep them open and to ensure
reliable transmission of electricity.

152. A comprehensive and well integrated approach to promoting reconciliation, recovery and
reconstruction is important to mitigating the potentially dangerous social risks prevalent today.
A social reconciliation program is being developed and needs to be implemented with vigor.
The implementation of measures over a period of years will have to be handled with sensitivity
and skill.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Kyrgyz
                              Republic
On June 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic.26

Background

The Kyrgyz Republic is recovering from a deep political crisis last year. In April 2010, a popular
uprising toppled the previous regime and internal ethnic conflict in June 2010 exacerbated the
already difficult political situation. The subsequent constitutional referendum and parliamentary
elections in October 2010 have helped to stabilize the political situation and put the economy on
a path of recovery, though the political situation remains fragile with presidential elections
scheduled for later this year.

The fallout from the domestic crisis has posed significant challenges. Border closures, especially
with Kazakhstan, hampered Kyrgyz companies and households involved in trade. The security
situation led to the lowest tourist arrivals in almost a decade. Interruptions in the spring farming
season and problems in harvesting and marketing have led to losses in agricultural production.
Rising global food and fuel prices have posed additional challenges. The banking sector also
suffered from diminished depositor confidence and the economic effects from events in the
south. Subsequently, the economy contracted by 1.4 percent and inflation rose to nearly
20 percent in 2010. To counter rising inflation, monetary policy was tightened toward the end of
2010. Early signs of recovery have started to appear this year, with the economy growing by
3.2 percent in the first four months of 2011.

On the back of political and macroeconomic stability, the Kyrgyz economy is expected to grow
by 6 percent in the medium term with positive spillovers from its larger partners in the Region.
                                                            
26
   Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of
any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

                                                                        61
 
                                                 
 

Agriculture, tourism, mining and textile production will be important drivers of growth. Strong
export oriented growth and fiscal consolidation will help to reduce the current account deficit in
the medium term. Official development assistance, while slowing, will remain an important
source of financing the current account deficit and will help to maintain an adequate reserves
level.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors noted that the economy is recovering from a deep political crisis, which
disrupted activity and negatively affected near-term growth prospects. Directors commended the
authorities for their efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and acknowledged the timely and
coordinated assistance by the international community, which helped prevent the economy from
falling into a deeper recession. Directors noted that the recovery remains fragile and a steadfast
implementation of prudent policies and structural reforms are crucial to improving growth
prospects.

Directors acknowledged the importance of supporting the nascent recovery, but underscored that
fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild policy buffers, reduce vulnerabilities, and promote
inclusive growth over the medium term. In this context, Directors welcomed the revenue and
expenditure measures prepared by the authorities, and encouraged them to follow through with
contingency plans, possibly based on reductions in low-priority spending, if risks to the fiscal
position materialized.

Directors noted the risks and governance issues associated with extra-budgetary funds and
underscored the importance of channeling all public finances through the budget. They welcomed
the authorities’ decision to liquidate the Special Bank Refinancing Fund and their efforts to
increase the transparency of public finances through improved reporting and monitoring of large
state-owned enterprises. They also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the existing targeted
social assistance system, with the support of key development partners.

Directors expressed concerns on continued high inflation, and welcomed the central bank’s
timely tightening of monetary policy in response to growing inflationary pressures. Most
Directors agreed with the need for further policy tightening if inflation fails to decline in the
period ahead. Directors noted the staff assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals and highlighted that exchange rate flexibility has served the Kyrgyz Republic well.

Directors noted that developments in the banking sector have exposed shortcomings in the bank
resolution framework and the central bank’s de facto lack of supervisory independence. They
encouraged the authorities to take decisive action to resolve problem banks and restore
confidence in the financial system, and welcomed the selection of an external auditor for Zalkar
Bank. Directors stressed the need to reform the legal framework for early intervention and
resolution of problem banks, and highlighted the need for enhanced supervisory vigilance and
increased capital buffers for the largest state-owned bank.

Directors endorsed the authorities’ structural reform agenda, emphasizing that steadfast
implementation is critical to the success of the economic program. They welcomed plans to
improve the business environment, which is key to supporting private sector-led growth, and
stressed that energy sector reform would create an important driver for growth in the medium

largest energy companies, with assistance from key development partners.

Annex 4: Kyrgyz Republic – Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low Income Countries


Based on the joint IMF-World Bank Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework, the Kyrgyz
Republic is assessed to remain at a moderate risk of debt distress.27. Stress tests suggest that the
country is still vulnerable, particularly to a combination of exogenous shocks. Further improvement
of the debt outlook will depend on maintaining sound macroeconomic policies, including fiscal
consolidation and prudent borrowing, as well as ensuring continued concessional financing to
support the country’s large development needs.


                                                                 I. BACKGROUND

The Kyrgyz Republic’s nominal stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt
declined from about 100 percent of GDP in 2003 to 41 percent in 2008. This decline was mainly
the result of acceleration in the pace of economic growth and a nominal appreciation of the domestic
currency, but also reflected firm fiscal discipline and Paris Club support.

The Kyrgyz Republic had two debt restructuring agreements with the Paris Club. The first was
in December 2002 under Houston terms and provided for flow rescheduling in three phases. The
second was in March 2005, under the Evian approach. The Kyrgyz authorities indicated in early 2007
that they did not wish to avail themselves of the HIPC initiative, but subsequently expressed interest
in the MDRI.

Since end-2008, the nominal stock of PPG external debt has increased, reaching 57 percent of
GDP at end-2010. The increase in this ratio largely reflects the decline in nominal (dollar) GDP in
2009 and 2010 as a result of the international financial crisis and domestic political instability which
negatively impact real growth, but also reflects an uptick in external borrowing to finance
infrastructure development and crisis-related fiscal deficits. The present value (PV) of PPG external
debt was equivalent to $1.5 billion (34 percent of GDP) at end-2010, of which 66 percent is owed to
international financial institutions (IFIs), and the remaining 34 percent to bilateral creditors. At end-
2010, indebtedness indicators were estimated to be below the applicable HIPC Initiative thresholds,
while income levels were estimated to be above the IMF MDRI thresholds.

                                                         II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS

The macroeconomic assumptions reflect the framework underlying the ECF-supported
program and World Bank and IMF staff projections through 2031. They have been updated to
incorporate recent developments and changes to the medium-term outlook, but long-term assumptions
are broadly similar to the framework used in the last DSA. The data on the stock of external debt at
end-2010 and debt payment schedule were provided by the Kyrgyz authorities, except for the data on
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank debt, which were provided directly by the two
institutions.




                                                            
27
  This DSA has been produced jointly by Fund and Bank staffs, in consultation with Asian Development Bank
and the Kyrgyz authorities. The fiscal year for the Kyrgyz Republic is January 1–December 31. The risk rating
would not change with the inclusion of remittances (Figure 2).

                                                                      64
 
                                                                 
 

The framework assumes implementation of sound macroeconomic policies—including fiscal
consolidation and prudent public debt management—as a basis for sustaining growth. Near- and
medium-term growth would be underpinned by recovery from the shocks of 2009 and 2010, including
a rebound in agricultural production and tourism, and would be supported by infrastructure
investments and strong mining production. Long-term growth will be generated by firm
implementation of structural reforms to remove impediments to private investment, stimulate
economic diversification, and improve the business climate, including increased financial stability
and deepened financial intermediation. The energy sector, which has large potential, is also
envisioned to add positively to growth in the long run. The framework features average medium-term
GDP growth of around 6 percent per year and average long-term growth over 2017–31 of about 5
percent, as in the previous DSA.

The main updates relative to the last DSA reflect new information regarding the authorities’
infrastructure development plans and debt relief. Specifically, energy-related investments have
been delayed, partly because of the domestic political unrest in 2010. The Kyrgyz government is still
in discussions with the Chinese authorities to finance and assist in the construction of substations and
transmission lines linking to the south.28 The latest information indicates total investments in this area
to be about $450 million (compared to $550 million in the previous DSA), including $208 million
likely to be disbursed over the next two to three years. These investments would be financed with
loans from China and are expected to contain a grant element slightly less than 35 percent, but not
less than 30 percent. This borrowing would be accommodated in the ECF-supported program under a
tied, nonzero, nonconcessional debt limit in the equivalent amount. In April 2011, the authorities
reached an agreement with Turkey for a debt write-off in the amount of about $49.5 million, which is
likely to be effected in 2011.

Planned energy sector investments will ensure smooth supply of electricity within the country
and contribute to economic growth. During the construction period (2012–16), the energy
infrastructure projects are estimated to contribute around a quarter of a percentage point to GDP
growth annually.29 The electricity transmission lines, when built, will reduce system overloading and
increase the self-sufficiency of supply. The impact on exports and long-term growth from the energy
projects would be more significant if new large electricity generation facilities are built.30

The authorities have also explored the possibility of investing in transportation infrastructure
around a main tourist destination (Lake Issyk-Kul). Borrowings in this area could total
approximately $600 million and be financed on terms similar to those of the energy infrastructure
projects. Given the uncertain growth effects and the possibility of a significantly worse debt outlook


                                                            
28
   These energy infrastructure projects will expand the potential for exporting electricity, improve reliability of
the transmission system and ensure smooth supply of electricity to remote parts of the country. Neighboring
Uzbekistan has been threatening repeatedly to withdraw from the regional power grid that would leave the
southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic without electricity, given that the only way to supply electricity to the
south is through the Uzbek electricity grid.
29
   The contribution to economic growth will come from increased domestic spending, which is not likely to be
significant, as only around 10 percent of the disbursed financing from China will be spent domestically (the rest
will be used to purchase imported equipment and labor).
30
   Kambarata-II (hydropower) was put in operation in 2010, but does not generate substantial volumes of
electricity. Its contributions to exports and growth are therefore limited. Kambarata-I is a much larger project,
but remains highly uncertain and therefore excluded from this DSA, as from previous DSAs.  



                                                               65
 
                                                                                     
 

(Text Figure 1), the authorities have decided not to pursue this investment further at this stage.
Consequently, this borrowing is not included in the baseline DSA projections.

                          Box 1. Kyrgyz Republic: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to average about 6 percent over the medium term, underpinned by economic recovery from
the shocks of 2009 and 2010, including a rebound in agricultural production and tourism and in line with strong recent
growth in the main trading partners. Growth in the medium term would also be supported by infrastructure investments and
strong mining production. Long-term growth would be generated by firm implementation of structural reforms to remove
impediments to private investment, stimulate economic diversification, and improve the business climate, and is broadly in
line with the historical average and with assumptions in the previous DSA.
After two successive years of contraction, exports would rebound somewhat in 2011, in line with developments in the
mining and tourism sectors, and reflecting strong growth in the main trading partners. In the medium term, export growth
will decelerate as the Kyrgyz Republic joins the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus customs union and transit trade declines. Import
growth in 2011 would be strong, consistent with growth projections and reflecting the high price of crude oil. In the medium
term, import growth will also decelerate with the loss of transit trade, but the high import content of energy infrastructure
projects will keep dampen the deceleration somewhat. In the long-term, import growth would be in line with assumptions in
the previous DSA, averaging around 6½ percent. As a result of these trends, the current account deficit would increase in
2011, but gradually improve, averaging about 5 percent of GDP in the long term.
With the exception of the energy infrastructure borrowing from China, medium-term public borrowing is assumed to be on
highly concessional terms. Over the longer DSA horizon, concessionality of new external public borrowing would gradually
decline from around 38 percent in 2011 to around 20 percent by 2031, as more borrowing is assumed to be contracted at less
concessional terms from bilateral and commercial creditors.
In line with the programmed fiscal consolidation, government revenues are projected to increase from about 30 percent of
GDP in 2011 to about 32 percent by 2016 and remain broadly stable at that level through 2031. After a wage-related
increase in 2011, noninterest current expenditure would increase temporarily to about 33 percent of GDP before declining to
about 30 percent of GDP by 2016. As a result, the primary fiscal deficit would deteriorate to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2011,
but gradually improve to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2016. Fiscal consolidation and appropriately tight monetary policy will also
help to maintain (GDP deflator) inflation at an average of around 7 percent over the medium term.

                                     III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

                                                                  A. Baseline

The baseline scenario points to a cautiously favorable improvement in the external debt outlook
over time. At end-2010, the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios, at 62 and
119 percent respectively, were well below their policy-based indicative thresholds.31 Only the PV of
PPG debt-to-GDP ratio, at 34 percent in 2010, is close to its relevant threshold of 40 percent. This
latter ratio then remains broadly stable through the medium term as energy-related disbursements
offset growth gains, before returning to a sustainable path underpinned by solid growth, fiscal
consolidation, and prudent debt management.

Debt service is expected to remain manageable throughout the DSA horizon. This reflects the
high concessionality of both the outstanding multilateral debt and the assumed new borrowing over
the medium term. The PPG debt service ratio would decline slightly from 3.6 percent of exports in
2010 to 2.9 percent in 2011 following debt relief from Russia and Turkey, and remain broadly at that
level through the medium and long term.32

                                                    B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

Stress tests and alternative scenarios show that the Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt is
vulnerable to large shocks or substantially less favorable assumptions. The PV of the external
debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of the external debt-to-revenue rise above the relevant indicative
thresholds under some tests. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises above the indicative threshold of 40
percent      in   the    medium       term     (or     even     over     the     longer    term)      when
(i) export value growth is at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2012−13;
(ii) the net non-debt creating inflows over 2012−13 are one standard deviation below their historical
average; and (iii) under a shock over 2012−13 combining lower GDP and export growth, a decline in
the US dollar GDP deflator, and lower net non-debt creating inflows. The ratio of PV of debt-to-
revenue would also approach the relevant indicative threshold of 250 percent in the medium term
under the last two conditions. However, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is robust and does not breach
its threshold under various tests. Debt service ratios also prove resilient, staying below their indicative
threshold levels under various tests. The historical scenario—where key macro variables evolve
according to their historic averages—points to a more benign external debt outlook than the baseline
scenario. However, an alternative scenario that assumes no fiscal consolidation in the medium term,
financed by external borrowing, results in an unsustainable debt outlook, with the PV of debt-to-GDP
following an upward trend (Text Figure 2).

   The Kyrgyz Republic is rated as a medium performer based on the World Bank’s Country Performance and Institutional
Assessment Index for low income countries. The relevant policy-dependent thresholds for countries in this category are 40
percent for the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-
to-revenue ratio, 20 percent of the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent of the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

   Under the debt-for-equity swap agreement signed between the previous Kyrgyz administration and the Russian authorities
in 2009, the Russian side agreed to relinquish claims on the Kyrgyz Republic in the amount of US$193.5 million in
exchange for a 100 percent stake in two state-owned companies in the Kyrgyz Republic. However, in early 2010, despite the
Kyrgyz Republic appearing to have fulfilled all its obligations, the Russian side called in question the implementation of the
agreement and declared the outstanding debt disputed. Since then the parties have been in close consultations to resolve this
issue and a settlement is expected in 2011, as also assumed in the previous DSA.

                           IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

                                                    A. Baseline

Domestic debt is projected to increase and will play a more important role in financing the
budget deficit in the medium and long term. Domestic debt accounted for around 3 percent of total
public debt at end-2010. However, by 2031, domestic debt is projected to reach about 9 percent of
total public debt as domestic financial markets deepen.

The Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt outlook is projected to be manageable in the medium and
long term. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt to GDP ratio would increase slightly in
the medium term from about 38 percent of GDP at end-2010 to a maximum of about 42 percent of
GDP in 2016 following disbursements for energy-sector infrastructure. It would then decline
gradually to about 37 percent by 2031 reflecting fiscal consolidation.

                             B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

Alternative scenarios and stress tests show that Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt remains highly
sensitive to shocks that reduce real GDP growth and result in unsustainable debt burden
trajectories. The standard sensitivity analysis based on the historical variation of key parameters,
including real GDP growth and exchange rate, shows that debt ratios would rise considerably in the
long run. Under stress tests and scenarios, the PV debt-to-GDP ratio in 2031 could increase to about
80 percent under the permanent real GDP growth shock scenario and the fixed (at 2011 level) primary
deficit scenario. In addition, debt burden trajectories are ever increasing if the long run growth rate
turns out 0.8 percentage points below the current estimate.

                      V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Based on the projected external debt burden indicators, the Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to be
at moderate risk of debt distress. All PV-based external debt indicators in the baseline are projected
to stay below their indicative thresholds over the DSA horizon. Moreover, the debt service burden
would remain well below the thresholds, reflecting the high concessionality of the external debt.
Nevertheless, alternative scenarios and stress tests show that the external public debt indicators could
approach or breach the thresholds if the Kyrgyz Republic were to experience large adverse exogenous
shocks or relax its prudent debt management policy. This conclusion is consistent with the last DSA.
When adding domestic debt to the analysis, total public sector debt seems manageable in light of the
dynamics of the domestic debt stock. This said, debt burden trajectories are highly sensitive to real
GDP shocks and a somewhat smaller long run real growth rate.

Low-concessionality loans from bilateral and commercial creditors to finance large public
investment projects continue to pose a risk to the debt outlook. Staff recognizes that the Kyrgyz
Republic has large developmental needs, but considers paramount to lock in the recent progress
towards achieving and maintaining debt sustainability. Even if loans have a grant element of at least
35 percent, it would be important to ensure that the underlying projects are viable and that market
risks, including exchange rate risk, are accounted for, so as to avoid the buildup of an unsustainable
debt burden. Similarly, it would remain important for the government to seek highly concessional
loans, including in the energy sector.

The authorities broadly concurred with this analysis. They are highly concerned about
maintaining debt sustainability and will remain vigilant on the debt outlook. Indeed, given the
uncertain growth benefits and negative debt impact of the potential Issyk-kul road borrowing, the
authorities do not plan to pursue that project further at this point. Looking forward, the authorities
intend to make every effort to contract only concessional loans.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Also includes the effect of the financing gap, which is assumed to create debt, but does not enter the current or financial account.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
