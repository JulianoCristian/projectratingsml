Loan Project\n            will support the Government's implementation of a\n            structural reform program to foster rapid, and sustainable\n            economic growth, through macroeconomic stabilization,\n            towards integration into the European Union (EU). The reform\n            program is designed to attain these goals, through improved\n            economic management, and coordination of economic\n            policymaking, and, by enhancing fiscal discipline, so as to\n            strengthen market institutions, and competitiveness, and in\n            addition, will also enhance labor market flexibility, and\n            strengthen social protection. Measures for improved budget\n            procedures, reduction or elimination of subsidies, and\n            monitoring of Government guarantees, and reforms in the\n            pension system, will enhance fiscal discipline, while\n            reforms in the competition policy, and improvement of\n            institutional capacity for resolving business disputes, and\n            bankruptcy proceedings, will be supported. Social safety\n            nets will target vulnerable groups, aiming at improved cost\n            effectiveness of social assistance, and community-based\n            social services. However, the retrenchment of the wage bill,\n            and reductions in public employment pose risks if not\n            attained, and, containing health fund expenditures could\n            force the Government to resort to additional foreign\n            borrowing. These could undermine the credibility of fiscal\n            adjustment, while the slowdown in the world economy (i.e.,\n            economic effects of the terrorist events in the US) could\n            destabilize both Croatia's EU integration, and capital\n            flows, exacerbated by the coalition Government's\n            political risks, which could undermine reforms, and policy implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
