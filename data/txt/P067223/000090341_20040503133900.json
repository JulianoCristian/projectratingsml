development impact was modest, and\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned show that interagency coordination is a\n            key for successful implementation of a cross sectoral\n            adjustment program. The high level committee staffed by\n            technical experts was established at the outset of the\n            reform program. It proved essential to the formulation and\n            effective implementation of the reforms. A more focused\n            adjustment operation also allows more focused effort and\n            attention on specific areas so that more ambitious reforms\n            are possible. The Croatia SAL, unlike many adjustment\n            operations, did not attempt to address structural problems\n            at once across all major economic sectors. This strategy\n            meant that pressure could be concentrated on politically\n            difficult reforms like labor market flexibility. The\n            especially close coordination of the Bank and the Fund\n            helped design and fulfill a bold reform program. The\n            combined financial resources of the two institutions and the\n            overlapping conditionality gave strong leverage to the\n            reform program, which government officials reported was a\n            key factor in the program's success. Local consultants\n            have good standing among government counterparts and could\n            be used more widely in Bank operations. The Bank learned in\n            some components (e.g. Social Protection) that local\n            consultants are highly capable and more knowledgeable about\n            local conditions. Government counterparts also appreciated\n            working with them."}, "docdt": "2004-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
