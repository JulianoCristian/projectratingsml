Social\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) and Credit Project for St.\n            Lucia were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a single tranche, stand- alone DPL is not\n            the best instrument to address both short term and\n            medium-term challenges. In DPLs that are provided in the\n            context of financial crisis to support the macroeconomic\n            stabilization and fiscal constraints, this needs to be\n            explicitly recognized and evaluated to assess its\n            effectiveness. Lack of understanding or experience by the\n            borrower requires factoring in additional time to allow for\n            delays and greater investment in building a better\n            understanding of process and purpose. Close supervision is\n            instrumental for achieving program outcomes in one-off DPLs\n            with a more medium-term outlook and targets and outcome\n            indicators to be met at the end of the program."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
