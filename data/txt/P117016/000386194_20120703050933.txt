F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
1) Improve the business environment, competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector, by
supporting reforms to reduce delays in starting a business, buttress financial sector regulatory
environment, mitigate regional contagion risks, and promote investment.

  2) Improve public sector governance and economic management, by supporting reforms to
improve public service efficiency and performance, increase the efficiency of tax collection,
enhance fiscal discipline and strategic allocation of resources, strengthen accountability, and help
cope with the adverse consequences of the global economic downturn.

  3) Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by supporting efforts to
develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and
prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Although more diversified than other small Caribbean economies, St. Lucia is
highly vulnerable to economic and natural shocks. First, St. Lucia suffers from the myriad
disadvantages of limited scale due to its size. Second, St. Lucia has a strong degree of openness
and is subject to commodity booms and busts, which compound the challenges of
macroeconomic management and create uncertain growth paths. Third, the six Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) countries consistently rank in the top ten in the world in terms
of their exposure to natural disasters and climate change impacts. Fourth, St. Lucia has not
benefited much from international aid for years, in part due to its middle-income status. Overall,
due to a combination of high exposure to natural disasters, a small size and limited
diversification, St. Lucia is much more sensitive to external shocks than most other countries in
the world and faces increasingly difficult policy choices, especially in the wake of the global
financial crisis.

2.      After growing 3.6 percent annually on average during 2003-2007, economic activity
slowed down sharply due to a series of external shocks: Hurricane Dean in August of 2007,
an earthquake in November 2007, and the food and energy price spikes in 2007-2008. In
addition, St. Lucia was hit hard by the global financial crisis: real GDP contracted by 1.3 percent
in 2009, after growing by 5.8 percent in 2008 (Table 1). The recession in the United States and
Europe resulted in fewer tourism arrivals, as well as lower foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows and remittances. At the same time, the failure of the CL Financial Group in Trinidad and
Tobago, which hit hard most OECS countries, had a much smaller impact on St. Lucia due to the
prudent capital requirements established in 1995 and to a forceful enforcement of insurance
regulations.

3.      The Government of St Lucia implemented sound macroeconomic policies prior to
the crisis. The satisfactory track record of macroeconomic performance enabled St. Lucia to
obtain a disbursement of SDR6.9 million (approximately US$10.7 million) under the Rapid-
Access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in July 2009. However, facing weaker than anticipated economic activity, the
authorities expanded capital expenditures to mitigate the adverse impact of the external shocks
on employment and the poor. Higher capital expenditures coupled with lower revenues and
grants resulted in a primary deficit of 1 percent of GDP compared with a projected surplus of 0.8
percent of GDP in 2009.

4.     The percentage of the population living in poverty reached 28.8 percent in
2005/2006. The Country Poverty Assessment in 2005/2006 found that almost 60 percent of the
poor were below the age of 25. Poverty rates in rural districts were significantly higher than the
national average, giving rise to rapid migration to the north-west of the island. The
unemployment rate reached 16.8 percent by end-2008, with much higher rates among youth and
females, and there was no unemployment insurance program.

distress. In addition, fiscal measures related to GDP look in better shape.

5.      The medium term agenda and the specific priorities of the St. Lucian Government
were stated in Budget Speeches for FY2009/10 and FY2010/11. The program placed a strong
emphasis on private sector development through strengthening the partnership between the
Government and the private sector to stimulate the economy and set the stage for higher and
sustained growth in the medium term. It emphasized the need to ensure the health of the financial
sector through measures to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, and it also
emphasized the need for regional integration. To address the social impact of the crisis, the
program focused on economic and social empowerment of households and poverty reduction.
Lastly, it called for greater effectiveness and efficiency of the public service and operations of
Government Departments.

6.      The Government continued to implement reforms in 2009 and 2010, despite
challenges created by the global crisis. Advances in the reform program included the creation
of an online portal for company registration, submission to Parliament of the new Insurance Bill
aiming at improving the regulatory environment and mitigating the risk of contagion from
international financial markets, appointment of a Judicial Manager to perform a financial review
of British American Insurance Company (BAICO) with a view to reach an orderly resolution,
introduction of a cap on public employment in order to contain the rise in public spending on
wages, initiation of functional review of Public Departments, and creation of a Steering
Committee to improve targeting of social safety net programs.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Key Development Objectives:

      Improve the business environment, competitiveness, and strengthen the financial
       sector by supporting reforms to reduce delays in starting a business, buttress financial
       sector regulatory environment, mitigate regional contagion risks, and promote
       investment.
      Improve public sector governance and economic management by supporting reforms
       to improve public service efficiency and performance, increase the efficiency of tax
       collection, enhance fiscal discipline and strategic allocation of resources, strengthen
       accountability, and help cope with the adverse consequences of the global economic
       downturn.
      Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets by supporting efforts to
       develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and
       prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.

Key Outcome Indicators:

      Legislation is in place requiring basic solvency margin (capital requirements) for
       life insurance companies and annuity definitions are tightened to ensure that products
       offered are clearly defined as insurance products and that they are covered under the
       relevant regulations (Baseline: no capital requirements and definition of annuity
       products was large and included deposit type products in 2009).
      Fiscally sustainable wage bill ensuring key public services coverage and quality do

                                                3
       not decline (Baseline: Central government expenditure on wages and salaries projected
       to increase from 11.7% of GDP in 2009 to 12.4% of GDP in 2010; Target: Central
       government expenditure on wages and salaries contained to below 12% of GDP in 2010
       and reduced to 10.3% of GDP in the medium term).
      Higher efficiency on tax and customs administration (Baseline: operating costs of
       collecting EC$1 were 3.3 cents in 2008; Target: operating costs of collecting EC$1 are
       3.0 cents).
      Critical information exists to allow developing objective selection criteria for
       beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for social programs (Baseline: no
       such information available prior to August 2009).

Reasons/Justification

N/A

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

7.      The Economic and Social Policy Development Policy Loan/Credit (ES DPL/DPC)
supported policies and reforms intended to assist the Government of St. Lucia in dealing
with the global crisis and further advancing the country’s longer term development
agenda. In particular, it supported measures to improve public service delivery and social
assistance, enhance the country’s competitive position and better manage the inherent
vulnerability of a small and open economy. The ES DPL/DPC was organized around three
pillars, consistent with the Government’s Program as outlined in the previous section.
Consequently, the program supported core measures to help: (i) improve the business
environment and financial sector; (ii) improve public sector governance and economic
management; and (iii) strengthen social safety nets.

1.4.1 Component 1: Improving Competitiveness and Strengthening the Financial Sector

8.      The move toward Caricom Single Market Economy posed new challenges for
private sector activities in St. Lucia. In particular, the diversification strategy that turned the
country into one of the most diversified islands in the region was no longer relevant. To adjust
to this new reality, the authorities prepared a new Private Sector Development Strategy jointly
with a National Investment Strategy that focused on bringing more Foreign Direct Investment,
including from nationals living abroad. In addition, the government prepared a Competition Law
to ensure that the benefits of the Caribbean Single Market Economy are not lost to anti-
competitive practices. The government was also reviewing the proposal of the creation of a new
Trade and Export Promotion Agency (TEPA).

9.     To facilitate the registration of new companies, the Registrar’s office moved from
manual to electronic registration process. The objective was to put all records of the Registry
Office in electronic format. To completely eliminate manual barriers, a new Electronic
Transaction Act was envisioned to allow online collection of fees.



                                                4
10.    The government was fully aware of the risks in regional financial markets and
intended to move ahead with a new Insurance Act to improve regulations and mitigate
contagion risks. The new insurance act was to follow recommendations of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank with the aim of strengthening the existing legislative and institutional
capacity for better regulation of the market.

11.     The government also appointed a Judicial Manager to handle the BAICO financial
fallout. The financial collapse of BAICO and Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO) called
for both a short term response to protect policy holders and a longer term financial regulatory
reform. In the short term, the ES DPL/DPC supported the appointment of a Judicial Manager by
the Ministry of Finance and the Registrar of Insurance as a positive step towards addressing the
financial resolution of BAICO. The Judicial Manager would manage and take stock of the
company’s assets by initially preventing policyholders from recovering any money while under
its control and thus safeguard the interest of policyholders. Further, it would prepare a
comprehensive report of the financial status of the company within 90 days of his appointment,
and present recommendations to resolve the BAICO case to the Courts.

12.     Consistent with these objectives, the ES DPL/DPC prior actions under this pillar
were: (i) the online company registration portal had been launched; (ii) The Borrower has
submitted to its Parliament an Insurance Bill; and (iii) The Borrower, through its High Court, has
appointed a Judicial Manager to perform a review of BAICO within the Borrower’s territory,
with a view to recommending an orderly resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.

1.4.2 Component 2: Improving Public Sector Governance and Economic Management

13.      The ultimate objective of this component was to increase efficiency in the public
administration, improve productivity in public service delivery and achieve a more
sustainable and predictable wage bill. In the short term, the Program focused on keeping the
public wage bill fiscally sustainable through aggregate measures such as capping the level of
public employment and identifying efficiency and productivity gains through functional and
institutional reviews. Following consolidation of two Ministries (Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Economic Planning and National Development), the Program supported the initiation
of the process for reviewing the existing human resource management system together with the
pay and classification systems in the public administration.

14.     The Program also supported the government’s efforts to reinforce revenue
generation capacity and improving efficiency of tax collection. A new Value Added Tax
(VAT) would replace 4 consumption taxes. The introduction of the VAT would facilitate
efficient collection, strengthen the revenue flow and create incentives for expanding savings. In
addition, the Program supported a modernization of customs through the implementation of
Automated System for Custom Data (ASYCUDA) World. Both the VAT and the custom reforms
were expected to help the private sector comply with laws and regulations.

15.     To achieve these objectives, the Program supported the following measures: (i) a
cap on public service employment to hold the size of funded positions at the FY 2008/2009
levels, and no funding of vacant approved positions as outlined in the FY 2009/2010 budget; (ii)

                                                5
merger of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Planning and National
Development to create the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and National Development
under the administration of a single Permanent Secretary; (iii) institutional review of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and operation and efficiency reviews for the Ministry of Social
Transformation and the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities have
been initiated; (iv) submission to Parliament of a Value Added Tax Bill and establishment of a
VAT Implementation Unit with functional with adequate staffing and resources; and (v)
implementation of ASYCUDA World program in its customs department, including providing
the required financing for implementation of that program in the FY 2009/2010 budget, training
customs administration personnel, completion of a prototype software for ASYCUDA World
program, and developing a corporate strategic and business plan outlining a sequential
implementation of the ASYCUDA World program for the following three years.

1.4.3 Component 3: Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social Safety Nets

16.    The objective of this component was to strengthen the crisis response capacity of St.
Lucia’s social safety net (SSN), and to improve its effectiveness and efficiency in the
medium and long term. The first step would be a Social Safety Net Assessment (SSNA) to
evaluate the social assistance programs and to identify immediate steps to improve their support
to poor beneficiaries. In the long term, the Program supported actions to build consensus for
reform of the social safety net among key stakeholders and establish appropriate actions and
sequencing of tasks to undertake that reform.

17.     Among the immediate actions to improve safety net outcomes identified by the
SSNA was the improvement of the targeting mechanism of the Koudemain program. This
program is a pilot modeled on Chile’s Puente program, covering 47 of the poorest households in
4 communities in St. Lucia. Koudemain connects these households with all relevant social
assistance programs, and provides them with intensive psychological support over a two-year
period. The SSNA recommended a review of the targeting mechanism by an econometrician to
validate its quality or make recommendations for improving it. The Government would then
assess whether it is appropriate to use that instrument for other social assistance programs,
including Public Assistance. Another key recommendation of the SSNA was to consolidate all
programs targeted to the poor under the Ministry of Social Transformation. Introducing a
transparent targeting mechanism, streamlining payment mechanisms, and documenting policies
and procedures, would also strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the program. It was
expected that the consolidation of programs targeted to the poor, the strengthening of the Public
Assistance program, and improved targeting of social assistance programs, would yield fiscal
savings.

18.     The longer term reforms would come about as part of the process of building
constituencies for SSN improvement, and through critical actions to strengthen its
efficiency and effectiveness that would necessarily take a longer time than the life of the ES
DPL/DPC. The process of building support for change is a critical first step in the reform
process, as has been demonstrated by the experience of Jamaica. In the case of St. Lucia,
Cabinet established a Steering Committee to spearhead reforms and to elaborate an Action Plan
to do so. In coordination with the implementation of the ES DPL/DPC, the Bank provided Non-

                                               6
   lending Technical Assistance (NLTA) to the Government of St. Lucia and other OECS countries
   in the area of social safety net reform.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Program Performance

   19.     All the reforms supported by the DPL were conditions for Board presentation, and
   thus were deemed to be implemented prior to approval of the Credit/Loan. The status of
   those reforms, as well as the status of the Expected Outcomes of the Program as of October
   2011, is reported in Table 2 below.

   20.     While the government stayed the course in its reform program, implementation was
   slower than expected. For several months, government agencies focused their efforts in
   alleviating the damage caused by Hurricane Tomas, and implementation of reforms became
   slower. Little progress was made on the public sector governance and economic management
   component, with merely one outcome indicator achieved. On the social safety net component,
   two of the three outcome indicators were not achieved. However, with regard to the BAICO
   resolution, St. Lucia made substantial progress on revising the draft of the new Insurance Act in
   consultation with stakeholders.

   2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

   21.     Several factors affected implementation of the Program. First, the scope of the
   Program was broad, given that this was a one-tranche operation covering reforms in three
   complex areas. Further, reforms in two of these areas – public sector governance and the social
   safety net – take substantial time to design and even more time to implement. Second, the time
   span of the Program – 12 months, was too short, particularly as implementation was disrupted by
   Hurricane Tomas in late October 2010. Following the huge destruction caused by the hurricane,
   the authorities focused their attention on recovery efforts, and that slowed down implementation
   of the Program. Third, and also partly because of the hurricane, Government asked the Bank to
   postpone a supervision mission planned for early 2011. Eventually, the mission visited St. Lucia
   only a couple of weeks before the closing date. An earlier visit by the Bank team could have
   pointed out areas where more action was needed, and could have recommended that appropriate
   technical assistance was procured for that purpose. Fourth, there are several bottlenecks in the
   drafting and legal preparation of legislation, and consequently there was a backlog of legislation
   that needed to be drafted, reviewed by cabinet and approved by Parliament. Fifth, there were
   technical glitches in several systems, such as the online portal for company registration. And last
   but not least, the slow pace of progress was largely due to limited capacity of implementation in
   the public sector.

   2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

   22.      Design. The Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and National Development was
   responsible for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies, including
   the Ministry of Social Transformation, Public Service, Human Resource Development, Youth
   and Sports; the Ministry of Health Wellness, Family Affairs, National Mobilization, Human
   Services and Gender Relations; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Consumer Affairs, and
   Customs Administration. As part of the preparation process, the Bank discussed with all relevant
   institutions the development of M&E process to ensure adequate feedback to policy-makers. The
   government and the Bank agreed on a results framework with a number of process, output and
   outcomes indicators to be assessed in June 2011 – the closing date of the program. Those were
   the agreed benchmarks for evaluation of the program supported by the ES DPL/DPC.

                                                        11
23.     Implementation and Utilization of the M&E framework was limited. Attention of the
St. Lucia government was drawn by Hurricane Thomas and its aftermath. The Bank responded
quickly with an Emergency Recovery Loan, which was approved by the Board in March 2011,
but there were no supervision missions for the DPL/DPC until mid-June 2011, i.e., three weeks
before the closing date.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

24.     In June 2011, during the supervision mission, the authorities requested a follow-up
operation, to consolidate the reforms included in this DPL/DPC and to take their reform program
to the next stage. As elections would probably take place in late 2011, they would like to be
ready with a set of measures to introduce in the first year of the new government – the best time
in the political cycle to implement structural reforms. The request is now under consideration at
the Bank.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

25.     The objectives of the DPL/DPC program were relevant when the operation was
appraised and they remain relevant to date. The vulnerability of St. Lucia to external shocks
(Section 1.1) is a structural given, and the international financial crisis is not over yet. If
anything, financial instability in Europe became more acute in 2011. Thus, both the structural as
well as the temporary external conditions remain very important reasons for St. Lucia to become
more competitive, enhance the efficiency and efficacy of its public sector, and improve the
effectiveness of its social safety net.

26.     The ES DPL/DPC was consistent with the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS)
FY10-14 of the OECS and the World Bank discussed by the Board of Directors in June
2010. The FY10-14 RPS rests on two pillars: (i) Building Resilience; and (ii) Enhancing
Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth. In this context, FY10-14 RPS focuses on
improving fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing efficiency and transparency of public
spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic and financial stability, strengthening
policy coordination and economic management, and rationalizing social safety net programs and
improving targeting systems. These objectives were fully reflected by the PDOs of the ES
DPL/DPC, and are critical for strengthening the ability of St. Lucia, as well as other OECS
countries, to respond to exogenous shocks and laying the foundation for growth in the medium
term.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

27.    The program document of the ES PDPL/DPC states that this operation was ―envisaged in
the FY10-14 RPS as a single tranche operation and (was) viewed as the beginning of a multi-
year engagement‖ (para. 6). Consequently, while this DPL/DPC was approved as a self standing
operation, the last column of its policy matrix describes the Second Phase of Government
Reforms (Annex 1). Thus, in order to evaluate the achievement of this DPL/DPC’s PDOs it’s
                                               12
necessary to have a broader perspective of the various policy measures included in the Program.
At the same time, 12 months is a relatively short period of time to implement such an ambitious
agenda, particularly when a major natural disaster struck the island in that period and deflected
the authorities’ attention towards recovery efforts for several months.

3.2.1 Component 1: Improve the business environment, competitiveness, and strengthen
      the financial sector. Moderately Satisfactory

28.    As mentioned above, St. Lucia is highly vulnerable to external shocks, and it was hit
hard by the international financial crisis. Thus, improving the business environment and
becoming more competitive overall would help in the current recovery and enhance resilience of
the economy in the future.

29.     In April 2011, Parliament approved the new Financial Service Regulatory Act. This
Act consolidates supervision of non-banking financial activities, including insurance,
cooperatives, credit unions and money services (domestic banks are regulated by the ECCB).
This consolidation is broadly in line with the prevailing international trend, including most of the
Caribbean, of moving away from separate regulators per category towards more consolidated
regulation. The regulatory authority is now being formed, and it is expected to become
operational in January 2012.

30.     The time that it takes to register a company affects the ease of doing business.
Usage of the internet has facilitated that process in many countries. In April 2009, St. Lucia
launched an online company registration portal, which included a search component and a
company registration component. The first component has been in operation for some time, but
the second component was undermined by technical glitches. Consequently, as of October
2011, no companies had been registered through the portal, and the Registrar of Companies and
Intellectual Property Office continues to do the process manually. According to the Doing
Business 2011, the number of days it takes to register a business in St. Lucia was reduced from
20 days in 2009 to 14 days in 2010. That Report indicates that 5 steps were needed to complete
the process, the second of which was at the Registrar’s office, which took 6 days. That is
consistent with information received by the ICR mission from 4 lawyers working on registration
of companies, who said that the process at the Registry takes 5-10 working days. Meanwhile, in
a step that would facilitate online registration of companies, Parliament approved the Electronics
Transaction Act in March 2011. Currently, about two thirds of businesses are informal, as many
small businesses find the registration process too cumbersome and expensive.

31.     Caribbean countries were hit hard by the collapse of two insurance companies -
BAICO and CLICO in early 2009. Both companies sold ―executive flexible premium
annuities‖, which were in fact investment products yielding 8.5% for 2 to 5 years, and invested
heavily in real estate in the United States. As result of the US real estate market downturn, the
companies could not meet their commitments. The collapse of both companies, which were very
prestigious in the Caribbean, revealed the weakness of the regulatory environment in the islands
and the fact that existing regulations were not properly enforced.




                                                13
32.    In April 2009, Caribbean governments agreed on a regional plan to address the
BAICO problem. The plan called the establishment of a new company for policy holders, with
contributions of US$100 million from Trinidad and Tobago and US$5 million from Barbados.
In December 2010, however, that plan collapsed when the new government of Trinidad and
Tobago decided not to participate with funds, and BAICO refused to create a new company. A
―Plan B‖ was designed, whereby BAICO would be liquidated using the petroleum fund at ECCB
(about US$50 million), and funds obtained from the sale of the traditional insurance part of the
business.

33.     St. Lucia has only limited financial exposure to the collapse of both companies
because they had assets in the country of a similar order of magnitude as their liabilities there.
That was due to prudent capital requirements established in 1995 and to the enforcement of
insurance regulations. However, St. Lucia participates actively in the regional plan for the
resolution of BAICO and it has recently appointed a judicial manager for CLICO.

34.     The BAICO/CLICO collapse highlighted the need for a new insurance legislation.
A draft proposal was submitted to Parliament in early 2010. After passing the first reading,
Parliament created a special committee, chaired by the Speaker, to revise the draft in consultation
with stakeholders. The new Act would increase capital requirements (for foreign companies
from EC$2.5 million to EC$5 million, and for local companies from EC$1.5 million to EC$2
million) as well as solvency margins for general insurance (from EC$200,000 to EC$500,000, or
20% of premium income, net of reinsurance, whichever is higher) and it would establish a
solvency margin for life insurance (5% of policy holder liabilities). The new Act would also
define annuities to ensure that they are insurance products and not partly cash deposit type
instruments as in the past. In September 2011, the Special Committee had completed its review
of the draft legislation, but had not reported to Parliament yet. Second and third readings were
expected to be quick, after which the draft would go to the Senate for final approval.

3.2.2 Component 2: Improve public sector governance and economic management.
      Moderately Unsatisfactory.

35.     The Government’s program pursued improvement of public sector efficiency and
effectiveness as one of its strategic priorities, through both short and medium term policy
reforms. In the short term, to help contain the growth of the wage bill, the Government
established a cap on public sector employment to hold the size of funded positions in the public
sector at the FY 2008/2009 level (6884 funded positions). That was essential for reversing the
deterioration in the fiscal accounts from a primary surplus of surplus of 2 percent of GDP in
2008 to a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 1). In the medium term, the Government
mandated operation and efficiency reviews in all agencies as a first step towards a deeper reform
designed to use financial and human resources more efficiently to enhance productivity, improve
service delivery and reduce waste.

36.   While the number of funded established positions was kept below the cap, the actual
number of employees was higher than the funded positions: funded positions were 6,732 in
2009/10 and 6,840 in 2010/11, while the actual number of established employees in central
government was 6,632 in 2008/09, 6,834 in 2009/10 and 7,050 in 2010/11. Part of the increase in

                                                14
2010/11 was due to the recruitment of police officers to address the rising security concern, and
it seems that the effort has been successful in reducing crime. At the same time, the number of
other employees (non-established, capital, in training and others) declined somewhat in 2010.
Altogether, Government was able to contain growth of the Central Government wage bill:
expenditures on wages and salaries were EC$316.2 million (10.77% of rebased GDP) in 2009/10
and EC$342.7 million (10.84% of rebased GDP) in 2010/11. The ratios with respect to the old
GDP series were 11.87% and 11.92%, respectively.

37.     Functional reviews were carried out in the Ministry of Social Transformation and in
the Ministry of Communication, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities in 2010, but
cabinet did not approve the recommendations of those reviews. The Ministry of Social
Transformation supported the recommendations of the review, which concluded that the Ministry
lacks the resources to perform its mandate and recommended to increase its budget and staff.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Communication, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities did
not agree with the recommendation to spin off several of its departments to create independent
executive agencies, such as a roads agency, a licensing agency, etc. Given these conflicting
views, Cabinet took note of the recommendations but did not adopt them. The Ministry of
Public Service lacks a public sector reform unit, and it does not have the staff and resources
required to do more reviews.

38.     The VAT Implementation Unit was established in October 2008, but the
introduction of the VAT has been postponed several times. In June 2011, the Government
was still working on the draft legislation to be presented to Parliament. Meanwhile, the
Implementation Unit has been training its staff, and it has launched a multi-facet information
campaign, which includes printed material, small office items with the VAT logo, and even a
song promoting the VAT which is being played in local radio. The 2011/12 Budget Speech
indicates that the VAT will be implemented by April 2012.

39.     The VAT will replace four taxes: (i) consumption tax (on imports and domestic good);
(ii) environmental levy; (iii) mobile phones; and (iv) car rental. These four taxes yielded
EC$174.1 million in FY2009/10 (5.92% of GDP) and the estimated revenue for 2010/11 is
EC$153.2 million. Taking into consideration that, in 2010/11, the consumption tax on fuel was
converted into an excise tax, which raised EC$44 million, revenues of those taxes increased by
about EC$23 million in 2010/11.

40.     While indirect tax collections (Inland Revenue and Customs) grew from EC$473.4
million in FY2009/10 to EC$493.8 million in FY2010/11, there was no improvement in the
efficiency of tax and customs administration. For customs only, the operating cost of
collecting EC$1 was 3.30 cents in 2008/09, 3.25 cents in 2009/10, and 3.39 cents in 2010/11.
The equivalent costs of Inland Revenue were 1.37, 1.57, and 1.62 cents, respectively. The total
costs for Customs and Inland Revenue combined were: 2.40 cents in 2008/09, 2.51 cents in
2009/10, and 2.59 cents in 2010/11.

41.   St. Lucia launched ASYCUDA World in September 2010. Migration from
ASYCUDA++ was done in one shot, which caused difficulties for users. A prototype was not
completed as planned. There were technical glitches in the new system, and there was no back-

                                               15
up. In October 2011, ASYCUDA World was still at a developmental stage due to resource
constraints. The e-documents were still to be introduced, and overall implementation was about
50%. The new system was expected to be fully operational by end-2011.

3.2.3 Component 3: Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets.
      Moderately Unsatisfactory.

42.     A comprehensive assessment of the social safety net was finalized in August 2009. Its
results have been discussed within the government, and consultations with external stakeholders
are planned to take place jointly with consultations on the recently completed Poverty Reduction
Strategy. Phase 1 of the reform will address the public assistance program, and other programs
will follow.

43.     As part of that reform, the Ministry of Social Transformation is developing an
objective mechanism for selection of beneficiaries using proxy means testing. The St. Lucia
Social Development Fund has carried out a review of the targeting mechanism of the Koudemain
program with the objective of expanding its coverage. The Ministry of Social Transformation has
carried out its own review of that targeting mechanism to see whether it can be used for other
social programs. The conclusion of the Ministry, however, was that the targeting mechanism
used by Koudemain, which is based on the Poverty Assessment, was not appropriate for other
programs. The Ministry is now fine tuning a new mechanism based on proxy means testing,
which would be adopted and piloted by the Koudemain program as it expands its coverage from
47 households in 4 communities to about 150 households across the island. That expansion is
scheduled to commence in November 2011 and take about 6 months.

44.      There is no new specific information for the selection of beneficiaries. The Ministry
of Social Transformation views information from the Survey of Living Conditions and
Household Budget (SLC-HBC) of 2006, which was part of the Country Poverty Assessment, as
still pertinent for an objective beneficiaries selection criteria and targeting mechanism. The next
Survey is planned for September 2012. In addition, the Ministry plans to use information from
the 2010 national census and it is now preparing a Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, which
targets separately women, men and children, with support of UNICEF. The Ministry is also
planning to start construction of a new Management Information System (MIS), which would
include a Unified Beneficiaries Information System (UBIS).

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

45.     While the objectives of the ES DPL/DPC were and remain relevant, there were
significant shortcomings in the achievement of those objectives. That was partially due to
Hurricane Tomas, which caused serious damage in the island and diverted government attention
to recovery efforts. Little progress was made on the public sector governance and economic
management component, where two Outcome Indicators (OIs) were not achieved and two were
only partially achieved. In particular, actual established positions in government were higher
than funded positions in 2009/10 and 2010/11, introduction of the VAT was postponed several
times and the cost of collecting EC$1 by Inland Revenue and Customs actually increased rather

                                                16
than decreasing as planned. On the social safety net component, two of the three OIs were not
achieved, as there was no new specific information for selection of beneficiaries, and the first
action plan was not implemented for lack budget. Reviews of the Koudemain target mechanism
were completed in July 2011, and a proxy means testing mechanism for social safety net
programs was scheduled to be piloted by Koudemain starting in November 2011. On the
component regarding improvement of the business environment, the online registration of
companies was still not operational as of October 2011, more than two years after being
launched. With regard to the BAICO resolution, St. Lucia adopted a ―Plan B‖ after the first
regional plan collapsed, and made substantial progress on revising the draft of the new Insurance
Act in consultation with stakeholders, but the legislation was not yet approved as of October
2011.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

46.    There were no gender aspects to this operation, and given the short period covered
by the Program, it’s not possible to attribute any specific poverty impact to this DPL/DPC.
Once the reform of the social safety net programs is completed, however, it is expected to have a
meaningful impact on beneficiaries of these programs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

47.      The ES DPL/DPC included various aspects related to institutional
change/strengthening. First, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Planning
and National Development were merged into a new Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and
National Development under the administration of a single Permanent Secretary. Second,
operations and efficiency reviews were carried out in two ministries, containing
recommendations for institutional changes to improve their performance. Third, government
initiated a process to reform the social safety net programs and to establish an objective
mechanism for selecting beneficiaries using proxy means testing. When implemented, those
initiatives would contribute to strengthening key institutions in St. Lucia.

N/A

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

48.    The risks that development outcomes will not be fully achieved and/or maintained
are rated Significant for the following reasons: (i) the slow rate of implementation, whereby
most targets were not achieved by the closing date; (ii) the protracted recovery of developed
countries from the international financial crisis, which could negatively affect tourism to St.

                                               17
Lucia for a long period of time; (iii) negotiations between the government and 11 unions in the
public service on a three year wage agreement (2010-13), which were to start in November 2010,
were postponed for the second half of 2011. Since Parliamentary elections could be held before
the end of this year, those negotiations would be held during an elections period. That
concurrence could make it difficult for government to contain the size of public sector
employment and the wage bill; and (iv) the risk of natural disaster is high. While St. Lucia
participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and major private
enterprises are partly covered by their own insurance, the potential costs of a major natural
disaster to the economy would be high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.      Bank performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. After some
initial delays, the Government and the Bank teams put together a comprehensive Program in a
relatively short period of time. That was not an easy task since the authorities were not familiar
with the modality of a single tranche operation, in particular with the fact all policy actions had
to be accomplished prior to Board presentation. The components of the Program were designed
to increase resilience of the economy to external shocks, to enhance its longer term growth
potential and to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable segments of the
population. However, the scope of the Program was wide, comprising issues in many sectors. In
addition, the time allocated for implementation – 12 months, was too short, considering the
limited capacity in the public sector, lags in the approval of new legislation, and the risk of
natural catastrophes (which actually materialized in Hurricane Tomas). Also, probably because
of the urgency in putting together the operation, several items in the policy matrix were not
clearly defined, such as ―critical information needed to develop objective selection criteria for
beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for social protection programs‖ or the
difference between solvency margins and capital requirements of insurance companies. Overall,
however, the Government and the Bank teams put together a comprehensive program under
difficult conditions. Implementation of the Program was slower than anticipated, but it’s
objectives remain relevant and it set the stage for reforms which would contribute to St. Lucia’s
economic and social development. The design and implementation proved too complex given the
capacity of the public sector and the lack of experience with DPLs on the government’s side.

(b) Quality of Supervision
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.    The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Shortly after Board
approval, there was a change of Task Team Leader, and there was a gap in the follow-up by the
Bank of program implementation. The Bank proposed to carry out an Implementation Support
mission in early 2011, but following Hurricane Tomas, Government was focused on
reconstruction efforts and it asked the Bank to postpone the mission several times. The mission

                                                18
was finally held in June 2011, just a few weeks before the closing date. The reasons for that
delay were beyond Bank’s control, but it certainly undermined the function of implementation
support. At the same time, the Implementation Support mission conducted a thorough
assessment all components of the Program, and it also gathered preliminary data and information
for the ICRR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

51.     Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the Program included
issues that were and remain relevant for St. Lucia’s development, its scope was wide and the
time allocated to implementation was too short. For reasons that did not depend on the Bank,
there was only a single supervision mission, and it took place just before the closing date, which
did not allow enough time for alerting the Government on targets still to be met and for helping
the authorities to achieve them.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

52.     The Government program identified crucial issues for the future development of the
country, and it reached agreement with the Bank on the ES DPL/DPC Program to address an
important part of those issues. However, while recognizing the impact of Hurricane Tomas,
there were significant shortcomings in the achievement of the operations’ objectives. In
particular, introduction of the VAT was postponed several times, actual positions in the public
sector increased in 2009/10 and 2010/11, and apart from the consolidation of the two economic
policy ministries, there was little progress in reform of the civil service. Also, postponement of
the wage negotiations with public sector unions for the electoral period would probably make
controlling the growth of the wage bill more difficult. In addition, there was little progress in
reform of the social safety net, and the online registration of companies was still not operational
more than two years after being launched. At the same time, Government was already planning
policy measures for the first year of the new administration, which is usually the best time for
implementation of reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

53.     As described above, only partial progress was achieved in implementation of the
Program. While the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development stated its
commitment to stay the course in the reform process, it was constrained by capacity limitations
in the public sector, the backlog in processing legislation in Parliament, and the damages caused
by Hurricane Tomas. However, by the closing date (June 2011), and as of October 2011, most
Outcome Indicators were not achieved.

6. Lessons Learned

      A programmatic approach, which supports a multi-stage program with a longer
       term horizon, is superior to a stand-alone one year program. Participants at the
       Regional Operations Committee meeting of the ES DPL/DPL held in December 2009,
       strongly supported a programmatic approach. Eventually, a stand-alone operation was
       favored because of the high uncertainty at that point in time. With hindsight, a
       programmatic operation could have had stronger development impact by setting the stage
       for a longer term reform program.

      In small states, policy based programs need to be relatively simple, in terms of
       realistic scope and targets. Since generally only one policy based operation is prepared
       in a multi-year period, both the Government and the Bank tend to include many activities
       in the program. However, implementation capacity is usually not strong in these
       countries. Thus, in order to increase the likelihood that programs are fully implemented,
       it would be useful to design highly selective and relatively simple programs;

      One year is too short a period for implementation of a program, particularly when
       it is as ambitious as this one. Designing, approving and implementing policy reforms
       takes time. In addition, a natural disaster or a similar emergency situation could distract
       the authorities from the program for several months, as it happened in St. Lucia in late
       2010. Thus, it would be advisable that policy based programs have a time span of a least
       18-24 months;

      Close supervision, preferably coupled with technical assistance, is instrumental for
       achieving Program outcomes in a one-off DPL. In those operations, where all reforms
       need to be completed prior to Board approval, the targets and outcome indicators to be
       met at the end of the Program have a somewhat blurry meaning, since no disbursement is
       triggered by them. Thus, close supervision amounting to TA could help achieve those
       targets. In addition, following up with actual technical assistance and country dialogue
       that builds local capacity could also enhance sustainability of the reforms in the medium
       term.

                Saint Lucia DPL Implementation Completion Report1

1.         Assessment of the operation’s         objective,   preparation,    design   and
           implementation experience

Objectives
The Government of Saint Lucia is of the view that the objectives of the DPL are both
relevant and necessary at this time. Given Saint Lucia’s vulnerability to external shocks,
the need to build resilience through economic and social policy reforms cannot be over
emphasized. The onset of the global financial crisis and the recent devastating effects of
a severe drought and hurricane have further exposed the economy, given rise to higher
fiscal deficits and debt ratios and reducing the capacity of the country to recover quickly.

Preparation
It is our view that the initial preparations for the DPL got off to a slow start because of
uncertainty about the actions required of the Government of Saint Lucia. For example, at
the very beginning of the process Saint Lucia was not aware that the conditions had to be
completed before submitting the DPL to the Executive Board of the World Bank for
approval.

Also, during the negotiations the St Lucian delegation expressed its disagreement with
the provision in Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement that seem to indicate that the
suspension of the agreement can affect the country’s entire loan portfolio with the Bank.
However, assurances were given that the provision is intended to allow the Bank to
initiate consultations and dialogue concerning the macro-economic framework and the
Program.

In our view, there should have been more clarity on the process and the prerequisites for
board approval, especially as it was Saint Lucia’s first DPL.

Design
We believe that the DPL was appropriately designed and well balanced as the main
conditions included reforms in the areas of supporting growth and competitiveness, fiscal
reform, strengthening the financial sector and social safety nets. These were also the
areas highlighted by the IMF under the RCF/ENDA facilities and the CDB under its
Policy Based Loan facility.

However, the timeline for completing some of the conditions was not very clear. For
example, a cap on public service employment to hold the size of funded positions to its
2008/09 level. It was not very clear whether the freeze was only for 2009/10 relative to
2008/09 or for subsequent years.

Implementation Experience
Our experience has been that some of the conditions were implemented more quickly and
easily than others. For example, the merger of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Economic Affairs was accomplished long in advance of the board approval of the
programme. However, some other conditions such as those pertaining to the social safety
nets took longer to implement.

Also, strict implementation of some conditions may not always be feasible because of the
need to respond to unforeseen circumstances. For example, the Government had to
employ additional police officers in 2010 in response to an escalation in crime.

2.     Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives

All the agreed conditions have been met and have either being implemented or are in the
process of being implemented (see appendix 1 attached for details).

3.     Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and
       implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may
       be helpful in the future

The Government of Saint Lucia’s performance during the preparation and
implementation of the programme can be described as a bit slow at the beginning as we
were unsure about many of the details of the programme and the procedures involved,
given that this was our first experience of a DPL. At the beginning we were not aware
that all the conditions had to be in place before the programme was submitted to the
board of the World Bank for approval.

The other matter worthy of note is that Saint Lucia had capacity constraints which slowed
down the implementation of the conditions. While we recognized the importance of the
conditions for improving competitiveness and strengthening the economy against shocks,
their implementation coincided with of the global crisis which had a severe impact on the
economy, making it necessary to divert limited resources to the stabilization and recovery
effort and resulting in unforeseen delays.

The lesson coming out of these experiences is for full disclosure of all the procedures and
processes at the outset, allowing for awareness of the requirements by all the parties and
facilitating a smoother process. Also, a better assessment of the borrower’s
implementation capacity should have been made at the beginning prior to any agreement
on the conditions. Too often conditions are agreed without due regard to the capacity to
implement in an efficacious manner, with adverse implications for the outcome.




                                            29
4.     Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, with special emphasis on lessons learned

We are of the view that the World Bank should have provided complete disclosure of the
full details of the procedures and processes involved. As indicated earlier, we were
unaware at the beginning that all the conditions had to be met before board approval,
contributing to needless delays.

We are also of the view that the World Bank was not sufficiently sensitive to the needs of
Saint Lucia as a small and vulnerable economy particularly in the wake of the global
financial crisis. Negotiations for the DPL occurred during the height of the crisis, but the
World Bank did not adjust its processes or procedures to assist countries like Saint Lucia
to access urgently needed financial assistance. This was unlike the IMF which responded
to our needs by rapidly providing emergency financing. In fact this experience brings into
question the appropriateness of the DPL as an instrument for cushioning the impact of the
global financial crisis on small and vulnerable countries like Saint Lucia, given its
cumbersome procedures. There is need for the World Bank to re-examine its menu of
options as well as its procedures for assisting small countries like Saint Lucia during
periods of crisis.

In future, we believe that the World Bank should be flexible in its approach to assisting
small and vulnerable countries by having in place a special facility to accelerate the
provision of financial assistance in crisis situations, possibly through a special window
based on sound macroeconomic policies.
