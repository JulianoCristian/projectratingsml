      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.




About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
    To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to ad apt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current deve lopment priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the St. Lucia Economic
and Social Development Policy Loan/Credit (IBRD-79190, IDA-47520) approved by the
Board on June 8, 2010 and closed on June 30, 2011.

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank carried out an assessment of
the above operation as part of a cluster of project performance assessments for three
small middle-income countries- the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and St Lucia- that
faced particular challenges during the global financial crisis.

This report is based on a field visit to St Lucia that took place in February 2013. The field
visit included discussions in St Lucia with relevant government officials, financial
institutions and the Caribbean Development Bank. It also includes a review of the
program document, financing agreements, Implementation Completion Report and
Implementation Completion and Results Report, and other relevant material as well as
interviews with the Bank and IMF staff. The cooperation and assistance of all
stakeholders is gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report (PPAR) was sent to the Borrower for comments. No comments received from the
Borrower.

Summary
This report assesses the Economic and Social Development Policy Loan and Credit (DPL) to
St. Lucia, approved by the Board on June 8, 2010 and which closed on June 30, 2011. The
loan aimed to provide timely financial support to the government of St Lucia to manage the
impact of the global economic crisis. The operation had three objectives: (a) improve
business environment and competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector; (b) improve
public sector governance and economic management; and (c) improve effectiveness and
efficiency of social safety nets. The relevance of these objectives was rated ‘high’: the loan
was expected to maintain and reinforce the reform agenda of the government to revive
growth and improve competitiveness as outlined in the government’s annual budget for
FY2010/11. The DPL was embedded in the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS 2010-2014).

While the loan provided needed financial support to the St. Lucia government during the
global economic crisis, the loan’s stated objectives and design were medium to long term.
This resulted in a mismatch between the short-term nature of the operation (12 months) and
the time needed to make concrete progress with reforms. The activities, while well aligned
with the government’s medium term plans and structural reforms, were not design ed to yield
measurable short term results. The scope of these activities, covering many sectors, was
overly ambitious and broad for a one year DPL. The relevance of design and the achievement
of all the three objectives were rated ‘Modest’. There was little progress in many of the areas
of reform, such as civil service reforms, reduction in the wage bill, social safety net measures
and the online registration of companies.

Under the administration that came to power in March 2012, some reforms have been
initiated such as the introduction of VAT, and tabling of a revamped insurance bill. However,
St Lucia’s fiscal position has deteriorated and the overall deficit has widened to an estimated
12 percent of GDP for 2012 with public debt rising to 78 percent of GDP in 2012. The
outcome of the operation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Implementation was severely affected by Hurricane Tomas which struck St. Lucia in October
2010. The hurricane diverted attention of the government to the immediate problem of
responding to the affected population and rebuilding damaged infrastructures. The Bank was
asked to postpone project supervision, delaying the mission and scope for midcourse
corrections until shortly before the closing date.

This DPL offers four key lessons:

      A single tranche, stand- alone DPL is not the best instrument to address both short-
       term and medium-term challenges. The one-off DPL shored up St Lucia’s finances
       through the influx of funds. However, its stated objectives were medium or long-term
       for which the single operation DPL was not adequate. A programmatic series of DPLs
       would have been a more appropriate instrument for engagement, allowing the
       government time to implement St. Lucia’s ambitious program, particularly given
       known capacity constraints.
      In DPLs that are provided in the context of financial crisis to support the
       macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal constraints, this needs to be explicitly
                                        x


    recognized and evaluated to assess its effectiveness. In cases where this is not
    recorded as an objective, the documentation does not fully recognize the intent, nor
    credit the DPL with what it achieves.
   Lack of understanding or experience by the borrower requires factoring in additional
    time to allow for delays and greater investment in building a better understanding of
    process and purpose. Such situations also require greater stakeholder consultations
    both before and during implementation to ensure and enhance understanding. This
    being the first DPL, the government of St Lucia was not conversant with the Bank’s
    internal DPL process. The Borrower’s Response (ICR, Annex 4) indicated a lack of
    complete appreciation of the pre-board requirements or their significance in the loan
    process. This highlights the need for deeper and more inclusive internal discussion to
    attain support of key stakeholders and buy-in.
   Close supervision is instrumental for achieving Program outcomes in one-off DPLs
    with a more medium-term outlook and targets and outcome indicators to be met at the
    end of the Program. Close supervision is necessary to help in achieving the DPL and
    reform program’s targets. In addition, following up and providing or financing
    technical assistance if necessary, together with country dialogue to build local
    capacity, could be useful to bolster reforms and enhance sustainability in the medium-
    term and both a good supervision plan and methods to support sustainability should
    be considered at the outset.

1. Background and Context
Introduction
1.1 This PPAR assesses the Economic and Social Development Policy Loan (DPL) to St.
Lucia, which was approved by the Board on June 8, 2010 and closed on June 30, 2011. The
DPL was planned in the context of the 2008 global financial crisis. It was expected to
contribute to the government’s broad based response to the crisis aimed at maintaining
macroeconomic stability while protecting social spending, with measures to enhance tax
revenue and control expenditures

1.2 The operation had three objectives: (a) improve business environment and
competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector; (b) improve public sector governance
and economic management; and (c) improve effectiveness and efficiency of social safety
nets. These objectives were expected to maintain and reinforce the implementation of the
longer term structural reform agenda of the government to revive growth and improve
competitiveness and support the vulnerable groups in St. Lucia, who were significantly
affected by the global crisis, through improved effectiveness of safety nets. In addition to the
above stated objectives, the loan was also expected to provide timely financial support to the
Government of St Lucia to manage the impact of the global economic crisis.

1.3 The DPL was embedded in the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS 2010-2014) for the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), which was organized around two pillars:
(i) building resilience; and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating sustainable
growth. It was also aligned with the government’s annual budget for FY2010/11 which
focused primarily on generating growth, securing jobs, promoting competitiveness and
protecting vulnerable citizens in the face of global recession. The policy actions supported
under this program were grounded in analytical evidence including IMF Article IV
consultations, OECS ROSCs on Auditing and Accounting, and the Joint World Bank IMF
Technical Assistance on BAICO/CLICO failures.

Country Context
1.4 St. Lucia is a middle-income country with a GDP of US$1.23 billion and per capita
income of US$ 7,379 as of 2011. After its independence from United Kingdom in 1980, St
Lucia became a member of the OECS. St Lucia is also a member of the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). St Lucia’s currency, the Eastern Caribbean Dollar
(EC$), has been pegged to US$ at EC$ 2.7 since 1976. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB) issues the currency for eight OECS members and the EC$ is 100 percent backed by
OECS’ foreign exchange reserves.

1.5 Although more diversified than several other Caribbean economies, St. Lucia’s
capacity to diversify is limited, which renders it highly vulnerable to economic and natural
shocks (including climate change impacts). First, St. Lucia suffers from the myriad
disadvantages of limited scale. Second, it has a strong degree of openness and is subject to
commodity booms and busts, which compound the challenges of macroeconomic
                                             2


management and create uncertain growth paths. Third, the OECS countries, including St.
Lucia, consistently rank in the top ten in the world in terms of their exposure to natural
disasters and climate change impacts. Fourth, St. Lucia has not benefited much from
international aid for years, in part due to its middle-income status. As a result, it is highly
sensitive to external shocks and faces increasingly difficult policy choices in an
interdependent world, especially in the wake of the current global financial crisis.

Program Context
1.6 The economic and social context of the DPL was largely framed by: (i) the 2008
global financial crisis; (ii) the pre-crisis imbalances arising from St Lucia’s expansionary
fiscal policies that did not produce the desired effect due largely to a series of external
economic and natural shocks; (iii) the rigidity of the budget due to high debt servicing and
wage bill and the fall of fiscal revenues that limited the government’s room for
implementing counter fiscal policies; and (iv) the impact of the economic downturn on the
vulnerable populations. The Bank’s support provided through its loan and credit, was
expected to help the government in maintaining macroeconomic stability and protecting the
poor while enhancing economic and institutional foundations for faster development.

1.7 The 2008 global financial crisis hit St. Lucia relatively hard. St Lucia depends heavily
on tourism and financial services as sources of revenues and foreign exchange. Reflecting a
sharp decline in visitors and construction activity related to foreign direct investment, real
GDP is estimated to have contracted by 5.2 percent in 2009 and the current account deficit
reached 11.7 percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, St Lucia’ fiscal position deteriorated
sharply. In addition, the pre-crisis imbalances stemming from a debt-financed growth left the
country with high external, public and private debt at the commencement of the global
financial and economic crisis. Adding to this, St. Lucia incurred damages from an earthquake
and Hurricane Dean in 2007 and the adverse effects of global food and fuel price increases.

1.8 The wage bill accounted for a large part of government’s recurring expenditure. In
2008 the central government spent 47 percent of recurrent expenditures (11.0 percent of
GDP) on the wage bill. Nominal salary expenditures increased by 21 percent in 2004-2008.
This increase was in part a response to greater demand for public services, low flexibility for
hiring of established personnel, and in part as a consequence of an outdated pay and
classification plan.

1.9 The financial crisis and the ensuing contraction in economic activity resulted in a
slowdown in private sector credit demand. The collapse of the CL Financial Group with
operations in St. Lucia and other Caribbean countries highlighted weaknesses in the
regulation and supervision of the non-bank financial sector, particularly the insurance sector.

1.10 St. Lucia was exposed to financial distress due to troubles at the CL Financial Group
and its subsidiaries in the life insurance business: Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO)
and British American Insurance Company (BAICO). Both companies used term deposits
                                                               3


taken from policyholders to invest in real estate in the United States. As a result of the US
real estate market downturn, BAICO came under judicial management and CLICO assets
were seized by the government of Trinidad and Tobago on January 30, 2009.1

1.11 St. Lucia’s vulnerable groups were significantly affected by the economic downturn.
The situation was particularly worrisome as, in 2006, one-fourth of St. Lucia’s population
was already living below the poverty line, crime was increasing and unemployment rates
were about 17 percent. Unemployment rates among youth and women, already high, were
expected to increase. The government had in place a series of social programs however these
were largely piecemeal, expensive and inefficient in targeting the most vulnerable.

1.12 The government proposed to address these challenges by longer term structural reforms
including a single-rate Value Added Tax (VAT),2 improving efficiency in tax collection,
developing a social safety net reform strategy, rationalizing the wage bill, and strengthening
insurance regulation. Private sector development was a priority for the government as it
prepared to respond to the changing global business environment as well as the move toward
a Caribbean Single Market Economy. To adjust to this new reality, the authorities were
finalizing a new Private Sector Development Strategy jointly with a National Investment
Strategy.

Recent Developments
1.13 St. Lucia’s economy was on a path to achieve a modest growth in 2010, buoyed by a
noticeable rebound in tourism which increased by about 15 percent through September 2010.
During October 30-31, 2010, Hurricane Tomas struck St. Lucia causing loss of life and
substantial damages to infrastructure and agriculture. It also caused significant damages to
the road network, the water supply, and the agriculture sector. The damage to the banana
industry was estimated at 80 to 90 percent losses. The impact on the tourism sector, which
has just started its high season, was pronounced. The total impact of Hurricane Tomas was
43.4 percent of Saint Lucia’s GDP3 .

1.14 The government was forced to run a large fiscal deficit to finance repair to damaged
infrastructure and provide grants to the affected population. The deficit was financed through
domestic and international borrowing. The authorities financed the reconstruction through
grants and external concessional financing, and borrowing from IMF through the Rapid
Credit Facility/Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance and from other international financial

  The CL Financial Group is based in Trinidad and Tobago, and provides policies throughout the Caribbean. However, due
to jurisdictional issues and regulations prevailing at the time the exposed countries had limited legal recourse to mitigate the
adverse financial impact of CLICO and BAICO’s restructuring and reorganization which was a consequence of the financial
crisis. St. Lucia was less exposed to BAICO than other ECCU members but its exposure to CLICO was significant.

  The 2009/2010 Budget Address notes that, “Government views the introduction of VAT as part of its strategic policy
response in strengthening economic management, thereby building the reliance of the economy to vulnerability and external
shocks. The need for this strategic approach has become even greater in light of the impact of the global recession.”

institutions. In February 2011, the Bank approved a US$15 million credit for the Hurricane
Tomas Emergency Recovery Project to provide additional resources to rehabilitate damaged
infrastructure and stabilize high risk areas on an expedited basis.

1.15 St. Lucia has yet to fully recover from Hurricane Tomas. Further, the pre-crisis
imbalances particularly debt-financed growth that left the country with high external, public
and private debt, remain (IMF, 2012). Fiscal imbalances have widened, reflecting past
expansionary policies as well as the recent stimulus efforts to boost growth, and are expected
to contribute to continued sizeable external current account deficits. The policy response to
support flagging growth has been strong, with a significant injection of public demand over
the past three years, but policy space has been very limited and fiscal vulnerabilities have
accumulated.4

1.16 The VAT was introduced in September 2012, which led to a jump in cost-push
inflation. The already high unemployment increased sharply during the cyclical downturn.
The financial system has weathered the downturn, but weak economic activity is taking a
toll. The pre-crisis credit boom left financial institutions with notable asset quality problems:
nonperforming loans almost doubled during the past two years, their resolution hampered in
part by the inability of banks to foreclose on available collateral due to cumbersome
procedures.

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
2.1 The Loan Agreement states that the loan is made to support the carrying out of the
government’s program of actions, objectives and policies designed to promote growth and
achieve sustainable reductions in poverty and sets out the specific prior actions to be carried
out as prior actions for the loan. In addition the Program Document states that the DPL aims
to "support policies and reforms that will assist the Government of St. Lucia in dealing with
the emerging short term economic challenges brought about by the global crisis and further
advancing the country’s longer term development agenda" and “supports adequate economic
policies to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and to strengthen the framework
for sustainable economic recovery and growth.”5. More specifically, the DPL Program
Development Objectives were to:

           Improve the business environment, competitiveness, and strengthen the financial
            sector by supporting reforms to reduce delays in starting a business, buttress financial
            sector regulatory environment, mitigate regional contagion risks, and promote
            investment.
           Improve public sector governance and economic management by supporting reforms
            to improve public service efficiency and performance, increase the efficiency of tax
            collection, enhance fiscal discipline and strategic allocation of resources, strengthen

         accountability, and help cope with the adverse consequences of the global economic
         downturn.
        Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets by supporting efforts to
         develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms
         and prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.

2.2 The Program Document outlines the short term economic challenge of providing
support to the government’s budget and external financing needs which was critical for
maintaining macroeconomic stability during the global economic crisis and keeping the
government’s program intact for a quicker recovery6. The Loan Agreement enumerates as the
basis for the loan only the specific program development objectives identified in the Program
Document and does not refer to the identified driving need to provide short-term financial
support during the global economic crisis. For this review, the loan objectives are those
specific actions set forth in the Loan Agreement. In addition the government’s letter outlining
the Program refers to both the pressure on the government’s fiscal and debt positions because
of the global crisis and the critical need for budget support for maintaining macroeconomic
stability and the imperative of proceeding with the reform agenda for realigning the economy
on a sustainable and growth oriented trajectory.

The Design of the Operation
KEY POLICY ACTIONS

2.3 There was one general condition - to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework
consistent with the objectives of the Program- and several prior actions relating to the
specific objectives of the Program.

PRIOR ACTIONS

2.4 Prior to Board presentation the actions listed numerically under each heading below
had been taken by the government:

        Improving Business Environment, Competitiveness, and Strengthening the
         Financial Sector:

           i.    The Government had submitted to its Parliament an Insurance Bill.

          ii.    The Government, through its High Court, had appointed a judicial manager to
                 perform a review of BAICO within the Borrower’s territory, with a view to
                 recommending an orderly resolution in connection with the insolvency of
                 BAICO.

  Program Document para. 8 states “ the proposed DPL/DPC provides timely financial support to the Government of St.
Lucia to manage the impact of the global economic crisis and to maintain and reinforce the implementation of the longer-
term structural reform agenda.”
                                                6


            Improving Public Sector Governance and Economic Management:

        I.      The Government had established a cap on public service employment to hold the
                size of funded positions at the FY 2008/2009 levels (6884 funded positions), and
                stopped the funding of vacant approved positions as outlined in the FY 2009/2010
                budget (7603 approved positions) in said sector.

       II.      The Government had merged its Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
                Economic Planning and National Development to create the Ministry of Finance,
                Economic Affairs and National Development under the administration of a single
                Permanent Secretary, pursuant to its Cabinet Decision No. 989 of 2009.

    III.        The Government had:

                (a) submitted to its Parliament a Value Added Tax Bill; and

                (b) established a VAT Implementation Unit and made the unit functional with
                adequate staffing and resources.

    IV.         The Government had commenced the implementation of Automated System for
                Custom Data (ASYCUDA) World program in its customs department as follows:
                allocated an amount of approximately EC$1.5 million for the implementation of
                the ASYCUDA program in the FY 2009/2010 budget; launched a training
                program for its customs administration personnel; completed a prototype software
                for ASYCUDA program; and developed a corporate strategic and business plan
                outlining a sequential implementation for the ASCYUDA World program for the
                next three years.

            Improving Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social Safety Nets:

        I.      The Government had completed a Social Safety Net Assessment and conducted
                subsequent stakeholder consultations on the results of the assessment.

       II.      The Government had established a Social Safety Net Steering Committee to
                spearhead reform efforts of its Social Safety Net System.

2.5 The Operations Policy Matrix also includes the expected subsequent actions of the
second phase of government reform programs. Policies and reforms described in the
government’s Program are not benchmarks for the evaluation of this operation.

POLICY AREAS

2.6 The prior policy actions supported by the DPL aimed at advancing the country’s longer
term development agenda by improving the three policy areas noted above. The actions taken
are discussed below:
                                                7


(i) To improve the business environment and competitiveness, and strengthen the
financial sector:

2.7 The move towards a Caricom Single Market Economy posed new challenges for
private sector activities in St. Lucia. In particular, the diversification strategy that turned the
country into one of the most diversified islands in the region was no longer relevant. To
adjust to this new reality, the authorities prepared a new Private Sector Development Strategy
jointly with a National Investment Strategy that focused on bringing more foreign direct
investment, including from nationals living abroad. In addition, a draft Competition Law was
prepared to ensure that the benefits of the Caribbean Single Market Economy are not lost to
anticompetitive practices. The government was also reviewing the proposal of the creation of
a new Trade and Export Promotion Agency (TEPA).

2.8 To improve the business environment, the government has moved from manual to
electronic registration of companies with the aim of putting all records of the Registry Office
in electronic format. Electronic registration mechanisms including electronic payment
(approved by an Electronic Transaction Act) were supported by the Program to increase the
ease of conducting business transactions; however the shift has been slow to start up and
faced problems during its launch.

2.9 The government was fully aware of the risks in regional financial markets and intended
to move ahead in mitigating these by passing into legislation a new Insurance Bill to improve
regulations and mitigate contagion risks. The new Insurance Bill followed recommendations
of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank with the aim of strengthening the existing legislative
and institutional capacity for better regulation of the market and was supported by the
Program.

2.10 Also, to reduce the risk to financial markets, the government took actions to mitigate
the adverse impact of the collapse of the British American Insurance Company (BAICO) and
the Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO). The new Insurance Bill and the appointment
by the government of a Judicial Manager to handle the BAICO financial fallout aimed at
protecting protect policy holders through the financial resolution of BAICO/CLICO in the
short term and help in the longer term financial regulatory reform.

(ii) To improve public sector governance and economic management:

2.11 The objective of this component was to increase efficiency in the public administration,
improve productivity in public service delivery and achieve a more sustainable and
predictable wage bill. In the short term, the Program focused on keeping the public wage bill
fiscally sustainable through aggregate measures such as capping the level of public
employment and identifying efficiency and productivity gains through functional and
institutional reviews. Following consolidation of two Ministries (Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Economic Planning and National Development), the Program supported the
initiation of the process for reviewing the human resource management system together with
the pay and classification systems in the public administration. This included conducting an
institutional review of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and operation and efficiency reviews
                                             8


for the Ministry of Social Transformation and the Ministry of Communications, Works,
Transport and Public Utilities.

2.12 The Program also supported the government’s efforts to reinforce revenue generation
capacity and improve efficiency of tax collection. The new Value Added Tax (VAT) bill
submitted to Parliament was designed to replace four consumption taxes. The introduction of
VAT will facilitate efficient collection, strengthen the revenue flow and create incentives for
expanding savings. After considerable discussion VAT was introduced in 2012 under the
VAT Act, but not all the provisions of the VAT Act are yet in effect. In addition, the
Program supported a modernization of customs through the implementation of the
Automated System for Custom Data (ASYCUDA). Both the VAT and the custom reforms
were expected to help the private sector comply with laws and regulations.

(iii) To improve effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets:

2.13 The program was designed to support government efforts to strengthen the crisis
response capacity of St. Lucia’s social safety net (SSN), and to improve its effectiveness and
efficiency in the medium and long term. The first step was the completion of a Social Safety
Net Assessment (SSNA) to evaluate the social assistance programs and identify immediate
steps to improve their support to poor beneficiaries, followed by the establishment of a Social
Safety Net Steering Committee to spearhead reform efforts of its Social Safety Net System.
An Action Plan was formulated by the Social Safety Net Steering Committee whose
priorities included the upgrading of the Public Assistance Program, and review of the Public
Assistance Law. Also, an Action Plan was formulated by the Social Safety Net Steering
Committee whose priorities included the upgrading of the Public Assistance Program, and
review of the Public Assistance Law. These steps were largely procedural – action plans,
reviews, setting up steering committees, etc. However, in the medium term the program
aimed to support actions to build consensus for reform of the social safety net among key
stakeholders and establish appropriate actions and sequencing of tasks to undertake that
reform.

M&E Design: Key Outcome Indicators:
2.14 To monitor progress over time and judge its success the operation had the following
indicators. Targets were set for each of the items to be accomplished by the closing date
(June 30, 2011):

      Legislation was to be in place requiring basic solvency margin (capital requirements)
       for life insurance companies and annuity definitions are tightened to ensure that
       products offered are clearly defined as insurance products and covered under the
       regulations (Baseline: no capital requirements and definition of annuity products was
       broad and included deposit type products in 2009).
      Fiscally sustainable wage bill was to have been presented, ensuring key public
       services coverage and quality do not decline (Baseline: central government
       expenditure on wages and salaries projected to increase from 11.7 percentage of GDP
       in 2009 to 12.4 percentage of GDP in 2010; Target: Central government expenditure
                                              9


       on wages and salaries contained to below 12 percentage of GDP in 2010 and reduced
       to 10.3 percentage of GDP in the medium term).
      Higher efficiency on tax and customs administration was to have been achieved
       (Baseline: operating costs of collecting EC$1 were 3.3 cents in 2008; Target:
       operating costs of collecting EC$1 are 3.0 cents).
      Critical information was to exist to allow developing objective selection criteria for
       beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for social programs (Baseline: no
       such information available prior to August 2009).

Relevance of the objectives is rated as High. The relevance of the objectives of the DPL
program was high at the time of the appraisal and they remain relevant to date. St. Lucia’s
small, open and largely tourism-dependent economy is vulnerable to external shocks. Prior to
the global financial crisis, St Lucia had faced several external shocks, both natural and
economic. Declining tourism revenue following the global financial crisis severely impacted
St Lucia’s already stretched pre crisis fiscal position. Vulnerable groups in St. Lucia were
significantly affected by the global crisis.

2.15 The priorities of the government program to address the above challenges were stated
in the budget speeches for FY09/10, and FY10/11 and were articulated around the following
pillars: (i) Private sector development and financial sector reform, (ii) Public sector
efficiency and performance, and (iii) Social safety nets. The DPL reform program as
described above was aligned with the government program pillars. Furthermore, St. Lucia is
part of the Bank's Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) FY10-14 that was adopted a few
months after the DPL approval and that has two main pillars: (i) building resilience, and (ii)
enhancing competitiveness and stimulating sustainable growth. More specifically, the FY10-
14 RPS was to contribute to achieving improved fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing
efficiency and transparency of public spending and service delivery, sustaining
macroeconomic and financial stability, strengthening policy coordination and economic
management, rationalizing social safety net programs and its targeting system. These
objectives were fully reflected in the Program supported by the DPL.

Relevance of Design
2.16 Relevance of design is rated as Modest. The project was conceived in the context of
the global financial crisis. The government was in need of a quick disbursing operation based
on budgetary needs to address the macro-economic challenges posed by the crisis. The stand-
alone DPL was to meet this need. However, the stated objectives and program were
medium/long term. There was thus a mismatch between the short-term nature of the
operation (12 months) and the time needed to make concrete progress in the identified areas
of reform as designed. A stand-alone operation could only launch the reforms but these will
take many years to complete and to achieve the objectives. The planned activities of the
Program after Board presentation, as designed, merely touched on the surface some of the
                                                           10


deep rooted challenges which clearly required a medium to long term or a multi- year
operation.7

2.17 The activities while well aligned with the government’s medium term plans and
structural reforms as identified in several Bank and Fund’s analysis were not designed to
yield results in the short term. The scope of these activities, covering many sectors, was
clearly ambitious and too wide for the one year DPL. Planned policy actions such as the
approval of new legislation by the parliament, public sector reforms, and pay classification,
mergers and reviews of ministries with entrenched constituencies are not easy to formulate
and implement particularly in the short term and in view of the low public sector capacity.

2.18 The operation was conceived in the context of the financial crisis and was expected to
support the government’s budget in maintaining macroeconomic stability under the turmoil
of the global economic crisis and keeping the government’s program intact for a quicker
recovery. However, though clearly stated in the Program Document, macroeconomic
stabilization was not included as an explicit objective in the Loan Agreement or its
accomplishment, or lack of accomplishment, assessed in the evaluation reports. There is a
mismatch between delivering swiftly needed financial support to meet balance of payment or
budgetary constraints and giving adequate and well-structured support to spur medium-term
reform programs.8

2.19 Overall the results matrix chain was ambitious and even unrealistic, as policy actions
of the program represented in many cases only a start in comparison to what was needed to
effect real change on the ground. Most indicators were consequently unrealistic given the lag
in legal reform and the risk of natural disasters as discussed above. Some indicators in the
policy matrix were not clearly defined, such as that relating to critical information needed to
develop objective selection criteria for beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for
social protection programs, or the difference between solvency margins and capital

 IEG’s evaluation, World Bank Group Response to the Global Economic Crisis. Phase II, notes in Chapter 7: “A common
message to emerge …is that the Bank’s present instruments may not be well adapted to the nature of cr isis lending.
Limitations appear in the content in terms of responding to the needs of the moment or in terms of achieving medium-term
support. During the crisis, the Bank has had perforce to rely largely on its existing country engagements, which then become
a substantial focus of its crisis operations…. Although in some cases useful medium-term reform has been undertaken, in
many cases the difficult circumstances of preparation of operations during a crisis tend to limit the extent of medium-term
reform achieved. Especially in countries that may be less seriously affected, a question for the Bank is whether, given the
difficulties of achieving solid medium-term engagement through crisis lending, a new form of countercyclical crisis
engagement is needed that is less demanding in terms of depth of reform but that also reflects a shorter, crisis-specific
engagement…”

  IEGs evaluation World Bank Group Response to the Global Economic Crisis. Phase II notes that “crisis response DPOs
typically supported a broad array of reforms that should help attain stronger fiscal outcomes in the future. However, as
public financial management reforms require focused action over time to attain the expected results, stand-alone crisis
response DPOs were ill suited to follow up on this reform agenda. Important structural fiscal reforms were sometimes
disregarded.”( Chapter 2). “The policy content of DPOs was often only partly relevant to the fiscal challenges of the crisis,
reflecting in many cases the need for rapid processing and crisis induced pressures. Some programmatic DPOs were not
modified to address the consequences of the crisis. Most also included policy components with other foci; in only half were
these relevant to the crisis, despite their relevance for longer-term development objectives”. (Chapter 5). “ Programs were
based on areas that lent themselves to swift preparation, often through prior or ongoing engagement”.( Chapter 3).

requirements of insurance companies. The ICR points out that this could probably be because
of the urgency (of the crisis) in which the operation was designed. Furthermore, there were
no indicators for tracking public debt to GDP ratio, although maintaining a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework and gradually lowering the ratio to the regionally mandated
target of 60 percent was the implicit goal.

3. Implementation
3.1 This $12.0 million DPL was a single-tranche stand-alone operation. It was a blend loan
with an IBRD component of $4.0 million equivalent, and an IDA component of $8,0 million
equivalent. It was approved on June 8, 2010, and made effective on August 12, 2010. Loan
proceeds were fully disbursed at effectiveness and the operation was closed as scheduled on
June 30, 2011.

Implementation Arrangement
3.2 The Ministry of Finance was responsible for coordinating actions among other
concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved in the
implementation of the reform program being supported by the DPL including Ministry of
Social Transformation, Public Service, Human Resource Development, Youth and Sports;
Ministry of Health Wellness, Family Affairs, National Mobilization, Human Services and
Gender Relations; Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Consumer Affairs, and Custom
Administration.

Factors that Affected Implementation
3.3 In addition to the prior actions taken by the government before Board presentation of
the DPL, the operation included a number of follow-up actions to implement the agreed
reforms. Targets were set for these actions (see outcome indicators) under each of the three
policy areas to be accomplished by the closing date (June 30, 2011).

3.4 The project had a slow start and implementation of the program of actions did not
proceed as intended. Many of the planned policy actions – legal reform, introduction of
VAT, mergers of ministries, pay reviews and classifications, consolidation of piecemeal
safety nets and systems for targeting of beneficiaries were either delayed, not completed, had
to be revamped or not achieved. Several factors were responsible for this:

      Design issues: As discussed, there was a clear mismatch between the long term nature
       of the reform and the short duration of the loan. Many of the planned policy actions –
       legal reform, mergers of ministries, pay reviews and classifications- required
       extensive stake holder consultations and buy-in of many constituents and hence
       proved difficult to implement and were either not completed, revamped or dropped.
       It also did not help matters that St Lucia was not fully conversant with the DPL
       process, this being their first DPL. The Borrower’s Response (ICR, Annex 4)
       indicates their inability to fully appreciate the pre-board requirements and the need
       for deeper and more inclusive internal discussion to attain wide support of key
                                            12


       stakeholders and thereby assist in long-term sustainability. Some elements of the
       program are still to be introduced. For example, the new government has tabled a
       revised insurance bill based on extensive consultations and it is expected to be
       enacted. Technological glitches delayed the full implementation of the online registry
       and the ASYCUDA. While the latter is now in place the online registry is not fully
       operational. Likewise, introduction of the VAT took place only in October 2012 and
       several sectors are still exempt, though phased implementation is scheduled to take
       place.

      Capacity Constraints: Several constraints have been identified:

             (i) Public sector capacity in St Lucia is low and was also stretched due to the
             crisis. The medium to long term nature of the proposed reforms did not help
             matters. The proposed legal reforms came in the wake of bottlenecks in the
             drafting and preparation of legislation, and consequently there was a backlog of
             legislation that needed to be drafted, reviewed by cabinet, and presented to
             Parliament for approval. Technical glitches in several systems, such as the
             online company registration portal, were not addressed.

             (ii) The M&E system was not set up. There was only one officer in the Ministry
             of Finance who was assigned to coordinate with the Bank and this function
             ceased after the DPL was disbursed. . Some of the conditions such as
             establishing ceilings on public service employments proved challenging to
             implement and monitor.

             (iii) The implementation also suffered from limited supervision. Partly because
             of the hurricane, the government asked the Bank to postpone a supervision
             mission planned for early 2011. Eventually, the mission visited St. Lucia only a
             couple of weeks before the closing date. An earlier visit by the Bank team could
             have pointed out areas where more action was needed, and could have
             recommended that appropriate technical assistance was procured for that
             purpose.

      St Lucia is also vulnerable to, and has a high risk of, natural catastrophes and this risk
       materialized and affected implementation of the operation. The implementation was
       affected by Hurricane Tomas in October 2010. As discussed in Para 1.17 the
       hurricane diverted the government’s attention to the immediate problems at hand of
       responding to the affected population and rebuilding damaged infrastructures.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1 The stated objectives of the operation against which efficacy is evaluated are specific
objectives of the government’s long-term development agenda in three policy areas: (i) to
improve business environment and competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector; (ii)
to improve public sector governance and economic management; and (iii) to improve
effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets. While the required prior actions in these
policy areas had been met before Board presentation, the achievement of the DPL’s
                                              13


objectives is measured against actions implemented after Board presentation and outcome
indicators defined for each of the policy areas.

4.2 As commented on in paragraph 2.16 above, the Program Document states that while
this was a single-tranche operation, it was viewed as the beginning of a multi-year
engagement under the 2010-2014 Regional Partnership Strategy. The last column of the
Government’s policy matrix describes the Second Phase of Government Reforms9.

4.3 The Program Document also states that the operation’s support to the government’s
budget and external financing needs was critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability
during the global economic crisis and for keeping the government’s program intact for a
quicker recovery. A satisfactory macroeconomic framework is fundamental not only to
support the flow of economic activity, but to lower gradually the ratio of the public debt to
GDP towards the regionally mandated target of 60 percent (PD, Pg. 42). Even though it is not
a stated objective against which the operation is evaluated, the DPL loan was effective in
providing budgetary support to St Lucia at a critical time. Table 4.2 summarizes the
achievement of objectives.

Objective 1: To improve business environment and competitiveness and
strengthen the financial sector
4.4 This objective was to support the private sector development agenda by promoting
investment by reducing delays in starting a business, and improving financial sector
regulatory environment by mitigating regional contagion risks through the following policy
actions:

POLICY ACTIONS

4.5 The prior policy actions, as noted above in paragraph 2.04, were: i) submission of the
Insurance Bill to Parliament ii) appointment of a Judicial Manager to perform a review of
BAICO. After loan approval, the Borrower was to implement additional policy actions,
namely: (i) launching the on-line company registration portal; (ii) development of a regional
plan for the orderly resolution of BAICO/CLICO collapse and active participation by St.
Lucia in implementing the regional resolution; and putting in place legislation requiring basic
solvency margin (capital requirements) for life insurance companies and tighten annuity
definitions to ensure that products offered are clearly captured as insurance products and that
they are covered under the relevant regulations.

4.6 Insurance Bill: The bill that was submitted was sent by Parliament to a select
committee for review. The bill, which was lacking in many respects, lapsed after the election
of the new government in March 2012. A new bill was resubmitted to Parliament and is now


9 (Program Document, Annex 2).
                                           14


with the select committee for review. The bill has broad support of concerned government
bodies and is expected to be passed. The new Act would increase capital requirements as
well as solvency margins for general insurance, and would establish a solvency margin for
life insurance. It would also define annuities to ensure that they are insurance products and
not partly cash deposit type instruments and that the online registration is in place.

4.7 Appointment of a Judicial Manger to perform a review of BAICO: The Borrower,
through its High Court, appointed a judicial manager to perform a review of BAICO with a
view to recommending an orderly resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.

4.8 Regional plan for the orderly resolution of BAICO/CLICO collapse. St. Lucia
nominated the Director of the Financial Supervision Unit, in the regional Technical Core
Committee as a representative for resolution of BAICO/CLICO. The representative actively
participated in the resolution plan and currently also chairs the regional committee of
insurance regulators. The DPL supported this action with Technical Assistance. In April
2013, an agreement was reached at the regional level on the creation of a new entity to take
over BAICO’s insurance portfolio (Annex B).

4.9 Launching of the online company registration portal. The registry was launched in
2009, which included a search component and a company registration component. The first
component has been in operation for some time, but the second component was undermined
by technical glitches. Consequently, at the time of the ICR in October 2011, no companies
had been registered through the portal, and the Registrar of Companies and Intellectual
Property Office continues to do the process manually. The Doing Business Report on St
Lucia (2014), however, states that other than easing up the business start- up process by
making it possible to reserve/ check availability of company name on-line in 2010, St Lucia
has not taken any other steps to make it easier to start a business between 2011-2013.

ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVE

4.10 The only performance indicator to measure the achievement of the objective was that
the time required to register a business has been reduced by 80 percent or takes four days to
register a business (Baseline: 20 days to register a business in 2009). There were no
intermediate outcome indicators to measure the impact of the settlement for BAICO or the
insurance law. This target was only partially achieved with the introduction of the online
registry and the easing up of the business start- up process by making it possible to reserve/
check availability of company name on-line in 2010. The registration of businesses continues
to be manual and the number of days it takes to register a business in St. Lucia was 14 days
in 2010. The 2013 data indicates that the time to register a business takes 15 days with five
procedures and 6 days at the registrar’s office (Doing Business, 2014).

4.11 Based on the partial implementation of the policy actions supporting this objective and
the modest improvement in the time required to register a business, IEG’s Rating of Efficacy
for this objective is Modest.
                                              15


Objective 2: To improve public sector governance and economic
management
4.12 This objective was expected to increase efficiency of Inland Revenue and Custom
departments, and enhance fiscal discipline and improve expenditure efficiency in the public
administration. These goals were to be achieved through the following policy actions
(including prior actions) :-

POLICY ACTIONS

4.13 There were four prior actions that were implemented prior to the DPL: i) Cap on public
service employment ii) Merger of Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic
Planning and National Development iii) Submission of a Value Added Tax Bill and
establishing a VAT Implementation Unit and making it functional with adequate staffing and
resources iv) commencement of the implementation of the ASYCUDA program. Additional
policy actions to achieve this objective were that before closing date of the DPL the
government would initiate the institutional review of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
operation and efficiency reviews for the Ministry of Social Transformation and the Ministry
of Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities.

4.14 Cap on public service employment. This cap aimed at holding the size of funded
positions at the FY 2008/2009 levels (6884 funded positions), and stopped the funding of
vacant approved positions as outlined in the FY 2009/2010 budget (7603 approved positions)
in said sector. While the number of funded established positions was kept below the cap, the
actual number of employees was higher than the funded positions: funded positions were
6,732 in 2009/10 and 6,840 in 2010/11, while the actual number of established employees in
central government was 6,632 in 2008/09, 6,834 in 2009/10 and 7,050 in 2010/11. Part of the
increase in 2010/11 was due to the recruitment of police officers to address the rising security
concern, and it seems that the effort has been successful in reducing crime. At the same time,
the number of other employees (non-established, capital, in training and others) declined
somewhat in 2010.

4.15 Ministerial mergers. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Planning
and National Development were to merge to create the Ministry of Finance, Economic
Affairs and National Development under the administration of a single Permanent Secretary,
pursuant to its Cabinet Decision No. 989 of 2009. The government announced a merger of
the two ministries of Finance and Economic Planning and National Development. However,
there was no follow through and the merger has yet to be consummated.

4.16 Institutional Reviews. Functional reviews were carried out in the Ministry of Social
Transformation and in the Ministry of Communication, Works, Transport, and Public
Utilities. The Ministry of Social Transformation supported the recommendations of the
review, which included additional resources for the Ministry. Recommendations to achieve
better strategic management and policy operations, and enhance public sector efficiency in
select ministries were submitted to Cabinet for approval. However, the Ministry of
Communication, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities did not concur. Cabinet took note of
                                                       16


the recommendations but did not adopt them. There were no indicators to track enhanced
efficiency and performance of public sector institutions.

4.17 Value Added Tax Bill and VAT Implementation Unit. The Bill was submitted to
Parliament however it was not till October 2012 that the VAT was finally introduced. The
unit is housed in the Inland Revenue Department and the staffing arrangement is adequate
and implementation as the Budget statement for 2013 shows is in progress and has largely
been smooth. However, many sectors have been left outside its ambit. According to IMF
Article IV 2012 the expected “gain from the VAT will be realized only if all sectors
contribute, and the base is shielded from the exemptions that have eroded the yield of other
taxes.”

4.18 Implementation of ASYCUDA. The government implemented this program in its
customs department and allocated approximately EC$1.5 million for the implementation of
said program in the FY 2009/2010 budget. It launched a training program for its customs
administration personnel; completed a prototype software for the ASYCUDA program; and
developed a corporate strategic and business plan outlining a sequential implementation of
the ASYUDA program for the next three years.

4.19 St. Lucia launched ASYCUDA in September 2010. However migration to this
ASYCUDA program was done in one shot, which caused difficulties for users. A prototype
was not completed as planned. There were technical glitches in the new system, and there
was no back up. In October 2011, the ICR points out that ASYCUDA was still at a
developmental stage due to resource constraints. The e-documents were still to be introduced,
and overall implementation was about 50 percent. The new system was expected to be fully
operational by end-2011. Among recent developments the e-documents were introduced10 in
January 2012 and St Lucia has operationalized ASYCUDA11. St Lucia’s experience in
implementing ASYCUDA is helping others in the region; St Kitts recently sent a team of
experts to St Lucia in February 2013 to “experience first- hand the capabilities of
ASYCUDA.” 12

ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVE

4.20 The following were the outcome indicators to measure the impact of the policy
actions:

        Fiscally sustainable wage bill ensuring key public services coverage and quality
         do not decline. The government’s expenditure on wages and salaries was projected to
         increase from 11.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 12.4 percent of GDP in 2010 and
         reduce to 10.3 percent of GDP in the medium term. This outcome was not achieved:

                                            17


       government was able to contain growth of the central government wage bill:
       expenditures on wages and salaries were EC$316.2 million (10.77 percent of rebased
       GDP) in 2009/10 and EC$342.7 million (10.84 percent of rebased GDP) in 2010/11.
       The ratios with respect to the old GDP series were 11.87 percent and 11.92 percent
       respectively. The Governments’ Wage Bill continues to be high and according to the
       St Lucia’s Budget Statement 2013 represents almost 13 percent of GDP. This was far
       above the target of 10 percent.

      Improvement in indirect tax collection and Higher Efficiency in tax and custom
       administration. The government’s indirect tax collection (inland revenue and
       customs) was expected to improve by EC$28 million, or 1.0 percent of GDP
       (Baseline: Indirect tax collection on instruments replaced by the VAT was EC$168 or
       6.0 percent of GDP in FY2009/10). This outcome was largely achieved. The VAT
       was introduced in October 2012. With the implementation of the VAT, five taxes
       were repealed, namely Consumption Tax, Hotel Accommodation Tax, Environmental
       Protection Levy, Motor Vehicle Rental Fee and Mobile Cellular Telephone Tax. The
       VAT is administered by the VAT Section of the Inland Revenue Department. The
       introduction of VAT is expected to broaden the tax base and increase the
       effectiveness of tax collections.

4.21 For the period October 2012 to March 2013, the Inland Revenue Department had a
gross collection of $63.6 million. During the same time period, the Customs and Excise
Department collected $77.6 million, an average of $12.9 million for 6 months of importation.
These four taxes yielded EC$174.1 million in FY2009/10 (5.92 percent of GDP) and the
estimated revenue for 2010/11 is EC$153.2 million. Taking into consideration that in
FY2010/11 the consumption tax on fuel was converted into an excise tax, which raised
EC$44 million, revenues of those taxes increased by about EC$23 million in 2010/11.

       Higher efficiency on tax and customs administration. The operating costs of
       collecting EC$1 were 3.3 cents in 2008. The target was to have the operating costs of
       collecting EC$1 improve to 3.0 cents. This target was partially met. For customs
       only, the operating cost of collecting EC$1 was 3.30 cents in FY2008/09, 3.25 cents
       in FY2009/10, and 3.39 cents in FY2010/11. The equivalent costs of Inland Revenue
       were 1.37, 1.57, and 1.62, respectively. The total costs for Customs and Inland
       Revenue combined were: 2.40, 2.51, and 2.59 cents. With the improvements reported
       in Para 4.22 the customs administration is expected to improve.

4.22 As discussed above, the implementation of the policy actions to achieve this objective
was only partial for some actions (mergers and reviews of ministries and capping of funded
positions and at 13 percent the wage bill is way above the 10 percent target) but there has
been progress in the implementation of VAT as well as the ASYCUDA. Consequently, the
IEG Rating of Efficacy for this objective is Modest

Objective 3: To improve effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets
4.23 This objective was to improve efficiency and coordination of safety net programs
which were largely uncoordinated, fragmented, with many duplications and gaps.
                                            18


Policy Actions:

4.24 Prior actions taken before Board presentation of the DPL included that: (i) the
government had completed a Social Safety Net Assessment and conducted subsequent
stakeholder consultations on the results of the assessment and (ii) established a Social Safety
Net Steering Committee to spearhead reform efforts of its Social Safety Net System.
Additional actions to be taken after Board presentation included: (i) development of an action
plan for reforming the social safety nets and initial implementation of the plan; (ii)
completion of a review of targeting for Koudemain and revision of the targeting mechanism
based on this review; and (iii) existence of a technical ground for proxy means testing for
broader social safety net programs.

4.25 The following are the outcome indicators to measure the impact of these policy actions:

      Action plan for reforming the Social Safety Nets has been developed and is being
       implemented. The Action Plan formulated by the Social Safety Net Steering
       committee includes upgrading of the safety net and review of the Public Assistance
       Law. A key recommendation of the assessment was to consolidate all programs
       targeted for the poor under the Ministry of Social Transformation. It also provides for
       introducing a transparent targeting mechanism, streamlining payment mechanisms,
       and documenting policies and procedures to strengthen the efficiency and
       effectiveness of the program. It was expected that the consolidation of programs
       targeted for the poor, and improved targeting of social assistance programs, would
       yield fiscal savings. However, the plan has not been implemented due to lack of
       budget. A Poverty Reduction Strategy and interim work plan were completed in July
       2011, and were scheduled to be submitted to cabinet by end-October 2011.

      Review of targeting for Koudemain was completed and mechanism was revised based
       on this review. Technical grounds exist for proxy means testing for broader social
       safety net programs. The objective of the review was to lay the ground for a proxy
       means test that can be used for the broader social safety net programs. The
       assessment led to the conclusion that its targeting mechanism, based on the Poverty
       Assessment, was not appropriate for other programs. The assessment identified the
       improvement of the targeting mechanism of the Koudemain program- a pilot program
       modeled on Chile’s Puente program, covering 47 of the poorest households in 4
       communities in St. Lucia.
      Critical information exists to allow developing objective selection criteria for
       beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for social programs. This was not
       achieved and there is currently no new specific information for the selection of
       beneficiaries. The Ministry of Social Transformation views information from the
       Survey of Living Conditions and Household Budget (SLC-HBC) of 2006, which was
       part of the Country Poverty Assessment, as still pertinent for an objective
       beneficiaries selection criteria and targeting mechanism. The next Survey was
       planned for September 2012. An action plan for reforming the social safety nets has
       been developed and is being implemented.

4.26 The implementation of the policy actions to achieve this objective was only partial.
Consequently, the IEG Rating of Efficacy for this objective is Modest.

5. Ratings
Outcome
5.1 The relevance of objectives was High, while the relevance of design and the
achievement of the objectives was Modest. The overall outcome of this operation is rated
as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The DPL was expected to achieve the following outcomes:
(i) improve business environment and competitiveness, and strengthen the financial
sector; (ii) improve public sector governance and economic management; and (iii)
increase effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets. Two of three objectives were
partially met and one was not met. As this PPAR has shown, the reform program was
ambitious and it was unrealistic to be attained in a short period and in the context of the
crisis where the government’s resources were already stretched. There was limited public
sector capacity to carry out the agreed reforms. Although the program document
envisaged a robust M&E system, it was never set up. Some envisaged reforms such as the
VAT were recently introduced and are expected to broaden the revenue base; however,
full coverage is lacking as some sectors are exempt. The Insurance bill is in the final
stages of being adopted and the BAICO resolution is in sight. However, there has not
been any progress on wage bill, public sector and investment climate reform. The central
government’s overall deficit has widened to an estimated 12 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) by fiscal year 2012 (ending in March 2013), and public debt has increased
to about 78 percent of GDP. Consequently the outcome of the DPL is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcomes
5.2 The risk to development outcomes is Substantial given the stagnation in tourism
industry, large fiscal and current account deficits, and slow progress in implementation of
the reforms specified in the policy matrix of the DPL. Furthermore, the wage bill
continues to be unsustainable. The on-going wage bill negotiation with eleven labor
unions in the public sector that are currently demanding a 15 percent increase in wages
poses a difficult challenge for the authorities given the fiscal and economic fundamentals.
On the revenue side, the introduction of the value-added tax in October 2012 is expected
to broaden the revenue base. However, there is scope to further widen the tax base by
reducing tax incentives and exemptions. The government that came to power in March
2012 stated commitment to carrying out necessary reforms and to restoring growth.
However, its ability to achieve this also depends to a large extent on the recovery of the
tourism sector which in turn depends heavily on global economic recovery. Challenges,
at the country level, include the slow pace of reform in the business climate and the
public sector. The risk of natural disaster is high too. Although St. Lucia participates in
the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and major private enterprises
are partly covered by their own insurance, the potential costs of a major natural disaster
to the economy would still be high.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

5.3 St Lucia was severely impacted by the global financial crisis in 2008. The
budgetary support provided by the DPL was therefore relevant in addressing challenges
in key areas of the country's social and economic life. The short term duration of the DPL
reflected St Lucia’s need for a quick disbursing loan. However the project’s stated
objectives and policy actions to achieve them - though all relevant and based on previous
and ongoing analytical work- were medium to long term in nature. The operation thus
reflected a clear design mismatch.

5.4 In addition, the expected pace of implementation, and the results matrix of the
operation was also unrealistic given limited public sector capacity in St Lucia. The
government also had no experience with DPLs and lacked understanding of the Bank’s
process. To the Bank team’s credit, the DPL was designed under the pressures to
respond to St Lucia’s urgent needs following the global financial crisis. At the same time
it put together an ambitious program both from the point of the time needed to implement
it and the context of the DPL. The Bank team was aware of and acknowledged the
implementation capacity related challenges but did not include any specific provisions to
build capacity of the public sector.

5.5 Some reforms were not clearly defined, such as “critical information needed to
develop objective selection criteria for beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms
for social protection programs” or the difference between solvency margins and capital
requirements of insurance companies.

5.6 Bank team identified several risks including natural disasters and political risks that
could affect the achievement of objectives. Some of these risks materialized: Hurricane
Tomas, delays in mergers of Ministries and wage revisions and legal reforms. The
seriousness of the challenges of natural calamities, as well as getting the buy-in of
entrenched constituents affected by the proposed change particularly in the public sector,
proved hard to mitigate. The Bank team’s full appreciation of these challenges merited a
more realistic and well sequenced/ phased program design which the Bank team failed to
put together.

5.7   Quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

5.8 The weak public sector capacity would have required an intensive supervision
program to ensure successful implementation. However, this was not achieved in part due
to a change in the task team leader of the DPL after the Board approval which resulted in
a gap in Bank’s follow up of program implementation. The Bank team subsequently
proposed to carry out an Implementation Support mission in early 2011, but following
Hurricane Tomas, the government was focused on reconstruction efforts and it asked the
Bank to postpone the mission several times. The mission was finally held in June 2011,
                                            29

just a few weeks before the closing date. This certainly undermined the function of
implementation support.

5.9   Overall, the Bank’s performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Government Performance
5.10 The government program identified crucial issues for the future development of the
country, and reached agreement with the Bank on the Program to address an important
part of those issues. However, this PPAR mission findings (based on the discussions with
the relevant ministries) are that the DPL was largely prepared by the Bank team and that
broad based consultation with key stakeholders in the country on the reform program
were not held. The DPL was not included in the World Bank project unit in the ministry
and the government did not set up a monitoring and evaluation system as envisaged in the
program’s design. This being St Lucia’s first DPL, the government also felt that the
Bank team did not fully explain the significance of the conditionality associated with a
DPL or the meaning of the pre-conditions for presenting the DPL to the Board of
Directors of the Bank. The government was in need for funding and agreed to the
program for which there was no broad ownership of key stakeholders. The ability of the
government to carry out the reforms was also largely impaired by Hurricane Tomas
which struck St. Lucia in October 2010, a few months after disbursement of the DPL.

5.11 Overall there were significant shortcomings in the achievement of the operations’
objectives. There was little progress in many of the areas such as civil service reforms
and reduction in the wage bill, social safety net and the online registration of companies,
which is not operational four years after launch. Under the current government some
reforms have recently been initiated such as the introduction of the VAT, and tabling of
the revamped Insurance bill with broad stake holder support. Significant progress is also
being made on BAICO resolution. However, the fiscal position has deteriorated, and the
overall deficit widened to an estimated 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by
fiscal year 2012 (ending in March 2013), public debt increased to about 78 percent of
GDP and the public sector wage bill has increased to 13 percent of GDP.

5.12 IEG rates the Government Performance as moderately unsatisfactory

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13 Design: The Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and National Development
was responsible for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies,
including the Ministry of Social Transformation, Public Service, Human Resource
Development, Youth and Sports; the Ministry of Health Wellness, Family Affairs,
National Mobilization, Human Services and Gender Relations; the Ministry of
Commerce, Industry and Consumer Affairs, and Customs Administration.

5.14 As part of the preparation process, the Bank discussed with all relevant institutions
the development of M&E process to ensure adequate feedback to policy-makers. The
Bank team recognized that M&E is traditionally a weak area in small islands including
St. Lucia but there is strong understanding of the need to strengthen such mechanisms.
                                           30

The Bank thus agreed to maintain a dialogue with counterparts in the Ministry of
Finance. The government and the Bank agreed on a results framework with a number of
process, output and outcomes indicators to be assessed in June 2011, the closing date of
the program. Those were the agreed benchmarks for evaluation of the program supported
by the operation. These indicators, described in the Policy Matrix in Annex 2 of the
Program Document (Annex B), represent the agreed benchmarks for future evaluation of
the program supported by the DPL.

5.15 Implementation and Utilization of the M&E framework was limited. One of the
reasons for this was that the attention of the St. Lucia government was drawn by
Hurricane Tomas and its aftermath. The Bank responded quickly with an Emergency
Recovery Loan, which was approved by the Board in March 2011, but at the request if
the government, there were no supervision missions for the DPL until mid-June 2011,
only three weeks before the closing date.

5.16 The PPAR mission found that there was apparently no ownership of the system and
conditions described in the policy matrix. Second, there was no follow through by the
Bank to ensure that such a system was being established. Thirdly, the government’s
attention shifted to responding to the devastation caused by Hurricane Tomas. However,
the government did provide a progress report to the Bank as a part of the ICR preparation
mission in June 2011. Since the M&E was never set up there was no M&E
implementation. The World Bank project unit in the Ministry of Finance also stated that
it was not involved in the negotiations of the DPL and had no knowledge about the status
of implementation.

5.17 IEG rates the quality of the M&E system as Negligible.

6. Lessons
6.1   The DPL has four key lessons:

6.2 A single tranche, stand- alone DPL is not the best instrument to address both short-
term and medium-term challenges. The one-off DPL shored up St Lucia’s finances
through the influx of funds. However, its stated objectives were medium or long-term for
which the single operation DPL was not adequate. A programmatic series of DPLs would
have been a more appropriate instrument for engagement, allowing the government time
to implement St. Lucia’s ambitious program, particularly given known capacity
constraints.

6.3 In DPLs that are provided in the context of financial crisis to support the
macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal constraints, this needs to be explicitly recognized
and evaluated to assess its effectiveness. In cases where this is not recorded as an
objective, the documentation does not fully recognize the intent, nor credit the DPL with
what it achieves.

6.4 Lack of understanding or experience by the borrower requires factoring in
additional time to allow for delays and greater investment in building a better
understanding of process and purpose. Such situations also require greater stakeholder
                                           31

consultations both before and during implementation to ensure and enhance
understanding. This being the first DPL, the government of St Lucia was not conversant
with the Bank’s internal DPL process. The Borrower’s Response (ICR, Annex 4)
indicated a lack of complete appreciation of the pre-board requirements or their
significance in the loan process. This highlights the need for deeper and more inclusive
internal discussion to attain support of key stakeholders and buy-in.

6.4 Close supervision is instrumental for achieving Program outcomes in one-off DPLs
with a more medium-term outlook and targets and outcome indicators to be met at the
end of the Program. Close supervision is necessary to help in achieving the DPL and
reform program’s targets. In addition, following up and providing or financing technical
assistance if necessary, together with country dialogue to build local capacity, could be
useful to bolster reforms and enhance sustainability in the medium-term and both a good
supervision plan and methods to support sustainability should be considered at the outset.
