                          collecting EC$1 were 3.3 cents in 2008; Target: operating costs of collecting EC$1 are 3.0
                          cents).
                           (iv) Critical information exists to allow developing objective selection criteria for beneficiaries
                          and functional targeting mechanisms for social programs (Baseline: no such information
                          available prior to August 2009).
                          The Program Development Objectives are to:
                              Improve the business environment, competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector, by
                              supporting reforms to reduce delays in starting a business, buttress financial sector

                       Given the decline in fiscal revenues under the current global environment, the impact of the
                       global crisis particularly on vulnerable groups, financial sector risks from the regional inter-
                       linkages, these efforts are particularly important for maintaining macroeconomic stability,
                       improving the fiscal balance to create space for social protection and productive expenditures
                       and help foster growth in the medium term.
                       Contribution to the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS): The proposed ES DPL/DPC is viewed
                       as the beginning of a multi-year engagement and rooted under the OECS RPS FY2010-14
                       scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3, 2010. It also aims to create a policy platform
                       for medium-term reforms to be supported by the Bank or other donors in the future.
                       There are three main risks to the program supported by the proposed ES DPL/PDC:
                       Economic: Strong financial sector linkages in the region create contagion risks, as demonstrated
                       by the recent BAICO/CLICO collapse. A deeper and more protracted global slowdown and
                       further retrenchment of capital flows could deepen the impact on St. Lucia. St. Lucia is also
                       susceptible to other external shocks such as an increase in oil prices, specific shocks to tourism
                       sector, or further loss of tourism market share. Mitigation: As St. Lucia is vulnerable to external
                       shocks, prospects for mitigation are limited, although St. Lucia's exposure is partially mitigated
                       by it being one of the most diversified economies in the OECS. So far, the impact of the
                       BAICO/CLICO collapse has been contained and national authorities and the ECCB are
                       strengthening regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector. The government is
                       implementing a sound economic program, which enabled it to access SDR 6.89 million (about
                       US$10.7 million) under the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) of
                       the IMF in July 2009, and is taking further measures to manage the crisis.
                       Natural Disaster: St. Lucia's is vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical
                       storms. In the past, natural disasters have adversely affected the agriculture and tourism sectors,
                       with particularly severe effects on communities and households. In 2007, St Lucia was battered
                       by Hurricane Dean in August--which destroyed the island's entire banana crop--and an
                       earthquake in November. The large costs of recovery from natural disasters have contributed to
                       increasing indebtedness in St. Lucia and in the Caribbean as a whole, and have also redirected
                       scarce public resources away from long-run development plans. Mitigation: While difficult to
                       mitigate natural disaster shocks, damage to the major private sector enterprises would be partly
    Risks and Risk     covered by their own insurance. St Lucia participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
    Mitigation:        Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant
                       disaster. The Bank is also assisting St. Lucia through the St. Lucia Disaster Management
                       project II, which was approved in July 2004 and the project was later extended until December
                       2011 with additional financing. Finally, through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, the
                       Bank (together with IDB) is helping St. Lucia to increase its capacity to integrate climate
                       resilience into sectoral and national development strategies.
                       Political: As some of the actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC will have to go through a
                       Parliamentary approval process, there exists a risk that their enactment and implementation
                       could be vulnerable to special interests or delay by the opposition. Furthermore, actions that
                       have already taken place--such as the cap on public employment--could face continued
                       resistance. Similarly, the sharpening of social safety nets targeting mechanisms could be
                       challenged by groups who may find themselves no longer eligible for benefits. Mitigation: The
                       political risk is reduced by the UWP government's substantial majority in Parliament (11 seats
                       out of 17 in the House of Representatives) and the government's strong commitment to the
                       reform program. The risk is reduced further by the government's consultative approach to
                       reform implementation and the government's commitment to dialogue among all stakeholders,
                       as demonstrated, inter alia, by the reliance on the National Consultative Council in formulating
                       the budget and the announced establishment of a Tripartite Council to ensure regular dialogue
                       between the Government, employers, and major worker organizations. Furthermore, the IFIs
                       and other donors are also heavily focused on building consensus for the Government's reform
                       program.

         ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN/CREDIT

                                                    TO
                                              ST. LUCIA

    I.   INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document describes the proposed Economic and Social Development
Policy Loan/Credit (ES DPL/DPC) for US$12 million (IBRD US$4 million and IDA SDR5.3
million) to St. Lucia. The proposed ES DPL/DPC provides timely financial support to the
Government of St. Lucia to manage the impact of the global economic crisis and to maintain and
reinforce the implementation of the longer-term structural reform agenda. St Lucia's economy
was hit by Hurricane Dean and an earthquake in 20071, the fuel and food price increases in 2007
and 2008, and now the global crisis. In addition to the rigidity of the budget due to high debt
servicing and wage bill, the fall of fiscal revenues has further limited the Government's room for
implementing counter fiscal policies. St Lucia needs financial and technical support to adjust to
the deteriorated global environment and to address most urgent social issues. The ES DPL/DPC
will help the government in maintaining macroeconomic stability and protecting the poor while
enhancing economic and institutional foundations for faster development. Therefore, the ES
DPL/DPC supports specific actions to (i) improve business environment, competitiveness, and
strengthen the financial sector; (ii) improve public sector governance and economic
management; and (iii) improve effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets.

2.       After a period of moderate growth during 2003-2007, St Lucia has been hit hard by
the global crisis. Real GDP grew merely by 0.7 percent in 2008 and contracted sharply in 2009
by 5.2 percent, compared to an average growth rate of 3.6 percent during the previous 5 years,
when tourism was buoyant and FDI-related construction was booming. The recession in the
United States and Europe has contributed to lower tourism arrivals, FDI inflows, and
remittances. Fiscal revenue declined reflecting the cyclical downturn and a limited temporary tax
relief to the tourism sector. At the same time, the failure of the CL Financial Group in Trinidad
and Tobago, with extensive operations in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU)--
including St. Lucia--has highlighted the vulnerabilities of the financial system.2

3.      The Government responded to the crisis by relaxing the fiscal policy in order to
mitigate its impact on the economy, minimize the adverse implications for employment and
protect the poor. The Government of St Lucia implemented sound macroeconomic policies
prior to the crisis and the track record of satisfactory macroeconomic performance enabled the
Government of St. Lucia to obtain a disbursement of SDR6.9 million (approximately US$10.7

and some public infrastructure, and by an earthquake in November 2007.

million) under the Rapid-Access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) from the
IMF on July 27, 2009.3 4 However, faced with weaker than anticipated economic activity and
lower external grants, the authorities relaxed the fiscal policy to minimize the adverse
implications for employment and the poor. The economic contraction increased the
unemployment rate to 16.8 percent by end-2008 compared to 14.6 percent in 2007.5 The
unemployment rate is estimated to have increased further in 2009--which may worsen an
already high level of poverty.6

4.      In the meantime, the Government continued to implement critical structural
reforms and remained committed to its long term reform agenda, despite challenges
created by the global crisis. The Government is committed to further advancing key structural
reforms to promote economic growth, create jobs, improve public sector performance and reduce
poverty. Advances in the reform program include the creation of an online portal for company
registration, submission to Parliament of the new Insurance Bill aiming at improving the
regulatory environment and mitigating the risk of contagion from international financial markets,
appointment of a Judicial Manager to perform a financial review of BAICO with a view to reach
an orderly resolution, introduction of a cap on public employment in order to contain the rise in
public spending on wages, initiation of functional review of Public Departments, submission to
parliament a VAT law and completion of a social safety net assessment and creation of a steering
committee to improve targeting of social safety net programs.

5.      The proposed ES DPL/DPC supports the Government's program aimed at
maintaining an enabling macroeconomic environment, improving competitiveness and
strengthening the financial sector, improving public sector performance, and strengthening
safety nets. Maintaining an enabling macroeconomic framework should help contain the public
debt to GDP ratio on a sustainable path. Improving the regulation of insurance business should
help increase financial stability and mitigate the risk of contagion from international financial
markets. The ES DPL/DPC program will help improve the effectiveness of the social assistance
programs by building response capacity and improving outcomes of social programs through
taking stock of social assistance programs and designing better targeted and effective programs;
and, in the medium-term, achieving a reorganization and rationalization of St. Lucia's safety net
system. Important first steps will be taken to improve the business environment through reform
of business registration. The ES DPL/DPC provides support for improved efficiency and
performance of the public sector including maintaining a sustainable wage bill, ensuring

  ESF is available to countries eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) but that do not have a
PRGF program in place. Financing terms are equivalent to a PRGF arrangement and more concessional than under
other IMF emergency lending facilities. The conditionality associated with the ESF is tailored to members' needs
and circumstances. Under the rapid access component, the member will only need to commit to appropriate policies
to address the shock, and in exceptional cases, to take targeted up-front measures.

  St. Lucia does not have an IMF program but policy discussions are held under the Article IV and the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) Consultations. The IMF Executive Board concluded the most recent Article IV
Consultations with St. Lucia on March 15, 2010 and consultations with the ECCU countries including St. Lucia
were held in February 2009.

customs administrations and initiating public administration reform.

6.      The proposed operation is rooted in the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) FY10-
14 of the OECS and the World Bank, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3,
2010. The FY10-14 RPS rests on two pillars: (i) Building Resilience; and (ii) Enhancing
Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth. In this context, FY10-14 RPS will
contribute to improving fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing efficiency and transparency of
public spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic and financial stability,
strengthening policy coordination and economic management, and rationalizing social safety net
programs and improving targeting systems. These achievements will be critical in strengthening
the ability of the OECS to respond to exogenous shocks and laying the foundation for growth in
the medium term. This ES DPL/DPC is envisaged in the FY10-14 RPS as a single tranche
operation and is viewed as the beginning of a multi-year engagement.

    II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

7.      St. Lucia is a small island with relatively good social indicators. St. Lucia is an upper
middle income country with an area of 610 sq km, 158 km of coastline, an estimated population
of 169,960 and GNI per capita of US$5,530 ($9,190 PPP) in 2008. It has a well-established
parliamentary democracy, free elections, a multiparty structure, equality of access to political
activity and participative decision-making. Life expectancy is about 75 years in St. Lucia. It has
an adult illiteracy rate of 5.2 percent.7 It is a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Association of Caribbean States
(ACS).8

8.      Although more diversified that other small Caribbean economies, St. Lucia's
capacity to diversify further is limited, which renders the country highly vulnerable to
economic and natural shocks (including climate change impacts). First, St. Lucia suffers
from the myriad disadvantages of limited scale. Second, St. Lucia has a strong degree of
openness and is subject to commodity booms and busts, which compound the challenges of
macroeconomic management and create uncertain growth paths. Third, the six OECS countries
consistently rank in the top ten in the world in terms of their exposure to natural disasters and
climate change impacts. Fourth, St. Lucia has not benefited much from international aid for
years, in part due to its middle-income status. Overall, due to a combination of high exposure to
natural disasters, a small size and limited diversification, St. Lucia is much more sensitive to
external shocks than most other countries in the world and faces increasingly difficult policy
choices in an interdependent world, especially in the wake of the current global financial crisis.

9.      Due to high dependence on tourism revenues, recent adverse shocks to income from
tourism have had a large impact on growth. Tourism is the largest employer after the public
sector; tourism revenues based on BOP statistics amounted to 30 percent of GDP in 2009 and

tourism-related FDI is a significant source of growth. After growing 3.6 percent annually on
average during 2003-2007, economic activity slowed down sharply due to a series of external
shocks: Hurricane Dean in August of 2007, an earthquake in November 2007, and the food and
energy price spikes in 2007-2008. Growth fell to 0.7 percent in 2008 and real GDP is estimated
to have contracted by 5.2 percent in 2009 due to the adverse impact of the global crisis on
tourism, investment, and construction, before recovering with positive growth of 1.1 percent in
2010.
10.     St. Lucia's vulnerable groups are expected to be significantly affected by the global
crisis. Given St. Lucia's vulnerability to external shocks, the global crisis is having a significant
negative impact on the country. The situation is particularly worrisome as one-fourth of St.
Lucia's population was already living below the poverty line in 2006 and unemployment rates
were about 17 percent. Although the unemployment rate declined to 14 percent in 2007, it
increased back to 17 percent in 2008. Unemployment rates among youth and particularly
females, already high, are also expected to increase.9
11.     The new Government, led by Prime Minister, the Hon. Stephenson King, was sworn
into office in September 2007 and is focusing on managing the impact of the global
economic crisis, while strengthening longer term development prospects. The new
government is initiating additional structural reform policies to deal with the crisis and reinforce
the fundamentals of the country for accelerated growth and development. The government
presented to Parliament an annual budget for FY2010/11 on April 19, 2010, focused primarily on
generating growth, securing jobs, promoting competitiveness and protecting vulnerable citizens
in the face of global recession.

III.    ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT

12.     Economic activity in St. Lucia is dominated by tourism, while the role of other
sectors is declining. Tourism contributed 11.7 percent to total value added in 2008 and
accounted for 38 percent of employment in 2003-2005. Hotel activity is dominated by all-
inclusive resorts, while spending on independent restaurants and other activities is lower than in
other destinations. Although St. Lucia's policy of diversification has created the most diverse
manufacturing sector in the OECS, the contribution of manufacturing to the economy has
declined from 8.0 percent of GDP in 1990 to 5.9 percent in 2008.10 During the same period, the
share of agriculture in GDP also fell from 14.5 percent to 3.9 percent. This was largely driven by
declining export revenues from bananas--the main export crop--due to low international prices
and preference erosion: the share of banana exports in GDP fell from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 1.7
percent in 2007.




9
  According to St. Lucia Statistical Department, unemployment rate among the 15-24 age group stood at 31 percent
at the end of 2008. It was 36.2 percent for males and 23.8 percent for females.
10
   Manufacturing includes paper products, food-processing and beverages, electrical and metal items.


                                                      11
13.     St. Lucia's growth in 1991-2000 was slower than its OECS neighbors, and efforts to
revitalize growth have not produced the desired effect due to a series of external shocks.
Between 1991 and 2000, real GDP growth in St. Lucia averaged 2.2 percent per year, or 1.6
percent on a per capita basis. The government pursued expansionary fiscal policy after 1999 in
an effort to revive growth and reduce unemployment, but the policies had limited success due to
the adverse effects of September 11, 2001, on tourist arrivals. Growth picked up from 2003
through 2006--averaging 4.1 percent per year--but then slowed dramatically as St. Lucia
incurred damages from an earthquake and Hurricane Dean in 2007 and then, more recently,
experienced the adverse effects of food and fuel price increases and the global financial and
economic crisis (Table 1).

14.     Fiscal stimulus measures in the early 2000s sharply widened the public sector deficit
and rapidly increased debt levels. The consolidated public sector deficit widened from an
average of 0.7 percent of GDP during 1990­99 to 4.6 percent during 2000­03, primarily
reflecting a rise in the central government deficit with the rest of the nonfinancial public sector
remaining broadly in balance. Due to the worsening fiscal position and weak GDP growth,
public debt rose steeply from 44 percent of GDP in 1999 to 72 percent in 2003. Most of the
increase in debt was to foreign commercial banks. Public external debt nearly doubled, from 28
percent of GDP in 1999 to 55 percent of GDP in 2003.

                                                                     12
15.     Although the authorities strengthened fiscal management by improving revenue
administration and containing capital expenditures in 2002-04, the debt ratios remained
high. The central government's overall balance on a cash basis improved by more than 4 percent
of GDP between 2002 and 2004, reflecting public sector wage restraint, reduced capital spending
and higher tax revenue during recovery from the economic lows of 2000-02. However, debt
stocks continued to rise, reaching nearly 79 percent of GDP by the end of 2004.

16.     Continued prudent fiscal policies started to bear fruits after 2004, when debt levels
first stabilized and then began declining. Although deficits increased in 2005-06 as capital
expenditure rose prior to the Cricket World Cup, they did not translate into a greater debt burden.
In 2007 and 2008, the government was able to reach a primary surplus, reflecting an increase in
current revenue and a marked reduction in capital expenditures post-World Cup. The public
sector debt consequently declined to 68 percent of GDP by end-2007.

17.     External debt accounts for slightly more than half of all public debt and is issued
primarily by the central government. At the end of 2008, 82 percent of total external debt was
issued by the central government. Just under half of central government external debt (48
percent) was held by multilaterals, with the remainder held by bilateral and commercial
creditors. The central government also issued 94 percent of the domestic debt, 63 percent of
which was held by the domestic private sector (see Annex 4 for the debt profile in the OECS).

18.     Management of the wage bill has continued to pose challenges to fiscal discipline.
The central government employs 6 percent of the island's population and spends 47 percent of
recurrent expenditures (11.0 percent of GDP in 2008) on the wage bill, in line with the average
for small Caribbean states and below other Commonwealth Caribbean countries (Figure 1).
However, while nominal salary expenditures increased by 21 percent in 2004-2008 (in line with
inflation), other components of the wage bill, such as non-established positions and allowances,
grew by 42 percent. This increase was in part a response to greater demand for public services,
low flexibility for hiring of established personnel, and in part as a consequence of an outdated
pay and classification plan which is modified through piecemeal requests to attract and retain
qualified personnel to the public service.

19.     A key input for managing a sustainable wage bill while enhancing public service
performance is a solid pay and classification plan. The current pay and classification scheme,
enacted in 1992, has many weaknesses and distortions that make controlling the wage bill
difficult and demoralize public officers. Salaries for a number of posts are no longer competitive
with the local private sector. There has not been a broad benchmarking exercise with the private
sector or quasi-government organizations since 1992. Many new allowances have been
introduced since the last review, representing almost 30 percent of total remuneration for some
staff. Allowances have provided flexibility but have also made the current remuneration system
considerably more complex.

20.     Addressing capacity constraints rooted in outdated management practices is critical
for public sector performance. The existing capacity constraints in the public service arise
from an attempt to cover all functions typically carried out by bigger countries, on the one hand,
and outdated management practices, on the other. While the first point is common to all small
states, the latter refers primarily to the OECS and in particular St. Lucia's highly centralized

                                                13
personnel management system, in place since independence and concentrated in the independent
and constitutionally entrenched Public Service Commissions (PSC). The centralization of human
resources management at the PSC and outdated public service regulations do not leave public
sector managers room for efficiently managing their staff.

21.     Further efficiency improvements in tax and custom administrations are critical for
revenue enhancement. While St. Lucia ranks high among other Commonwealth Caribbean
states in terms of the efficiency of its tax and customs administration, there is still significant
room for improvement. Taxes on international trade amounted to 33 percent of total tax revenue
in 2008. Documentation under the current customs information system, ASYCUDA ++, is still
manual and leads to unnecessary delays in the clearance of containers and creates difficulties for

business environment. With the expiration of the Cotonou preferences in 2007 and the signing
of a Caribbean Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU in 2008, St. Lucia has had
to adapt to an erosion of European preferences for its exports and opening of its market to the EU
products. The eventual arrival of the Caribbean Single Market Economy (CSME) will bring
about another set of challenges and opportunities. The government is preparing for these changes
through a revision of the Private Sector Development Strategy, revamping the Fiscal Incentives
Act of 1974, developing a National Investment Strategy, and revitalizing the 2005 National
Export Development Strategy (SLNEDS).

23.     The financial sector is deep but subject to uneven and uncoordinated regulation. St.
Lucia's financial sector comprises 6 banks (3 foreign branches), 4 offshore banks, 7 finance
companies, and 31 insurance companies. In 2008, broad money supply and private sector credit
in the country were 91.7 percent and 136.1 percent of GDP, respectively, much higher than the
regional averages. As a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), all domestic
commercial banking activities and a few mortgage and finance companies in St. Lucia are
regulated under the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). All other depository institutions
activities such as cooperative credit unions, building societies, development banks, insurance,
and offshore banking entities are governed by national regulators.

24.     The percentage of the population living in poverty increased from 25.1 percent in
1995 to 28.8 percent in 2005/2006 and poverty is concentrated among the young. The
Country Poverty Assessment in 2005/2006 found that almost 60 percent of the poor are below
the age of 25. Poverty rates in rural districts are significantly higher than the 28.8 percent
national average, giving rise to rapid migration to the north-west of the island. Unemployment
rates have remained high at about 17 percent since 2006, and the government does not have an
unemployment insurance program.

25.     The fragmented structure of the social assistance programs poses efficiency and
effectiveness challenges. Similar to other OECS countries, St. Lucia has a wide range of social
programs including income support, public assistance cash and in-kind benefits, education and
health-based, labor market, housing, and community-based programs. A striking feature of the
social protection landscape is the number of programs and the multiple ministries involved in the
provision of social assistance (Table 2). At the same time, social assistance is characterized by:
(i) lack of clear eligibility criteria for many of the programs; (ii) uncoordinated programs
managed by different offices and agencies; (iii) large number of public subsidies targeted to poor

                                                    15
and vulnerable groups; (iv) lack of a single beneficiary registry for social assistance programs;
and (v) inadequate monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, there is limited information readily
available on the different programs, their costs, and the number of beneficiaries.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

26.     The adverse impacts of recent natural disasters and global crises contributed to a
sharp deceleration of GDP growth to 1.5 percent in 2007, 0.7 percent in 2008, and an
estimated contraction of 5.2 percent in 2009 (Figure 2). Tourist arrivals declined sharply in
the second half of 2008 and fell further in 2009 (5.8 percent decline y-o-y), with the negative
revenue impacts amplified by large hotel price discounts (up to 60 percent in the peak season)
and reductions in length of stay. However, this was offset to an extent by greater cruise
passenger traffic, which increased by 1.5 percent in 2008 and 12.8 percent in 2009. The rising
costs of raw materials and fuel depressed activity in manufacturing, construction, transportation,
and energy sectors. Manufacturing output fell by 5.4 percent in 2008, while air and sea transport
contracted by 3.8 and 12.8 percent, respectively. Public sector construction also fell due to
government fiscal constraints. The one exception was agriculture, where growth was supported
by a 21.3 percent increase in banana exports, although the overall impact on GDP was limited by
the small size of the sector.11

27.     Inflation, which has been volatile in the last few years, has fallen from its mid-2008
highs due to declining import prices and slowing economic activity. Inflation picked up in
late 2007 and early 2008 with the rising prices of imported food and energy (Figure 2), which
prompted the authorities to offer agriculture subsidies, continue subsidizing flour, sugar, and
rice, place an additional 15 basic food and health-related goods under price controls, and
temporarily suspend (until March 2010) the CARICOM common external tariff on several
imported foodstuffs.12 With the fall in international prices of food and fuel and the onset of the

  The increase in international prices was magnified by the depreciation of the US dollar, to which the EC dollar is
pegged.

global crisis, inflation decelerated markedly in the last quarter of 2008--bringing the end-of-
period figure to 3.8 percent--and continued falling to 1.0 percent by the end of 2009.

28.    The current account deficit--which had widened markedly during the preparations
for the 2007 Cricket World Cup--is contracting. After averaging around 15 percent of GDP
between 2000 and 2005, the current account deficit increased rapidly to 30 percent of GDP in
2006-08 due to higher imports in preparation for the Cricket World Cup, continued terms of
trade deterioration, and, after the hurricane season, a decline in tourist arrivals (Figure 3). The
                                                          current account deficit contracted

                                                         as the reduced availability of foreign
                                                         financing put downward pressure on
                                                         imports.

                                                      29.    Most of the current account
                                                      deficit has been financed through
                                                      FDI, but FDI inflows have not kept
                                                      pace with the rapidly widening deficit.

                                                      inflows fell to 15.4 percent of GDP
(Figure 3). With a paucity of non-debt creating inflows, the current account deficit has been
increasingly financed with higher borrowing--primarily commercial--and draw-down of
reserves.

30.    Reduced availability of foreign investment has increased the demand for private
sector credit. Although household credit demand fell by 19.6 percent, business credit, both in
terms of loans and investments, increased by 14.1 percent between June 2008 and June 2009
while demand for commercial bank credit grew by 4.9 percent. This expansion, financed by
increased foreign borrowing by banks, has increased credit risks.

31.     The growth of credit is overshadowed by weakening banking indicators. Although
the earnings of commercial banks have improved, non-performing loans increased from 5.8
percent in 2007 to 6.6 percent in 2008 due partially to the tremendous credit increases in
previous years and partially to the current global economic slowdown. Although this ratio is
below the 7.7 percent ECCU average, it is higher than the 5 percent ECCB target (Table 3).
Commercial banks' excess reserves at the ECCB dropped and interbank interest rates increased
toward the end of 2008. Spreads on ECCU sovereign bonds in the over-the-counter repo market
spiked to an unprecedented level at the end of 2008, signaling that ECCU governments are
facing higher financing costs.

32.    In addition to the current global crisis, St. Lucia has also been exposed to severe
financial distress due to troubles at the CL Financial Group. CL Financial Group, a large
insurance, banking, energy, agriculture, and real estate conglomerate, has run into trouble with
two of its subsidiaries in the life insurance business: Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO)
and British American Insurance Company (BAICO). Both companies used term deposits taken
from policyholders to invest in real estate in the United States. As a result of the US real estate
market downturn, BAICO is under judicial management and CLICO assets were been seized by
the government of Trinidad and Tobago on January 30, 2009. The deficiency of BAICO is
estimated at USD 287 million as of June 2009 in the Judicial Managers' report, which would
represent about 6.5% of the ECCU's combined GDP. The deficiency of CLICO Barbados to
which the Eastern Caribbean countries are exposed is not known precisely but is expected to be
sizeable.
33.     The CLICO/BAICO collapse has revealed a substantial weakness in the financial
regulatory regimes of St Lucia and the Caribbean at large. The CL Financial Group is based
in Trinidad and Tobago and its policies were sold throughout the Caribbean through subsidiaries
and branches. However, the exposed countries had limited legal recourse to mitigate the
financial impacts of CLICO and BAICO because the existing financial regulations are restricted
to each island's jurisdictions. Moreover, existing legislation does not prevent the occurrence of a
similar event in the future, and significant improvements need to be made to the regulation of
insurance companies, including adding minimum solvency requirements for long term insurance
and increasing minimum capital requirements.

34.    St. Lucia has been less exposed to BAICO than other ECCU members but its
exposure to CLICO is significant. In 2005, St. Lucia began to require that insurance companies
hold statutory deposits and establish an insurance fund equal to their liabilities. Preliminary
estimates suggest that the statutory deposits would have a net shortfall of EC$45-75 million to
cover the CLICO policyholder claims. In the case of BAICO, the insurance fund--currently
worth EC$4 million--largely covers the estimated EC$5 million in BAICO claims.

35.    The regional response to CLICO/BAICO is under development. Emergency meetings
involving the ECCB, Central Banks of Trinidad & Tobago and Barbados, and the Monetary
Council of the ECCU convened to discuss how to mitigate and resolve the issue. In July 2009,

                                                      18
the Monetary Council agreed that KPMG, an international advisory services company, will
perform the technical work required to bring a new company to take over the operations of
BAICO. In August 2009, regulators in the ECCU and the Bahamas intervened in the operations
of BAICO and appointed Judicial Managers in all ECCU countries with branches of BAICO
except Dominica. The judicial managers have endorsed the solution put forward by the
governments of the ECCU to establish a new entity to take over BAICO. The Monetary council
also appointed a Ministerial sub-committee on insurance which is supported by a core technical
team to progress with the resolution of BAICO. The core team has met with a potential strategic
investor discuss participation in the new company. As for CLICO Barbados, it has been given
until June 2010 by the government of Barbados to achieve a feasible restructuring plan with
policyholders; should it fail, the company is expected to be placed under judicial management.

36.    Although the government achieved a primary budget surplus (excluding grants) in
2007, the situation began to deteriorate in 2008. While revenue collection strengthened from
28.1 percent of GDP in 2007 to 28.9 percent in 2008, expenditure on salaries and capital goods
increased by 0.9 and 0.5 percentage points of GDP, respectively. As a result, the primary budget
surplus (excluding grants) contracted to 1.1 percent of GDP.

37.     The fundamental challenge for the government in FY2009/10 has been the
adjustment to the deteriorated external environment. The fundamental challenge for the
government in FY2009/10 has been the adjustment to the deteriorated external environment. In
FY2009/10, the Central Government's primary fiscal balance deteriorated by EC$80 million (or
3.1 percentage points of GDP), from a surplus of EC$43.9 million (1.7 percent of GDP) to a
deficit of EC$36.1 million (1.4 percent of GDP). This reflected an increase in expenditures, both
current and capital. On the revenue side, the decline in current revenues was partly compensated
by an increase in grants from the European Union and Taiwan, China, while capital revenue
dropped by 0.3 percentage points of GDP. The overall deficit of about 4.8 percent of GDP was
financed mainly from external sources.

38.     Although the authorities were projecting a primary budget surplus of 0.8 percent of
GDP for FY2009/10 at the time of access to funds under the IMF's ESF in July 2009, fiscal
policy was later relaxed to cope with the adverse effects of the more than anticipated
contraction in economic activity. The track record of satisfactory macroeconomic performance
enabled the Government of St. Lucia to obtain a disbursement of SDR6.9 million (approximately
US$10.7 million) under the Rapid-Access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF)
from the IMF on July 27, 2009. At that time, the authorities were projecting a primary budget
surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP for FY2009/10 based on less optimistic revenue projections,
scaling back on capital spending, limiting public sector wage increases, and raising fuel prices.
However, in the face of the severe impact of the global crisis, the government increased capital
expenditures to minimize the adverse implications for employment and poverty. At the same
time, total revenue and grants are projected to have fallen short of the estimations in July 2009
for FY2009/10 by 2 percentage points of GDP. As a result, central government primary budget
balance is projected to give a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 (Table 4).

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

39.    The global economic crisis has worsened the near-term outlook for St. Lucia.
Following a steep contraction of 5.2 percent in 2009, real GDP is expected to grow by just 1.1
percent in 2010 (Table 5). In the medium term, growth is expected to accelerate to 3.8 percent
per year in 2013-2014 on the back of resumption in tourism flows.

40.     The slow pace of recovery will keep inflation pressures down. Price growth is
expected to accelerate moderately to 1.9 percent by the end of 2010 as recovery begins to take
root, and remain around that level in the medium term.

41.     After almost halving from its 2008 level, the current account deficit is expected to
start widening again in 2010. The deficit on the current account is estimated to have fallen from
31.0 to 20.0 percent of GDP amid a large contraction in imports. FDI inflows declined to 8.3
percent in 2009, down from 28.3 percent in 2007. While commercial bank borrowing and FDI
were the major vehicle for financing the current account deficit in 2008, official capital flows
emerged as the important financing mechanism in 2009. As both import demand and the inflows
of financing are expected to recover in the medium term, the current account deficit is likely to
widen to 22-23 percent of GDP in 2012-2014. As in the past, a major portion of the deficit is
expected to be financed through FDI, although official borrowing is likely to play a larger role
than before.

42.     The main near and medium-term risks include slower recovery in major tourist
markets, additional financial system stress, and further market share losses of agricultural
exports. The extent and speed of the recovery in tourism depends heavily on future
developments in England, Canada, and the US, which supply an estimated 75 percent of tourists
to the English-speaking Caribbean.13 While an improvement in demand will help, a resurgence

of hotel investment is still likely to take time due to current excess capacity. A further
contraction in private capital flows would exacerbate existing problems, which can propagate
through the region's financial institutions quite quickly as demonstrated by the recent CL
Financial and Stanford Group events. Finally, the end of the EU's quota under the Cotonou
Agreement will remove an important source of revenue for agricultural producers although the
Fair Trade scheme--which guarantees a relatively stable price to growers--has allowed the
producers to carve a significant niche market in the UK.

43.      The government of St Lucia fully recognizes the importance of reversing the
deterioration in fiscal balances and implementing a credible fiscal framework for ensuring
fiscal and debt sustainability. Public debt is estimated to have increased from 66 to 77 percent
of GDP between 2008 and 2009. Under no policy change scenario, the public debt to GDP ratio
is likely to continue increasing and reach about 89 percent of GDP by 2020. The government of
St Lucia is fully aware of this risk and trying to calibrate the timing of the fiscal tightening so as
to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability while minimizing adverse implications for employment.

44.     The government has reiterated its commitment to a medium-term fiscal strategy,
which would help achieve fiscal and debt sustainability. In this context, the government has
announced fiscal measures within its FY2010/11 budget, which include implementation of
market based property taxes and a tax on interest income. The Government reintroduced vehicle
licensing fees in January 2010. The government has also submitted a VAT law to its Parliament
to introduce a broad based Value Added Tax.

45.     The public sector debt projections for St Lucia assume that the Government
withdraws fiscal stimulus and implements a moderate degree of fiscal consolidation from
2011 onwards. Under this baseline scenario, in 2011 and the following years the Government
limits its wage expenditure to below 12 percent of GDP and realizes some important revenue
gains from the implementation of the VAT as well as property and interest income taxes (see
Figure 4 and Annex 5). In this case, public sector debt is likely to grow through 2011 but start
declining thereafter. By 2014, public debt to GDP ratio would reduce to below 80 percent and
continue falling to below 75 percent by 2019.

46.    Despite the worsening of the fiscal situation in the near term, debt sustainability
analysis indicates that St. Lucia remains under a moderate risk of debt distress. If the
Government were to implement even stricter measures including a sharp reduction in capital
expenditure in 2010 and 2011 and under more optimistic assumptions about revenue gains from
the new taxes (3.1 percent of GDP in 2012 and thereafter, compared with 1.2 percent in the

                                                         22
baseline), the public debt to GDP ratio could decline to 71 percent of GDP by 2014 and fall
below the ECCB benchmark of 60 percent by 2020. Moreover, although extreme shock scenarios
are likely to lead to a breach of the present value of debt to GDP and debt service to export
thresholds, stochastic simulations assign low probabilities to such extreme scenarios for St. Lucia
and therefore support the assessment of moderate risk. The risk is further mitigated by the
adoption and implementation of macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability reforms supported by
this ES DPL/DPC. However, if the Government maintains the current expansionary fiscal stance
and gains only negligibly from the new tax measures, the public debt to GDP ratio would not
assume a declining path and could instead rise to 89 percent of GDP by 2020.

47.     Notwithstanding the significant challenges posed by the global economic crisis, the
macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed
Economic and Social Development Policy Loan/Credit. The proposed ES DPL/DPC supports
adequate economic policies to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and to strengthen
the framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth. Bank staff has used projections of
St. Lucia' macroeconomic outlook to assess the sustainability of its fiscal program, balance of
payments, and associated debt dynamics. Bank staff has also taken into consideration the views
of the IMF and regard the IMF assessment as an additional element to conclude that St. Lucia's
macroeconomic situation is adequate and that government policies are likely to be sustainable
over the medium term. The ES DPL/DPC financing from the Bank, jointly with resources from
the Caribbean Development Bank and the EU will help assure full financing of the budget and
external financing needs, given the current assessment of the situation.

IV.      THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

48.     The medium term agenda and the specific priorities of the St. Lucian Government
are stated in Budget Speeches for FY2009/10 and FY2010/11.14 The program places a strong
emphasis on private sector development through strengthening the partnership between
Government and the private sector to stimulate the economy and set the stage for higher and
sustained growth in the medium term. It emphasizes the need to ensure the health and effective
regulation of the financial sector through measures to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory
framework of the sectors. And, it also emphasizes the need for regional integration. To address
the social impact of the crisis, the program focuses on economic and social re-engineering for
empowerment of households and poverty reduction. Lastly, it calls for greater effectiveness and
efficiency of the public service and operations of Government Departments. This strategy is
consistent with other statements that highlight the need to concentrate on profiting from the
opportunities for sustained growth and development and to restructure and reposition the
economy for successful integration within an increasingly liberalized regional and international
trading environment.15

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCIAL SECTOR

49.      The main driving idea behind the vision of Private Sector development is to adjust
the institutions to evolving realities, beginning with the review of the outdated Fiscal
Incentives Act of 1974. Moreover there are plans to: create an incentive's regime for the service
sector; undertake a road show to encourage investments from St. Lucians living abroad; hold
private sector consultations to vet proposals for a Free Trade Agreement between Canada and
CARICOM; and formalize the registration process for SMEs by the Small Enterprise
Development unit. The development of a National Investment Strategy is underway, and to
facilitate trade with European countries, the full adoption of the metric system has been taking
place.16

will be finalizing a new Private Sector Development Strategy.17 This two year undertaking

   The European Commission St Lucia Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for the period
2008-2013 (10th EDF) states that the key priorities of the Government's development strategy are: (i) to halt any
further decline in the agricultural sector and encourage agriculture and wider economic diversification; (ii) provide
the enabling environment to foster a private sector-led growth, notably to boost tourism activity with a deliberate
emphasis on increasing returns to the local economy through effective linkages; (iii) encourage education and
human resource development; (iv) support the emerging informatics industry and financial services sector, and also
encourage the adoption of appropriate technology as a means for achieving greater efficiency

   The new PSD Strategy has initially identified target areas for sector development and has a stronger built-in
accountability mechanism. Mission interviews confirm that extensive stakeholder consultations have concluded
with a preliminary weighted ranking of PSD priorities. In order to develop the sector, a consensus from the
businesses of St. Lucia stressed the need for further capacity building, improvement of marketing skills and the

current demands of the sector. It is anticipated that the new strategy will provide critical
recommendations to outlining the 5 year development course for the sector. The OPRS unit is

was held in April 2009 as part of the finalization mechanism of the PSD Strategy.

51.     The government is reviewing the legislation and the creation of a new agency for
trade and export promotion. The new agency, Trade and Export Promotion Agency (TEPA),
will facilitate product development and promotion. The design will follow the guidelines set by
the 2006 National Export Development Strategy. Tax Laws and fiscal incentives acts are being
reviewed; and efforts to implement new standards and quality management systems are expected
to help boost exports. A National Export Council comprised of representatives from the private
and public agencies, would serve as an advisory council regarding export policies and TEPA
would be the implementation agency. TEPA would be a unit within the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry. A consultancy report commissioned by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
was completed in May 2009. This report outlined the best institutional model for the TEPA
agency, including an Action Plan.

52.     The government is committed to improving the Doing Business Indicators:
Administrative roadmaps are being created and ongoing discussions are being held for a new
investment strategy to attract foreign direct investments into St. Lucia. Attempts to improve the
World Bank's Doing Business indicators have prompted government officials to investigate
administrative processes that the private sector must undertake to conduct business in areas
involving: business registration, obtaining construction permits and proper licensing, and
registering property. Government officials have also started to examine the process of dealing
with the commercial courts systems and the viability of a one-stop shop for entrepreneurial
businesses.

53.     In preparation for the Caribbean Single Market Economy, a review of the business
licensing regime is being undertaken. Depending on the nature of the business, there could be
multiple licensing requirements for a St. Lucian business. In preparation for the Caribbean
Single Market Economy, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is attempting to facilitate this
process by developing a Business Licensing Regime. As of now, all non-nationals need a Trade
License in order to operate a business in St. Lucia. A Business License is necessary for all
individuals/companies conducting business in St. Lucia, both national and non-national. An
Import License is required when bringing in specific goods to the island. With the new Single
Regional Market, all CARICOM nationals will be equivalently treated as a St. Lucian and will
no longer require the Trade License. This merger will reduce the necessity of a Trade License by
35 percent. A baseline study has been conducted to survey all St. Lucian businesses in


necessity for an improvement of standards. The new strategy demands closer monitoring and evaluation of
progress. Neither an impact assessment nor a review was conducted of the 1998 strategy. Currently, the European
Union is financially supporting the implementation of a baseline survey to support the commencement of the
strategy. A public tender notice was given on May 25, 2009 to hire external consultants to conduct the survey. The
survey data will be used as a quantitative foundation to conduct a midterm and final efficacy review of the 5 year
PSD strategy implementation.

December 2008. Within 2009/2010, the Ministry anticipates drafting legislation to regulate the
business licensing regime based on the survey results. It plans to design an appropriate fee
generation and collection mechanism and begin the public education process to inform the
private sector.18

54.     The most notable achievement in the area of improving business environment is the
recent launch of the new online company registration system at the Registry of Companies
and Intellectual Property Office. With the assistance of USAID, on May 13, 2009 the online
registration became available to the public (www.rocip.gov.lc). The database has significantly
eased the administrative bottlenecks related to investment and trade processes. In 2010, St.
Lucia ranked 36/183 economies overall in the World Bank's Doing Business indicators.
Between 2009 and 2010 there were relative negative changes in rankings to "Registering
Property" and "Paying Taxes" in St. Lucia, dropping from 67 to 76 and from 30 to 40
respectively. To start a business in St. Lucia there are 6 registration requirements, amounting to
20 days with the largest bottleneck occurring at the Registry itself. This new online process has
reduced the time for businesses to become properly registered from 20 days to a maximum of 3
days. The automated process now facilitates the search for a company name, the company name
reservation and registration process. This drastically reduced time will now set St. Lucia far
above both the regional (64.5 days) and OECD average (13.4 days).

55.     The process of informing the public of this online system has started and small
businesses have maintained a steady trend of registration through this portal. Public
education efforts of the online system have been targeted to lawyers, accountants and the
business community as well as the Small Enterprise Development Unit in the Ministry of
Commerce, who assists SMEs with registration procedures. As of April 201019, there are 17,816
total registered St. Lucian businesses: 8,656 larger limited liability companies and 9,160 small
businesses. In 2009, 427 larger limited liability companies registered and 714 smaller businesses
registered. From January to April 2010, 129 larger companies have registered while 207 smaller
businesses have registered.

56.     With the launch of the online registry the medium term goals for the office include
digitalization of older business registries and advancing the electronic transaction act.
Currently, all documentation required to register businesses can be done online with the
exception of the fee payment. Fee payments must still be manually processed. The Electronic
Transaction Act will legalize the acceptance of electronic signature allowing online payments.
As of now, once the registration has been approved electronically, individuals can come to the
Registry office to collect their Certification of Incorporation. The next priority for the Registry
includes digitalizing all prior business registries that are still in paper format. There are
preliminary discussions regarding further simplification of business procedures by utilizing the
same identification number for business licensing and tax collection purposes.

57.     St. Lucia is taking proactive steps to provide a resolution for BAICO activities in the
country and appointed the Judicial Manager for thoroughly reviewing the financial
situation of BAICO. To combat further contagion, ECCB authorities issued a notice of
intervention effective June 29, 2009. The notice of intervention is a prerequisite for the
appointment of a Judicial Manager, who would then conduct a thorough financial investigation
into the assets and liabilities of BAICO and propose a compromise settlement to policyholders.
Appointment of the Judicial Manager occurred on July 31, 2009. Furthermore, in July 2009, St.
Lucia along with other ECCU member states decided to establish a new company to take over
certain portfolios from BAICO. KPMG was hired to clarify the financial position of BAICO,
prepare a feasibility study on the establishment of the company and execute the strategy. The full
report of the judicial managers was filed with the respective Courts in each island in October
2009.

58.     St. Lucia is also participating in the regional efforts to develop a broader, region-
wide solution to the financial activities of CL Financial Group. Officials in the region have
acknowledged the need for greater cross border supervision, entailing closer collaboration and
cross exchange of information between national financial regulators would be a more prudent
regulatory stance to reflect the seamless movement of capital flow between the countries. Thus,
the ECCU monetary council affirmed that the regional response to this financial should: 1) have
a regionally orientated solution 2) protect the interest of the policyholders 3) and prevent the
"systematic risk" of the region's financial system. St. Lucia is actively involved in designing the
regional resolution process. For example, all ECCU governments have also put together a high
level team to deal with the resolution of BAICO. As of November 2009, the team has developed
a resolution strategy based on the Judicial Manager's report. The team is currently under
discussion regarding the implementation steps of the resolution.

59.     With respect to the longer term horizon for the financial regulatory environment,
St. Lucia is undertaking substantive efforts to consolidate regulation and supervision of the
non-banking financial sector under the Financial Service Regulatory Act. The decision by
the St Lucian Government to establish a single Financial Services Regulator is broadly in line
with the prevailing international trend of moving away from networks of specialist functional
regulators towards more consolidated regulation. It also parallels initiatives that are currently
being undertaken in other Caribbean islands. While Cabinet has already approved the SRU, the
Financial Services Regulatory Act provides the legal basis in forming the statutory body under
which non-banking financial activities such as insurance activities, credit union, cooperatives,
money services and development banks will now be regulated and supervised. This new entity
will serve as an important body in which authorities will convene regulatory and supervisory
power over non-banking financial institutions. This progress is in line with the IMF
Recommendation of its Article IV mission in October 2008. As of April 2010, the FSRA is
currently pending Parliament approval.

60.    In tandem with the Financial Service Regulatory Act, the government is enacting
extensive supporting legislation with regards to the insurance sector, money services
transactions, commercial code, and the cooperative act. The insurance sector bill will
oversee the insurance business conducted in St. Lucia. The money services transaction act will
provide for licenses and regulation of the money service businesses. The Cooperative Act will
oversee credit unions and cooperatives and the Commercial Code will legally permit electronic

                                                27
payment transactions. As of April 2010, the Commercial Code Act, Insurance and the Money
Service Act have all been enacted.

61.     The authorities have also initiated a reform of the financial system infrastructure
governing the payment system. The Payment System Bill is to advance the operation and
regulation of the payment system generally and moreover to codify procedures governing the
payment system. The bill provides for the establishment of the payment system and for the
Central Bank's exclusive authority for the operation, supervision and administration of the
payment system. The bill outlines in detail the legal guidelines in operating and administrating
the payment system. As of April 2010, the bill has been enacted.

IMPROVING PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE

62.     The government has identified the improvement of public service efficiency and
effectiveness as one of its strategic priorities. Government actions in this area include short-
term and medium-term policy reforms. In the short-term, the government has established a cap
on public sector employment to hold the size of funded positions in the public service at the FY
2008/2009 levels (6884 funded position) and registered a net reduction in the number of funded
position of 153 as of April 2010 ­ considerably below the authorized number of positions.20 Any
request for new positions and for filling vacancies will first have to be approved by the Ministry
of Finance and the Ministry of the Public Service. The costs associated with the employment of
non-established public servants have also been capped at FY 2008/2009 levels. Finally, the
government has mandated immediate action to ensure the proper use and management of
government's fleet of vehicles (reducing it by eleven percent in FY 2009/2010), rationalization
of office space and a review of the telecommunication systems within the public service.

63.      The government of St. Lucia has mandated operation and efficiency reviews in all
agencies and has initiated three of them as of April 2010. While some agencies, such as the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, have recently completed their own
institutional reviews, a government-wide exercise led by the Ministry of the Public Service with
cooperation from a grant from the World Bank is finalizing operation and efficiency reviews in
two ministries and is starting others. Final drafts of the reviews were completed for the Ministry
of Social Transformation and for the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport and Public
Utilities. The Ministry of the Public Service has initiated a similar review in the Ministry of
Justice and is expected to cover at least three additional ministries in the next year.

64.     These reviews have the main objective of identifying how Government should use
financial and human resources more efficiently to enhance productivity, improve service-
delivery and avoid waste. The recommendations of these reviews, expected to be sent for
Cabinet approval by June 2010, include measures which are expected to contribute to achieve
better strategic management and policy operations in individual ministries and enhance public
sector efficiency. These recommended measures include, for example, value for money audits


20
  Of the 7,603authorized established (or permanent) positions in St. Lucia's public service only 6,884 had been
funded as of March 31, 2009. As of April 1, 2010, following the cap in public sector employment, the public service
had 6,731 funded positions, or 153 less than in March 2009.

for the overseas missions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and strengthening strategic planning
mechanisms for the Ministry of Social Transformation. In addition, a merger of the ministries of
Finance and Economic Affairs, aimed for budgetary reasons but also due to existing synergies
between these agencies, was recently implemented with the purpose of reducing the number of
ministries and part of their administrative structures through consolidation of position and
retirement of senior staff.

65.    The government is planning to strengthen revenue collection through introduction
of a VAT and revision of the property tax methodology. The introduction of a VAT will be
accomplished with the technical assistance of the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center CARTAC.21 Preparatory work on cadastral surveys to switch the property tax
methodology to a market-based system in 2011 has begun as well. Together, the two measures
are expected to stabilize revenue inflows and increase tax revenues over 30 percent in the long
term.

66.    The VAT will replace multiple existing tax instruments, limit exemptions, broaden
the tax base, and improve the efficiency of tax administration. The VAT will be administered
by the Inland Revenue Department and replace several indirect taxes previously levied by the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise Departments. Unlike the instruments it is replacing--
which were levied at different rates and, in the case of the consumption tax, reached 30 percent
in some cases--the VAT will be charged at a flat rate, currently expected to be 15 percent.
Furthermore, the VAT will allow for credit or refund of taxes paid on inputs, thus benefitting
businesses by preventing tax compounding. These features are expected to increase efficiency
and facilitate compliance, therefore broadening the tax base. The VAT is also expected to take
into account the special needs of poor households and small businesses by exempting small
purchases of water and electricity and only charging the tax on companies with turnover above
EC$120,000.

67.     A new fuel market pass-through mechanism was implemented in September 2009 to
increase both allocative and fiscal efficiency. The prices of gasoline and fuel are to be
reviewed by the government every four weeks, thereby better reflecting movements in
international prices. This higher pass-through to consumers is expected to reduce consumption
distortions in the economy caused by the disparity between domestic and international prices of
fuel, and was a recommendation made by the ECCB as far back as 2006. In addition, a new cap
of EC$10 will be placed on the level of subsidy per 20-pound cylinder (while other LPG
categories will no longer be subsidized), and a flat excise tax rate of EC$3 per gallon will replace
the existing consumption tax on gasoline and diesel. The government's longstanding policy of



21
   Several missions from CARTAC have visited St. Lucia since September 2007. In the area of public finance,
CARTAC consultants assisted the authorities in financial programming, accessing the impact of a pass-through of
the international price of fuel, the introduction of a VAT and a market-based property tax, and with other measures
aimed at containing expenditures. The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) fielded a VAT and tax administration
mission in September/October 2007, with a view to providing a strategy for successful introduction of the VAT,
reviewing ongoing Customs and Excise Department reforms, and offering advice for the medium term on
strengthening the VAT.


                                                        29
subsidizing fuel has led to large losses in recent years, so its new system addresses this issue and
attempts to stabilize government revenue from fuel.

68.     The implementation of ASYCUDA World will further enhance efficiency in customs
administration. The government has signed a project agreement with UNCTAD, the United
Nations agency that provides the software and training, and has allocated approximately EC$1.5
million for the implementation of said program in the FY 2009/2010 budget. The government has
launched a training program for customs administration personnel, made substantial progress in
the procurement of equipment needed and has completed the development of prototype software.
In addition, the Customs Department developed a corporate strategic and business plan outlining a
sequential implementation of the ASCYUDA World program for the next three years.

69.    It is expected that ASYCUDA World will go on line by June 30, 2010 in a pilot
customs office and will be fully implemented and interfaced with external stakeholders
such as the Ministry of Commerce before the end of 2010. Based on the government's
previous experience with the upgrade from ASYCUDA 2.7 to ASYCUDA++, which brought 40
percent increase in revenue collection according to the Customs Department, the expected
increase in efficiency by switching to ASYCUDA World is substantial. A risk management
program that targets specific importers and products ­ tied to the implementation of ASYCUDA
World and the trade facility program ­ will also enhance efficiency by reducing physical audits.

70.     Government reform plans include the review of the pay and classification plan and
the enactment of a public employment act. Although the government has strong willingness to
review the pay and classification plan and the legal framework on human resources management
for increasing decentralization and allowing more autonomy for public sector managers, the
capacity constraints for moving these agendas forward and the expected one-time fiscal costs of
any reclassification are difficult to overcome in the short term. The difficulties experienced in the
negotiation of retroactive salary increases with trade unions have delayed the discussion of a
classification and pay review exercise. In terms of the review of the HRM legal framework,
while a draft public sector employment bill has been prepared by the Ministry of the Public
Service it will be revised to incorporate recent successful experiences in the update of this kind
of legislation in other Commonwealth countries. A World Bank grant will support the
government's efforts on these two initiatives.

71.     Recent PFM assessments have concluded that the existing systems largely support
the maintenance of aggregate fiscal discipline and strategic resource allocation, but also
singled out key institutional issues for further attention. St. Lucia PFM systems were
reviewed in the course of the PEFA assessment (October 2006), and more recently, in the course
of the fiduciary review, focused on the financial management and procurement of the capital
projects (2007-2008).22 Additional interviews with the government were conducted in the
summer of 2009, in the course of the project preparation. The main deficiencies noted in St.
Lucia PFM systems lay in the areas of medium-term strategic planning and budgeting,
preparation of annual financial statement, procurement, internal audit and the lack of legislative


22
     Policy Note on Project Fiduciary Management was published as a result of this exercise


                                                          30
oversight provided by the Public Accounts Committee. It was also noted that the Government of
St. Lucia is taking steps to remedy these deficiencies. Generally, St. Lucia is recognized as one
of the most reform-minded Caribbean countries.

72.     St. Lucia is generally recognized as having robust, if largely traditional, budget
system, enforced by the 1997 Finance Administration Act. This system allows the
Government to prepare a relatively comprehensive and credible annual, "line-item" budget.
However, in the last few years there has been an increasing realization that the existing system
cannot adequately support the Government's efforts to reform and improve efficiency of the
public sector.23 The Government recognized this issue and is committed to budget reform.

73.     Ultimate objectives of the envisioned budget reform include placement of the annual
budget in a longer-term fiscal framework and move focus on outputs rather than inputs,
based on program budgeting. Achievement of these objectives will require a multi-year
concerted effort on part of the government, and may call for a significant organizational
restructuring of a number of ministries and agencies. The reform agenda will include
development and introduction of a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF), formulation of
the sectoral programs, design and implementation of the performance indicators. Dedicated
leadership, revision of the existing legal framework and organizational structure, adequate
training of the involved personnel and re-adjustment of the existing government management
and information system (SmartStream) are needed to ensure success of the future reform.
Although it is envisaged that the largest part of the reform activities should be led and
implemented by the Government, external technical assistance would be highly beneficial.24

74.     The government is currently drafting an updated Finance Administration Act as the
existing act (1997) does not accommodate changes to the budget process that will be
required if the suggested reforms are to be implemented. The main challenge associated with
the current Act is that is does not concern itself with such objectives of budget management as
the pursuit of macroeconomic stability and the efficiency and effectiveness of government
spending. The updated legislature should explicitly spell out the principles of budget
formulation, approval and implementation updated in the context of the envisioned reform
(introduction of the MBTF and program-based budgeting). The government may want to
consider introducing a separate budget law if changing the existing Act--given its very broad
nature--proves to be too difficult.


23
   The existing system has the usual weaknesses associated with the isolated pursuit of control and compliance: more
concern with the inputs rather than the outputs of government operations; centralized control given to agency
managers in their use of resources; a strictly annual cycle which cannot capture the longer run implications of the
current year's budget decisions.
24
   The GOSL works with a number of development partners in the area of budget reform. Technical training focused
on the formulation of medium term and quarterly projections for the fiscal accounts has been delivered by
CARTAC. CDB is offering technical assistance supported by the grant under the broader "Managing for
Development Results" initiative. The recently initiated Eastern Caribbean Economic Management Program, funded
by CIDA, focuses on supporting macroeconomic governance and fiscal reform. Finally, the World Bank-financed
regional E-Government project will address the IT aspects of the budgeting, tax and customs administration. In such
situation, it is critical that the government assumes the full ownership of the reform early on, which would allow it
to efficiently and effectively manage a variety of choices, and achieve the best results.


                                                        31
75.    The Government plans to introduce comprehensive budget reform. The government
plans to prepare and approve a policy decision and a Briefing Note, which will introduce the
reform, provide a detailed Action Plan, and establish leadership and implementation
mechanisms. The first step towards the future reform was made with the decision to merge the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This move will bring together the
planning and budgeting functions.

76.    Both Auditor General and Accountant General Departments are operational but a
major challenge is the long-standing inability to produce annual financial statements of
auditable quality. Before moving on to more advanced reforms, it is essential to assure a basic
financial compliance. While the situation is improving, the latest audited financial statements of
the government of St. Lucia still date back to 2003

77.     The government recognizes potential risks posed by this situation and is striving to
bring its performance to the required level. The department of the Accountant General is
currently finalizing the government's financial statements for the 2004-2005. It is expected that
by the end of calendar 2010 financial statements at least up to 2008 will be prepared and
submitted to the Auditor General examination.

78.    While the external audit function in St. Lucia has been traditionally recognized as
one of the strongest in the Eastern Caribbean, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has
been inactive. As the government strives to bring its financial statements up to date, it is
important that the PAC resumes its oversight role contributing to the improvement of the
government's financial accountability.

79.     The government is taking steps to improve financial management capacities in the
line ministries. Development of these capacities is a pre-requisite for the eventual introduction
of program budgeting and performance indicators. As ministries and departments take more
responsibility in line with the increase in their flexibilities, strengthening of the internal audit
function becomes imperative. The government is drafting a proposal for the establishment of the
Internal Audit Units within some of the line ministries and the general revamping of the Internal
Audit function. It is expected that this proposal will be presented to the Cabinet's before the end
of the calendar year 2009.

80.     The Government has prioritized procurement reform to streamline public
administration and increase the efficiency of public spending. At present the Procurement
and Stores Regulations (1997) govern public procurement process. Competition, value for
money, and controls in procurement need to be improved. The Regulations do not provide
transparent criteria for use of direct purchase methods in place of competitive tendering
mechanisms and do not provide for formal appeals mechanisms. There are no standard bidding
documents, which could be used by various suppliers. There is also no central registry of actual
procurements that show the values and quantities of goods and services procured and the
procurement method. The data exist, but are not consolidated into statistical and management
reports.

81.   The Ministry of Finance is fully aware of the above-mentioned issues and wants to
move to international best practices. The updated, harmonized Procurement bill is currently

                                                32
being prepared with the assistance of the donor community. 25 It is expected that it will be tabled
in the Parliament within the next year. The Government also intends to eventually move to the e-
procurement, most likely as part of the broader sub-regional initiative.

82.     The Government has prioritized the assets management program as an important
part of the broader effort aimed to improve the efficiency of public expenditures. Stand-
alone assets management regulations are being developed in tandem with the new Finance and
Administration Act. Among the other, these Regulations will specify the rules guiding assets
acquisition, maintenance, utilization and valuation. Specially designated unit will be responsible
for the implementation of the newly introduced procedures. It is expected that these regulations
will be completed and presented to the Parliament within a year.

IMPROVING SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

83.     In an effort to mitigate the poverty impact of the global economic crisis, the
Government of St. Lucia has been scaling up its social safety net programs. Its cash
transfer program, Public Assistance, is one of the largest social assistance programs in the
country, with a budget of US$1.4 million in 2008-2009. It is a means tested intervention targeted
to the "needy" and reaches about 25 percent of poor households (3,600 individuals). In May
2008, the Government increased the amount of the benefit in response to the crisis, as has been
done with many cash transfer programs throughout LAC (Table 6).26

84.     In 2009 the Government established the Holistic Opportunities for Personal
Empowerment (HOPE) program with an allocation of US$3.5 million. HOPE provides
short-term employment, on-the-job training, and life skills training to persons aged 16-60 years
of age. The objective is to place 2,000 persons per year in employment for six months, paying
them a rate that reflects their skill level and the type of job.

Puente program. Koudemain is designed to target the poorest households in the country, and

then provide them with intensive psychosocial support over a two-year period and connecting
them to all relevant social assistance programs. There are currently 44 households identified as
eligible for the program; these will make up the pilot.

         Box 1: Holistic Opportunities for Personal and Empowerment Program (HOPE)

 The program incorporates three features: (i) a temporary employment component that will focus
 not only on beautification and landscaping activities but on construction activities, primarily at the
 community level. It will also provide opportunities in the delivery of services; (ii) a health support
 component in which basic health servicing/diagnosis, treatment and advice will be administered; (iii)
 a personal development component in which soft skills, in addition to vocational training, will be
 administered.
 Budget: estimated budget of EC$9.5 million per year
 Number of Beneficiaries: The Program is designed to employ a maximum 2000 households
 Recruitment: A means testing system under development will be used to qualify participants.
 Participation will be demand driven; however, priority will be given to qualified local residents.
 Participants may also be referred to the program by community groups and Parliamentary
 Representatives.
 Engagement: Participants will be employed for a maximum of two six-month cycles.
 Remuneration At the end of each month, participants will receive $500.00. An additional $100.00
 will be paid as an incentive upon satisfactory attendance at other programs such as Literacy and
 Personal Development.
 Administration: The proposed program will be managed as an autonomous activity under the
 umbrella of a Social Protection Agency of the Poverty Reduction Fund/Ministry of Social
 Transformation.

86.      The Government has granted subsidies on selected items and imposed price
controls on basic foodstuffs in an effort to further protect the population. In FY07-08, St.
Lucia removed the General Consumption Tax from basic food items as part of the CARICOM
Common External Tariff Agreement, a regional response to the high cost of living. This
agreement remains in effect until 2010. Government has subsidized fertilizer and the price of
flour, sugar, and rice, and has placed an additional 15 basic food and health-related goods under
price controls, involving maximum wholesale and retail margins. Government estimates that
approximately EC$7 million was spent in maintaining prices in FY08-09, and a provision of
EC$10 million was made in the FY09-10 budget to compensate for price increases.

87.     The crisis has revealed some weaknesses in the country's social safety net. The
social safety net assessment found the following:

       For the Public Assistance program, the law creating it calls for a Board to review
       beneficiary selection, which goes against the principle of transparent targeting
       mechanisms. Benefit amounts were not always large enough to mitigate negative coping
       behaviors (such as keeping kids out of school); also, households in which at least one
       person is employed are automatically rejected for the program ­ this can create the
       perverse incentive of discouraging people from working. There are only four social
                                                   34
         workers covering the entire island, with an average caseload of 600 households each;
         these social workers are responsible for intake, case management, and making payments.
         The payment system itself is outdated; Public Assistance officers devote roughly four
         days a month making payments to clients. The program is administered by the Ministry
         of Health, although other programs targeted to the poor are managed by the Ministry of
         Social Transformation. Being housed in different Ministries means that program officers
         often miss opportunities to realize synergies from their work. Finally, procedures and
         policies are largely undocumented, leading to a high level of discretion in beneficiary
         selection.
         International best practice for public works programs indicates that, to exclude the non-
         poor, the wage offered should be set at slightly below the prevailing wage rate; however
         HOPE bases its wage rate on the skill level of the beneficiary and can be higher than the
         prevailing wage rate for unskilled labor.
         The Koudemain pilot was started without baseline indicators and a management
         information system, making it difficult to monitor and evaluate the program's
         performance. Furthermore, three out of four Koudemain Caregivers are not trained or
         experienced in provision of psychosocial support, nor are they able to channel
         beneficiaries into all relevant programs without the need for several applications (; a
         fundamental design feature of the Chile Puente program).

88.    As a result, the Government is committed to undertaking longer-term reforms to
strengthen program outcomes. Government has informed the Bank of its interest in: i)
consolidating and rationalizing its social safety net programs; (ii) strengthening social assistance
coordination and implementation; and (iii) improving efficiency of social spending, including
public subsidies. In its 2009 Budget Speech Government informed the public of its plan to
review the expensive and regressive general subsidies on rice, flour and sugar. However, little
progress has been made to date on this.

89.     As a first step in the reform process, St. Lucia agreed to undertake a social safety
net assessment (SSNA), which was completed in August 2009. The purpose of the SSNA was
to identify weaknesses in the social safety net and make recommendations on improving its
design, particularly with regard to strengthening its crisis response capacity. Completed with
support from the Bank, UNICEF, and UNIFEM, the assessment found that while St. Lucia has a
number of social assistance programs that serve, or could serve, a risk management function,
there is considerable scope for strengthening the social safety net. Recommendations to improve
the SSN include, among others, developing a coherent social assistance strategy (with
establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee an important first step); introducing an objective
and transparent targeting mechanism; establishing a Central Beneficiary Identification System
and Central Beneficiary Registry; enhancing accountability and controls for social assistance
programs; and strengthening implementation capacity.

 V.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

1.     The RPS FY2010-14 for the OECS and the World Bank, scheduled to be discussed
by the Board on June 3 2010, supports St. Lucia's development agenda through two main

                                                35
pillars: (i) building resilience; and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating
sustainable growth. The OECS governments have identified these two areas as the main
challenges which are impacting or likely to have an impact on St. Lucia's development agenda in
the short, medium and long term. The selected pillars were also determined taking into account
the crippling effects of the crises and the need for urgent remedial measures as well as the areas
of focus of other development partners throughout the period of the RPS. In this context, the RPS
FY10-14 will contribute to achieving improved fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing
efficiency and transparency of public spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic
and financial stability, strengthening policy coordination and economic management,
rationalizing social safety net programs and improving the targeting system. These achievements
will be critical in strengthening the ability of St. Lucia to respond to exogenous shocks and
laying the foundation for growth in the medium term.

90.     The focus of the proposed ES DPL/DPC is fully consistent with the objectives of
Bank engagement under the RPS FY10-14. The proposed ES DPL/DPC is aligned with the
two main pillars of the RPS as outlined above. Specifically, the proposed ES DPL/DPC supports
reforms actions to maintain an enabling macroeconomic framework, improve governance and
public expenditure management, strengthen social safety nets, improve competitiveness and
financial sector stability, and reinforce policy coordination and economic management. The
proposed ES DPL/DPC also aims to create a policy platform for medium-term reforms which
could be supported by the Bank or other donors in the future. Finally, the proposed ES DPL/DPC
contributes to the government's objectives as set forth in the FY2009/10 and FY2010/11 Budget
Speeches presented by the Honorable Stephenson King, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance,
on April 24, 2009 and on April 19, 2010 respectively, with its focus on improving governance
and public expenditure management, strengthening social safety nets, improving competitiveness
and business environment, and strengthening policy coordination and economic management.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

91.     The OECS is well served by several bilateral and multilateral agencies. Main
multilateral donors include the IMF, Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), which in addition to
its own resources onlends IDB funds, EU, OAS, PAHO and the UN. The main bilateral donors
are CIDA, DFID, USAID, China, Japan, Kuwait, France, Taiwan, China and Venezuela. The
Bank's contribution is relatively small at around 10 percent of total reported disbursements.
Together with the EU, CIDA, DFID, USAID, PAHO and the CDB, the Bank is an active
participant in the Eastern Caribbean Donor Group to improve donor coordination.

92.     The content of the ES DPL/DPC is aligned with the programs of the active donors in
the region in order to provide complementary support to ongoing reforms. The Bank and
the government are keen on donor coordination and are aware of the importance of creating
synergies for reforms. This is also important for efficient use of institutional capacity as such
capacities are limited in small island economies.




                                               36
93.    In the areas of the Government's program supported by the ES DPL/DPC the
following donors have been most active: The IMF, the EU, CIDA, the Commonwealth
Secretariat, and the CBD.27 The relevant highlights of each program are elaborated in turn below.

        The Bank and the IMF have been collaborating closely in the ECCU on monitoring the
        financial sector, the medium-term structural reform agenda, and technical assistance
        on macroeconomic management. In areas such as improving ECCU capacity to
        manage debt, the consultations with the government are conducted on a trilateral basis.
        Both the Bank and the IMF provided technical assistance to the ECCB to determine
        effective responses to the near collapse of BAICO and CLICO, two distressed life
        insurers in ECCU.

        The European Union has been the largest donor to the OECS. The EU programs focus
        on regional integration, increasing agricultural competitiveness and promoting
        diversification, and supporting banana exports. Within the last 5 years, the EU has
        funded the Health Programme (EUR 20.19 million), Economic Diversification and
        Private Sector Development Programme (EUR 2.98 million), and the Agro-tourism
        Programme (EUR 4.2 million) in St. Lucia.

        The Caribbean Development Bank is the second largest donor to the OECS, and St.
        Lucia accounts for 25.6 percent of approvals to the sub-region. The main focus of the
        CDB portfolio is the development of physical and social infrastructure, but loans have
        also been extended for strengthening fiscal performance.

        CIDA has focused its efforts to improve capacity in four sectors: trade and private
        sector development, public sector strengthening, governance, and environmental
        management. The recently initiated Eastern Caribbean Economic Management
        Program focuses on supporting macroeconomic governance and fiscal reform, and a
        new initiative on improved public revenue collection and management (taxation and
        customs) and budget preparation and execution (public expenditure management) is in
        planning.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

94.    Several investment lending operations are linked to the ES DPL/DPC program. The
ongoing OECS (St. Lucia) Skills for Inclusive Growth project supports the employability of
youth through public/private sector partnerships for technical and life skills training. The E-
Government for Regional Integration Project promotes the efficiency, quality, and transparency
of public services through the delivery of regionally integrated e-government applications that
apply economies of scale.

95.   The existing grant and technical assistance programs also support the
implementation of the policy reforms envisaged by the ES DPL/DPC program. The IDF


27
    The Com Sec has been involved in the reform of the public service through technical assistance, the specific
information on the amount and type of intervention has been requested from the government.


                                                      37
Grant on Strengthening on Institutional Capacity for Project Implementation will help the
governments develop and sustain the institutional capacity in financial management,
procurement and project management. The IDF Grant on Enhancing Public Service
Performance contributes to strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of the Public Service to: (i) manage a sustainable wage bill; (ii) increase
decentralization of human resources management; and (iii) implement an effective performance
appraisal system for public officers. These grants are fully aligned with the ES DPL/DPC
program. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the OECS governments through its
Non-Lending Technical Assistance program for improving social safety nets.

LESSONS LEARNED

96.      The design of the proposed ES DPL/DPC has benefitted from the lessons learned
from the previous Bank operations in St. Lucia. The Bank has been active in St. Lucia since
1990 and the operations have spanned the following sectors: agriculture, education, social
protection, climate change and environment, disaster management, water, health, and the public
sector. Specific evaluations of the Bank operations are given in the OECS Country Program
Quality Enhancement Review completed by the Banks' Quality Assurance Group (December
2004) and CAS Completion Report annexed to the OECS CAS FY06-FY09 (report No. 33118-
LAC, discussed by the Board on September 13, 2005) highlights the main lessons. Since the
start of Bank engagement in St. Lucia, portfolio performance has generally been satisfactory.

97.     The CAS completion report recognizes that while the Bank's technical expertise in
project design has made a significant contribution to the sub-region's development, project
implementation has not always gone smoothly. Overly complex project designs have led to
lengthy delays in effectiveness and a sense that the project timetable was more Bank-driven than
client-led. So, greater attention to client preparedness has been a significant factor during
preparation of this operation.

98.   The completion report also highlights that the Bank's lending has had the greatest
impact in two areas that are key in the proposed ES DPL/DPC:

  i.   Interventions for policy reform, such as the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
       Authority project to restore fiscal balance, encourage growth, and dismantle a crippling
       telecommunications monopoly while establishing a regulatory framework.
 ii.   Interventions which responded to unforeseen crises, such as the post 9-11 Emergency
       Recovery Loans and the Hurricane Ivan contingency facility. The Bank's work in such
       situations has been broadly recognized as demonstrating the Bank's ability to bring its
       global knowledge and to work flexibly and swiftly with both clients and donors.
The ES DPL/DPC instrument by its nature focuses on policy reform and this proposed operation
has been designed to mitigate the significant negative impact of the global economic and
financial crisis.

99.   The best results were achieved when Bank staff worked closely with country
counterparts during design and implementation and exploited synergies between analytical
work and operation design. The preparation of this operation has entailed consultations with a

                                              38
broad cross section of civil servants, a number of private sector representatives and other
stakeholders. It is grounded in analytical work which focuses on the Caribbean, the OECS, and
St. Lucia specifically (see section below). Further, as noted earlier, there are a number of active
investment loans and trust funds which target areas within the scope of the proposed operation
and will provide implementation support.

100.    The proposed ES DPL/DPC includes only critical actions needed for the
achievement of development objectives, consistent with the 2005 Review of World Bank
Conditionality which indicates that disbursement conditions should be few and focused on
actions critical for achieving the results sought under a program.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

101. The policy actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC are grounded in analytical
evidence. Selected findings from the relevant analytical studies--organized by ES DPL/DPC
program component--are shown in Table 7 below.

                                could help to reduce system abuse.

                                Enhance accountability and control for social assistance
                                programs. Automated information systems, including
                                beneficiary and accounting systems, are required for key
                                programs. Formal appeals mechanisms should be established.

                                Develop implementation capacity. Priority needs to be given
                                to defining the core resources and capacities needed to address
                                the requirements and constraints identified above. An action
                                plan for capacity building, including identification of
                                institutional functions and responsibilities and financing
                                arrangements will be needed.

VI.     THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

102. The proposed ES DPL/DPC supports policies and reforms that will assist the
Government of St. Lucia in dealing with the emerging short term economic challenges and
further advancing the country's longer term development agenda. More specifically, the
goal of the program is to help the country manage the impact of the global crisis, while
accelerating the structural transformation of the economy to improve public service delivery
and social assistance, enhance the country's competitive position and better manage the
inherent vulnerability of a small and open economy. The proposed ES DPL/DPC is
organized around three pillars, consistent with the Government's Program as outlined in the
previous section. Consequently, the program supports core measures to help (i) improve the
business environment and financial sector; (ii) improve public sector governance and economic
management; and (iii) strengthen social safety nets.

103. The Development Objectives of the proposed ES DPL/DPC are fully consistent
with the government's strategy. The government's current program aims at promoting
sustained high economic growth, laying the groundwork for private sector development,
improving fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing vulnerabilities, alleviating poverty and
advancing the nation's social development agenda. The reform policies supported under this ES
DPL/DPC are selective critical policy actions that contribute to the achievement of longer term
development objectives.

104. Accordingly, the ES DPL/DPC supports important initial implementation
achievements within the government's program. All actions supported by the ES
DPL/DPC are included in St Lucian Government's broader economic program. The
following are the core policy actions supported by the Loan (Box 2). All of them have been
successfully met before the presentation of this loan to the Board. The ES DPL/DPC
program also recognizes many other government reforms which constitute milestones for
the reform implementations and are not bolded in the program matrix.

                                    Box 2: Core Policy Actions
      Component I. Improving Business Environment, Competitiveness, and Strengthening the
                                       Financial Sector
       The Borrower has, submitted to its Parliament an Insurance Bill.
       The Borrower, through its High Court, has appointed a judicial manager to perform a
      review of BAICO within the Borrower's territory, with a view to recommending an orderly
      resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.


          Component II. Improving Public Sector Governance and Economic Management
       The Borrower has established a cap on public service employment to hold the size of
      funded positions at the FY 2008/2009 levels (6884 funded positions), and stopped the funding
      of vacant approved positions as outlined in the FY 2009/2010 budget (7603 approved
      positions) in said sector.


                                                42
     The Borrower has merged its Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic
    Planning and National Development to create the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and
    National Development under the administration of a single Permanent Secretary, pursuant to
    its Cabinet Decision No. 989 of 2009.
     The Borrower has: (a) submitted to its Parliament a Value Added Tax Bill; and (b) has
    established a VAT Implementation Unit and made said unit functional with adequate staffing
    and resources.
     The Borrower has commenced the implementation of ASYCUDA World program in its
    customs department as follows: (a) allocated an amount of approximately EC$1.5 million for
    the implementation of said program in the FY 2009/2010 budget; (b) launched a training
    program for its customs administration personnel; (c) completed a prototype software for
    ASYCUDA World program; and (d) developed a corporate strategic and business plan
    outlining a sequential implementation of said ASCYUDA World program for the next three
    years.

              Component III. Improving Effectiveness and Efficiency of Safety Nets
     The Borrower has: (a) completed a Social Safety Net Assessment; and (b) conducted
    subsequent stakeholder consultations on the results of said assessment.
     The Borrower has established a Social Safety Net Steering Committee to spearhead
    reform efforts of its Social Safety Net System.


105. The ES DPL/DPC contributes to St. Lucia's longer term development objectives
in many ways. First, support to the Government's budget and external financing needs is
critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability under the heavy turmoil of the global
economic crisis and keeping the Government's program intact for a quicker recovery. A
satisfactory macroeconomic framework is fundamental not only to support the flow
economic activity, but to lower gradually the ratio of the public debt to GDP towards the
regionally mandated target of 60 percent.

106. The second strategic objective under the ES DPL/DPC is to improve
competitiveness and strengthen the financial sector. St. Lucia aims at achieving a stronger
competitive position in the region where the process of regional and international integration
opens new opportunity for business, but also creates challenges. St Lucia has a clear goal of
increasing the role of the private sector in the growth process and has embarked on an ambitious
program of private sector development. The government is in the process of renewing its
development strategies for private sector, trade facilitation and investment promotion. It is
expected that by the end of ES DPL/DPC, an electronic system of company registration will
reduce times and cost of registration, encouraging enterprise creation. This outcome
complements other government efforts to improve the business environment and to encourage
new investments. In addition, the ES DPL/DPC would support the new legislation on insurance
consistent within the framework of improving insurance regulation in the region. The vigilance
of the financial system is most important given the interconnection across islands and the likely
contagion risks from financial markets.

107. Third, management of fiscal pressures and efficient public service delivery are
central to transformation of St. Lucia. The external shocks such as natural disasters and the

                                               43
pressures on the government to spend have gradually raised the public debt, while the efficiency
of the public institutions is lagging. The wage bill and the debt service cover more than half of
the total public expenditures and limit the fiscal room for public investment that would
complement the private sector investment. The strategy of the government is to initiate a process
that contains the upwards expenditure pressures through greater efficiency both in public
administrations and revenue collection. In a year time after the approval of this ES DPL/DPC,
significant progress is expected in revenue collection capacity with the introduction of the VAT
and the full implementation of ASYCUDA World. At the same time, the initial process for
public administration and public service reforms will have been initiated.

108. Lastly, the crisis has tested the social assistance mechanisms in St. Lucia and
highlighted the dispersion and untargeted nature of these programs--which lack capacity
to address the current crisis. The short term strategy of the government is to address the crisis
by extending assistance for the poor and less fortunate as well by prioritizing employment
generating expenditures. At the same time, the government has embarked on longer term
reforms to improve efficiency and effectiveness through rationalization of social assistance
programs and improved targeting. The ES DPL/DPC supports government's efforts with
selective critical policy actions. An improved social safety net, more efficient and effective,
is expected to be designed and implemented as a result of the government reforms in this
area.
                         Box 3: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
    Principle 1: Ownership: The government's program is described in a number of separate but consistent
    documents. In particular, the FY2009/10 Budget Speech delivered on 24 April, 2009 and the FY2010/11
    Budget Speech delivered on April 19, 2010 are the key government policy documents. The new RPS for
    the OECS, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3 2010, is aligned directly to the development
    challenges in the OECS including St Lucia and it aims at contributing to two main development pillars:
    (i) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; (ii) reducing vulnerability and promoting social
    inclusion. The Bank has supported the program through analytic work in the area of public expenditure,
    economic management, poverty and social protection. The loan recognizes implementation of actions
    already completed by the authorities.

    Principle 2: Harmonization: The program document defines the actions agreed with the government
    and summarizes expected outcomes in a program matrix. The program matrix has been harmonized with
    the IMF, CDB and EU which also support policy actions in key program areas; such as macroeconomic
    stability, public sector and debt management, and social assistance reforms.

    Principle 3: Customization: The program document supports a substantial portion of the authorities'
    development strategy in the areas of efficient provision of high quality public services, enhancement of
    business environment and financial sector and improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of social
    safety nets. The ES DPL/DPC has been designed around three program areas critical to achieving the
    objectives of the government's program. These program areas are (i) improving public sector governance
    and economic management; (ii) improving effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets; and (iii)
    improving business environment and financial sector

    Principle 4: Criticality: The program matrix contains only 8 prior actions considered to be the most
    critical policies to achieve the program's objectives. The loan contains no further benchmarks.

    Principle 5: Transparency and Predictability: The program matrix clearly states expected outcomes
    and indicators in a transparent manner. Progress towards meeting the long term goals of the program will
    be monitored under the RPS FY2010-14 for the OECS.



                                                      44
109. Under the RPS FY2010-14, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3 2010,
the Bank will remain engaged as the government implements its medium term strategy. It
is envisioned that further progress towards improved economic and social conditions in St. Lucia
will be a key theme of the RPS. Accordingly, it is expected that future Bank support will focus
on maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic framework and reform agenda that will
include improved fiscal and debt sustainability, public sector modernization, effective debt
management, improved business environment and investment climate, and effective targeting
and increased efficiency of social safety net programs.


COMPONENT 1: IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

110. The policy of the government is to adapt its competitiveness strategy to emerging
realities. In the past, St. Lucia implemented a diversification strategy that turned the country into
one of the most diversified islands in the region. But, this strategy will no longer be relevant in
light of the move toward Caribbean Single Market Economy. To adjust to this new reality, the
authorities are finalizing a new Private Sector Development Strategy jointly with a National
Investment Strategy that focuses on bringing more Foreign Direct Investment, including
investment from the nationals living abroad. To this end, the government plans to review the
outdated Fiscal Incentives Act of 1974. In addition, the government is preparing a Competition
Law to endure that the benefits of the Caribbean Single Market Economy are not lost to anti-
competitive practices. The government is also reviewing the proposal of the creation of a new
agency: the Trade and Export Promotion Agency (TEPA).

111. Improving the business environment through Doing Business reforms is an
immediate and complementary priority of the government. Business facilitation is quite
opportune in light of the global financial crisis and the imminent trade agreements that will
change the dynamics of trade in the region. These efforts complement the work on the Private
Sector Development Strategy and the creation of the Trade Export Promotion Agency.

112. Moving from manual to electronic registration of businesses is a solid step in this
direction. The ES DPL/DPC fully supports this move, which will increase the efficiency of
business registration in St. Lucia and will set St. Lucia as a leader in this area. The government
is aiming at putting all records of the Registry Office in electronic format. To completely
eliminate manually barriers, Parliamentary submission of the Electronic Transaction Act is also
expected allow online collection of fees.

113. The government is fully aware of the risks in regional financial markets and is
moving ahead with a new Insurance Act to improve the existing regulations and mitigate
contagion risks. The new insurance act is in line with the recommendations of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank and aims at strengthening the existing legislative and institutional
capacity for better regulation of the market.

114. The government has also appointed a Judicial Manager to handle the BAICO
financial fallout. The financial collapse of BAICO and CLICO demands both a short term
response to protect policy holders and a longer term financial regulatory reform. In the short
term, the ES DPL/DPC supports the appointment of a Judicial Manager by the Ministry of

                                                 45
Finance and the Registrar of Insurance as a positive step towards addressing the financial
resolution of BAICO. The Judicial Manager will manage and take stock of the company's assets
by initially preventing any policyholders from recovering any money while under its control and
therefore will safeguard the interest of policyholders. An in-depth report regarding the financial
status of the company is expected to be produced within 90 days of his appointment. On the
basis of the Judicial Manager's findings, recommendations to resolve the BAICO case will be
presented to the Courts.

115.    Consistent with these objectives, the ES DPL/DPC prior actions under this pillar
are:

     i) The online company registration portal has been launched.
     ii) The Borrower has, submitted to its Parliament an Insurance Bill.
     iii) The Borrower, through its High Court, has appointed a judicial manager to
          perform a review of BAICO within the Borrower's territory, with a view to
          recommending an orderly resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.

COMPONENT 2: IMPROVING PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

116. The ES DPL/DPC supports the government's efforts to reinforce revenue
generation capacity. A key outcome will be the introduction of the VAT, jointly with the
necessary preparation to start implementation. The introduction of the VAT should facilitate
efficient collection, strengthen the revenue flow and create incentives for savings, given that it
taxes consumption.28 In addition, the ES DPL/DPC supports a major modernization of customs
through the implementation of ASYCUDA World. Both the VAT and the custom reforms are
expected to have the parallel effect of making it easy for private sector to comply with laws and
regulations. Therefore, parallel gains in the quality of the business environment are also foreseen.

117. The ES DPL/DPC also supports the first steps of public administration and public
service reforms. In the short term, the ES DPL/DPC focuses on keeping the public wage bill
fiscally sustainable through aggregate measures such as capping the level of public employment
and identifying efficiency and productivity gains through functional and institutional reviews. At
the same time, the ES DPL/DPC program supports the initiation of the process for reviewing the
existing human resource management system together with the pay and classification systems in
the public administration. The ultimate objective is to increase efficiency in public
administrations, improve productivity in public service delivery and achieve a more sustainable
and predictable wage bill. An IDF grant by the World Bank is currently assisting the government
of St. Lucia in this regard. The ES DPL/DPC program also foresees quick wins in the public
administration area through consolidation of two ministries based on reprioritized commitments
(Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Planning and National Development) as a first
step of the implementation of recommendations of functional and institutional reviews with the

28
  The 2009/2010 Budget Address notes that, "Government...views the introduction of VAT as part of its strategic
policy response in strengthening economic management, thereby building the reliance of the economy to
vulnerability and external shocks. The need for this strategic approach has become even greater in light of the
impact of the global recession."


                                                      46
objective of promoting better strategic management and policy operations and enhancing public
sector efficiency in select public institutions.

118.   The ES DPL/DPC program includes the following prior actions under this pillar:

   i) The Borrower has established a cap on public service employment to hold the
        size of funded positions at the FY 2008/2009 levels (6884 funded positions), and
        stopped the funding of vacant approved positions as outlined in the FY
        2009/2010 budget (7603 approved positions) in said sector.
   ii) The Borrower has merged its Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic
        Planning and National Development to create the Ministry of Finance, Economic
        Affairs and National Development under the administration of a single
        Permanent Secretary, pursuant to its Cabinet Decision No. 989 of 2009.
   iii) Institutional review of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and operation and efficiency
        reviews for the Ministry of Social Transformation and the Ministry of
        Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities have been initiated.
   iv) The Borrower has: (a) submitted to its Parliament a Value Added Tax Bill; and
        (b) has established a VAT Implementation Unit and made said unit functional
        with adequate staffing and resources.
   v) The Borrower has commenced the implementation of ASYCUDA World
        program in its customs department as follows: (a) allocated an amount of
        approximately EC$1.5 million for the implementation of said program in the FY
        2009/2010 budget; (b) launched a training program for its customs
        administration personnel; (c) completed a prototype software for ASYCUDA
        World program; and (d) developed a corporate strategic and business plan
        outlining a sequential implementation of said ASCYUDA World program for
        the next three years.

COMPONENT 3: IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

119. The proposed ES DPL/DPC would help to strengthen the crisis response capacity of
St. Lucia's social safety net, and improve its effectiveness and efficiency in the medium and
long term. The ES DPL/DPC supports government efforts to mitigate the impact of the
economic crisis through the evaluation of social assistance programs, and identification of
immediate steps to improve their support to poor beneficiaries. In the long term, the ES
DPL/DPC supports actions to build consensus for social safety net reform among key
stakeholders and establish appropriate actions and sequencing of tasks to undertake social safety
net reform.

120. Among the immediate actions to improve safety net outcomes identified by the
SSNA is the improvement of the targeting mechanism of the St. Lucia Koudemain
program. A proxy means test was developed to target the program, but the SSNA
recommended a review of the instrument by an econometrician to validate its quality or make
recommendations for improving it. Once this is done, the Government will have an objective
and transparent targeting instrument and can assess whether it is appropriate to use for other
social assistance programs, including Public Assistance.


                                               47
121. The longer term reforms will come about as part of the process of building
constituencies for SSN improvement, and through critical actions to strengthen its
efficiency and effectiveness that will necessarily take a longer time than the life of the ES
DPL/DPC. The process of building support for change is a critical first step in the reform
process, as has been demonstrated by the experience of Jamaica. In the case of St. Lucia, this
longer term process started with the stakeholder consultation held in September 2009 to discuss
the findings and recommendations of the SSNA. At the end of these consultations, participants
agreed to form a Steering Committee to spearhead reforms, and elaborate an Action Plan to do
so. Both the Steering Committee and its Action Plan must be approved by Cabinet. One of the
first actions identified during consultations (and recommended in the SSNA) is the consolidation
of all programs targeted to the poor under a single Ministry ­ this would likely mean moving
Public Assistance to the Ministry of Social Transformation. Introducing a transparent targeting
mechanism (i.e., the proxy means test developed for Koudemain), streamlining payment
mechanisms, and documenting policies and procedures, would also strengthen the efficiency and
effectiveness of the program. Having the targeting mechanism of the Koudemain program
evaluated by an econometrician is therefore a key step in improving the social safety net. It is
expected that the consolidation of programs targeted to the poor, the strengthening of the Public
Assistance program, improved targeting of social assistance programs, and other actions
identified in the SSNA and agreed during consultations, will yield fiscal savings. In coordination
with the implementation of the ES DPL/DPC, the Bank is providing Non-lending Technical
Assistance (NLTA) to the Government of St. Lucia and other OECS countries in the area of
social safety net reform.

              Box 4: Jamaica's Social Safety Net Reform Process: Lessons Learned
   The actions described under the Improving Social Safety Nets Component are similar to
   the steps followed by Jamaica in its social safety net reform process. In 2000, Jamaica
   began implementation of reforms recommended in a Social Safety Net Assessment. A
   steering committee of key stakeholders has guided the reform since its planning
   stage and, in 2009, continues to provide oversight of the social protection reform agenda.
   Following presentation of the SSNA, the steering committee elaborated an action
   plan for social protection reform. The agenda included merging existing cash transfer
   programs into a new conditional cash transfer program, introduction of objective and
   transparent targeting mechanism (a proxy means test) and capacity building with respect
   to information management and accountability and control. The agenda also included
   upgrading of the school feeding program, support for early childhood interventions for
   vulnerable children, and other activities. This action plan was approved by Cabinet and
   the Government signed a Letter of Policy Intent addressed to the President of the
   IDB (which partnered with the World Bank and provided grant financing for the
   completion of studies and development of the proxy means test). Jamaica and the World
   Bank are now partnering on a second social protection project, which includes further
   strengthening of the conditional cash transfer through introduction of differentiated
   benefits, piloting of welfare to work initiatives, and support to strengthen civil service
   pension administration. Jamaica's social safety net reform process has become a




                                               48
122.      The ES DPL/DPC includes the following prior actions under this component:

       i) The Borrower has: (a) completed a Social Safety Net Assessment; and (b) conducted
            subsequent stakeholder consultations on the results of said assessment.
       ii) The Borrower has established a Social Safety Net Steering Committee to spearhead
            reform efforts of its Social Safety Net System.
       iii) An Action Plan has been formulated by the Social Safety Net Steering Committee whose
            priorities will include the upgrading of the Public Assistance Program, and review of the
            Public Assistance Law.
       iv) The government has initiated the review of the targeting mechanism for the Koudemain
            program in order to lay the ground for a proxy means test that can be used for the broader
            social safety net programs.

VII.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

123. The actions supported by this ES DPL/DPC are expected to have a positive overall
distributional impact. The measures supported by the ES DPL/DPC are expected to augment
the government's ability to enhance macro stability, lower inflation, attract more domestic and
foreign investment, reduce the tax burden for lower income groups, and enhance the efficiency
and fairness of the tax system. Since high debt adversely impacts the poor by reducing fiscal
space for priority social spending and investment programs while macroeconomic volatility and
inflation have a disproportionately negative impact on the poor, the reform program supported by
this ES DPL/DPC is expected to have a positive overall impact on poor people's income and
access to services. The measures supported under the business environment, competitiveness,
and financial sector strengthening component are likely to attract more domestic and foreign
investment--which would benefit growth and employment and therefore contribute to poverty
reduction--and mitigate the adverse effects of the BAICO/CLICO collapse, therefore
minimizing the impacts on small investors who would otherwise be the most vulnerable.

124. The planned introduction of the broad-based VAT, as well as other instruments
including market-based property taxes and a tax on interest income, is expected to increase
public revenues while reducing the tax burden of the poor. The VAT is expected to eliminate
tax cascading which disproportionately affects small businesses under the existing indirect tax
system. In addition, the VAT implementation team has committed itself to identifying a set of
zero-rated and/or VAT exempt items to ensure that tax burden of the most vulnerable segments
of the society does not increase. For example, the VAT is expected to take into account the
special needs of poor households and small businesses by exempting small purchases of water
and electricity and only charging the tax on companies with turnover above EC$120,000. The
VAT is also expected to be revenue neutral, which, combined with the broader tax base, suggests
that it is likely to be levied at a rate lower than the existing indirect taxes it aims to replace.
Furthermore, the incidence of the planned introduction of new property and interest income taxes
is likely to fall on the richer segments of society, increasing fiscal space with little direct cost to
the poor.



                                                   49
125. The reform of the social safety nets supported under this ES DPL/DPC is expected
to benefit the poor by increasing the efficiency and targeting of social spending. While
reform will take time, the priorities identified in the SSNA will improve the overall assistance
the poor and vulnerable will receive. The first actions agreed upon during the consultation
process should have immediate effect: the upgrading of the Public Assistance program and
review of the law creating it will enable the Government to use scarce resources more
effectively; an improved, transparent targeting mechanism for the Koudemain programs will
ensure that the poor are receiving assistance and reduce errors of inclusion and exclusion. Other
recommendations in the SSNA, which will follow later, will continue having positive impacts:
the establishment of a central beneficiary registry will improve the monitoring and evaluation of
programs; improving monitoring and information systems will allow the Government to track
beneficiaries, ensuring that the poor are receiving appropriate benefits and making it easier to
measure the performance and impact of social assistance programs; documenting policies and
procedures decreases discretionary implementation of programs. Finally, establishing
accountability and control mechanisms, including a system for appeals and complaints, will help
to ensure that errors of inclusion and exclusion are minimized.

126. Notwithstanding the expected positive distributional impacts in the long run, some
groups may experience limited adverse impacts in the short term. The Government's
decision to cap the public sector employment and not fund vacant positions is likely to not only
adversely impact the prospective public sector employees, but could also affect the level and
quality of service delivery. However, both the Government and the stakeholders realize that
these measures are necessary to weather the impacts of the crisis and to allow time for deeper
public sector reforms which are expected to result in a more efficient public sector and thus
better service delivery. In addition, the revision of targeting mechanisms for the Koudemain
programs may lead to a loss of benefits for certain groups; although they are unlikely to be the
poorest parts of St. Lucia's society, it may take some time before these groups are able to adjust
to the loss of transfer income.

COUNTRY CONSULTATION

127. The ES DPL/DPC has been prepared within the framework of the Government's
Medium Term Economic Program and has therefore benefitted from extensive
consultations with various stakeholders. The preparations of the specific policy actions
benefited from wide consultation within the country. Specific laws, institutional reforms and
actions supported by this ES DPL/DPC were discussed with different groups, including non-
governmental organizations and the private sector. The government has consulted intensively
with country stakeholders, including the cabinet and members of Parliament, to inform the
budget process and the formulation of key aspects of certain legislation. The National
Consultative Council, which enjoys broad based representation from civil society, was a key
influence in the formative process of the economic and social vision presented in the
FY2009/2010 Budget. The Government further demonstrated its commitment to the consensus-
building process by announcing the establishment of a Tripartite Council which will bring
together representatives from the Government, employers, and worker organizations for regular
dialogue. Furthermore, in the course of preparing the VAT law for submission to Parliament, the
Government has committed itself to extensive public consultations with stakeholder groups to


                                               50
ensure that the introduction of the VAT will not significantly affect the livelihoods of the
vulnerable groups in the society.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

128. Monitoring, Evaluation and Results Framework. The Ministry of Finance will be
responsible for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. A number
of other agencies are involved in the implementation of the reform program being supported by
this ES DPL/DPC, including Ministry of Social Transformation, Public Service, Human
Resource Development, Youth and Sports; Ministry of Health Wellness, Family Affairs,
National Mobilization, Human Services and Gender Relations; Ministry of Commerce, Industry
and Consumer Affairs, and Custom Administration. As part of the preparation process, the Bank
has discussed with all relevant institutions the development of M&E process to ensure adequate
feedback to policy-makers. M&E is traditionally a weak area in the small island economies
including St. Lucia but there is strong understanding of the need to strengthen such mechanisms.
The Bank will maintain a dialog with counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. The government
and the Bank have agreed on a results framework with a number of process, output and outcomes
indicators to be assessed at the end of the program supported by this ES DPL/DPC. These
indicators are described in the Policy Matrix in Annex 3 and represent, therefore, the agreed
benchmarks for future evaluation of the program supported by the ES DPL/DPC. Policies and
reforms described in the Government Program are not benchmarks for the evaluation of the ES
DPL/DPC.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

129. Public financial management (PFM) and procurement systems. In general, the public
financial management and public procurement systems are adequate for this operation (see
detailed description of the existing systems in the Public Financial Management section of the
ES DPL/DPC). While challenges remain, the government is moving ahead to further strengthen
its public fiduciary control framework. In connection with this process the World Bank is
engaged in the continuous policy dialogue with the government. As is evident from the policy
matrix in Annex 2, the ES DPL/DPC supports the actions identified by the GOSL as key to its
effort to strengthen the public financial management systems.

130. Foreign exchange system. The IMF conducted the Safeguard assessment of the ECCB
in 2007 and found that the ECCB control environment is satisfactory. ECCB has well established
procedures that ensure the integrity of its operation and there is a well functioning internal audit
department, external auditors who regularly audit the accounts, and an Audit sub-committee of
the Board.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

131. Loan Disbursement. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures
for development policy support. Loan proceeds will be disbursed once evidence of fulfillment
with prior actions (Annex 2) has been accepted and the necessary approvals by the World Bank
and St Lucia have been obtained. Once such approvals are received, the Bank would make a
single loan disbursement into one of the St. Lucia Ministry of Finance treasury accounts

                                                51
denominated in US dollars and located in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. These funds will
be immediately converted to EC$, and thus will become available to finance budgeted
expenditures. They will be disbursed according to the regular government's budget procedures.
Within a week of this funds transfer, the Ministry will provide the Bank with a written
confirmation of the described transaction.

132. Accounting and Auditing. The administration of this loan will be under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. The GOSL uses the integrated financial management
system (Smartstream) to produce its accounts, which are prepared on the modified cash basis.
While the government does have in place the effective cash management system, and well-
functioning internal controls, backlog in preparation of the government's financial statements
remains the main problem. This issue is discussed in detail in the Public Financial Management
section of this document. The government strives to bring this issue to closure.

133. While the Auditor General for the obvious reasons is behind the schedule for the audit of
the government's financial statements, compliance audits of the line ministries expenditures are
up to date (2007/2008). For the most part, the audited ministries are in compliance with the
budget requirements. While this provides us with some level of assurance with regards to the
adequate use of the transferred funds, the World Bank reserves the right to request the audit of
the deposit account according to the Terms of Reference and by the auditors approved by the
Bank.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

134. The specific policies supported by this ES DPL/DPC operation are not expected to
entail significant impacts on the environment, forests, or other natural resources. The
supported reforms aim primarily at strengthening public financial management and budgetary
discipline, improving private sector competitiveness, and protecting the poor. At the same time,
GOSL has devised programs and policies to assess and manage potential adverse effects on the
environment. Internationally, the government has committed to the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), and regionally it has committed to the Cartagena Convention and the St.
George's Declaration of Principles for Environmental Sustainability in 2001. Following the
principles of this declaration, the OECS Natural Resources Management Unit (NRMU) prepared
an "OECS Charter for Environmental Management" and developed the OECS Environmental
Management Strategy in March 2002. The GOSL has also prepared a National Biodiversity
Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and has recognized the importance of Protected Areas (PAs)
as a means to conserve biodiversity. In 2008, along with other countries in the region and their
international partners, the OECS countries launched the Caribbean Challenge which aims to
protect and ensure the effective management of PAs. Several projects and activities aiming to
conserve the key ecosystems are being implemented, including the GEF/UNDP supported
Sustainable Management of the Shared Marine Resources of the Caribbean Large Marine
Ecosystem and Adjacent Regions Project (CLME), the GEF/UNEP supported Integrating
Watershed and Coastal Area Management Project (IWCAM), the GEF/World Bank supported
OECS Protected Areas and Associated Sustainable Livelihoods Project (OPAAL), and
Implementation of Pilot Adaptation Measures in coastal areas (SPACC).



                                              52
135. Government capacity to enforce environmental protection continues to be a
challenge in St. Lucia (just as in other OECS countries), even in cases where the legislative
foundation for the management of these ecosystems has long been in place. There is
inadequate enforcement of existing environmental regulations mainly due to the key agencies
being limited by human and financial constraints. Experience shows that site-based enforcement
is most effective where persons are available to implement awareness raising and enforcement of
environmental rules and regulations on a regular basis. Due to the lack of human resources,
enforcement suffers for want of sufficient personnel to enforce the law. Not only is there a lack
of human resources, but also a limited pool of persons with professional and technical training
and experience in environmental management. Given these limitations, many key agencies do
not have the institutional capacity to enforce the existing environmental laws effectively.
Furthermore, in some cases, the agencies concerned do not have the authority to enforce the laws
regulating the environment in general and protected areas in particular. The agencies must rely
on the police or some other law enforcement entity even to halt a violation. This process can be
inefficient and results in inconsistent and ineffective enforcement. Finally, even in cases where
agencies have the authority to halt violations or the power of arrest, they must coordinate with
legal staff from outside the agency to pursue prosecutions. This can be problematic due to
varying institutional priorities, which is again exacerbated by limited resources. The Bank is
helping St. Lucia address some of these constraints through the World Bank/GEF OECS
Sustainable Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystems Project
(currently under preparation) which would, inter alia, establish a system of long-term financing
mechanisms to sustainably fund protected areas in St. Lucia and also support efforts to
harmonize policy, legal and institutional frameworks in St. Lucia and other OECS states.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

136. The government reform program, supported by this ES DPL/DPC, faces three types
of significant risks: economic, natural disaster, and political.

137. Economic: Strong financial sector linkages in the region create contagion risks, though
the banking system has so far remained resilient. The recent CL Financial and Stanford Group
events demonstrated that external financial shocks can be quickly transmitted to the region
through such financial institutions. The presence of financial conglomerates and complicated
ownership structures within the Caribbean increases the contagion risks across different types of
financial institutions as well as across borders. Mitigation: St Lucia appears not to have any
direct exposure to the Stanford Financial Group. The impact of the CL Financial group has
so far been contained. The national authorities and the ECCB are strengthening regulation
and supervision of the nonbank financial sector. The Government appointed a judicial
manager of BAICO's operations in St. Lucia on July 31, 2009 to perform a financial review
and feasibility study to facilitate an orderly resolution to the BAICO failure. Similar
coordinated action was undertaken in other ECCU members as the resolution to the
CL/BAICO case requires a regional approach.

138. A second near-term risk includes a deeper and more protracted global slowdown,
increasing financial stress and further decline of capital inflows. A further deterioration of
the global economic situation could deepen the impact on the St Lucian economy and cause
severe hardship. Mitigation: The government is implementing a sound economic program

                                               53
and is taking further measures to manage the crisis. The IMF, World Bank, EU and other
donors have active dialogue with St Lucia. The Executive Board of the International Monetary
Fund approved on July 27, 2009 a disbursement of SDR 6.89 million (about US$10.7 million) to
St. Lucia under the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) based on
track record of sound macroeconomic policies in St. Lucia. Although the ratio of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) to total loans showed some increase, it still remains relatively low at 6.6 percent at
the end of 2008. The capital adequacy ratios were also adequate. Nonetheless, there is anecdotal
reporting of increases in NPL ratios in the first quarter of 2009.

139. Given the strong reliance on the rest of the world, particularly for commodities and
service industries such as tourism, St. Lucia is susceptible to other external shocks such as an
increase in oil prices, specific shocks to tourism sector, or a further expansion of the tourism
sector in other competing destinations. Mitigation: While difficult to mitigate, the government
seeks to manage these risks through its main focus on reducing vulnerabilities and support for
economic diversification and fiscal prudence. Furthermore, St Lucia's exposure is further
mitigated by it being one of the most diversified economies in the OECS.

140. Natural Disaster: Another major risk is St. Lucia's vulnerability to natural disasters such
as hurricanes and tropical storms. In the past, natural disasters have adversely affected the
agriculture and tourism sectors, with particularly severe effects on communities and households.
In 2007, St Lucia was battered by Hurricane Dean in August--which destroyed the island's
entire banana crop--and an earthquake in November. The large costs of recovery from natural
disasters have contributed to increasing indebtedness in St. Lucia and in the Caribbean as a
whole, and have also redirected scarce public resources away from long-run development plans.
Mitigation: The damage to the major private sector enterprises would be partly covered by their
own insurance. St Lucia participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility
(CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant disaster. The Bank is
also assisting St. Lucia through the St. Lucia Disaster Management project II, which was
approved in July 2004 and the project was later extended until December 2011 with additional
financing. The World Bank (together with IDB) is helping St. Lucia to increase its capacity to
integrate climate resilience into sectoral and national development strategies. St. Lucia will
benefit from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in 2010, under which sectoral and
cross-sectoral country-led activities will: (i) pilot and demonstrate approaches for integration of
climate risk and resilience into development policies and planning; (ii) strengthen capacities at
the national levels to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scale-up and
leverage climate resilient investment, building upon other ongoing initiatives; and (iv) enable
learning-by-doing and sharing of lessons at various levels.29

141. Political: As most of the actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC will have to go
through a Parliamentary approval process, there exists a risk that their enactment and
implementation could be vulnerable to special interests or delay by the opposition. Furthermore,


29
   The PPCR is one of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), which are interim funds developed by Multilateral
Development Banks, participating countries and other stakeholders to bridge the financing gap prior to agreement on
the next climate change regime.


                                                        54
actions that have already taken place--such as the cap on public employment--could face
continued resistance. Similarly, the sharpening of social safety nets targeting mechanisms could
be challenged by groups who may find themselves no longer eligible for benefits. Mitigation:
The political risk is reduced by the UWP government's substantial majority in Parliament (11
seats out of 17 in the House of Representatives) and the government's strong commitment to the
reform program. The risk is reduced further by the government's consultative approach to
reform implementation and the government's commitment to dialogue among all stakeholders, as
demonstrated, inter alia, by the reliance on the National Consultative Council in formulating the
budget and the announced establishment of a Tripartite Council to ensure regular dialogue
between the Government, employers, and major worker organizations. Furthermore, the IFIs
and other donors are also heavily focused on building consensus for the Government's reform
program.

approved by the IMF Executive Board on March 15, 2010. St. Lucia also requested financial
resources from the IMF under the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF) and the Board of the
International Monetary Fund approved on July 27, 2009 a disbursement of SDR 6.89 million
(about US$10.7 million) to St. Lucia under the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF).

       Annex 4: ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CRIBBEAN STATES DEBT PROFILE

1.      OECS countries are among the most highly indebted in the world. Total public debt
ratio averages around 90 percent of GDP in the OECS with a wide variation among the member
states. St. Kitts and Nevis holds the highest debt to GDP ratio by far --177 percent at the end of
2008. St. Vincent and Grenadines has the lowest ratio of 68 percent. The other member states
ranges between 70 percent and 109 percent.

2.     The level of indebtedness in the OECS often raises concerns about debt
sustainability and many member states restructured their debt in the recent past. Dominica
and Grenada completed debt restructurings under PRGF supported programs in 2005. Antigua
and Barbuda has been working on a debt strategy to approach creditors. Antigua and Barbuda
also benefited from some debt write-downs along with St. Vincent and Grenadines. St. Kitts and
Nevis has recently engaged advisors for a possible restructuring.

3.      External debt is the biggest component of public debt in many countries. Although
there are significant variations among the countries, external debt is higher than 50 percent of the
total in most member states. This renders the OECS economies highly vulnerable to external
shocks

4.      A significant part of the external debt is multilateral and bilateral. Central
governments hold about 80 percent of the external debt and more than one-half of it is owed to
multilateral and bilateral creditors. The only exception is Antigua and Barbuda where 53 percent
of the central government's external debt is with commercial creditors.

5.      Many countries are under the heavy burden of high public debt service. Although
some countries (Dominica and Grenada) managed to reduce their debt service through debt
restructurings, the debt service burden is heavy in most countries in the region. Only the external
debt amortization averages about 22 percent of the current revenues, --crowding out other public
and private expenditures. The current global economic crisis has further increased the challenges
for the governments as it led to higher interest rates and greater difficulties in rolling over
existing debts.

6.      There is no data available on private sector external debt in the OECS either via
local sources (ECCB), international sources (WB, IMF, BIS), or databases (EIU). The only
information available is the consolidated balance sheet of the commercial banks in each member
states; this gives a partial indication of the external exposure of the financial system in the
absence of financial information on insurance companies.

7.       The net foreign position is generally favorable in the OECS with foreign assets of
commercial banks outweighing foreign liabilities, except in St Lucia where the position is
negative as of February 2009. It has been negative since September 2006 (the start of the series)
but the gap has significantly widened. Antigua and Anguilla also have higher vulnerability as the
ratio of foreign liabilities to ECCB imputed foreign reserves is above 1.5. In other words,
reserves fall short of covering commercial banks' foreign liabilities. Considering foreign
liabilities and foreign deposits in proportion of total banking liabilities, it appears that Anguilla,
Antigua, St Kitts and St Lucia are the most exposed ones, with a ratio exceeding 17 percent.

                           Annex 5: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.      This annex presents a public debt sustainability analysis for St. Lucia using both a
deterministic model and stochastic simulations. The baseline public debt to GDP ratio
projections are based on the macroeconomic assumptions that are consistent with the medium
term macroeconomic framework envisaged in the IMF Staff Report dated April 9 2010.

2.      The baseline scenario assumes an average annual real GDP growth of 3.1 percent over
the period 2010-2015. After a 5.2 percent contraction in 2009 due to the global crisis, the St.
Lucia economy is expected to make a modest recovery in the medium term. On the fiscal side,
the baseline scenario assumes a containment of wage expenditure below 12 percent of GDP from
2011 onwards (spending on wages and salaries is expected to amount to 12.4 percent of GDP in
2010) as well as some moderate gains from the implementation of the VAT, property taxes, and
interest income taxes (averaging 1.2 percent of GDP from 2012 onwards). With these fiscal
policies in place, St. Lucia would be able to run a primary surplus of 0.1 percentage points of
GDP on average during 2010-2015. The annual inflation rate is assumed to steadily rise from
1.9 percent in 2010 to 2.2 percent in 2015.
                                                       Figure 5: Public Debt to GDP Ratio
3.     Under    the   baseline    assumptions
                                                               (Baseline Scenario)
described above, St. Lucia's public debt-to-     85
GDP ratio would continue rising in 2010 and      80
2011, but is expected to decline thereafter      75
(Figure 5). By 2015, the public sector debt
                                                 70
would fall to 78 percent of GDP and continue
declining to 73 percent by 2020. If the          65

Government were to make stronger                 60
expenditure cuts and realize larger gains from   55
the implementation of new taxes, the public      50
debt could fall further to 69 percent of GDP         2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015
by 2015 and 59 percent by 2020. On the other
hand, if the current fiscal stimulus is not removed and no additional revenue boost is received
from the new tax measures, the public debt to GDP would not assume a declining path and could
reach 89 percent of GDP by 2020.

4.     The external debt accounted for about 55 percent of St. Lucia's total public debt stock in
2009, compared to 76 percent in 2003. A high share of external debt makes the public debt
highly sensitive to changes in the exchange rate. A possible sharp devaluation of the exchange
rate would significantly increase the cost of debt servicing, resulting in larger borrowing
requirements, and thus higher debt ratios. Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 30 percent
devaluation in 2010 and 2011 would raise the public debt ratio to 123.3 percent in end-2012,
compared to 82.2 percent under the baseline scenario.

5.     In the case of a combined shock of one standard deviation to primary balance, real GDP
growth and real interest rates in 2010 and 2011, the public debt ratio would increase to about
97.3 percent by 2011, and stabilize at that level. This result implies that the public debt

sustainability in St. Lucia hinges on continued fiscal discipline and a favorable macroeconomic
environment.

6.     Stochastic simulations assign low probabilities to extreme scenarios for St. Lucia. A
more recent approach to fiscal sustainability is utilizing a stochastic simulation tool. This
framework takes the interactions among key variables into account, contrary to the deterministic
approach. The common practice

tests. As a result, frequency distributions of the debt ratio can be derived for each year of
projection, which provides a probabilistic assessment of debt sustainability. Simulation results
for St. Lucia show that the 95 percent confidence interval is the range of public debt ratio
between 72 percent and 100 percent (by end-2014). Furthermore, there is a 2.5 percent
probability that the public debt ratio will be above 100 percent throughout the projection period.

                               Annex 7: TOURISM SECTOR PERFORMANCE

1.      Tourism is a key employer and a major source of foreign exchange revenue in St.
Lucia. Recognizing the importance of this sector to the overall performance of the economy, the
following annex presents a brief summary of the tourism sector in St. Lucia by discussing recent
trends in tourism to St. Lucia and comparing them with the performance of tourism in other
OECS states and the wider Caribbean market.

2.      Tourism revenues in St. Lucia--measured as a share of GDP--are one of the
highest in the Caribbean. Between 2003 and 2005, tourism revenues averaged close to 40
percent of GDP. Although tourism's contribution to GDP declined to approximately 30 percent
in 2006 and 2007 due to damages inflicted by Hurricane Dean and an earthquake in 2007, the
figure is still high in comparison to other Caribbean countries (Figure 7).

3.       In 2006, despite the solid growth in global tourism, St. Lucia's tourism sector
experienced its first period of contraction since its full recovery from the 9/11/2001
terrorist attacks in the US. Stay-over arrivals continued to decline in 2007 due to a number of
factors, including high airfares stemming from the surge in fuel prices, airlift constraints, the
passport requirement on US citizens associated with the Western Hemispheric Travel Initiative
(WHTI), and the adverse effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. The
contraction occurred despite the additional tourist arrivals for the Cricket World Cup (CWC) in
the first half of 2007. Cruise passenger arrivals, on the other hand, increased appreciably by 69.7
percent in 2007, following two consecutive years of significant contraction in 2005 and 2006.

4.       The global recession has had a mixed impact on stay-over and cruise passenger
arrivals. After a strong performance in the first half of 2008, stay-over arrivals plummeted in the
fall of 2008, although registering overall positive growth of 2.9 percent for the year. The decline
continued into 2009, with stay-over arrivals falling by 5.8 percent. The year-on-year contractions
in stay-over arrivals have been mainly the result of the deepening financial crisis and economic
downturn, which softened demand for travel to St. Lucia and the wider Caribbean. In contrast,
cruise ship passenger arrivals have seen an upward trend, increasing by 1.5 percent in 2008 and
12.8 percent in 2009.
