for St.\n            Lucia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank Performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: a programmatic approach, which supports a\n            multi-stage program with a longer term horizon, is superior\n            to a stand-alone one year program. In small states, policy\n            based programs need to be relatively simple, in terms of\n            realistic scope and targets. Since generally only one policy\n            based operation is prepared in a multi-year period, both the\n            Government and the Bank tend to include many activities in\n            the program. One year is too short a period for\n            implementation of a program, particularly when it is as\n            ambitious as this one. Designing, approving and implementing\n            policy reforms takes time. In addition, a natural disaster\n            or a similar emergency situation could distract the\n            authorities from the program for several months, as it\n            happened in St. Lucia in late 2010. Close supervision,\n            preferably coupled with technical assistance, is\n            instrumental for achieving program outcomes in a one-off\n            DPL. In those operations, where all reforms need to be\n            completed prior to Board approval, the targets and outcome\n            indicators to be met at the end of the program have a\n            somewhat blurry meaning, since no disbursement is triggered\n            by them."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
