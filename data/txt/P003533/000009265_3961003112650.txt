MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TIANJIN INDUSTRIAL DEVXLOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $150.0 aillion, to help finance a Tianjin Industrial Development Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a matur-
ity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan
would be onlent to the Tianjin municipality on the same terms as the Bank
loan. Tianjin would onlend as follows: (a) the industrial credit component
of $134.5 million to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs), and (b),
out of technical assistance component of $15.5 million, $200,000 to ?FIs and
$9.7 million to eligible enterprises, on the same terms and interest rate as
that of the Bank loan. PFIs would onlend the loan proceeds of the industrial
credit component to eligible enterprises for a maximum period of 15 years
including up to three years of grace and at a variable interest rate equal to
the Bank rate plus a minimum spread of 1.2 percent. The foreign exchange risk
of the loan amount will be borne by the Tianjin municipality on a part of the
technical assistance component ($5.6 million), by the borrowing enterprises on
the industrial credit component ($134.5 million) and the technical assistance
component ($9.7 million), and by the PFIs on the balance of technical
assistance ($200,000),
2.        Background.  Industry is China's largest productive sector, account-
ing for nearly half of its gross domestic product in 1990 and employing
17 percent of the country's total labor force. Despite its rapid growth, the
industrial sector is characterized by low efficiency and productivity and
often inferior quality of products. This is mainly due to inappropriate poli-
cies, outdated equipment and technology, inadequate infrastructure and weak
support institutions. The Chinese Government is carrying out changes in the
industrial structure through ongoing economic and enterprise reforms which
focus on market-oriented production and pricing, greater enterprise autonomy
and management accountability, modernization of existing equipment, export-
orier.;ed production, conservation of natural and energy resources, and
enhancement of the scope and efficiency of financial intermediation. At the
same time, steps are being taken to improve the infrastructure and to
strengthen the support institutions. The Bank is assisting in industrial
restructuring, through its economic and sector work and lending operations,
both at national and regional levels, the latter having special significance
because of the gradual decentralization of investment responsibilities under
China's reform process.
3.        The proposed project would support industrial restructuring in
Tianjin which is one of the three largest cities in China with the status of a
province. Tianjin has a relatively large and diversified industrial base.
Although its industrial output accounts for only 3 percent of the national
industrial output, it is quite sizeable in absolute amount--Y 71.7 billion
($15.2 billion) in 1990. Tianjin's industrial sector has faced many of the



same problems as the industrial sector has in the whole of China. In line
with the national polic7, the Tianjin Municipal Government (TMG) is implement-
ing a series of reforms to restructure the industrial sector. The Bank has
already started supporting this program through a loan, approved in February
1989, for the Tianjin Light Industry Project (TLIP, Loan 3022-CHA).  TLIP is
assisting TMG in restructuring three priority subsectors of the light industry
sector, viz., textile dyeing and finishing, paper and packaging. IDA has also
approved, in June 199^, a Tianjin Urban Development and Environmental Prcject
(Credit 2387-CHA) which envisages the removal of bottlenecks and improvement
of the physical infrastructure in Tianjin, including management of solid
wastes, and pollution control in industrial enterprises.
4.        TLIP has laid the foundation for a constructive dialogue with TMG
which has now requested Bank assistance for the proposed industrial restruc-
turing project aimed at new subsectors, viz., machine tools, construction
equipment, automotive parra, electronic components and electric motors.
International consultants (financed under Credit 1664-CEA) have carried out
the studies of these five subsectors which have helped to determine Tianj$'a'
comparative advantage in their main product groups and to prepare development
programs and strategies.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank's lending
operations have included direct loans for large ludustrial projects including
restructuring, lending to development finance institutions, mainly for the
modernization of light industry, and regional subsector-focused operations.
The experience has shown that successful industrial restructuring depends
largely on well-prepared programs and strategies and on an integrated frame-
work of appropriate policies and incentives, suitable corporate governance,
technological modernization and satisfactory physical and institutional infra-
structure. Although overall implementation of the TLIP is satisfactory,
implementation was initially delayed due to lack of familiar-wty in ICB proce-
dures and Bank guidelines for selecting consultants, and because of a tendency
to underestimate costs, particularly for large subprojects. Under the pro-
posed project, very strong emphasis is being placed on project implementation
support, in order to minimize such problems and strengthen implementation
infrastruuture.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Industrial restructuring is a pro-
longed process and requires a firm and long-term commitment from the TMG and
continuous support from the Bank. The Bank's involvement in the proposed
project would help to accelerate and broaden the reforms initiated with TLIP
and provide continuity in Bank support for the restructuring of the industrial
sector. The studies of the five selected subsectors have helped to detecmine
the comparative advantage of key products in each subsector and recommended
restructuring measures that would lead to economies of scale, product special-
ization, new marketing strategies, phasing out of nonariable products, reorga-
nization of the subsectors, improvements in enterprise organization and man-
agement systems, and strengthening of institutional infrastructure. The Bank
has considerable experience in industrial restructuring based on its earlier
work in China and other countries and has, thus, been able to provide close
guidance to consultants in developing appropriate programs and strategies.
Furthermore, a very constructive dialogue initiated with TMG on this subject
under TLIP has provided a good foundation for advancing reforms by adopting



-3-
new measures and undertaking new experiments in the industrial sector in
Tianjin. These measures and experiments go far beyond those initiated under
TIP.
7.        Prolect Objectives.  The main objective of the project is to support
TMG in restructuring the industrial sector. It would thus aim tot (a) expe-
dite policy and enterprise reforms at the regional level; (b) modernize and
reorganize the subsectors based on economic criteria and commercial viability;
(c) strengthen institutional infrastructure; (d) improve the organizational
structure and internal enterprise management and systems; and (e) diversify
and strengthen the financial intermediation process.
8.        Economic and enterprise reforms are the focal point of the restruc-
turing strategy, and the proposed project will assist in their implementation
on two fronts. On the one side, the project would help the Government in
carrying out subsector policy reforms (such as liberalization of investment,
production and pricing; improvements in the foreign trade regime; social
security and housing reforms; and promotion of industries in which Tianjin has
a comparative advantage). These policy reforms are needed irrespective of the
type of enterprise ownership. On the other side, a set of enterprise reforms
would be pursued (such as corporatization, improvements in the contract
responsibility system, reorganization of subsectors, introduction of modern
management systems and procedures and promotion of joint ventures) which will
make enterprises more efficient and profitable.
9.        Pro1ect Descr_-tion.  The project would includes  (a) financial
assistance in the form of an industrial credit of $134.5 million to be onlent
through three PFIs, viz., China Investment Bank, Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China and Bank of Communication, to enterprises in the five subsectors
included in the project for restructuring and modernization, and (b) technical
assistance of $15.5 million. Loan proceeds would be used by PPIs and enter-
prises on a first-come, first-served basis.
10.       The technical assistance component of the proposed Bank loan will be
used for: (a) strengthening of institutional infrastructure ($11.8 million)
through import of testing equipment, pilot plante, computer hardware and soft-
ware, teaching aids, etc., and staff training; (b) consultant services for
assistance in project implementation ($2.5 million); (c) training of enter-
prise management and staff ($0.7 million); (d) strengthening of the institu-
tional framework for labor redeployment ($0.3 million); and (e) strengthening
of PFIs ($0.2 million).
11.       Proiect Implementation.  The technical assistance component of the
project will be implemented by TMG except for the funds allocated to PFIs and
enterprises for their institutional strengthening. PFIs will be responsible
for onlending the financial assistance component to beneficiary enterprises.
The total cost of the project is tentatively estimated at $222 million equiva-
lent with a foreign exchange component of $150 milP:On (68 percent). Final
costs of the project would depend upon the individud subprojects that PFIs
will finance under the industrial credit component.
12.       Although the project is basically for assisting the five preidenti-
fied subsectors, TMG and the financial intermediaries will be free to include



-4-
other subsectors in the project scope provided they carry out subsector stud-
ies and prepare restructuring plans satisfactory to the Bank before providing
financial assistance. PFIs will be responsible for the appraisal and supervi-
sion of subprojects and all investment decisions under the proposed Bank loan
following agreed criteria, which would include, inter alia, compliance with
TMG's development program and strategies.
13.      Retroactive financing of up to $5.0 million equivalent is provided
for eligible expenditures made after July 31, 1992 for urgently needed equip-
ment and consultant services under the technical assistance component of the
project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 11253-CHA), dated
Pebruary II, 1993, is being distributed separately.
14.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The subsectors to be restructured under the
project are of %igh priority and critical for China's future development.
Once their res ructuring is completed as planned, they would continue to oper-
ate satisfactorily. Beneficiary enterprises are commercial entities and
therefore would be able tz generate adequate revenues for maintaining new
a"sets. Support institutions would provide services which would be of direct
relevance to enterprises and, therefore, their services will remain in demand
and paid for by enterprises. PFIs have shown gradual institutional develop-
ment and, based on prudent financial policies being followed/agreed to be
followed, they would provide move efficient financial intermediation in the
future.
15.       areed Actions.  Key agreements reached during negotiations with TMG
and PPI* include the development program and strategy for the five subsectors;
onlending criterLa; and details of the technical assistance component to
strengthen support institutions. The engagement of consultants to assist in
the implementation of subsectoral restructuring progrsms and the signing by
Tianjin and the PFIs of subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank
would be conditions of loan effectiveness.
16.       Environmental Asrects. The project subsectors are not major pollut-
ers but their manufacturing processes will still have environmental impacts.
To ensure that satisfactory measures are taken to protect the environment, the
Tianjin Environment Protection Bureau would approve renovation and expansion
plans of enterprises to be assisted under the proposed Bank loan and would
periodically monitor their compliance; all subprojects vould be consistent
with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank; appraisal reporte and
summary information on individual subprojects to be sent by PFIs to the Bank
will indicate specifically the equipment to be procured for pollution control;
and Bank staff will make necessary checks during the approval of individual
subprojects.
17.       Project Benefits.  The acceleration of policy and system reforms,
improved services of support institutions and restructuring of enterprises
under the project would result in improvement of subsectoral efficiency and
performance. The subprojects would meet economic viability criteria, would



5-
result in significant improvements in product quality and production effi-
ciency and would promote economies of scale and product specialization.
18.       Risks.  There are two main project risks:  (a) unanticipated and
adverse future macroeconomic developments and the cumbersome process of coor-
dination between the central and provincial authorities could affect the pace
of implementation of the agreed policy and system reformst and (b) various
activities envisaged under the project may not be completed on time. However,
given the Government's strong commitment to the reform process, institutional
arrangements made in Tianjin for project implementation and experience gained
under TLIP, these risks are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the suceess
of the project.
19.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loin would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Execative
Directors approxe the proposed loan.
