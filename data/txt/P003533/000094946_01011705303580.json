The Bank, and Borrower\n            performances are rated as marginally satisfactory, mainly\n            due to underestimating difficulties in the changing\n            management culture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and,\n            because of delays in completing technical assistance (TA)\n            activities by the Tianjin government, respectively. Lessons\n            show that: 1) although enterprise reforms have been\n            introduced, with increased market-orientation, the actual\n            performance remains unsatisfactory. Government control\n            legacy is strong, evidenced by reluctant management\n            decision-making, where particularly at the local levels,\n            government remains involved in most critical decisions,\n            despite the supposed autonomy granted to SOE management.\n            Thus, investments in SOEs remains highly risky; 2) another\n            government legacy on SOEs, is their focus on production,\n            rather than on marketing. The absence of market information,\n            hampers operational aspects, since management concentrates\n            on production of huge inventories, not only reducing liquid\n            funds, but creating working capital problems. This risk\n            factor could be mitigated by developing market research\n            institutes to bridge marketing gaps; and, 3) strengthening\n            Bank skills in project finance, analysis of credit risk,\n            including accountability on investment decisions, is paramount."}, "docdt": "2000-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
