It also covers\n            measures aimed at fostering social inclusion and better\n            managing natural resources. And it supports governance\n            reforms in areas such as public financial management, public\n            administration, and legal and judicial development. These\n            fundamental reforms provide the foundation upon which the\n            government can then effectively implement sectoral policy\n            actions. The potential volatility of capital inflows makes\n            it important for Vietnam to secure resources on a long-term\n            basis and to signal the support of the international\n            community to its reform program. Strong capital inflows and\n            government interventions in the exchange rate market to\n            prevent the appreciation of the dong resulted in higher\n            inflation, a current account deficit and an asset price\n            bubble in 2007. Bank lending and investments of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs) in the stock market and in real estate\n            amplified these trends. Market sentiment might have reversed\n            Sound macroeconomic management will be critical to sustain a\n            strong economic performance and continued poverty reduction\n            in this more turbulent environment. To address this risk,\n            the current credit supports measures aimed at enhancing the\n            effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. They include the\n            assessment of SOE investments in the financial and real\n            estate sectors, the strengthening of banking supervision and\n            corporate governance in banks, and the adoption of criteria\n            to prioritize public sector investments."}, "docdt": "2008-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
