follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the breadth of\n            the reform undertaking and linkages among policy actions\n            across sectors called for a comprehensive approach to\n            dialogue and support by development partners. The strong\n            track record of government commitment and adoption by\n            partners of the PRSC series to match government priorities\n            and processes made this approach work. Analytical work gives\n            insight on inter-linkages across individual policy areas, as\n            well as cross-cutting issues, and helps ensure they are\n            appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported\n            under the operation. Dedicated and adequate resources for\n            analytical work and short-term technical assistance enables\n            the government and development partners to assess the\n            potential impacts of related policy actions and help refine\n            the proposals. Donor coordination can strengthen the policy\n            dialogue and deliver benefits to the client. The PRSC series\n            served as an effective framework for policy dialogue and\n            interactions between the government and donors. Government\n            line ministries voiced concern that financial flows from the\n            PRSCs went directly into the state budget, and their\n            participation in the often time-intensive policy dialogue\n            did not result in direct budgetary increases. Multi-sectoral\n            Development Policy Lending\u0092s (DPLs) may be best suited to\n            ministries that have clear and strong policy linkages, and\n            where improved policy coordination is a primary objective.\n            There is a need to complement consideration of outcome\n            indicators by looking at qualitative assessments of\n            achievements and also at complementary objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
