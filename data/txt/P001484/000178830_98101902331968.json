        of bridges for the Antsohihy-Ambanja road; (c) improvement\n            of road maintenance operations by strengthening MTP's\n            central administrative organization for road maintenance;\n            improving routine and periodic maintenance in two regional\n            districts, including regravelling program for about 400 km\n            of roads; and improving the mechanical workshops in five\n            regional district centers; (d) a study to determine the most\n            appropriate mix of labor and equipment for road maintenance\n            and improvement works and implementation of a two-year\n            demonstration program; (e) feasibility and detailed\n            engineering studies for a 170 km section of road; (f)\n
