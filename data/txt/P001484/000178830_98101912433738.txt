DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, has a land area
of about 590,000 sq km and is situated in the Indian Ocean about 400 km off
the southeast coast of Africa, from which it is relatively isolated both
economically and culturally (see Map). Its topography is generally rugged,
with a central mountain range of up to 2,800 m altitude traversing the country
in a north-south direction. The climate is marine tropical, but varies con-
siderably within the country; cyclones and heavy rainfalls are especially
frequent on the east coast during the rainy season (November-May) while arid
and dry zones are found in the south and the west. Because of this climate
and topography, construction of transport infrastructure is difficult and
expensive. The island is therefore largely segmented into a number of rather
isolated regions, polarized around small townships, some of which are often
interconnected only by coastal shipping.
1.02      The population is estimated at about 9 million and growing at 2.5%
p.a. Population distribution is uneven, and about one-half of all inhabitants
occupy one-quarter of the island's area in the central Antananarivo and
Fianarantsoa provinces. Density averages 16 persons/sq km, but ranges from
2 persons/sq km in the southern and western provinces to 25 persons/sq km in
the central and eastern coastal regions.
1.03      The population is 85% rural and engaged largely in the agricultural
sector. Although more than half the annual production is used for subsistence,
agricultural products (chiefly coffee, spices and meat) account for about
80% of Malagasy exports and 42% of GDP. The country will continue to rely
on agriculture since industry, which accounts for 14% of GDP, is at an early
stage of development, and the numerous known mineral deposits, with the
exception of chromite and graphite, are not commercially important. Average
per capita income has increased by less than 1% p.a. since 1960 and is cur-
rently about US$210 p.a. Due to an economic recession which began in 1972,
and the energy crisis and worldwide inflation which began in 1973, there has
been little economic growth since then.
Government's Development Efforts and Goals
1.04      Government aims at establishing a decentralized socialist system
based on the "Charter of the Revolution", dated August 1975. Its overall
development efforts between 1978-2000 will be concentrated on improving the
level of education of the population, providing better social services,
achieving self-sufficiency in agriculture and creating an industrial base



- 2 -
capable of satisfying the country's basic needs and at the same time provid-
ing greater employment opportunities. The First Development Plan established
under the new decentralized structure covers the period 1978-1980. Under this
first short-term Plan the Government intends to set up the necessary admin-
istrative structures to carry out its long-term development strategy and, in
the transport sector, to provide a basic transport infrastructure for the
island.
B. The Transport System
The Network
1.05      The transport infrastructure comprises the following:  about
27,500 km of roads, of which 4,500 km are paved; two unconnected railway
systems totalling 860 km; 4 main ports and 11 lighterage ports of some sig-
nificance; and 56 airfields. There are no pipelines or navigable rivers.
Transport needs are relatively well served only on the central plateau, with
the metropolitan area of Antananarivo generating or absorbing half of the
country's commodity flows. Other populated areas are mainly concentrated
along the coast and are served mainly by coastal shipping or air transport
due to the lack of all-weather roads.
Highway Transport
1.06      Details of the highway subsector are discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.07      Madagascar's national railway, which plays a strategic role in the
country's limited transport system, dates back to 1913 when the main line
between the port of Toamasina (formerly Tamatave) and Antananarivo was com-
pleted. The railway is operated by the Madagascar National Railway (Reseau
National des Chemins de Fer Malagasy (RNCFM)) under the Ministry of Transport
and Supplies (Ministere des Transports et du Ravitaillement, MTR, Chart 1).
It consists of two short unconnected systems (meter gauge) which total 860 km
of single-track line and an additional 175 km of industrial branch lines and
private sidings. The northern system includes: (a) a 375 km section between
the port of Toamasina to just north of Antananarivo; (b) a 154 km section from
Antananarivo south to Antsirabe; and (c) a 167 km section from Moramanga north
to Lake Alaotra. The southern system, 164 km, connects the port of Manakara
with the city of Fianarantsoa.
1.08      The railway system provides the only continuous means of surface
transportation for most of the areas served. Its main line has a near mono-
poly in the area between Toamasina and Antananarivo while competition between
road and rail is very keen on the section between Antananarivo and Antsirabe.
The southern system between Manakara and Fianarantsoa is the only transport
link between those cities. In the past, Government ensured the monopoly in



- 3 -
the Toamasina-Antananarivo corridor by protective regulations setting a 5.5
ton vehicle load limit on the parallel road, which is now being reconstructed
to paved standard to take the 10-ton maximum allowable axle load (para. 2.08).
Freight traffic on the system amounted to 823,000 tons in 1977 and has been
stagnating since 1973 due to depressed local economic activity- Tariffs are
based on commodity values and range from FMG 16.5 per ton-km for less than a
carload of general freight to FMG 3.3 per ton-km for chromite. Tariffs have
not kept up with the cost of operations, and RNCFM therefore shows a deficit.
Unlike its freight traffic, RNCFM's passenger traffic has steadily increased
by about 7.2% p.a. since 1972 due to the rapid growth of suburban traffic.
Over 3.92 million passengers were transported in 1977.
Air Transport
1.09      Internal air transport is important in Madagascar, and a very dense
air transport network has developed. Of the 56 airports, 17 are built to
all-weather standards including 5 suitable for international traffic. The
remainder are either gravel or grass strips. All are operated and adminis-
tered by the Directorate of Civil Aviation and Meterology in MTR. More than
50% of all air traffic is handled by Ivato Airport at Antananarivo.
Air Madagascar
1.10      Air Madagascar (AM), owned 70% by Government and 30% by Air France,
began operations in 1969 and has since greatly expanded services and become
increasingly viable. AM's fleet currently consists of 18 aircraft, including
one B-707 for long distance; two B-737s for domestic and regional use; six
twin Otters and nine light aircraft. A B-747 (combination cargo/passenger
plane) has recently been acquired, and service started in March 1979. AM's
main international routes go to Europe via East Africa, and a regional network
serves Reunion, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Apart from Air France, the only
other long distance international carriers serving the country are Alitalia
and Aeroflot which provide weekly service to Rome and Moscow, respectively.
Air Tanzania and Air Mauritius operate a pool arrangement with AM for des-
tinations in Tanzania and Mauritius.
1.11      In 1976 AM's traffic totalled 227.9 million passenger-km and 28.4
million ton-km. The company provides internal services to 52 scheduled,
regular stops. Forty of these account for only 20% of traffic and produce
losses but are continued for social reasons and for lack of alternative sur-
face transport. In 1976, internal traffic comprised 77 million passenger-km
and 2 million ton-km (207,364 passengers and 4,893 tons of freight). During
1973-76, the number of passengers on domestic flights increased by about 10%
p.a. while the number of passengers on international flights decreased by
about 6% p.a. due to the departure of large numbers of expatriates and the
consequent reductions in their travel and in tourist travel.
Ports and Coastal Shipping
1.12      Madagascar relies almost exclusively on shipping for foreign trade;
coastal shipping is also important and is the only means of transporting
freight between many areas. The major ports are located at Toamasina with



- 4 -
two-thirds of total traffic, Mahajanga with 11%, and Antomboka in the north
and Toliara in the south, each with about 4% of total traffic. Imports
and exports totalled 2.8 million tons in 1975. Because the amount of total
tonnage has stagnated since the downturn in economic conditions in 1972, the
major ports currently have sufficient capacity, and the port of Toamasina
has over-capacity. In 1975, coastal shipping accounted for about 300,000
tons, more than half of which went to or from the island of Nossi-Be.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.13      The overall governing policy for transport planning and coordina-
tion in Madagascar is based on the 1975 "Charter of the Revolution" which
states that it is essential to: (a) connect regional capitals by all-weather
roads; (b) construct the Antananarivo-Moramanga-Toamasina road; (c) maintain
the road network effectively; and (d) review the transport organization to
improve services. Government's long-term 1978-2000 Plan restates these
objectives to be implemented in a series of short-term plans. While con-
struction of new roads has priority ranking in the National Development Plan
for 1978-80, there is no comprehensive transport program based on economic
criteria. Progress towards meeting the transport objectives has been slow
due to budgetary constraints (para 2.15); as a result, Government can under-
take major new projects only when outside financing is available.
1.14      Transport planning and coordination does not yet pose any serious
problems since the country's transport infrastructure is still very under-
developed and new investments are concentrated on providing only a very basic
system. But, when completed, the Moramanga-Toamasina road, now being con-
structed with financing from the People's Republic of China, will provide an
all-weather road link between Antananarivo and Toamasina which will compete
with rail and air transport servicing this area; thus greater intermodal
.coordination will be needed on this corridor in order to optimize use of the
transport system. Future investments will require a much greater planning
effort than in the past to ensure that use of the most economic mode by
commodity is encouraged. The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MFP) is
expected to be able to undertake these tasks in the near future. During
project supervision the Association will review the adequacy of MFP's planning
and coordination capabilities and may consider providing assistance to MFP
under future projects, should the need arise.
1.15      Responsibility for transport planning is divided between the Ministry
of Public Works (Ministere des Travaux Publics, MTP) for roads and MTR for
air, water and rail transport; overall planning and coordination of invest-
ments is the responsibility of the lfFP. There is a shortage of qualified
transport planners in both MTP and MTR and insufficient data to analyze
transport demand. It is expected, however, that the data collection
needed for highway planning will improve with the recent resumption of annual
traffic counts (para 2.04) and the preparation of an annual inventory of road
conditions to be started under the proposed project (para 3.12). In addition,
a team of transport planners (SETEC-France/Berger-US) was financed under



Madagascar's First Railway Project (Cr. 488-MAG) to assist MTR's planning
effort and eventually improve highway planning through better coordination
between MTR and MTP. The team, which finished its assignment in August 1978,
carried out a number of transport studies, including a modal allocation study
of road/rail traffic in the Antananarivo-Toamasina corridor, but did not
succeed in training a sufficient number of local staff since counterpart staff
were not provided in adequate numbers and with the required qualifications.
The MFP is therefore assuming most of MTR and MTP's planning functions.
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.16      Bank Group involvement in Madagascar's transport sector began in
1966 when the First Highway Project (Credit 90-MAG, US$10 million) provided
for construction to paved standards of two sections of the Antananarivo-
Mahajanga road, totalling 145 km. A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR,
No. 1409) dated January 3, 1977 found that the cost of the road construction
was far below original estimates and the recalculated rate of return was
greater than estimated at appraisal. Surplus funds were used to finance sup-
plementary works and studies, which necessitated a delay in project completion.
1.17      The Second Highway Project (Credit 134-MAG/Loan 570-MAG, US$8 mil-
lion, 1968) helped finance construction of 146 km of two major trunk roads and
construction of three bridges. The project did not completely meet its
objectives, and completion was delayed by about one year due to difficulties
of the contractors who carried out the project. Actual project cost was
US$15.2 million in contrast to the appraisal estimate of US$11.5 million,
including contingencies. This represents an overrun of some 30%, of which
about half was due to price increases and half to increased quantities. The
cost overrun was financed in large part by Government, but savings under the
First Highway Project also contributed to financing. PPAR No. 811, dated
July 18, 1975, found that the economic justification of one of the project roads,
Ambilobe-Ambanja (91 km), was doubtful in view of its low rate of return (8%),
primarily caused by higher construction costs than foreseen at appraisal.
1.18      The Third Highway Project (Credit 351-MAG/Loan 876-MAG, US$30 mil-
lion, 1973) provided for construction of 417 km of primary roads, detailed
engineering of the Antsohihy-Ambanja road and a review of the traffic
counting system. In 1975 the project had to be modified due to substantial
cost increases as a result of price and quantity increases not anticipated at
appraisal, as well as the devaluation of the US dollar. A supplementary
credit of US$5.6 million was therefore provided while construction was reduced
by 67 km. PPAR No. 2143, dated July 27, 1978, found that while the overall
recalculated rate of return of 14% was acceptable and in line with appraisal
estimates, two road sections had individual rates of return of 10% or less,
since expected agricultural benefits failed to materialize due to the deter-
iorating political and economic situation of the country. The PPAR further
outlines the project's deficiencies, including an insufficient provision of
funds for road maintenance and a failure to train Malagasy nationals and
thereby contribute to institution building. These problems have been
addressed under the ongoing Fourth and the proposed Fifth Highway Projects.



1.19      The Fourth Highway Project (Credit 641-MAG, US$22 million, 1976)
is currently helping to finance construction of 370 km of secondary roads
between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano and the 67 km of primary roads from
Arivonimamo to Analavory deleted from the Third Highway Project. A road
maintenance component is also included which provides for a study to evaluate
maintenance needs, including procurement of equipment and technical assistance
for training of local staff in road maintenance. The project's road construc-
tion component is progressing satisfactorily and is nearly completed. The
maintenance study is finished; however, implementation of the recommended
training program has been delayed. Since training of local staff is essential
to improving maintenance operations under the proposed Fifth Highway Project,
agreement was reached that Government would take the measures necessary to
allow an early start of training (para 2.13).
1.20      Bank Group assistance has also helped finance the construction of
feeder roads under agricultural and rural development projects. A 1974 pro-
ject for Village Livestock and Rural Development (Credit 506-MAG) financed
the construction of about 170 km of secondary roads in Mahajanga province and
maintenance of about 280 km of roads. Under the Mangoro Forestry Project
(Credit 525-MAG, 1974) provision was made for construction and maintenance of
56 km of gravelled service roads, 840 km of plantation truck roads and 910 km
of tracks. The Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project (Credit
322-MAG, 1972) included the improvement of 24 km of existing secondary rural
roads and construction of about 90 km of feeder roads. Finally, construction
of farm roads was included in the Lake Alaotra Irrigation Project (Credit
214-4AG, 1970).
1.21      Other transport projects include a port project (Credit 200-MAG,
1970, US$9.6 million) which provided for the extension of Toamasina Port,
creation of the Toamasina Port Authority, and technical assistance for
management personnel and training; in 1973 the Credit was increased by US$1.8
million to cover a shortage of funds resulting from a currency realignment.
PPAR No. 2299, dated December 22, 1978, concluded that: (a) the physical
objectives of the project were satisfactorily carried out; (b) a lower
revised economic return at 7.0% was due to lack of traffic growth resulting
from adverse local and international political and economic conditions that
could not have been foreseea at the time of appraisal; and (c) although the
technical assistance towards institution building purposes did not achieve
satisfactory results initially because of the low calibre of expatriate
experts, progress in achieving autonomy and better management is now being
made by the port authority. The Bank Group also helped to finance a railway
project (Cr. 488-MAG, US$6 million, 1974) to assist RNCFM in replacing
outdated equipment and to determine the railways' long-term prospects and
requirements; a second railway project, presented to the Board on May 8, 1979,
will continue replacement of outdated equipment and the track renewal program.
1.22      The first four Bank Group projects in the highway subsector helped
Government to pursue its objective of providing better road access to re-
gional capitals. However, some roads financed under previous projects already
show signs of deterioration due to inadequate maintenance and, to a lesser
extent, a failure to enforce vehicle weight regulations. Both problems were
addressed under the Fourth Highway Project which provided for (a) purchase and
installation of weighbridges to monitor vehicle weights and (b) a road mainte-
nance study and implementation of some of the study's recommendations. Government
has agreed that a greater effort will have to be made to improve road maintenance
and assistance toward this goal will be provided under the proposed Fifth
Highway Project.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road network, totalling about 27,500 km, is divided into three
categories according to their function:
(a)  primary or trunk roads (about 8,700 km) linking the provincial
capitals and major towns;
(b)  secondary or district roads (about 6,000 km) within and between
districts; and
(c)  tertiary or subdistrict roads (about 12,800 km), partly tracks
serving as feeders to trunk and secondary district roads.
As shown in the following table, about 4,500 km are bitumen paved. Other
roads are generally low standard, dry-weather earth roads and tracks.

2.02      The road network is inadequate both in length and condition (para
2.25), and large portions of the country have no all-weather land connections
to the rest of the island. The network is particularly poor in the region of



- 8 -
Antomboka, the only region where the trunk road linking Antananarivo
to the regional capital, the city of Antomboka, is not yet completely
constructed to all-weather standards (see Map). Still to be constructed
is the section between Antsohihy and Ambanja (165 km), which is passable
only in the dry season between May and November. Various areas on the
country's east and west coast also have no all-weather road connection with
the rest of the country, and road links to the southern regions are mainly
earth roads or trails, most of which are in poor condition although the dry
climate allows year-round serviceability. The paved road network consists
of a main north-south artery connecting Antananarivo with the regional centers
of Mahajanga and Fianarantsoa, plus several short stretches on the central
plateau and around the major coastal towns. During the last few years, paved
roads have been deteriorating due to inadequate maintenance. Average density,
considering all road types, is 47 m/sq km as compared to 87 m/sq km in Kenya
and about 49 m/sq km in Tanzania. In order to allow year-round road access
to the region of Antomboka, the proposed project will help finance the
construction of bridges on the Antsohihy-Ambanja road (para 3.08) and will
thus help meet Government's objective of connecting regional capitals by
all-weather roads (para 1.13). The project would also provide for feasibility
and detailed engineering studies for about 170 km of National Road 13, to
improve road access to the regional center of Taolanaro (para 3.15); in
addition the project's maintenance components would improve the condition of
various parts of the network (para 3.04(c)).
B. Traffic Growth and Characteristics
2.03      Composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is given below.  Between
1969 and 1977 the fleet grew at an average annual rate of 6.4%, but since 1973
the growth rate has fallen to 3.2% due to Madagascar's economic recession and
a shortage of foreign exchange which caused Government to curtail the import
of non-essential goods.

2.04      Present traffic volumes on paved roads range from about 100 vehicles
per day (vpd) in rural areas to more than 1,000 vpd near the main cities. On
unpaved roads, traffic flows reach a maximum of 75 vpd. Annual traffic counts
were stopped after 1972 when most expatriate advisors left the country, and
were only resumed in 1978 with assistance under the Association's Third High-
way Project. Although no recent traffic data are available to determine the
traffic growth rate, traffic volumes seem to be stagnating as indicated by
a drop in total fuel consumption by about 1% p.a. between 1970-76 as shown
below.

2.05      The Ministry of Finance and Planning's Tax Office estimates that
in total there are about 5,000 public freight transporters, including large
trucking firms, owner-operators, private carriers and cooperatives. The
majority of transporters own only one truck, and only 17 firms are listed
as having more than 5 trucks. While the larger companies are well run and
generally provide good service, individual transporters lack the managerial
knowledge to operate efficiently. There are no barriers to entry into the
industry, which is generally competitive.
Regulations
2.06      The Ministry of Transport and Supplies is responsible for setting
inter-provincial road transport rates while rates for intra-provincial freight
transport are set by provincial authorities within a minimum-maximum rate
system established by Government. However, in spite of the existing rate
regulation, tariffs are in practice governed by supply and demand and thus
vary considerably according to road condition, season and region and are
reasonable.
2.07      Passenger transport regulations are the responsibility of MTR and
the provincial authorities. Service is provided by cooperatives and individual
carriers. Although entry into the industry is nominally screened by Government
on the basis of supply and demand considerations, in practice all applicants



- 10 -
are admitted. Although there are no barriers to entry into the industry (para
2.05), since 1976, individual passenger carriers have been able to operate for
only one year, after which they must join an existing cooperative or form a
new cooperative (by Malagasy law requiring a minimum of seven members). Per-
mits are given to serve specific routes for which an official tariff exists.
Rates for inter-provincial transport range from FMG 1.40 to 5.60 per pass-km
depending on the type and condition of the road. Since rates are not revised
frequently enough to reflect changes in operating costs, carriers charge higher
rates. Provincial authorities may fix rates for intra-provincial transport
between the minimum and the maximum set by the official tariff, but in prac-
tice rates are determined by competition.
2.08      Vehicle dimension and weight regulations allow 10-ton axle loads
and are adequate. Enforcement of these regulations is, however, lacking and
Government is preparing to launch a major campaign to control axle loads.
Weighbridges were purchased under the Association's Fourth Highway Project
and are now being installed on major routes where overloading has been found
prevalent under a recently completed survey using portable scales.
C. Administration
2.09      ITP is responsible for administration of the primary network (8,700
km), and the decentralized local authorities are in charge of secondary and
tertiary roads (18,800 km). The Ministry of Agriculture also constructs
and maintains feeder roads under agricultural projects. As shown in Chart
2, MTP functions through its:
(a) Directorate for Programming, Management and Training (DPMT),
in charge of programming, evaluation and coordination of
engineering studies; centralization and collection of data;
definition of standards; policy formulation for works carried
out by MTP's various units; and training of MTP staff;
(b) Directorate of Studies, Control and Works (DSCW), in charge
of execution of engineering studies and supervision of
construction works carried out by force account and by
contractors;
(c) Directorate of Equipment (DE), in charge of procurement,
repair and maintenance of equipment which it provides for
hire to the regional district offices; and
(d) Six regional district offices in charge of physical execution
of construction works and periodic and recurrent maintenance
carried out by force account for primary and secondary roads.
2.10      MTP's administrative structure was set up in late-1977 and is
aimed at giving greater authority and independence to the six regional
district offices in line with Government's decentralization policy. For
primary roads, the regional roads engineers report directly to the General



- 11 -
Secretary of MTP and receive technical advice and assistance from DSCW for
execution of engineering studies and supervision of construction works car-
ried out by force account. For secondary roads, the regional roads engineers
are responsible only to the regional political authorities, although the
same staff and facilities are used for both primary and secondary roads.
Tertiary roads are maintained by the local communities. At present, there
is no central administrative unit to supervise regional road maintenance
operations. Although DPMT coordinates the annual primary road maintenance
programs submitted by the various regional districts for approval before the
beginning of each year, it has no jurisdiction over the secondary and tertiary
road networks. Strengthening of central control over planning and execution
of maintenance works is needed to make operations more efficient. This need
will be met under the proposed project which includes the establishment within
MTP of a central unit in charge of maintenance of the country's road network
(para 3.09).
D. Staffing and Training
2.11      MTP currently faces a shortage of qualified and experienced staff at
all levels. This has been particularly acute since 1972 when a large number
of expatriates, who filled many of MTP's key positions, left the country.
Furthermore, several reorganizations of MTP and changes in Government during
the past few years have led to repeated changes in personnel in many of MTP's
higher-level positions. MTP's central administrative organization and its
six regional district offices are staffed by about 110 engineers and about
150 technicians, all of whom are Malagasy. Although the number of staff is
adequate to fulfill the administration's basic needs, additional training
is needed as recommended in a recent consultant's study (para 2.13). A
shortage also exists of experienced middle and lower-level supervisory staff
(such as chiefs of road sections, maintenance brigades and work gangs) and to
a lesser extent, mechanics and vehicle operators. During the last few years,
Government was reluctant to use technical assistance, and MTP dismissed all of
its expatriate technical advisers, thereby limiting its capability to improve
its staffing situation. However, Government has altered its attitude towards
technical assistance and has expressed its willingness to accept such assist-
ance under the proposed project; the scope and timing of technical assistance
have been agreed by Government and the Association (paras 3.18 and 5.01(j)).
2.12      Most civil works training in Madagascar is theoretical rather
than practical. The technical college in Antananarivo (L'Establissement
d'Enseignement Superieur Polytechnique (LESP)) provides a four-year training
course in civil engineering which leads to an engineering diploma; about
15 to 20 students graduate annually. LESP's civil engineering department
suffers from a shortage of qualified lecturers, inadequate training equipment
and lack of funds. Courses at the LESP are given by MTP's engineers, who
often are not adequately prepared for their lectures or must cancel lectures
due to other commitments. About 20 secondary technical schools have two- to
four-year programs to train technicians, with about 250 graduates annually in
the various technical fields. Although the number of trainees is sufficient
to fill vacancies in MTP's central and regional administrations, the technical



- 12 -
courses do not always provide the theoretical training needed, and practical
training is almost non-existent. The only practical training and refresher
courses available to MTP staff are given at MTP's own training school (Centre
d'Application des Travaux Publics (CATP)), which in 1977 provided training for
only about 25 MTP employees due to inadequate facilities, shortage of experi-
enced instructors, and the limited local funds available.
2.13      Recognizing the shortage of skilled personnel in Madagascar, Govern-
ment selected consultants, Louis Berger (US), to carry out a study of MTP's
training requirements. The study, which was financed under the Fourth High-
way Project, outlines MTP's full manpower and training needs in the near
future (five years) to improve road maintenance to an adequate level. It
recommended:
(a)  improving training courses for both engineers and technicians
at the LESP through the appointment of a full-time lecturer
for the roads sector and the procurement of training equipment;
and
(b)  introduction of a long-term countrywide program for practical
and, to a lesser extent, for theoretical training of middle
and lower-level supervisory personnel and craftsmen through
the strengthening of CATP's training capacity.
The study was completed in mid-1978 and its recommendations accepted by the
Government. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has expressed
interest in providing funds for the LESP lecturer, and the Fourth Highway
Project will finance the CATP training program. Government has, however, been
rather slow in taking the necessary steps to allow for an early start of the
training. Since training of local staff is essential to improving maintenance
operations, Government and the Association agreed on the following: (a) a
road maintenance training program for MTP staff will be prepared and carried
out; (b) for this purpose, consultants will be employed by January 1, 1980,
with qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment
satisfactory of the Association; (c) the Association will be consulted on
Government's decisions relative to the training program to be executed; and
(d) construction of such training facilities as shall be required to carry out
the training program will start by January 1, 1980 (para 5.01(a)). In addi-
tion, employment of consultants by January 1, 1980 to prepare and carry out
the road maintenance training program, and start of construction of the required
training facilities at CATP by January 1, 1980, will be conditions of Credit
disbursement for all project components except that referred to in para 3.04
(a) below.
2.14      The ongoing Fourth Highway Project also includes on-the-job training
for MTP staff in the region of Antomboka. Technical assistance financed
under that project will set up an adequate regional maintenance organization,
introduce efficient methods for planning, programming, execution and cost
accounting for road maintenance in the region, and train local staff. The
proposed Fifth Highway Project will provide the same type of technical assis-
tance for the two additional regions of Mahajanga and Toliara (para 3.10)
and fellowships for local senior supervisory staff (para 3.19).

E. Planning and Financing
Planning
2.15      The Development Plan for 1978-80 included the following program
for the highway subsector. For the primary road network, an additional
1,000 km of roads were proposed for paving, and bridges on the paved network
were to be strengthened. For the secondary road network, it was proposed to
upgrade a total of 1,200 km of roads, primarily by force account, to permit
year-round use and to construct bridges totalling 1,000 meters. The Plan
further provided that 500 km of resurfacing per year would be undertaken
and that an average of FMG 150,000 per km per year (about US$700 equivalent)
would be spent for road maintenance. Actual progress, however, has not met
these objectives. So far, commitments have been obtained from foreign donors
for improvement to paved standards of 550 km of primary roads, and the upgrad-
ing of secondary roads is estimated to be less than half of that scheduled.
Construction of bridges, mostly with foreign financing, is following the
plan. Only about 50 km of roads were resurfaced in 1978 (para 2.25), and
maintenance expenditures were less than half the amount programmed (para 2.17),
primarily due to the country's tight financial situation; a large part
of these expenditures covered salaries of MTP staff.
Financing
2.16      Highway investments are financed through the development budget;
recurrent expenditures are financed out of the general budget. As indicated
in the following table, since 1975 investment expenditures for roads have
been rising rapidly due to the number of major road construction projects in
progress. In 1977 expenditures for the highway sector amounted to about FMG
8,308 million (US$38 million equivalent) for investment expenditures and FMG
3,827 million (US$17.4 million equivalent) for recurrent expenditures. This
represents about 14% of total Government expenditures; however, in 1978,
Government's allocation for highways was reduced to 11% of total allocations.

2.17      Since 1972, total recurrent expenditures in real terms have barely
kept up with inflation and have been insufficient for adequate maintenance
of the road network. In 1978, the budgetary allocation for operating expendi-
tures for primary road maintenance was increased to FMG 2,827 million (US$12.9
million equivalent), which would have been adequate. However, only about half
of the budgeted amount was actually made available to the regional district
offices due to the country's difficult financial situation.  The budgetary
allocation for secondary roads in 1978 was FMG 303 million (US$1.4 million
equivalent), which was about one-third of the amount required. Taking into
account operational equipment available in the regional districts and equip-
ment included under the ongoing project and the proposed project, the funds
needed to adequately maintain the primary and secondary road networks in 1980
will amount to about FMG 3,960 million (US$18 million equivalent) for operating
expenditures and about FMG 2,200 million (US$10 million equivalent) for equipment



- 15 -
renewal. Agreement was therefore reached with Government that: (a) at
least FMG 3,960 million (US$18 million equivalent) will be allocated for
operating expenditures in the 1980 budget; (b) Government will allocate at
least FMG 1,100 million (US$5 million equivalent) for equipment renewal in
the 1980 budget and make its best efforts to obtain external financing for
an additional FMG 1,100 million for the same purpose; and (c) alter 1980
and until the completion of the project, Government and the Association will
from time to time discuss the appropriateness of budgetary allocations for
road maintenance in the light of inflation and the scope of required mainte-
nance operations (para 5.01(b)).
2.18      Aggravating the problem of inadequate allocations is the haphazard
release of funds to the regional districts depending on the availability
of funds in the Treasury. As a result, maintenance operations frequently
stop, thus making execution of an established program impossible and works
more costly. Agreement was reached with Government that maintenance funds
will be made available to the regional district offices promptly as needed
for uninterrupted operations (para 5.01(c)).
Revenues from Road Users
2.19      Recurrent expenditures on roads are financed out of the general
budget to which road users contribute through taxes on vehicle ownership and
use. In 1976, total revenues from road users were about US$30 million. Even
though these revenues have been declining since 1973 because of the country's
difficult economic situation, they have been in excess of road maintenance
costs in the past and are expected to be so in the immediate future.

F. Engineering
2.20      As stated in para 2.09, DSCW has overall responsibility for engineer-
ing design within MTP. Due to a shortage of qualified staff, it carries out
feasibility and detailed engineering studies for minor and medium-sized projects
only, and relies on foreign consultants for design and supervision of major
works. MTP's National Soils Laboratory (Laboratoire National des Travaux
Publics et du Batiment (LNTPB)) satisfactorily carries out all the necessary
soil investigations and materials tests for the design and supervision of
construction for civil works done by both MTP and consultants.
2.21      Road design standards adopted by MTP are appropriate for the various
classes of roads (Table 2.6). Roads are usually designed for speeds of 60-80
km/hour on the central plateau and coastal plains, and 40-60 km/hour in moun-
tainous areas; standards for specific roads are usually determined by feasi-
bility studies on the basis of economic conditions, traffic levels and terrain.
Bitumen paved roads normally consist of a 6 m wide double surface treatment,
or asphaltic concrete for the more heavily trafficked sections, with a 15-20
cm gravel base. Pavements are designed for 10-ton wheel axle-loads, which is
satisfactory.

G. Construction
2.22      DSCW undertakes small construction works using equipment-intensive
methods while the regional offices carry out some spot improvement and periodic
maintenance operations by force account. Major road construction is done by
contractors, who are local subsidiaries of French or Italian firms. Construc-
tion is financed mainly by foreign donors, and is usually carried out by
contracts let on a unit price basis following international competitive
bidding or the bidding procedures required by the financing agency. Adminis-
trative procedures for bidding and contract award follow well established
regulations but are frequently carried out slowly, which has resulted in
rather lengthy delays in contract award; work specifications are comprehensive
and precise. Construction supervision is the responsibility of DSCW which
carries out some of this work with its own staff; however, because of a short-
age of experienced staff, major works are supervised by foreign consulting
engineers, though now partially in association with local consulting firms,
which have recently been established.
2.23      A domestic contracting industry for highway construction has not
yet developed due to lack of skilled personnel and scarcity of capital and
credit facilities. In 1974, a National Public Works Agency (Societe d'
Interet National pour Travaux Publics, SINTP) was created as an independent
and financially autonomous corporation whose sole stockholder is the Govern-
ment. SINTP has already carried out some major construction works and has
been selected to upgrade the Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano road financed under
the Fourth Highway Project. Its performance has, however, been hampered by
an inexperienced staff, inefficient management techniques and a shortage of
construction equipment. In order to strengthen SINTP's operations, under
the Fourth Highway Project consultants have been employed to assist SINTP in
executing the project work, which started in late-1978. Government is com-
mitted to further increasing its participation in civil works projects carried
out by foreign contractors, and is currently negotiating the terms and condi-
tions of its participation in these companies.
H. Maintenance
2.24      MTP's six regional district offices, through their subdivisions
and sections, maintain about 14,700 km of primary and secondary roads, pri-
marily by equipment-intensive operations. Maintenance of the tertiary road
network is discussed in para 2.28. The annual maintenance program is estab-
lished by the regional district engineers on the basis of their judgment;
there is no road inventory, and annual traffic counts on which to base main-
tenance requirements have only been recently reintroduced (para 2.04). Before
the beginning of each year, the proposed program for primary roads is submitted
by the regional district engineers to DPMT for approval and coordination with
that of the other regions; the program for the secondary network is submitted
by the regional engineers to the political regional authority only for their



- 18 -
approval. Maintenance funds from the budget are distributed to MTP's regional
district offices in proportion to the length of roads they must maintain. On
completion of maintenance operations, the district engineer prepares an annual
report outlining the general maintenance activities completed in his area,
giving global cost figures and type and scope of works; no detailed cost
accounting is carried out for these operations. As already mentioned (para
2.10),  MTP's central administration does not exert the necessary planning,
programming and control functions for road maintenance works carried out by
the regions. Although DPMT coordinates the annual maintenance program for
primary roads, the approved programs are not always followed. Furthermore,
DPMT is not sufficiently informed of the maintenance works carried out and
therefore cannot define corrective actions when needed. To assist in the
establishment of an adequate road maintenance organization, the proposed
project will provide for the creation of a central unit in charge of road
maintenance throughout the country (para 3.09) and introduce efficient plan-
ning, budgeting and cost accounting procedures for maintenance work in two
regions (para 3.10), which could later be applied to the rest of the country.
2.25      MTP's present routine and periodic maintenance operations are in-
adequate because of shortages of maintenance equipment (para 2.26), inadequate
equipment repair facilities (para 2.27), shortages of trained staff (paras
2,11-2,14), and insufficient recurrent funds (para 2.17). Although no
detailed records are as yet available for work done in 1978, it is estimated
that periodic maintenance of gravel roads, such as regravelling, was less
than 20% of that required to keep the network in adequate condition; routine
maintenance, such as reshaping, is done only sporadically with many of the
major road links not maintained at all. As a result, gravel-surfaced roads
frequently have an uneven surface and potholes, and many are negotiable only
during the dry season. Paved roads are also in poor condition. Less than
50 km of roads were resurfaced in 1978, although about 600 km of resurfacing
should be done annually to meet periodic maintenance needs. Routine mainte-
nance of paved roads, such as filling of potholes, repair of broken pavement
edges and reconstruction of shoulders, has also been inadequate, partly
because of an inadequate supply of materials (gravel aggregate and bitumen).
As a consequence, about a third of all paved roads (1,500 km) have deterior-
ated to such an extent that only full rehabilitation of pavement can restore
them to a serviceable condition, while about a quarter (1,100 km) require
resurfacing to avoid further deterioration and costly repair. Improvement of
maintenance is urgently needed to avoid continued deterioration of the network.
The Fourth Highway Project has begun to address this problem by assisting
Government to improve routine and periodic maintenance operations to an
adequate level in the regional district of Antomboka, and the proposed
project will expand this assistance to two additional regions (paras 3.10-
3.12). The project will also provide financing for the resurfacing, reha-
bilitation and maintenance of selected paved roads (paras 3.05-3.06).
2.26      One of the major problems preventing adequate road maintenance is
a general shortage of operational equipment. Most of MTP's equipment was
supplied by France before Madagascar's independence in 1960, and is now mostly
obsolete; newer equipment, financed by Government and bilateral assistance,
often stands idle due to lack of spare parts. Furthermore, even equipment
that is still operable is poorly utilized. DE is in charge of MTP's equipment



- 19 -
which it rents to the regional offices and charges rental for operating time
only and not for idle time. Since there is little incentive to minimize idle
equipment time, each superintendent requests as much equipment as possible,
even if funds are not available to operate it. In addition, the chiefs of
each subdivision were in the past not authorized to exchange equipment directly
among one another, which would reduce total requirements. With assistance
under the Fourth Highway Project, Government is beginning to address these
problems by financing road maintenance equipment and introducing an efficient
equipment management and rental system in the regional district of Antomboka,
with equipment charges based on actual equipment rental time; these changes
are expected to begin in the second half of 1979. If proven successful in
Antomboka, the new equipment rental system will be introduced into the regional
districts of Mahajanga and Toliara, which will be provided with additional
maintenance equipment under the project (para 3.10).
2.27      MTP's workshop facilities are not equipped to assure adequate main-
tenance and repair of the equipment fleet. The Central Mechanical Workshop
(CMW) in Antananarivo, which is responsible for major equipment repair and
overhaul, has adequate office and most of the workshop facilities needed, but
lacks workshop equipment and tools, spare parts, and experienced staff to
carry out its work. Equipment sent by the regional offices for major repair
must often wait for years until funds are available for the purchase of the
necessary spare parts. A similar situation exists at the regional workshops,
most of which lack adequate building facilities, workshop tools and equipment
and spare parts. Even preventive maintenance is not carried out as needed,
which further shortens the useful life of the equipment fleet. With the
assistance of the Fourth Highway Project, Government is establishing a special
equipment rehabilitation section within the CMW and a Central Procurement
Office (CPO) in Antananarivo for equipment and spare parts. The Fourth
Highway Project also provides funds for spare parts and technical assistance
for CMW and CPO and improvement of workshop facilities in the district of
Antomboka; equipment procurement is now underway, and consultants for
technical assistance will be recruited shortly. The new CMW section for
equipment rehabilitation and the CPO are expected to begin operations in
mid-1979. The proposed project will extend this effort by improving regional
workshops in the remaining five districts (para 3.13).
Maintenance of Tertiary Roads
2.28      Tertiary roads and tracks are primarily maintained by hand labor,
but the scope of these operations is limited, owing to the scarcity of funds
available to local communities. Villagers are recruited by the local com-
munities and supplied with tools to patch uneven surfaces, clear culverts and
drains, and raise the level of the road in inundated areas; technical advice
from MTP's regional offices is sometimes provided. The efficiency of this
work is rather low and not always of lasting value since the local staff are
not experienced in the operations and lack the required equipment for compac-
tion. Labor-intensive methods for road maintenance and improvement are viable,
if properly executed, not only for tertiary roads but also, for certain types
of maintenance, for the primary and secondary networks in areas with high
population density and unemployment, since the wage rate for laborers is low
(US$1.80 per day equivalent). The proposed project will therefore provide for
a study to determine the optimum mix of labor and equipment for maintenance
and improvement works in the various regions, and, if viable, to train local
staff in these operations (para 3.14).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      In view of the problems constraining road maintenance in Madagascar
and the resulting deterioration of the network described above, improvement
of Government's road maintenance capability is of highest priority. However,
because of the magnitude of the work needed and the substantial financial,
training and staffing requirements for improving road maintenance to an
adequate level, it has been necessary to strengthen the country's overall
maintenance capability in stages. Accordingly, the Association began to
assist Government in improving maintenance under the Fourth Highway Project
which financed a study to identify maintenance and training needs, a long-term
countrywide training program for MTP staff, the creation of a central main-
tenance workshop for equipment rehabilitation, and the general improvement
of maintenance operations in one of the country's six regional districts. The
proposed Fifth Highway Project will continue these efforts by helping Govern-
ment to rehabilitate and maintain the paved road network on a countrywide
basis, to improve mechanical workshop facilities in the remaining five regional
districts, and to improve maintenance operations in two regional districts.
Improvement of road maintenance in the rest of the country could form the basis
of a subsequent project.
3.02      As discussed in para 2.02, construction of the all-weather road
between Antomboka and Antananarivo is incomplete; thus, during the rainy
season between November and May, the region of Antomboka must depend on sea
and air transport only. The Association has recognized the need to improve
this road, and an engineering study for the remaining link between Antsohihy
and Ambanja (165 km) was included under the Third Highway Project. Given the
shortage of Bank Group funds and the priority of improving road maintenance,
it is not possible for the Fifth Highway Project to include full construction
of the road in accordance with standards given in the engineering study men-
tioned above (total cost of about US$40 million). The project will, however,
allow for improvement of the road in stages, and provide for construction of
bridges to allow year-round serviceability of the road. In addition, the
project will include feasibility and detailed engineering studies for a
section of about 170 km of National Road 13, to provide an all-weather road
link between Antananarivo and the regional district center of Taolanaro.
B. Objectives
3.03      The project's main objectives are:
(a) preventing further deterioration of the paved network in
order to reduce transport costs and to avoid early and
costly reconstruction works;



- 21 -
(b)  increasing the long-run maintenance capacity of MTP by
building up the necessary central administrative structure
and an adequate maintenance organization; and
(c)  providing for an all-weather road connection between the
regional district of Antomboka and the capital, Antananarivo.
C. Project Description
3.04      The proposed project consists of:
(a)  resurfacing and partial rehabilitation of a notional 500 km
of paved roads and the provision of an initial stock of
materials (bitumen) for road maintenance;
(b)  construction of bridges for the Antsohihy-Ambanja road;
(c)  improvement of road maintenance operations by:
(i)  strengthening MTP's central administrative organization
for road maintenance;
(ii)  improving routine and periodic maintenance in two
regional districts, including a regravelling program
for a notional 400 km of roads; and
(iii)  improving the mechanical workshops in five regional
district centers;
(d)  a study to determine the most appropriate mix of labor and
equipment for road maintenance and improvement works and
implementation of a two-year demonstration program;
(e)  feasibility and detailed engineering studies for
about 170 km of National Road 13;
(f)  training of MTP staff by technical assistance; and
(g)  fellowships for MTP staff.
(a) Resurfacing, Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Paved Roads
3.05      The project provides financing for resurfacing and partial rehab-
ilitation of various sections totalling about 500 km of the Antananarivo-
Mahajanga and Antananarivo-Fianarantsoa roads, with about 160 and 250 vpd,
respectively. Both roads show extensive cracking, potholes, an uneven road
surface and broken pavement edges; these problems create hazardous driving
conditions and cannot be improved solely by maintenance operations. Work
will consist of:



- 22 -
(i) reconstruction of failed sections of the base course;
(ii) resurfacing with a bituminous concrete layer or a
bituminous surface treatment; and
(iii)  reconstruction of shoulders.
The exact length, location and construction standards will be determined by a
consultant's study which is expected to be completed by the end of 1979 and
will be financed under the Fourth Highway Project. An additional 600 km of
rehabilitation and resurfacing work, which is not part of the project, will
be financed by Government.
3.06      At present, maintenance of paved roads is inadequate, not only for
the general reasons already cited (paras 2.25-2.27) but also due to a lack
of bitumen and crushed aggregate (para 2.25). To help address this problem,
the project will provide for the purchase of an initial stock of about 400
tons of bitumen; procurement of stone crushers under the Fourth Highway
Project will provide for the necessary supply of crushed aggregate. Agree-
ment was reached that Government will ensure that adequate amounts of bitumen
will be made available as and when required over the project period for the
rehabilitation and maintenance of its roads (para 5.01 (d)).
(b) Construction of Bridges for the Antsohihy-Ambanja Road
3.07      As indicated in paras 2.02 and 3.02, the Antsohihy-Ambanja road is
in need of improvement. At present, it is an earth road in poor condition
and impassable during the rainy season (November-May) when many of its exist-
ing river crossings and low-lying road sections become flooded. Improvement
of the road to all-weather standards ranks among Government's first priorities
in the transport sector and is essential for year-round transport of goods
and passengers and for improving the region's economic development and its
economic and social integration with the rest of the country.
3.08      The proposed project will assist Government towards meeting these
objectives by financing the construction of major river crossings. This will
consist of construction to one-lane standards of six major bridges ranging
from 40 to 320 m in length, with a total length of 650 m. Fourteen other
structures from 17 m to 32 m in length (total length 389 m) will be improved
to two-lane standards. The span and location of each bridge to be constructed
under the project is given in Annex 2.  The project will also provide for
construction to gravel standards of about 20 km of approaches to the bridges.
With its own financing, Government will improve the remainder of the road,
through execution of the necessary earth works to bring the road's vertical
alignment above the flood level, and by improvement of the road surface with
selected materials to allow for year-round serviceability. Agreement was
reached with Government that its improvement of the Antsohihy-Ambanja road to
allow year-round serviceability will be completed by the time bridge construc-
tion for the road is finished (para 5.01(e)).



- 23 -
(c) Improvement of Road Maintenance Operations and Equipment Repair Facilities
(i) Strengthening of the Central Administrative Organization
3.09      In order to strengthen the capability of MTP's centr-l administra-
tion to better plan, program and monitor maintenance works carried out by the
regional districts, the project includes the creation of a central unit for
road maintenance. The unit will be established within DPMT, which already
exerts a coordinating function for works carried out by MTP's various agencies.
It will control and centralize data collection; coordinate planning, program-
ming and budgeting; evaluate costs and scope of maintenance work done by the
regional districts for primary, secondary and tertiary roads; and if necessary,
define corrective actions required and monitor their implementation through
the General Secretary of MTP. The unit would be headed by a Malagasy engineer
experienced in road maintenance who could be recruited from among the most
experienced regional engineers. Agreement was reached by Government and the
Association that a central administrative unit for road maintenance will be
established within MTP and headed by a qualified and experienced engineer by
January 1, 1980, and will be provided with adequate supporting staff
(para 5.01(f)).
(ii) Improvement of Maintenance in Two Regional Districts
3.10      Both routine and periodic maintenance operations throughout the
country have been inadequate, but, as stated in para 3.01, because of the
limited human and financial resources available, it has not been practicable
to improve maintenance simultaneously in all of the country's six regions.
The project will therefore expand the efforts begun under the Fourth Highway
Project to improve maintenance at the regional level (para 2.25) by providing
the following assistance to the two regional districts of Mahajanga and
Toliara under a 2-year program consisting of:
(a) technical assistance to define a detailed program for
adequate routine and periodic maintenance; to outline the
composition and number of required maintenance brigades,
equipment, staff and training needs and the requirements
for capital and recurrent costs; to set up an adequate
maintenance organization, including introduction of
efficient techniques for programming, budgeting and execu-
tion of works, as well as cost accounting; and to train
local staff in proper work methods (para 3.16);
(b) arising out of (a), the procurement of equipment and spare
parts to complement existing equipment for setting up the
necessary recurrent and periodic maintenance brigades in the
two regions, including equipment for one regravelling training
brigade in each of the two regions (paras 3.11-3.12); and
(c) operation over a 2-year period of one road regravelling
training brigade in each of the two regions, including costs
for spare parts, fuel and materials (para 3.12).



- 24 -
Government and the Association agreed on the two regional districts of
Mahajanga and Toliara on the basis of overall road and traffic conditions,
qualifications of local staff and availability of equipment (para 5.01(g)).
3.11      Training in road regravelling and cost accounting will be provided
to MTP staff in each of the two regions. An expatriate foreman for each of the
two training brigades and a cost accountant for each region will be financed
under the project (para 3.16). It is envisioned that training in organiza-
tion and execution of works, including cost accounting, would be provided in
three-month cycles per team; the essential composition of each team is given
in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1: Proposed Composition of Each Regravelling Brigade
Equipment                             Staff
1 dozer, 150 hp                     1 Chief of Brigade
1 grader, 125 hp                    4 Equipment Operators
1 water tanker, 10,000 liters       3 Helpers for Equipment Operators
1 front-end loader                  5 Drivers
1 compressor and drills             1 Mechanic
1 roller (pneumatic), 10 ton        1 Mechanic's Helper
5 dump trucks 6 cu m
1 pick-up truck
Three Chiefs of Brigades will be trained concurrently during each training
cycle in order to optimize utilization of expatriate services. It is thus
expected that over the 2-year period, training would be provided to a total
of 48 chiefs of regravelling brigades, about 64 equipment operators, 48
helpers to equipment operators and 80 drivers, some of whom will be assigned
from regions outside of Mahajanga and Toliara. Training of mechanics will
be more suitably carried out at the CATP under the training program financed
under the Fourth Highway Project (para 2.13).
3.12      The regravelling work would include the necessary earthworks for
minor improvement of the horizontal and vertical alignment, the spreading and
compaction of a 15-20 cm gravel layer and construction and clearing of ditches
and drainage structures. On the basis of productivity rates in neighboring
countries, it is estimated that under the project a notional 400 km of roads
will be regravelled over the 2-year period by the two training brigades. These
operations will be complemented by three to four additional regravelling brigades
in each of the two regions, to be set up with existing equipment and equipment to
be procured under the project; operating expenditures for the latter brigades
will be financed by Government under its annual maintenance budget and is not
part of the project. The exact number and composition of maintenance brigades
for both periodic (regravelling) and routine maintenance (reshaping, filling
of potholes, etc.) will depend on the length and condition of the road network
in the regions selected and, on the basis of a road inventory and traffic
counts, will be determined by consultants financed under the project's tech-
nical assistance component during the first three months of their assignment.
Agreement was reached between Government and the Association that, following
the definition by consultants of maintenance requirements, a list of roads to
be regravelled under the 2-year regravelling program (1980-82) as well as



- 25 -
staffing needs, the number and type of equipment to be financed under the
project, and the timing of equipment procurement will be agreed between
Government and the Association (para 5.01(h)).
(iii) Strengthening of Regional Workshop Operations
3.13      At present DE's regional workshop facilities are not equipped for
adequate maintenance and repair of the equipment fleet. The proposed project
therefore provides for improvement of workshop buildings and procurement of
workshop tools, equipment and spare parts for the mechanical workshops at
the regional district centers in Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Fianarantsoa,
Toamasina and Toliara. Workshop facilities in the remaining district center
at Antomboka will be improved under the Fourth Highway Project (para 2.27).
Details of the scope of improvements to building facilities and requirements
for workshop tools and equipment and spare parts have been confirmed with
Government. The assistance provided under the proposed project and the Fourth
Highway Project should significantly strengthen the capacity of DE's regional
mechanical workshops to maintain and carry out minor and medium repairs to
road maintenance equipment; major equipment overhaul and rehabilitation will
be carried out at DE's central workshop in Antananarivo.
(d) Labor-Intensive Work Program
3.14      The project includes financing for a short consultants' study of
about 10 man-months to determine which maintenance and improvement works,
if any, might economically be carried out by more labor-intensive work methods
than are currently used. If such methods seem feasible, based on the supply
of labor in the project area, the wage rate of laborers, and the availability
of field supervisory staff or facilities for training supervisors, a detailed
2-year demonstration program to train local staff in these methods will be
defined by consultants. For the 2-year program, consultants would list:
specific projects to be carried out; the most economic equipment/labor mix;
technical assistance requirements; equipment, spare parts, tools and materials
needs; capital and operating costs; and the number and qualifications of
counterparts and local staff required. Financing of the demonstration program
would cover technical assistance, equipment, and operating costs for fuel,
spare parts and materials; adequate funds have been included in the project
costs to cover these items. An outline of terms of reference for the identi-
fication study have been discussed and agreed with Government. The demon-
stration program will take into account the role and functions of local
communities and Government's objective of developing cooperatives respon-
sible for road maintenance and improvement. Agreement was also reached
with Government that, following definition of the demonstration program by
consultants, Government and the Association will discuss and agree on
specific works to be carried out, equipment and materials to be procured
under the project, and the staff required for the demonstration program
(para 5.01(i)).
(e) Feasibility and Detailed Engineering Studies
3.15      The project provides financing for a feasibility study and, if
construction is economically justified, detailed engineering for about 170 km



- 26 -
of National Road (RN) 13, located between RN 7 and the Manandrotsy bridge.
With daily traffic of about 60 vehicles, this road forms part of the country's
major north-south axis linking the regional district center of Taolanaro
with Antananarivo. At present this is an earth road in poor condition and is
particularly poor during the rainy season when the safe driving speed is
reduced to about 10 km/hour on most of the road. Improvement of this road to
adequate engineering standards is one of Government's highest priorities in
the transport sector, and the proposed project will assist Government towards
this objective.
(f) Training by Technical Assistance
3.16      As mentioned (para 2.11), Government's road maintenance effort
is presently constrained by a shortage of qualified staff at all levels.
Technical assistance will therefore be provided under the project to assist
Government in improving the maintenance organization and operations in two
regional districts, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair in five
regional districts, and training local staff. The mission estimates that
a total of 168 man-months of consultant services will be needed over a 2-year
period and will consist of:
(i) two civil engineers, one in each of the two regional
districts for a period of two years each;
(ii) two cost accounting experts, one in each regional district
for a period of two years each;
(iii) two road foremen, one in each regional district, for a
period of two years each; and
(iv) one mechanical engineer for two years.
3.17      Training would primarily take place on-the-job.  Each civil engineer
in the above-mentioned team would advise the regional district engineer (his
counterpart) in matters related to road maintenance (para 3.10) besides advis-
ing and training the remaining supervisory staff in each region (about 3-5
engineers, about 15 technicians) in maintenance activities. The cost accoun-
tants would advise supervisory staff and train about 48 chiefs of regravelling
brigades (para 3.11) in cost accounting methods; part of this would include
in-class training. The road foreman would be assigned solely to the project-
financed regravelling brigade to carry out the training duties described in
para 3.12. The mechanical engineer would assist regional staff to implement
improvement of workshop facilities under the project, introduce a more effec-
tive equipment maintenance and repair system, and train local personnel.
3.18      Government has accepted technical assistance for project execution,
and agreement has been reached with Government on the scope and timing of
consultant services for that technical assistance (para 5.01(j)). In addition,
a notional amount of 72 man-months of technical assistance to train local
staff in labor-intensive methods has also been included in the project.
Agreement was reached with Government that all experts financed under the
project will be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Associa-
tion (para 5.01(k)).

(g) Fellowships
3.19      In order to improve MTP's long-term road maintenance capability,
local supervisory staff should receive advanced training in specialized
aspects of highway maintenance and equipment repair as well as civil and
mechanical engineering; the proposed project will therefore provide fellow-
ships abroad for suitable qualified Malagasies. Government has agreed that
the number and types of fellowships required to train local staff will be
defined by consultants under the project's technical assistance component
and thereafter will be agreed by Government and the Association (para
5.01(1)).
D. Cost Estimates
3.20      Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated by the
mission at about US$45.7 million or US$40.9 million, excluding taxes. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$34.0 million or 74% of total
project costs.   Details of project costs are provided in Table 3.2 below.

E. Financing
3.22      An IDA Credit of US$24.0 million will be provided for project
financing. A Special Action Credit of about US$10.0 million from the European
Economic Community (EEC) will also be available and will be administered by
the Association. These amounts should cover the project's total foreign costs;
Government will provide about US$11.7 million for local costs, including
US$4.8 million in taxes. A project financing plan is shown on the following
page.
F. Implementation and Procurement
Rehabilitation and Resurfacing of Paved Roads
3.23      The MTP, assisted by consultants provided under the project, will
be responsible for project execution. Rehabilitation and resurfacing of paved
roads will be by contract let on a unit price basis following international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. It is ex-
pected that contractors from EEC member countries will be awarded most of the
contracts, which will be financed under the EEC Special Action Credit. A con-
sultant's study to be financed under the Fourth Highway Project will define
the length, location and construction standards of road sections to be
rehabilitated and resurfaced; the study will be completed by the end of 1979.
Work is expected to start in early-1980 and to take about 12 months to com-
plete. The following points have been agreed with Government (para 5.01(m)):
(a) the length, location and construction standards of road
sections to be rehabilitated and resurfaced under the
project will be agreed by Government and the Association
following completion of the consultant's study;
(b) the execution of works by contractor following ICB;
and
(c) the supervision of construction by consultants selected
by Government on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.

Bridge Construction
3.24      Construction of bridges and approaches on the Antsohihy-Ambanja road
will be let on a unit price contract following ICB, in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. Works will be divided into three separate lots and will
be bid concurrently in order to attract foreign participants. Contractors
will be prequalified to bid on one or more lots. Construction is expected
to start in early-1980 and to be completed within 30 months. Supervision of
construction will be carried out by consultants selected by Government and
employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The scope
of each of the three lots will be defined by Government on the basis of a
preliminary work program and will then be agreed by Government and the Asso-
ciation; bid award following ICB and supervision of construction by consultants
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association have also been agreed
by Government and the Association (para 5.01(n)).
Improvement of Road Maintenance Operations
3.25      Routine (reshaping, filling of potholes, etc.) and periodic mainte-
nance (regravelling) will be carried out by MTP's regional district offices by
force account. Regravelling operations will be done by mechanized brigades;
eventual introduction of the appropriate labor/equipment mix for these works
will be considered in more densely populated areas following completion of the
identification study described in para 3.14. Consultants financed under the
project will work in an advisory capacity to the regional district engineers
and are expected to begin work in early-1980.
Improvement of Regional Workshops
3.26      Construction and improvement of workshop buildings in five regional
centers will be carried out by force account for minor improvements of exist-
ing buildings, and by contractors for major improvement work or new construc-
tion, following local competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory.
Work is expected to start in early-1980 and to take about six months to
complete.
Labor-Intensive Work Program
3.27      The identification study to determine an appropriate labor/equipment
mix for rehabilitation and maintenance operations in Madagascar will be
carried out by consultants, commencing in early-1980, and will take about
three months to complete. If this methodology proves economically viable, a
2-year demonstration program to train local staff in these methods will be
defined by consultants and thereafter agreed by Government and the Association
(para 3.14).
Feasibility and Detailed Engineering Studies
3.28      The studies will be carried out by consultants selected on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The feasibility study



- 33 -
is expected to start in early-1980 and to take about six months to com-
plete. If construction is found economically justified following review of
the study's recommendations by Government and the Association, detailed
engineering is expected to take about six months to complete.
Equipment, Spare Parts and Materials
3.29      Equipment and spare parts will be procured by ICB, following Bank
Group Guidelines. Spare parts can also be procured by other means besides
ICB if Government can demonstrate to the Association that ICB will not have
satisfactory results. Agreement was reached with Government that contracts
for single units of equipment and groups of equipment, tools, materials and
supplies costing less than US$50,000 will be awarded on the basis of quota-
tions from suppliers; the total amount of these items will not exceed US$500,000
(para 5.01(o)). Procurement of a stock of 400 tons of bitumen will be
according to established local Government procurement procedures which are
satisfactory. The DE will be in charge of procurement of equipment and spare
parts.
3.30      Completion of the project is expected by the end of 1982.  An imple-
mentation schedule (Chart 3), a progress reporting system (Annex 1) and
the preparation of a project completion report within six months of the
Closing Date have been discussed and agreed by Government and the Association
(para 5.01 (p)).
G. Disbursement
3.31      Disbursement from the Credit will be made on the following basis:
IDA Credit
(a) 70% of total expenditures for the rehabilitation
and resurfacing;
(b) 62% of total expenditures for construction of bridges
and their approaches on the Antsohihy-Ambanja road;

H. Ecology
3.32      The road rehabilitation and maintenance works carried out under
the project will improve drainage and thus help to decrease soil erosion,
which is a serious problem in Madagascar. Otherwise, the project will have
no influence on the ecology of the country.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
4.01      The proposed project will continue the training and maintenance
effort begun under the Fourth Highway Project. Its main objectives are:
(a) to improve the condition of 500 km of paved roads through a resurfacing
and rehabilitation program; and (b) to strengthen the road maintenance capac-
ity of the central administration of the Ministry of Public Works and its
decentralized regional authorities through: acquisition of road maintenance
equipment, spare parts and tools, a regravelling program for 400 km of roads
and the training of personnel at all levels through a combination of formal
and on-the-job training.
4.02      Proper maintenance of roads is of vital importance in Madagascar
where an often scattered population must rely on roads as the only means
of communication. Better maintenance would also support the country's effort
to improve the production and distribution of foodcrops, and could help to
reduce the country's dependence on imported foods, particularly rice, by
stimulating production through better and cheaper access to markets.



- 36 -
4.03      The project also includes construction of 6 major and 14 medium
size bridges (total length 1.04 km) on the road section linking Antsohihy-
Ambanja, including the necessary approaches, and upgrading of the road to
permit year-round travel, the latter to be performed by Government. This is
the only section of the Antananarivo-Antomboka road not yet constructed to all
weather standards. Construction of bridges under the project will allow
year-round access to the northern part of the country which is now cut off
during the rainy season, and is in line with Government's objective of linking
all provincial capitals to Antananarivo. Antomboka is the only provincial
capital which is not currently accessible to Antananarivo on a year-round
basis.
B. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.04      The project's maintenance components will provide significant
benefits to the majority of the population over a wide area of the country.
Generally, they should result in: reductions in transport costs of marketed
goods; improved access to areas which are otherwise cut off during certain
periods of the year; and better access to administrative and social facili-
ties. Project components for the rehabilitation and resurfacing of paved
roads and the regravelling of gravel roads will help prevent further
deterioration of roads to be included in the program, all of which are key
portions of Madagascar's primary road network. Benefits from the rehabili-
tation and resurfacing will accrue to road users primarily in the form of
vehicle operating cost (voc) savings and reduced maintenance costs. For the
road maintenance component, benefits will also accrue in the form of reduced
vehicle operating costs and improved maintenance capability. Furthermore,
if labor-intensive work methods prove economically feasible for road mainte-
nance, the use of such methods will enhance job opportunities and reduce the
need for foreign exchange required to purchase equipment and fuel from abroad
if equipment-intensive techniques were used.
4.05      It is expected that reductions in vehicle operating costs will be
passed on to producers and consumers in the form of reduced transport costs
and reduced prices for marketed goods. Since freight and passenger tariffs
are based on road conditions, they would take into account reductions in
vehicle operating costs due to road improvements. While these tariffs are



- 37 -
intended for all transport, in practice they are only applied to government-
related transport. Tariffs applied to non-government transport do, however,
reflect road conditions, and such transport is competitive.
4.06      The road improvements and bridge construction on the Antsohihy-
Ambanja road will have an influence on an area with a population estimated at
about 1.2 million. The work to be carried out will permit year-round use of
the road and result in decreased vehicle operating costs. It is also expected
that a considerable amount of traffic will be generated by these improvements
since this road is the only surface link between the provincial capital of
Antomboka and Antananarivo. Unquantified benefits include the elimination
of the cost of operating two ferries and the annual reconstruction of a number
of small wooden bridges which must be rebuilt at the end of each rainy season.
The time and cost of getting crops to markets will also be reduced. With the
road now impassable during the rainy season, the crops produced in the area
(sugar cane, cotton, corn, cocoa and cassava) are usually transported by
coastal shipping which results in long delays and high transshipment costs
due to the insufficient capacity and small size of ships available in the
coastal shipping fleet.
C. Economic Analysis
Rehabilitation and Resurfacing of Paved Roads
4.07      The economic analysis for this project component compares the
costs and benefits arising from the rehabilitation and resurfacing of sec-
tions of the Antananarivo-Mahajanga and Antananarivo-Fianarantsoa roads over
a period of five years, taken to be the economic life of the new road surface.
Economic costs of the program are adjusted to exclude taxes and to include a
10% allowance for physical contingencies and are expressed in constant May
1979 prices. The quantified benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating
costs derived from the following table. Savings in reconstruction costs,
which would be necessary if the resurfacing and rehabilitation program were
not undertaken, have not been quantified but would be substantial.

4.08      On the basis of traffic counts carried out by Government and con-
sultants in 1978, annual average daily traffic on the present paved road from
Antananarivo to Mahajanga is 160, of which one-third are cars, one-third heavy
vehicles and the remainder distributed between buses and light commercial
vehicles. On the Antananrivo-Fianarantsoa road section, traffic is currently
250 vpd, with about one-half cars and light vehicles and one-half heavy
traffic. The analysis assumes that traffic will grow at only 3% p.a. over the
life of the improvement, in line with the observed increase in the vehicle
fleet (para 2.03). The economic analysis indicates that the rehabilitation
and resurfacing of the two road sections would yield rates of return in excess
of 100%. Cost and benefit streams for this component are as follows:

Economic Rate of Return: 170%
Regravelling Component
4.09      This component includes the creation of one regravelling training
brigade in each of two regional districts. Since the specific roads to be
regravelled will only be selected during project implementation (para 3.12),
the economic evaluation is based on average road conditions and traffic
counts. The analysis compares the "with project" situation, in which about
100 km of gravel roads are regravelled annually by each brigade during a 2-year
period, with the "without project" case, with the roads receiving no more than
a minimal level of recurrent maintenance. All costs and benefits are net of
taxes and subsidies, and are in constant May 1979 prices.



- 39 -
4.10      The costs of the road regravelling component are calculated to
include the cost of labor, equipment, materials, fuel, spare parts and the
technical assistance used in implementation. Also included are the incre-
mental recurrent maintenance costs required to maintain the roads in proper
condition if all of the benefits from the regravelling are to be realized.
4.11      The quantified benefits of the road regravelling component consist
of savings in vehicle operating costs based on the estimates presented in
para 4.07. All roads to be regravelled are taken to be in poor condition
at present and will be raised to good gravel standard under the proposed
project. The lifetime of the regravelled surface is taken as five years,
considering the presently estimated average traffic volumes of about 60 vpd.
Traffic growth is assumed at 3% p.a. On the basis of traffic counts in 1978,
traffic composition co.nsists of one-third cars, one-third heavy vehicles
and one-third light commercial vehicles and buses. Economic analysis of
this component indicates an economic rate of return of 37% and a benefit/cost
ratio of 1.49:1, assuming a 12% cost of capital. During project execution,
individual road sections selected for regravelling will be subject to an
economic evaluation to determine their acceptability. At that time, the
analysis will be based on actual costs and traffic volumes for each road
section. The analysis will be carried out by Government based on semi-annual
traffic counts and reviewed by the Association. The method of economic
evaluation of roads to be regravelled and the acceptability for IDA-financing
of roads having rates of return of at least 12% were agreed with Government
(para 5.01(q)). Cost and benefit streams are as follows:

Road Maintenance Components
4.12      No rate of return calculation has been attempted for project com-
ponents intended to improve maintenance operations, but historically these
have tended to result in relatively high rates of return. The road mainte-
nance components primarily involve the establishment of an improved main-
tenance capacity without being directly linked to any measurable output or

defined program. However, they will undoubtedly result in improved work
organization, increased efficiency in operating and maintaining equipment, and
better road maintenance procedures. Overall, these maintenance elements are
expected to result in reduced vehicle operating costs and increased efficiency
of the road transport industry; these benefits will accrue to the economy as a
whole and will be passed on to different segments of the population in varying
degrees. Reduced vehicle operating costs will directly benefit the owners of
private cars and commercial vehicles, and since transport prices are deter-
mined in a competitive framework, part of this benefit should be passed on to
producers and consumers. There will also be Government savings in future road
rehabilitation costs.
Road Improvement and Bridge Construction
4.13      For the construction of bridges and their approaches on the
Antsohihy-Ambanja road, the costs are calculated to include both physical and
price contingencies as well as the cost of supervision. In addition, the
economic evaluation takes into consideration the estimated cost of work to be
performed by Government to ensure year-round use of the entire road length
(165 km). The quantified benefits of the project component consist of savings
in vehicle operating costs based on the estimates presented in para 4.07. The
existing road is an earth road in poor condition with many of its low lying
areas and existing bridges flooded during the rainy season. The analysis
compares the "with project" situation, in which 20 bridges will be constructed
and the road improved to a good earth standard with the "without project"
case, where the existing road is only open for about five or six months of the
year and receives no more than a minimal level of recurrent maintenance. All
costs and benefits are net of taxes and subsidies, and are in constant May
1979 prices.
4.14      The lifetime of the bridges and road improvement is taken as 20
years. Traffic on the existing road is currently 57 vpd. In addition to
existing traffic, the analysis assumes that construction of the bridges and
road improvements will generate new traffic as well as divert a certain per-
centage of traffic from coastal shipping and air transport to the road. For
the purpose of this analysis only the existing and generated traffic have
been quantified. Generated traffic is calculated on the basis of one-half
of the traffic on the road sections leading from both ends of the Antsohihy-
Ambanja road. The analysis assumes that these benefits will be realized
one-third in the first year, one-third in the second year, and the last third
in the third year of the economic life of the road. The economic analysis of
this component indicates a rate of return of 16%. Cost and benefit streams
are as follows:

Overall Project Rate of Return
4.15              The project's major components for which benefits have been quan-
tified include the paved road rehabilitation with rates of return in excess
of 100%, the regravelling component with a rate of return of 37% and the
road improvement and bridge construction on the Antsohihy-Ambanja road for
which the rate of return is 16%. The overall weighted return for the proj-
ect is 61%.



- 42 -
D. Risks
4.16      Rates of return for the rehabilitation and resurfacing program of
paved road sections exceed 100% in both cases. Large increases in costs or
decreases in benefits are unlikely to make this program uneconomic. For the
road regravelling component, where the rate of return is 37%, sensitivity
tests reveal that a 50% increase in costs or a 25% decrease in benefits would
both yield an 18% rate of return. For the bridge construction and road
improvements on the Antsohihy-Ambanja road, sensitivity tests indicate that a
20% increase in costs or 20% decrease in benefits will yield a 13% rate of
return.  Since generated traffic contributes a major part of the benefits
accruing from the bridge construction and road improvement, sensitivity tests
have been carried out which reveal that a 35% decrease in generated traffic
would still allow a 12% rate of return for this component.
4.17      The successful implementation of the rehabilitation and regravelling
components could be jeopardized by (a) the failure of Government to release on
a timely basis adequate maintenance funds to the regional district offices;
(b) interference of the regional political authorities in the implementation
of an established maintenance program; and (c) Government slowness in timely
recruitment and nomination of consultants. These problems, which could
prolong project implementation and thereby increase costs and postpone benefits,
were discussed with Government and measures to minimize these risks have been
agreed (para 5.01(b), (c), (f) and (j)).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Agreement was reached with Government on the following:
(a) a road maintenance training-program for MTP staff will be
prepared and carried out; for this purpose, consultants
will be employed by January 1, 1980, with qualifications,
experience, and terms and conditions of employment satis-
factory to the Association; the Association will be
consulted on Government's decisions relative to the
training program to be executed; and construction
of such training facilities as shall be required to
carry out the training program will start by January 1,
1980 (para 2.13);
(b) at least FMG 3,960 million (US$18 million equivalent)
will be allocated for operating expenditures in the 1980
budget; Government will allocate at least FMG 1,100
million (US$5 million equivalent) for equipment renewal
in the 1980 budget and make its best efforts to obtain
external financing for an additional FMG 1,100 million
for the same purpose; and after 1980 and until the
completion of the project, Government and the Association



- 43 -
will from time to time discuss the appropriateness of
budgetary allocations for road maintenance in the light
of inflation and the scope of required maintenance
operations (para 2.17);
(c) annual budgetary allocations for road maintenance will
be made available to the regional district offices
promptly as needed for uninterrupted operations (para
2.18);
(d) Government will ensure that adequate amounts of bitumen
will be made available as and when required over the
project period for the rehabilitation and maintenance
of its roads (para 3.06);
(e) the improvement by Government of the Antsohihy -
Ambanja road to allow year-round serviceability will be
completed by the time bridge construction on the road
is finished (para 3.08);
(f) a central administrative unit for road maintenance will
be established within MTP and headed by a qualified and
experienced engineer by January 1, 1980, and will be
provided with adequate supporting staff (para 3.09);
(g) the improvement of road maintenance in the two regional
districts of Mahajanga and Toliara (para 3.10);
(h) following definition by consultants of maintenance require-
ments, Government and the Association will agree upon a
list of roads to be regravelled under the 2-year regravelling
program (1980-82) as well as staffing needs, the number and
type of equipment to be financed under the project, and the
timing of equipment procurement (para 3.12);
(i) if more labor-intensive work methods are economically viable
for maintenance operations, consultants will define a 2-year
demonstration program, and Government and the Association
will discuss and agree on specific works to be carried out,
equipment to be procured under the project, and the staff
required for the demonstration program (para 3.14);
(j) the scope and timing of consultant services for technical
assistance (para 3.18);
(k) all consultants financed under the project will be employed
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
(para 3.18);
(1)  the number and types of fellowships required to train local
staff will be defined by consultants and thereafter will be
agreed by Government and the Association (para 3.19);



- 44 -
(m)  the length, location and construction standards of road
sections to be resurfaced and rehabilitated under the project
will be agreed by Government and the Association following
completion of the consultant's study; the execution of works by
contractor following ICB; and the supervision of construction
by consultants selected by Government on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (para 3.23);
(n)  construction of bridges for the Antsohihy-Ambanja road
will be divided into three lots, the scope of each lot
to be defined by Government and satisfactory to the
Association; bid award following ICB; and supervision
of construction by consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (para 3.24);
(o)  contracts for single units of equipment and groups
of equipment, materials and supplies costing less than
US$50,000 will be awarded on the basis of quotations
from suppliers, the total amount of these items not to
exceed US$500,000 (para 3.29);
(p)  an implementation schedule, a progress reporting system and
the preparation of a project completion report within
six months of the Closing Date (para 3.30); and
(q)  the method of economic evaluation of roads to be regravelled
and the acceptability for IDA-financing of roads having rates
of return of at least 12% (para 4.11).
5.02      Employment of consultants by January 1, 1980 to prepare and carry
out the road maintenance training program, and start of construction of the
required training facilities at CATP by January 1, 1980, will be conditions of
.Credit disbursement for all project components except that referred to in
para 3.04(a) above (para 2.13).
5.03      With the agreements and conditions outlined above, the project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$24.0 million on standard terms to the Republic
of Madagascar and an EEC Special Action Credit of about US$10.0 million.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project Reporting Requirements
A. Project Progress Reports
1.        The borrower will prepare Progress Reports that should be submitted
semi-annually in triplicate, no later than one calendar month after the end
of each six-month period. The first report should cover the half-year period
ending June 30, 1980.
2.        The information that Progress Reports should contain is described
below:
(a) General information: this should include the following:
(i)  the physical progress accomplished during the reporting
period;
(ii) actual or expected deviations from the project imple-
mentation schedule;
(iii) actual or expected difficulties or delays and their effects
on the implementation schedule, and the steps planned or
taken to overcome the difficulties and avoid further delay;
(iv) expected changes in the completion data of the project;
(v) key personnel changes in the staff of the administration,
consultants or contractor;
(vi) matters which may affect the cost of the project; and
(vii) any development activity likely to affect the economic
viability of project components.
(b)  A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
scheduled should show the progress in each project component.



- 46 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
(c) A financial statement should be set out in the tabular form
and indicate for each project component:
(i) original estimated cost;
(ii) revised cost, if appropriate;
(iii)  actual expenditure;
(iv) projected expenditure; and
(v) actual and projected withdrawals from the Credit Account.
(d) Finally, Progress Reports should state the status of action on
each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
3.        Progress Reports will be an important input in the preparation of
the Project Completion Report.
B.   Project Completion Report
4.        The borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to be
submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Closing
Date.
5.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation
by the borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a) the performance by the borrower and the Association of their
respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether
the Association could have been more helpful;
(b) the results that can be expected from the project, as compared
with expectations at appraisal, and whether the original ex-
pectations were realistic; and
(c) whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could
have been done better.
6.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return
was estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculations should
be as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a
minor portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex
with the relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.

Credit application
Feasibility studies, preappraisal report, project brief
Appraisal report
Credit Agreement documents, supplementary letters, etc.
Supervision Reports
Semi-annual Progress Reports
Project Correspondence Files
Miscellaneous evaluation reports
8.        The Highway Division, Eastern Africa Projects Departments, will
review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs Department.
After approval by the Highway Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the Bank
Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responsible for con-
ducting an audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exercise. This audit
can lead to suggestions for changes or additions in the PCR as OED prepares
the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for submission to the Bank
Group's Board of Directors. Before going to the Board, the draft PPAR, which
includes the PCR, is sent to various Bank Group divisions, to the Government,
and occasionally to consultants.
