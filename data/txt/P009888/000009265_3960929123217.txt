MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE ETECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR A POWER UTILITIES EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
India is submitted for approval. The loan would be for US$265 million
equivalent and would have a term of 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The loan will be used to
finance the Power Utilities Efficiency Improvement Project. The United States
Agency for Intprnational Development (USAID) will provide US$14 million to
firance technical assistance and training. The Government of India (GOI) will
onlend the proceeds of the proposed loan to the Power Finance Corporation
(PFC), with repayment over 15 years, including three years grace, at an
interest rate of not less than 11.5Z per annum, with GOI assuming the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks. PFC will make loans to its clients at an
interest rate which is now set at 12.5Z and which will be revised from time to
time to ensure that it reflects PFC's cost of borrowing and allows PFC to earn
a return on its equity that is positive in real terms. Repayment terms range
from three to seven years, according to the type of assets financed.
2.        India's power systems have an installed capacity of over 62,700 MW,
a size comparable with that of France and of the United Kingdom. In FY90,
India generated about 245,000 GWh -- about 70I from coal stations, 25Z from
hydro stations, and 5Z from gas, oil and nuclear. Despite impressive progress
in expanding supply, power shortages persist equivalent to about 22Z of peak
capacity and 9Z of total energy requirement. With per capita level of
electricity consumption still among the lowest in the world (about 270 kWh per
year), demand in India will continue to expand at a rapid rate, and an average
growth rate of 8% per annum is expected over the next five years. To meet
this growth, massive investments in additional plant capacity will be required
together with far reaching energy conservation measures. The strain on power
systems supply is exacerbated by the relatively inefficient and wasteful
utilization of energy in the country due to technological as well as energy
price inefficiencies.
3.        In the face of the current budgetary constraints,  central
government funding of the sector's investment program is likely to decline and
the state and central government-owned utilities will have to increasingly
rely on their own internal resources to finance power systems expansion.
However, their ability to contribute internal resources toward capacity
investments is hampered by their poor financial conditions. The sector's
financial distress primarily stems from the operational and financial
inefficiencies of the State-owned utilities -- the State Electricity Boards
(SEBs) and the State Generation Companies (SGCs). A large part of the SEBs'
financial losses is attributable to the relatively low retail tariffs which on
the average have remained at about 502 of the long run marginal costs (LRMC)
of supply. At the same time there are wide tariff differentials among
consumer groups with industrial tariffs close to, and in some cases even above
the LRMC, while agricultural tariffs are less than 10% of their supply costs.
The large financial burden imposed by agriculture on the power system is
increasing as agriculture's share in total consumption has grown. from about
17? in FY82 to 22? in FY90. A similar situation applies to residential uses
of electricity. The heavy financial losses of the SEBs are reflected in
negative internal cash generation equivalent to US$4.1 billion over the FY86-
90 period. This poor performance is adversely affecting the finances of the
centrally-owned utilities and is hindering efforts at attracting private



- 2 -
investors to the sector. A turn-around in the sector's finances would require
bold actions on tariff, billing and collection, together with conservation
measures such as plant efficiency improvements, reductions of transmission and
distribution losses, load management and promotion of end-use efficiency. To
effect these reforms, GOI is attempting to attach conditionality to its
discretionary financing of the states power sector. The creation of PFC in
1986 is an element of this strategy.
4.        PFC would link its financing of the SEBs' priority investments to
tangible improvements in the utilities' operations. It would support
efficiency improvements in existing plant operations, expansion and upgrading
of transmission and distributiorn facilities as well as mitigating measures for
controlling plant emissions. While helping finance the gap in electricity
demand and supply, PFC, through its loan conditionalities, will attempt to
instill financial discipline among the SEBs, thereby strengthening their
financial base and their capacity to contribute to the sector's investment
requirements.
5.        Lessons from Previous Bank Operations.  Performance audits
conducted for the Second Power Transmission Project (Cr. 242-IN) and the First
and Second Rural Electrification projects (Crs. 572-IN and 911-IN) highlighted
the difficulties of effecting institutional improvements in the absence of
clear division of responsibilities between the central entity and the SEBs,
and without agreed mechanisms for project cost recovery. Project completion
reports show that the Third and Fourth Transmission pro'ects (Crs. 377-IN and
604-IN) experienced similar difficulties; despite some progress, in general,
SEBs did not respond to GOI's initiatives. The lessons learned from these
projects had an important bearing in the design of the proposed project.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since PFC is envisioned to become
a key instrument in improving the performance of the power sector, GOI
considered it important to have, from the initial stages of PFC's formation,
support from the Bank in the shaping of the entity's policies and procedures.
The Bank has been able to work closely with GOI and PFC in this area, and
expects to continue doing so. In line with its operational policies, PFC will
lend only to utilities which have undertaken to implement Organizational and
Financial Action Plans (OFAPs), endorsed by their respective states, aimed at
improving the utilities' resource mobilization and operational efficiency.
These OFAPs typically include elements such as: (a) actions, including tariff
adjustments, to allow the utilities to reach, in a period of no more than
three years, the minimum 3Z rate of return, after interest, on historically
valued assets, as required by the Electricity Act; (b) until tariffs allow the
minimum return target to be reached, the states should commit to pay cash
subsidies to the utilities in the amount needed for the utilities to earn the
minimum 32 rate of return; (c) specific plans to reduce the utilities'
receivables; and (d) introduction of clauses in the utilities' tariff to allow
them to recover automatically, from their consumers, any increase in the cost
of both fuel and purchased power. The project thus enhances the Bank's
lending strategy for the sector, which supports development of private
utilities as well as central sector and state utilities that demonstrate
serious interest in improving their operational performance and finances.
7.        Lending through PFC also offers the advantage of allowing the Bank
to expand its impact on the sector by having access to most SEBslSGCs in the
country, as opposed to direct lending, which has to be restricted to selected
SEBs/SGCs. Moreover, because PFC will be having frequent and regular



operations with most SEBs/SGCs, it will enjoy the advantage of a closer and
more active relationship with them, providing a better potential for enfor2ing
lending conditionality.
8.        Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to: (a)
support GOI efforts to make PFC a viable and effective instrument for
effecting improvements in the power sector; (b) strengthen the operations of
the beneficiary SEBs by lending only to those who are willing to undertake
acceptable reform programs; (c) foster better use of existing power facilities
by reducing constraints in the transmission and distribution systems; (d)
mitigate the adverse envirormental impact of thermal plants in operation by
providing adequate anti-pollution and monitoring facilities; and (e) improve
the preparation of power projects and promote the development of the local
consulting industry by funding preinvestment studies and engineering for power
projects.
9.        Project Description.  The proposed project comprises: (a) a program
to strengthen PFC's capabilities to discharge its responsibilities; (b) the
creation of a preinvestment fund in PFC; and (c) five components to be
financed through PFC: (i) the implementation of a pre-identified segment of
the lending program of PFC with four SEBs (Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya
Pradesh and Gujarat); (ii) environmental upgrading of power plants; (iii)
engineering studies for systems renovation; (iv) institutional strengthening
of power utilities; and (v) improvements in SEBs' billing and collection.
10.       The project will be carried out in five and a half years and will
have a total cost of US$712 million equivdlent, with a foreign component of
US$242 million. Schedule A presents the cost estimates and the financing plan
for the project. Schedule B presents the arrangements for procurement and
disbursement. A timetable of key project processing events is presented in
Schedule C and Schedule D gives the status of Bank Group operations in India.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 8943-IN, dated January 3, 1992, is being
distributed separately.
11.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, PFC agreed: (a) to implement
its Operational Policy Statement, which statec PFC's lending criteria and
guides the Corporation in its operations and finances, and not to modify it in
a material manner without prior consultation with the Bank; and (b) that its
funds will not be pre-allocated but will be lent following criteria agreed
with the Bank. PFC also agreed to take actions to ensure that in its projects
satisfactory environmental standards are met.
12.       Environmental and Resettlement Aspects.  The project does not
present any environmental issues of significance or call for major dislocation
of population. It contemplates environmental actions in three aspects: (a) it
includes direct investments for about US$90 million to reduce pollution levels
and environmental degradation around a large number of power plants; (b) it
also includes studies for systems renovation comprising studies for upgrading
of power stations including an assessment of their environmental condition to
determine the mitigatory actions required; and (c) the transmission and
distribution sub-projects under the project will be subject to environmental
assessments when needed and will include the required mitigatory actions to
protect the environment. Participating SEBs will be asked, as a condition of
obtaining financing for a particular sub-project, to meet acceptable
environmental and social impact standards.

13.       Project Benefits.  The main benefits of the project are:
(a) improvements in the operational efficiency of the state utilities;
(b) improvements in the finances of the state utilities through reduction in
losses and better billing and collections; (c) improvements in the
environmental operating conditicns of participating utilities; (d) improved
quality of service; and (e) better use of existing plant facilities. Projects
eligible for PFC funding are required to have an economic rate of return of at
!east 12%; the economic rates of return of projects already approved, and
which represent about 50X of all investments envisaged, range from 142 to over
100 .
14.       It is envisioned that with the implementation of the action plans
mutually agreed to between PFC and the SEBs to help mitigate financial
shortfalls in the SEBs' operations, the financial returns on the proposed
investments would correspondingly improve.
15.       Risks.  The proposed project does not pose extraordinary technical
risks because the type of physical works involved is routinely implemented by
utilities in India. There are, however, risks related to the institutional,
managerial, and financial aspects of the project. On the institutional side,
there is a risk that the participating SEBs will not meet the expected
improvements set out in the action plans or that the pace of reform will be
slower than planned. This risk will be minimized by establishing realistic
actions and targets in the plans, and by providing financial and technical
resources to the SEBs to facilitate their implementation. To minimize the
risk of delays caused by slow procurement decisions and administrative
processing, at negotiations GOI provided the Bank with the details of the
procedures to be followed to expedite and simplify clearances of procurement
actions and releases of foreign exchange for Bank-financed procurement. There
are two risks related to PFC's performance. The first is that PFC could face
collection problems because of the poor financial performance of its
customers. This risk would be kept at an acceptably low level by PFC
requiring, as a condition of lending to any SEB or SGC, that they establish a
set of suitable guarantees, previously agreed with the Bank. The second risk
is that PFC might fail to become an effective promoter of institutional
improvements at the SEB/SGC level. This could occur if PFC does not have the
institutional resolve -- and GOI's support -- to attach adequate
conditionality to its lending operations. This also may occur if political
pressures prevent PFC from enforcing said conditionality or its OPS. To
manage this eventuality, agreements were reached to ensure that PFC's policies
and procedures are consistent with its developmental objectives.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
