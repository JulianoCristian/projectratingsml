instrument for improving the power sector; (b) strengthen\n            the operations of the beneficiary utilities by lending only\n            to those willing to undertake acceptable reform programs;\n            (c) foster better use of existing power facilities by\n            reducing constraints in the transmission and distribution\n            systems; (d) mitigate the adverse environmental impact of\n            thermal plants in operation by providing adequate\n            anti-pollution and monitoring facilities; and (e) improve\n            the preparation of power projects and promote the\n            development of the local consulting industry by funding\n            preinvestment studies and engineering for power projects.\n            The project comprises:  (a) a program to strengthen\n            PFC's capabilities to discharge its responsibilities;\n            (b) the creation of a preinvestment fund in PFC; and (c)\n            five components to be financed through PFC: (i) the\n            implementation of a pre-identified segment of the lending\n            program of PFC; (ii) environmental upgrading of power\n            plants; (iii) engineering studies for system renovation;\n            (iv) institutional strengthening of power utilities; and (v)\n            improvements in SEBs' billing and collection."}, "docdt":
