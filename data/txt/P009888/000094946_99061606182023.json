is mixed.\n            Implementation of investment and technical assistance\n            activities proceeded in a satisfactory manner, albeit\n            subject to delays. The power finance corporation's\n            business grew and its financial base strengthened. However,\n            financial and operating performance of state electricity\n            boards remained unsatisfactory despite the operational and\n            financial action plan agreements. These are some of the\n            learned from this project: The development outcome of Bank\n            assistance to India's state power sector will likely be\n            unsatisfactory unless sectoral issues on regulation, tariff\n            and financial reform, and managerial autonomy are addressed\n            through a full restructuring of the sector. Project\n            development objectives should be realistic, not wide-ranging\n            nor addressed to many sector issues. For complex projects,\n            compliance with sub-loan conditions should b sought up-front\n            at time of sub-loan approval. Acceptance of revenue\n            subsidies in lieu of tariff adjustments greatly hindered\n            tariff reform and weakened the utilities' resolve to\n            become financially sound and independent. Future Bank\n            lending to PFC should be extended only if the beneficiaries\n            adopt a reform agenda that the Bank would have otherwise\n            required under its current direct lending operations with\n            reforming state powers. The financial rate of return of the\n            sub-projects should be a primary sub-loan eligibility\n            criterion to ensure that financial revenues cover costs.\n            Project components should have been trimmed down."}, "docdt": "1999-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
