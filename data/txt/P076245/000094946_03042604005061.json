strengthening governance and transparency in the\n            management of mineral resources, placing particular emphasis\n            on small-scale and artisanal mining. These objectives will\n            be achieved through the project components, as follows.\n            First, reforms in the mining sector's legal, and\n            regulatory framework will be implemented, followed by\n            support to the establishment of mining administration\n            offices - close to exploitation sites, and establishment of\n            a certification program for gemstones, with the aim to\n            create a one-stop shop for gemstone exports, and exchange,\n            with a specific focus on strengthening private sector\n            associations. Second, institutional reforms for the\n            decentralized management of mineral resources will be\n            supported, as will communal efforts in extending access to\n            cadastre information at the municipal level, streamlining\n            tax collection, and the operations of the Directorate of\n            Mines and Geology. An important aspect will be the training\n            program, aimed at raising human resource capacity in the\n            sector. Third, the Mining Sector Promotion Agency will be\n            established, and the Geo-scientific Information\n            Infrastructure strengthened through capacity building, to\n            attract and promote private investments in the sector.\n            Certification procedures, administration of a small grants\n            program, and the establishment of geological/geophysical\n            information databases will be coordinated, including the\n            implementation of a geological/geo-chemical mapping to\n            increase availability of mineral resources information.\n            Finally, project management activities shall include project\n            procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements."}, "docdt": "2003-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
