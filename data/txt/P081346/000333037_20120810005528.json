development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: like sewerage service, solid waste\n            management requires adequate operations and revenues to\n            build an effective refuse collection system, and commitment\n            from city managers to set up adequate operation policies, in\n            particular when landfills are far from the city center, thus\n            requiring transfer stations. The Liuzhou Municipal\n            Government (LMG) intended to improve the efficiency of its\n            solid waste management operations by introducing both\n            institutional reforms and cost recovery policies. The\n            project provided Technical Assistance (TA) to Liuzhou\n            Environmental Sanitation Department (ESD) to analyze various\n            institutional options to achieve this objective. Targeting\n            multiple cities with complex components can result in\n            implementation delays, particularly when project management\n            offices (PMOs) and implementing agencies lack staff\n            experience in Bank operations. This project involved only\n            one city and funded a limited number of high priority\n            investments and programs. TA was also provided to the PMO\n            and the project implementing agencies to strengthen their\n            capacity to implement the project."}, "docdt": "2012-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
