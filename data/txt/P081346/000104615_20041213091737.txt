Country and Sector Background 
 
Strong city performance is critical to China’s sustainable growth and economic development.  
China’s cities and towns fuel over 60% of the country’s GDP, and this percentage may rise as the 
urban share of China’s population climbs to over 50% over the next 15 years.  Because China’s 
cities play such major developmental roles, supporting effective city management and services is 
an important part of the country’s poverty reduction strategy and its efforts to realize its Tenth 
Plan vision of a “well-off society.”  Cities in China’s Western region, in particular, are targeted 
for developmental assistance because of their comparatively low income levels and high poverty 
rates.  Major growth related urban environmental problems, such as air and water pollution, are 
also priority areas for development assistance. 
 
Both China’s Tenth Plan (2001-2005) and the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy 
(2002-2007) prioritize urban environmental protection, wastewater treatment and sanitation.  
Adequate sanitation and safe, sustainable water supplies promote a high urban quality of life and 
form a foundation for economic growth.  Many of China’s rivers and water sources, however, are 
polluted with raw or poorly treated industrial and domestic sewage.  Insufficient wastewater 
treatment, weakly enforced wastewater regulations, and inadequate overall managerial capacity 
in administrative agencies impair efforts to curb this pollution.  Further, solid waste and 
sanitation services and infrastructure are also deficient in many cities, threatening basic urban 
sanitation and public health. 
 
Page  2
China has taken steps to address these problems through governmental programs and policies, 
including the central government’s recent issuance of guidelines on reforming China’s 
wastewater and solid waste sectors.  These guidelines encourage utilities to set adequate user 
fees to achieve sufficient cost recovery, including of capital costs, and promote private sector 
investment in utility operations.  These guidelines and other factors, particularly deteriorating 
environmental conditions, have spurred many cities to undertake, with World Bank support, 
investments and institutional development programs in the wastewater and sanitation sectors.  
 
A
local problem 
This project targets wastewater and sanitation deficiencies in Liuzhou, a city in Western China’s 
Guangxi Autonomous Region. Greater Liuzhou has over a thousand industrial enterprises and is 
Guangxi’s largest industrial center. The city’s current population of 1.2 million is expected to 
reach 1.8 million by 2020, straining its already burdened water, sewer, and sanitation 
infrastructure.  The city has plans to improve this infrastructure, capitalizing on the recent 
success of an urban air pollution program.  Sector issues this project would address include: 
 
Protecting water quality 
Liuzhou’s principal water source for industrial, commercial, and residential use is the Liujiang 
River, which winds through the city center and suburbs.  The Liujiang is polluted because 
industries and the city drainage system directly discharge into it significant raw sewage and 
rainwater.  The Liuzhou Municipal Government (LMG) has taken steps to address its water 
pollution problem.  The city set targets that by 2010 at least 70% and by 2020 at least 90% of all 
urban wastewater will be adequately treated, and it recently commissioned a first municipal 
wastewater treatment plant to help achieve these goals.  However, this facility will treat a mere 
15% of total municipal wastewater.  Liuzhou clearly needs more treatment capacity, not only to 
improve its local economy and quality of life, but also to protect environmental and economic 
conditions for towns and agricultural sites downstream. 
 
On the operational side, the city recently decided to establish an autonomous wastewater utility 
company, and is adopting comprehensive industrial wastewater pollution control policies (see 
Attachment 1 of Annex 1) that—among other actions—improve urban planning, enhance water 
demand management, and relocate culpable industries.  The LMG is also preparing a new 
Discharge Permit System that will limit industrial discharges to pre-specified volumes.  To help 
ensure the success of these endeavors, Liuzhou is seeking technical assistance under this project 
to support operations in the new wastewater company and to properly implement industrial 
wastewater pollution control policies and procedures. 
 
Ensuring sanitation 
Municipal sanitation directly and visibly impacts Liuzhou’s neighborhoods and the daily lives of 
its citizens.  Liuzhou now has 249 public toilets, but a 1995 city plan estimates that 417 public 
toilets are needed by 2010.  This shortage is partially attributable to the dismantling of public 
toilets, without plans for replacement, to accommodate road widening and urban construction.  
Many of the remaining public toilets have poor facilities and unsanitary conditions, hindering 
city development and frustrating citizen expectations of public toilet services.  Although 
estimates of the future demand for public toilets should be carefully analyzed since China’s 
urban situation is rapidly changing, it is clear that Liuzhou needs to fill a sizable gap, including 
Page  3
rebuilding and upgrading existing public toilets.  Accordingly, Liuzhou is seeking funding for 
reconstruction and additional public toilet construction, and advice on how to better manage its 
sanitation facilities through private sector involvement. 
 
Managing solid waste: 
Solid Waste Management is also a major issue in Liuzhou.  The city now produces about 1,000 
tons of municipal solid waste per day, and this production is projected to increase to about 1,400 
tons per day (tpd) by 2010, and to 1,900 tpd by 2020.  Because the city’s existing landfill is near 
capacity, the city commissioned a second landfill 22 kilometers from the city center, which will 
receive solid and toxic wastes from greater Liuzhou, including Labao.  The city will also need 
several transfer stations and 42 new waste collection stations, the latter mostly in newly 
developed residential areas.  Additional and more functional vehicles are needed to properly 
collect and convey refuse to this second more distant landfill.  The city intends to improve the 
efficiency of its solid waste operations, and is seeking assistance on these efforts in addition to 
investment financing for transfer facilities and collection stations.  
 
2. Objectives 
 
The project’s development objective is to improve environmental conditions in Liuzhou by 
improving wastewater treatment, industrial pollution control, municipal sanitation and solid 
waste services and management.  This objective will be achieved by:  1) developing autonomous 
public utilities and helping develop their institutional structures, financial systems and 
operational processes; and 2) introducing regulations and reforms of industrial pollution control; 
and 3) investing in sewer networks, wastewater treatment plants, public toilets, solid waste 
transfer station and waste collection stations. 
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
This project is in line with important Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives and 
capitalizes on Bank experiences and comparative advantages.  The project would support two of 
three CAS themes:  (i) facilitate an environmentally sustainable development process (via 
tangible investments in and technical assistance to the wastewater, sanitation and solid waste 
sectors); and (ii) help improve the business environment and facilitate the transition to a market 
economy (by providing basic infrastructure and improving the overall environmental conditions).  
The Bank would also contribute to public sector reform by creating an autonomous and 
financially sustainable wastewater company (the Liuzhou Municipal Wastewater Treatment 
Company, Limited (LMWTC)) and by helping LMG improve the operational efficiency of solid 
waste management and sanitation operations. 
 
The Bank has proven expertise in urban environmental management and infrastructure 
investment in China, including in the Guangxi Urban Environment Project, which targets two 
other municipalities in the province.  The Bank can provide the LMG with expertise and 
experience acquired from these projects and other wastewater and sanitation programs on other 
continents.  The Bank also enjoys a strong comparative advantage in advising on public utility 
sector policies and reforms, including public-private sector partnerships.  These strengths will 
help promote project success.

6. Implementation 
 
A
Leading Group led by the Executive Vice Mayor has been established to supervise project 
preparation and implementation, provide policy guidance and ensure cross-departmental 
coordination.  This group includes representatives from various departments of the LMG (the 
Planning Bureau, Finance Bureau, Environment Protection Bureau, Appearance Bureau’s 
Environmental Sanitation Department, Price Bureau, etc.), the Liujiang District, Liuzhou 
Construction Investment and Development Co. Ltd (ICDC) and LMWTC .  Its technical 
secretariat, the Project Management Office (PMO), located in the Planning Commission, has also 
been established to execute daily project activities and provide daily supervision and project 
coordination.  The PMO, led by the Deputy Director of the Planning Commission, will consist of 
the Financial Management Expert, the Procurement Expert, the Social and Resettlement Expert 
and the Project Management Expert. 
 
This project’s lead implementing agency will be a financially and legally autonomous 
wastewater treatment company (the Liuzhou Municipal Wastewater Treatment Company 
Limited/LMWTC) fully owned by the Liuzhou Municipal Government (LMG).  The project’s 
construction management will be contracted to the Liuzhou Construction Investment and 
Development Co. Ltd (ICDC), an experienced infrastructure investment company fully owned 
by LMG.  The ICDC will be supported by the International Tender Company, the Tender Center 
and the Construction Supervising Company. 
Page  6
Liuzhou’s Environmental Sanitation Department (ESD) will be responsible for the 
implementation of the municipal sanitation (Public Toilet) and the solid waste management 
components (transfer station and waste collection stations).  Liuzhou’s Environmental Protection 
Bureau (EPB) will be the implementing agency for the industrial pollution control, with the 
support of the PMO for bid preparation evaluation and contract preparation and submission of 
payment requests. 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
The project is intended to achieve sustainability by strengthening the institutional capacity of 
each project implementing agency:  the LMWTC, ESD and EPB.  The project will help LMWTC 
and ESD improve their financial and operation policies to enhance cost recovery and operational 
efficiency and to reduce operation costs.   To achieve the project development objective of 
improved environmental conditions, the LMG will adopt a comprehensive policy on industrial 
wastewater pollution control (see Attachment 1 of Annex 1).  This policy includes urban 
development planning, regulatory control and demand side management via price incentives for 
polluters.  This comprehensive policy will complement the project’s physical investments and its 
institutional development program, and will help make the project outcome sustainable.  
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
A
World Bank report entitled 
Review of the Bank’s Assistance to the Urban Water Supply and 
Wastewater Sector
 (no. 24979) gives an overview of Bank assistance to China and compiles 
lessons from various projects.  Key lessons noted in this report and other wastewater projects are 
presented below along with explanations on how these lessons are incorporated into LZEMP: 
 
(i) 
Demand management is much less expensive than and should always precede 
supply increases and investments in wastewater treatment
.
Demand management 
was a central topic of discussion throughout project preparation and water recycling 
and other strategies related to demand management are a part of the project’s 
technical assistance to the EPB and LMWTC.    
(ii) 
Financially, legally, and institutionally autonomous utilities can best maximize 
performance and efficiency
.
LMWTC is becoming legally and financially 
autonomous in sewerage operations vis-à-vis the Liuzhou Municipal Government, 
and plans are in motion to maximize its efficiency.  Similarly, the project will help 
the LMG establish a separate operation for municipal solid waste management to 
ensure operational efficiency and management accountability. 
(iii) 
Like sewerage service, solid waste management requires adequate operations and 
revenues for an effective refuse collection system, and a commitment from city 
managers to set up adequate operating policies, in particular when landfill 
operations are far from the city center and need transfer stations. 
 This was 
brought up during early project preparation. This issues will be addressed through 
the institutional development component 
(iv) 
As learned in the Guangxi Urban Environment Project, projects that target 
multiple cities with multiple complex components can engender preparation 
Page  7
and/or implementation delays, particularly when the PMO and the implementing 
agencies lack adequate experienced staff
.
This project targets only one city and its 
components are well focused on a limited numbers of high priority investments and 
programs.  TA will be provided to the PMO and the project implementing agencies 
to strengthen their implementation capacity.
