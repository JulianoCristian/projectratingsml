 2.      Project implementation is satisfactory with only six of a total of 51 contracts still under
 construction. The PDO remains relevant and achievable by the current closing date. The total
 project costs have increased from US$205.6 million to US$216.13 million due to substantial
 depreciation of US dollars against RMB, as the exchange rate is reduced from 8.2868 at
 appraisal to 6.6275 at end of 2010.

 3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to fully fund the remaining ongoing works after
 recent price escalations increased contract costs.

 4.     In order to ensure that the Project Management Unit and Project Implementing Units
 have sufficient time to submit final withdrawal applications after the Loan closing date, a four
 month grace period, through October 31, 2011, is added.
