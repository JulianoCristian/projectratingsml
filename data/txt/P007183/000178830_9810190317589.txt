INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECOISTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIvWENDATION OF THE PRESIDET
TO THE EXBCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMIALA
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMINT PROJECT
1.        I subrnit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$4..0 million to
the Republic of Guatemala.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project would be the Bank Group's first agricul-
tural operation in Guatemala. It is based on the "Beef Cattle Program
for the South Coast" prepared by the staff of the Bank of Guatemala.
The project was prepared with the help of a FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
mission that visited the country in March 1969 and was appraised by
subsequent Bank missions in October-November 1969 and January 1970.
Because of national elections and a review of economic priorities by
the new Government which took office in July 1970, negotiations on the
proposed project were delayed until after economic policy discussions
had taken place between the Bank and the new administration. Negotia-
tions took place in 'Washington from November 24 through 27, 1970. The
Borrowter was represented by Messrs. Mario Martinez, Vice-Iiinister of
Agriculture, Julio Lorenzo, Deputy Manager of Bank of Guatemala, and
Federico Fahsen and Arturo Padilla from the National Planning Council.
3.        The proposed loan, the fifth to Guatemala, would increase the
Bank's total lending from US$46.5 million to US$50.5 million. The
following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Guatemala as of
Novexrber 30, 1970.

4.        Disbursements under the Second Power Loan (5h5-GU) made a
slow start because of flooding caused by heavy rains in late 1969, which
made it necessary to shift the site of the two existing gas turbines and
the new thermal plant.  The Education Project, which was signed in Dec-
ember 1968, is approximately one year behind schedule, and no funds have
been disbursed to date. A series of difficulties has arisen over this
project, in part because of the change of government, and the prepara-
tion of the IMiaster Plan and of an anpropriate curriculum for the second-
ary schools has been delayed.  A Bank mission visited Guatemala in
September 1970 and agreed on s-teps to be taken to speed up implementa-
tion of the project. Construction is now scheduled to start during the
first quarter of 1971.
5.        In December 1969 the IFC approved an irvestment of up to US$0.9
million to finance construction and operation of a hotel in Guatemala
City. However, the investment contract has not yet been signed, pending,
among other issues, a decision by the Government on whether to give the
project the benefits of the Tourist Incentives Law and agreement among the
participants on various legal and financial miatters. IFC is also discus-
sing with the Guatemalan Government and private sponsors possibilities
for its participation in the financing of a large nickel project (EXI'1IBAL)
which has been under consideration for several years.
6.        A number of projects are being prepared for consideration by
the Bank, including projects in telecommunications, highways and power.
The telecommunication project should be ready for presentation to the
Executive Directors before the end of the current fiscal year.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:              Republic of Guatemala.






-3-
Amount:             US$4.0 million.
Purpose:            To provide financial and technical
assistance to about 300 beef breeding
and fattening ranches to increase
production through efficient modern
techniques.
Amortization:       In 16 years including a five-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
beginning June 15, 1976 and ending
December 15, 1986.
Interest Rate:      7¼> percent per annum.
Conmitment Charge:  3/4 of one percent
Relending Terms:    Sub-loans to cattle producers in local
currency for 12 years, including a four-
year period of grace, at an interest rate
of 9 percent per annum. The final cost
to cattle producers, including interest
rate and additional charges and fees,would
not exceed 10 percent per annum. Sub-
loans to any one producer exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent would carry an extra
charge of 2 percent per annum for ser-
vices rendered by the Technical Service
Unit.
Estimated Economic
Return:,            20 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.           Pn appraisal report entitled "Livestock Development Project -
Guatemala" (PA-39) is attached.
9.          Guatemala's economic development depends heavily on agriculture,
which accounts for approximately 30 percent of GNP, generates 80 percent
of exports and employs 65 percent of the labor force. Assistance for the
development of traditional agriculture is principally being provided under
a sizeable rural development program financed by a USAID loan of
US$23 million, designed to raise incomes and living standards of the
small farmer of the highlands. The Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) has also been active in providing credit for livestock farmers
through three lines of credit totalling US$6.0 millions which, however,
do not provide for any substantial technical assistance.






- 4 -
10.       Livestock represents about one-fifth of total agricultural pro-
duction, but its growth has been lagging behind other branches in the
sector. Beef production has virtually stagnated during the past decade,
but exports have been maintained because of increasing imports of feeder
steers and reductions in local meat consumption. There is suitable land,
but the great potential for cattle raising has not been developed mainly
because of lack of efficient management and scarcity of long-term capital.
11.       The proposed project has been given hi-;h priority within the
recently adopted Five-Year Development Plan (1971-75). Its estimated
cost , including incremental working capital, is US$7.8 million. The
proposed Bank loan of US$4.0 million would finance about 52 percent of
project costs, including the foreign exchange component of on-ranch
investments and of technical services as well as about $1.4 million of
local expenditures for on-ranch investments.  I consider that the financ-
ing of this proportion of project costs, with the consequent financing
of some local expenditures, would be fully justified in view of the high
economic return on this project and its strategic role in the diversifi-
cation of the Guatemalan economy.
12.       Project funds would be channelled to cattle producers by the
participating credit institutions which will include a number of private
banks, and in due course a government agricultural bank, which is at
present being established. These institutions will extend their loans
to the farmers for a term of 12 years, including a 4-year grace period,
at a 9 percent interest rate. IMiscellaneous charges wfill add an esti-
mated 0.5 to 1 percent to the final cost of the loans to the farmers.
The participating credit institutions will rediscount 100 percent of
their loans at a 7 percent rate at a Livestock Development Fund to be
set up in the Bank of Guatemala.
13.       Technical services to participating cattle producers would be
provided by a Technical Service Unit, which would be established in the
Ministry of Agriculture. The Technical Service Unit would be headed by
an experienced Project Director, who would have the technical responsi-
bility for the project and would be responsible directly to the Vice-
NAinister of Agriculture. A Project Commission, at ministerial level,
would coordinate project activities.
14.       While the beneficiaries of the project would be commercially
viable farms, typically of about 300 hectares, it is provided that sub-
loans to any one farmer exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would carry a
surcharge of 2 percent. This would probably result in excluding from
the project most of the very large farmers, who reportedly have access
to other sources of funds and technical assistance and would not be in-
terested in sub-loans below US$50,000 equivalent.
15.       The economic rate of return of the proposed project is esti-
mated at 20 percent. Apart from a substantial increase in beef produc-
tion, other quantifiable benefits would be larger public revenues in the
form of sales and income taxes. Of much greater significance would be the






non-quantifiable benefits arising frorn the introduction of improved
livestock production techniques and the training of local technical
staff in skills new to Guatemala. These techniques should play an
important catalytic role in stimulating increases in production, and
in sustaining such increases well beyond the life of the project.
16.       Goods required for the proposed project would be procured
through existing commercial channels. There are several competitive
retail outlets for both local and imported goods.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUkIENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic
of Guatemala containing the covenants normally included in agreements
for agricultural credits, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Guatemala" (CA-3a) dated December 17, 1970 is being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors and a basic data sheet is attached
to this report. The economic report concludes that present high prices
in Guatemala's major export product, coffee, provide a good opportunity
to attack the country's deep-seated development problems. Although the
country has a rather varied and abundant natural resource base, past
economic growth has been slow and irregular, long periods of stagna-
tion being interrupted by brief export-led booms, the benefits of which
were not widely shared. The Government of President Arana, which took
office in mid-1970, has recognized that it will have to play a much
more active role in the development process, mainly through a long over-
due increase in development expenditures, in order to broaden the coun-
try's economic and social base by integrating the large subsistence
sector into the market economy and diversifying the narrow export struc-
ture. One of its first acts was to approve a five-year development
program prepared by the previous administration. This program, which
places major emphasis on agricultural diversification and improvements
in health and education, is generally well designed to serve Guatemala's
needs. However, its success will depend on how vigorously the Govern-
ment acts to improve institutional arrangements and to mobilize a sub-
stantially higher level of domestic savings. If its initial actions
along these lines are followed through, Guatemala's development prospects
are promising and merit substantial external support.
19.       The US$250 million external borrowing contemplated in the five-
year investment program for 1971-76 is broadly consistent with the present
lending programs of major external lenders. If the program is carried out
with financing of this type, Guatemala's external debt service ratio is
expected to decrease from 8 percent in 1970 to 5 percent in 1976. Under






- 6 -
these circumstances, Guatemala can be considered creditworthy for the
external borrowing contemplated.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREaENlT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOM'IE9DATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
