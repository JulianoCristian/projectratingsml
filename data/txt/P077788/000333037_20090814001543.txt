1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal:

Macroeconomic environment
1.     Peru had made important advances since the early 1990s to put in place an appropriate
policy environment for exports as evidenced by: (i) external tariffs were more than halved; (ii)
non-tariff barriers were among the lowest in the LAC region: (iii) macroeconomic stabilization
and fiscal restraints led to low inflation levels and credible and stable exchange rates; (iv) an
adequate foreign investment law and a reasonable business environment had attracted significant
FDI flows; and (v) there was significant private sector participation in infrastructure.

2.      Despite significant structural reforms during the 1990s, Peru's economy had failed to
establish a track record for sustained growth and poverty reduction. Peru's GDP per capita in
2000 was $2,368 in 2000, which was about the same level as that for 1970. A combination of
external shocks ­ the El Niño weather phenomenon, high cost and scarcity of external financing,
terms of trade deterioration ­ and the political crisis during 2000-2001 explained the country's
faltering growth during the years preceding this project. As a consequence, the poverty rate stood
at 54.8 percent in 2001, reflecting a rise of 7.1 percentage points from 1997.

3.     Acknowledging that growth and strong institutions are vital to sustainable social and
economic development, the Government's strategy in 2001 to reduce poverty was organized
around three central objectives:

       Competitiveness and employment generation;
       Equity and social justice; and
       Institutionally, creating an efficient, transparent and decentralized state.

Competitiveness
4.      A sound macroeconomic policy environment along with targeted foreign trade initiatives
had not achieved the desired enhancement in competitiveness. With the exception of Bolivia,
Peru's exports per capita level was the lowest in the Latin American region, which at US$268
was far below the WTO's published world average of US$1,229. Peru seemed to lag even in
areas for which it was expected to have a natural comparative advantage such as textiles and
agro-industrial products. Thus upon taking office in July 2001, President Toledo made
competitiveness a cornerstone of his Government's economic policy and political agenda to
deliver sustained and equitable growth. The Government was committed to improving Peru's
international standing on competitiveness in order to bolster growth of non-traditional exports.

5.     Specific actions taken by the Government in support of its competitiveness strategy
included the following:

       Creation of the National Competitiveness Council (CNC): The CNC was created in
       April 2002 under the office of the Prime Minister to lead and coordinate the design and
       implementation of a National Competitiveness Plan.



                                                  1 
 


       Rationalization of key entities responsible for export promotion: In July 2002 the
       following reorganization of government agencies was undertaken: (i) creation of the
       Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (MINCETUR); (ii) the merger of the Ministries
       of Industry and Fisheries under a single Ministry of Production (PRODUCE); and (iii)
       the consolidation of all agencies involved in investment promotion under one entity ­
       PROINVERSION.
       Trade agreements: In September 2002 the Government successfully completed
       negotiations with the U.S. for eligibility under the ATPDEA which opened the U.S.
       market and removed all duties on textiles, clothing, selected manufactured goods and
       processed foods. The Government also began negotiations on a free trade agreement with
       the U.S.
       Tariffs and export measures: In August 2002 new measures were enacted to (i) provide
       financial support to stimulate export industries; (ii) lower tariffs on capital goods from 7
       percent to 4 percent; and (iii) incorporate new tax measures under temporary admission
       regimes.
       Improvement in corporate finance / investment climate: In August 2002 the government
       also passed a new Bankruptcy Law to improve the legal framework for corporate
       restructuring and increase firm creditworthiness.
       Improvements in transport and logistics costs: A new Ports Law was passed by
       Congress in March 2003 with the objective of modernizing national port infrastructure
       and management through increased private sector participation.

6.     This project was thus designed to support the Government's goal to advance Peru's
competitiveness. The focus of the project was on those factors inhibiting export growth,
especially in the short term. Based on the Bank's analytical work and consultation with the
Government and various stakeholders, the following issues were identified as obstacles that
needed to be overcome in order to improve export competitiveness:

    a. Outdated government export strategy and poor linkages with the private sector. The
       challenge was how to ensure that the private sector firms, especially the producers of
       nontraditional export products, respond appropriately to any new incentive framework
       that the Government put in place to boost exports.
    b. Lack of quality consciousness. Peru lacked an integrated system for quality management
       at the national level and a major private or public sector institution to champion a
       "quality agenda." For example, Peru was not exploiting or developing two concepts
       related to quality that could have a significant impact in opening new markets:
       certification of organically grown agro-products and unique and localized branding such
       as the pisco. There was no clear agency to take a leadership position in emphasizing the
       issue of quality in export promotion.
    c. Underdeveloped export capacity and a lack of institutional coordination in export
       promotion. At the government level there were several major institutions attached to
       different Ministries: the Commission for the Promotion of Peruvian Exports
       (PROMPEX) under MINCETUR; the National Board of Trade under MINCETUR; the
       Executive Office of Economic Promotion under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (RREE)
       which houses the trade promotion offices in embassies across the world; and
       (PROMPYME) within the Ministry of Labor; which did not coordinate their activities.


                                                2 
 

          The problem of capacity was further aggravated by the high fragmentation of production
          in the nontraditional product sectors and the small size of firms.
       d. High logistics costs. Based on a 2001 Bank study, Peru's logistic costs as a percent of
          total revenues were estimated at 31 percent, compared to 15 percent for Chile, and to an
          OECD average of 9 percent. Some of the contributing factors were unreliable freight
          transportation; lack of refrigerated transport capacity; insufficient number of freight
          intermediaries; and inadequate technologies for packaging of merchandise. Another
          factor was the lengthy and inefficient processing of exports through the country's
          principal port of El Callao, which are compounded by deficiencies in terms of access
          roads to the ports
       e. Inadequate export finance infrastructure. Earlier Bank studies had indicated that limited
          access to adequate export finance instruments was one of the major problems of Peruvian
          exporters, particularly in view of the ever-growing risk aversion on financial institutions.

7.      The Bank's project was thus aimed at supporting actions that had already been taken by
the Government by focusing on the key issues that had been identified as obstacles to export
competitiveness. At the time of project preparation Peru's Global Competitiveness index had
been ranked by the World Economic Forum at the 64th percentile, and as an outcome of this
project a target was set at the 61st percentile.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

8.       According to the PAD and the Loan Agreement, the objectives of the Project were to
assist the Government of Peru to: (a) establish a streamlined, integrated and effective
institutional and policy framework to increase nontraditional exports; and (b) develop and
implement initiatives designed to foster the entrance of new export markets participants,
especially small and medium producers of non-traditional goods.

9.    In order to achieve these objectives, the Project was organized into four principal
components and an administrative / project management component:

I.        Strategic planning improvement and institutional framework for export
          development. This component would: (a) develop export capacity at the enterprise and
          regional level; (b) strengthen export promotion capabilities abroad and access to foreign
          markets; (c) design and implement of a National Suppliers Program (production chains);
          and (d) promote investment in exporting businesses.
II.       Adoption and implementation of effective quality practices. This component would:
          (a) Strengthen quality promotion, normalization, accreditation and adoption; (b) improve
          the sanitary certification process; and (c) upgrade the Centros de Innovación Tecnológica
          (CITE) model.
III.      Improve access to export finance. This component would: (a) strengthen the
          bankruptcy system; and (b) Complete studies regarding restrictions in access to finance.
IV.       Reduction of logistic costs associated with production and trade. This component
          would: (a) improve infrastructure and trade-related logistics services; (b) optimize road
          maintenance; (c) improve the supervision and regulation of public transport services;

         (d)strengthen customs intelligence and control systems; and (e) address goods handling
         security concerns at ports and airports.

10.    The key indicators related to Project outcomes as well as outputs to be achieved under
each of the principal components as specified in the PAD are shown in Table 1 below.

Main Beneficiaries
11.      By enhancing Peru's competitiveness through productivity improvements and trade
facilitation it was expected that this project would boost the growth of exports, particularly
nontraditional products. Government incentives would specifically target nontraditional exports.
Thus the main beneficiaries were expected to be exporters in general but especially those for
nontraditional exports, particularly micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as other
producers along the supply chain, transport services providers, freight handlers, and ultimately
workers in those enterprises that benefited from the opportunities generated by the activities of
this project.

12.     Beneficiary firms were expected to post increased earnings from growth in exporting
activity, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. Exporting opportunities would arise
from project financed training programs offered to micro-, small- and mid-sized enterprises
including demonstration of new quality standards in production that would lead to a higher level
of compliance with certification. Lower transportation costs along with reduced losses from
spoilage and product damage would facilitate access to foreign markets. Promotion of domestic
and foreign investment in export related activities would also provide much needed capital to
beneficiaries. Greater availability of financing would help to expand productive capacity and
thus strengthen earnings.

13.     The institutional improvements engendered by the project were expected to benefit
numerous government agencies that were directly and indirectly linked to production and trade.
The development of regional export plans and training of regional and local governments in trade
support activities was an important benefit in view of the new responsibilities particularly with
respect to the regulation, promotion, and support of production activities at the regional level that
had been thrust upon the regional governments by the Decentralization Law of 2002. Other
central government agencies and ministries would also benefit in terms of better coordination of
export promotion initiatives and more effectiveness in incentivizing production and exporting
activities.

Original Components
14.     The project's four main components covered a broad area of support towards the
development objectives. The implementation of the project was to be undertaken by 14
government agencies under the supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister (PCM) through
the Technical Secretariat of the CNC also headed by the Prime Minister. The operation of the
project was to be managed by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCM entered into
Participating Inter-Institutional Agreements (PIAs) with each of the 14 Participating Agencies
(PAs). The PCU was to have primary responsibility for project coordination, monitoring and
reporting tasks. A summary of the four components and the corresponding PAs is shown in
Annex 2. The duration of the project was set at three and a half years with a programmed closing
date of December 31, 2006.

15.     The design of the project components addressed the major issues that had been identified
as impediments to competitiveness as discussed in the previous section. The first two
components dealt with institutional strengthening and promotion of increased production of
quality products for exporting. The third component provided some basic indirect support of



                                                 5 
 

export financing. And the fourth component dealt with infrastructure studies that would help
guide the Government in framing key policies and decisions affecting logistics costs.

Component I: Strategic Planning Improvement and Institutional Framework for Export
Development

16.    The aim of this component was to address the shortcomings identified in the overall
government trade facilitation strategy and the supporting institutional framework. Activities
included selected diagnostic studies, training programs and provision of limited equipment
purchases.

17.    Regional export plans. In support of the decentralization of exports, the project would
finance through MINCETUR the development of Regional Export Plans (PERXs) and two
Product Operational Plans (POPs) as well as the establishment of regional offices to be managed
by the Regional Executive Committee for Exporting (CERX) in charge of implementing the
PERXs made up of representatives from agencies such as MINCETUR, PROMPEX,
PROMPYME, and PROVINVERSION and from private sector associations. The PERXs were to
serve as a blueprint for development of export capacity at the regional level and through the
CERXs create the institutional framework to monitor the implementation of the regional plans
thus enhancing the prospects of increasing nontraditional exports.

18.     Training and support of micro- small- and mid-scale enterprises. Through
PROMPYME design and implement training programs for micro- and small-scale exporters and
promote trade facilitation services to these enterprises; and foster linkages between large and
small producers. Support PROMPEX in designing and implementing a national technical
assistance program to help selected companies prepare and implement export strategies and
associated business plans. Design and implement a national suppliers' program through
PRODUCE that would identify high potential productive sectors, provide TA in management
techniques and quality principles to participating companies, and design and execute pilot
coordinating groups around selected productive chains. These initiatives were expected to trigger
an expansion in exporting activities particularly by micro-, small-, and mid-sized enterprises.

19.      Strengthening of export promotion capabilities: Support the Productos Bandera
initiative hosted by PROMPEX. Develop a pilot promotion program for selected markets under
the Foreign Relations Ministry (RREE) through the commercial offices operating in Peruvian
embassies overseas. Increased promotion of Peruvian products would lead to greater volume of
nontraditional exports.

20.     Institutional strengthening of government agencies: Provide local support and training
of government agency staff directly involved in production for export. The institution-building
efforts focused on market intelligence, advisory assistance, training and equipment for
PROMPYME, PROMPEX, MINCETUR, PROINVERSION, RREE and regional government
offices. Training programs for internal staff of the central government agencies, who in turn
would train their counterparts in regional governments. The project would also finance studies on
inter-governmental coordination of trade policies and on barriers to investment. It was expected




                                               6 
 

that these activities would enhance the effectiveness of these government agencies acting in a
coordinated fashion to increase nontraditional exports.

Component II: Adoption and Implementation of Effective Quality Practices

Develop and revise national quality norms and accreditation of control entities
21.      This sub-component would be coordinated by INDECOPI given its role as administrator
of the national metrology and standards systems. A national quality council would develop new
technical norms, improve coordination between various agencies involved in quality
management, and train the staff of private sector laboratories and other entities that offer
certification services to facilitate their accreditation. By establishing quality standards consistent
with international practices, including ISO- based certifications; this component was expected to
facilitate the entrance of small- and mid-sized producers into the export markets, directly and
indirectly ­ as part of a supply chain.

Improvement of the sanitary certification process
22.    The focus was on two agencies: DIGESA, the updating and formulation of processed
foods sanitary norms and provision of limited HPLC and field equipment for DIGESA's three
regional laboratories; and SENASA, improving the agricultural sanitary certification process and
provision of equipment for a toxic waste laboratory.

Upgrade of the CITES Quality Program
23.     This sub-component would involve a diagnostic study to redesign the Centers of
Innovation & Technology (CITE) model to improve its financial sustainability, market strategy
and contribution to the improvement of quality standards and promotion of small and medium
exporters. The CITEs were established by PRODUCE to improve competitiveness through
productivity and technological enhancements; their ownership structure is public, private as well
as mixed public-private. The goal was to reinforce the CITE's role as a business support center
with greater emphasis on technology and quality improvements. The project would fund new
CITEs pilot programs for packaging of selected agribusiness products, the garment industry,
producers of wood products, and maintenance and cleaning services. Because of its proven track
record in support of small- and mid-sized enterprises, CITEs offered a good platform to
incentivize producers to tap opportunities in the export markets through quality improvement.

Component III: Improve Access to Export Financing

24.     Under this component the loan would finance technical assistance to review the
bankruptcy procedures at INDECOPI and prepare studies regarding key aspects which affected
credit access, specifically by small- and mid-sized businesses. By improving access to financing
this component was expected to assist exporters in obtaining critical financial resources to
support their export expansion.

Component IV: Reduction of Logistic Costs

25.    This component was comprised of diagnostic studies aimed at the improvement of trade-
related infrastructure and logistics services, the optimization of roads maintenance, the



                                                  7 
 

improvement in the supervision and regulation of public transport services, and the strengthening
of customs intelligence and control systems.

26.    In the design of the project numerous studies were identified as important in terms
achieving a greater understanding of the key transportation issues for air, land and sea including
national and regional ports. The information provided by these studies was to assist the
government in framing infrastructure policies from a legal, regulatory, and investment
perspective including attracting private sector participation in the development, maintenance and
management of transportation services and facilities.

27.     The Ministry of Transportation (MTC) would oversee studies on air and sea ports.
OSITRAN, the transportation regulatory agency, would commission studies for improving the
agency's efficiency and ability to regulate ports, airports, railroads and highways. PROVIAS,
which is an agency within the MTC, would contract studies on improving road maintenance with
a focus on regional road networks.

Extension of Closing Date
28.     Because of delays in project effectiveness and the slow pace of disbursements for reasons
explained in the subsequent sections of this report, it was necessary to extend the closing date
twice, from the original date of December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007, and then to
December 31, 2008. The extension allowed the Borrower to achieve 90 percent disbursement of
the original project financing amount. As explained later in this report, a longer implementation
period should have been considered at the time of project design.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry:

29.     The design and preparation of this project benefitted from strong government ownership
at the highest level as shown by the strong interest and participation during project preparation of
the Prime Minister, the First Vice President, and several Ministers of state. In April 2002 the
Government established the National Council for Competitiveness and it was the Technical
Secretariat of the Council that prepared the feasibility study for the project on behalf of the



                                                 8 
 

Government. The project thus became the focal point for the Government's competitiveness
policy.

30.    The project was prepared after only two years into the administration of President Toledo
which was strongly committed to further opening the economy to international trade and thus
presented a favorable window of opportunity to embark on a TA project of this magnitude. With
the possibility of a free trade agreement between Peru and the U.S. on the horizon, the
Government wanted to be better prepared to benefit from the trade agreement.

31.     Lessons learned from previous Bank experience with TA operations were taken into
consideration in some key aspects of the design. Strong Government commitment to the
objectives of the project diminished the high risk factor associated with other Bank projects
where poor government support had compromised project outcomes. In order to avoid
coordination problems that arise with projects that have multiple implementation agencies, the
Bank introduced Participation Agreements into the project's conditionality establishing the rules
and expectations for each participating agency.

32.     The project's focus on expansion of non-traditional exports through increased
competitiveness was a realistic market-based approach with limited intervention by the
government. On the other hand, the scope of the project was very broad. By combining all
relevant competitiveness issues the project served a useful purpose in terms of consolidating
many diverse activities across multiple government entities. But in doing so the design of the
project became somewhat ambitious with over 100 individual tasks encompassed by the four
components.

33.     While the four project components of the project were consistent with the objectives, the
structure was complex. With 16 participating agencies the project exhibited a high degree of
implementation risk in terms of the coordination efforts required to complete all the programmed
tasks. One good design feature was to establish the PCM as the head office of the project thus
achieving a high level of oversight over the numerous participating Ministries and independent
agencies. This arrangement facilitated PCU's task of ensuring that the PAs remain on schedule
and comply with their committed assignments.

34.     Viewed from a different perspective, the project's components could have been
streamlined by arranging them into separate operations. Components I and II which dealt with
productivity and quality improvements and trade promotion in the context of the government's
decentralization policies could have been structured as one operation; Component III, while a
very small component, could also have been expanded into a separate operation dealing with
access to financing by SMEs with emphasis on trade-related financing; and Component IV could
have been implemented as another project dealing with trade-related logistic infrastructure.
Another option might have been to include the four components while reducing the sub-
components and thus the number of participating agencies. Even though all sub-components
were relevant, they did not all have the same order of priority and degree of effectiveness with
respect to the overall objectives.




                                               9 
 

35.     Considering the complexity of the project, the Bank may have been too optimistic with
respect to the timeframe for implementation. The PAD recommended a three and a half year
period for completion of the project with the expectation that the government's comprehensive
program of reforms for export competitiveness would continue through 2010, but it did not
explain the basis for that conclusion. As mentioned in the previous section, it became necessary
for the Borrower to request two extensions of the closing date in order to complete the project.

36.     Several design features of the project components were not clear in terms of their
contribution to the objectives. In Component I, while training and support of micro-, small- and
mid-scale enterprises were expected to result in increased productivity, it was not clear how this
would eventually result in the successful entry into new export markets. With respect to technical
assistance, it was not clear how the three agencies identified for this activity, MINCETUR,
PROMPYME and PROMPEX were to coordinate their assistance to enterprises since their
activities appeared to overlap. During implementation, the PCU caught sight of this issue and
made every effort to avoid duplication of project activities.

37.      Component III on access to financing lacked a critical mass as an instrument towards the
achievement of the project objectives. While creditor rights and bankruptcy procedures are in
some way correlated with the availability and cost of financing, it does not appear that
knowledge of bankruptcy procedures is critical to export financing. From a financial perspective,
the two activities included in this component represented a minimal 1.5 percent of total project
costs, which puts into question its justification as a major project component. In order to have a
tangible impact on project outcomes, a financial system component would have to have much
more substance in terms of analysis of micro-, and small-scale enterprise financial performance,
adequacy of collateral, government export financing vehicles, the banking system's credit
culture, as well as a more in-depth diagnosis of creditor rights and potential mechanisms to
facilitate their claims all of which could more aptly be addressed in the context of a stand alone
financial sector project.

38.    At the time of project preparation, Bank staff raised some concerns regarding the need for
transportation projects as contained the Component IV. Participants in the PAD review meeting
commented that a number of transportation and port studies had already been done but that they
had not led to meaningful progress in terms of port reforms. The question of political
commitment to these reforms was raised. In addition it was not clear who would be making
decisions regarding the implementation of a study's recommendations.

39.     Perhaps another approach to project design could have relied on the initial understanding
that this TA loan was to be followed by other competitiveness-related projects. According to the
PAD, this TA operation was to be the first step in a sequential program of Bank support with
possible additional investment and program support for the competitiveness agenda. If this had
been the intent, then the design of each project could have been more streamlined with greater
focus by each project in the series on one of the major components.

40.   The Bank took special care in managing procurement and other fiduciary issues. The
PAD recommended that the Bank carry out periodical procurement supervision and assist the
PCU staff during the start-up of the project. A more vigilant approach to these issues responded



                                               10 
 

to Bank concern that PCM might be perceived as a public entity subject to political interference
and not as a technical entity.

41.     Based on the project's preparation and design, quality at entry is thus judged to be
moderately satisfactory. Project appraisal was based on an in-depth analysis of the principal
challenges to competitiveness. The Government's feasibility study identified critical factors that
had to be addressed in order to achieve an effective competitiveness policy. While the design of
the project components was consistent with the objectives, the structure was too complex. In
contrast, the component on export financing was too shallow to have had a meaningful impact on
project objectives.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

42.     The successful completion of the project is attributed to government commitment to the
objectives of improving competitiveness and to the effectiveness of the PCU in managing all of
the outputs although the complexity of the project proved to be a challenge. The principal
implementation factors are summarized below:

Management effectiveness of the PCU

43.     The PCU was staffed with highly qualified professionals with strong backgrounds in
organizational management, project management, and financial control and reporting. As a sign
of good teamwork, there was no turnover of the senior staff during the duration of the project, in
contrast to Bank staff, where the project went through four Task Managers. The unit maintained
a high level of organization in coordinating the work of the participating agencies. Throughout
the implementation of the project the PCU closely monitored the Operational Plan which
included a detailed accounting of each task and complemented with a matrix of indicators to
monitor project outputs. The highly effective operation of the PCU was one of the determining
factors in the success of this somewhat complex project.

Organizational structure of the project and quality of staff in participating agencies and of
consultants

44.     Establishing the project within the PCM, with the PCU as a unit inside of the PCM, was
an effective arrangement in terms of implementation, particularly in view of the large number of
ministries and other government agencies involved in different project components. Each
ministry in effect reports to the PCM, thus it represented the highest level of management
authority. Because of the visibility of the Prime Minister's office, this project was referred to as
the "PCM project." This organizational structure facilitated the PCU's task of coordinating with
each participating entity and in ensuring their adherence to the program objectives.

45.     The quality of the staff in the PAs as well as their consultants also contributed to
successful implementation. Key personnel in the participating agencies were well versed on the
project scope and had ample experience with project management. In some cases they did have
to become more familiar with the Bank's procurement policies in order to process their funding
requests. With respect to the project consultants contracted by the PA, the quality of some of the


                                                11 
 

firms was a plus in terms of the efficiency of outputs. The regional export plans were well
received, which generated an interest in having the firm that did the work update the other
regional plans that had been done prior to the project. The scientist who served as an advisor on
the acquisition of laboratory equipment was very helpful in identifying the most cost effective
equipment. In the case of the CITEs, their established presence in Peru and successful experience
in helping small- to mid-sized businesses was instrumental in the successful development of the
technology pilot programs.

Participating entities had a vested interest in the output of the project

46.     The project's yardstick in terms of nontraditional exports served as a clear guide for
designing and selecting each output. Despite the large number of PAs, each one identified
specific needs for resources that would help them promote nontraditional exports more
effectively. The list of tasks that had been drawn up at the time of project preparation remained
pretty much intact. Some PAs ended up having to make changes to the specification of their sub-
components even after the Bank had already approved the terms of reference but in most cases
they were marginal adjustments to achieve a better output although they slowed down
implementation due to the rigid nature of the procurement process.

Delay in effectiveness and extension of project completion date
47.     With the delay in effectiveness combined with other implementation issues, the first
disbursement did not occur until November 2004 which was almost one and a half years after
Board approval in June 2003. One of the reasons for the delay was that the Government had not
assigned the necessary budget allocation as counterpart funds within the 2004 budget. Yet, in
2005, one year after project effectiveness, only 5 percent of the funds had been disbursed,
followed by a more meaningful 20 percent in 2006. The slow pace of project implementation
was in due in part to the complexity of the project and to the large number of participating
entities. Since the time allotted for implementation was not realistic, it was necessary to seek an
extension of the closing date. Further delays were encountered in 2006 as a result of the first
request for an extension. While the Borrower and the Bank had discussed the need for an
extension six months prior to the original closing date, a number of factors delayed the Bank's
response until November 2006. As a result, the PCU had to hold up new contracts during a six
month period pending the Bank's final approval on the extension. These developments took a
toll on implementation as reflected in the Moderately Satisfactory rating on implementation
progress from mid-2006 through mid-2008. Roughly four years passed between the date of
Board approval and when disbursements started to accelerate.

48.    The delays in project implementation may have also represented a lost opportunity for the
Bank. Given the complex operational nature of the project, the Bank's Lima office could have
played a more active role in monitoring the project's activities. If the Lima office had assigned
an operational staff person as a project contact to act as troubleshooter, the implementation
experience may have been more efficient.

Change of government in July 2006
49.    President Toledo's administration put competitiveness in the government's policy
agenda. The Prime Minister was also a strong supporter of the project. The Government



                                                12 
 

understood the nature of the challenge as underscored by the World Economic Forum's
lackluster competitiveness ranking for Peru. Thus the Government had a strong buy-in to the
goals of the project. When President Garcia assumed office in July 2006, his administration
continued to support pro-trade policies. However, the new government's priorities and
governance style were not as strongly supportive of the specific goals of this project. The new
political leadership that may have been unfamiliar with the details of the project could have also
been challenged by its complex structure. This may have also contributed to further
implementation delays by the participating agencies.

Government budget constraints led to partial cancellation of funds
50.     The government's counterpart funding posed a challenge both at the beginning and at the
end of project implementation. In response to a weakening economy, the Government imposed
austerity measures during the last year of implementation in the form of new spending ceilings
on all public sector entities, including this project. With the closing date of December 2008 fast
approaching, the spending cutbacks obligated the PCU to stop the contracting process on projects
that had already been approved for a total of $1.1 million. Thus the remaining available Bank
funds were cancelled.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:
 
51.     No deviations were found with respect to the Bank's financial management, procurement,
and disbursement policies. During the first year of implementation the Bank upgraded the PCU's
risk rating from substantial to moderate in response to the positive actions taken by the unit
regarding compliance. The Bank's periodic Financial Management Reviews consistently rated
the project as satisfactory. The reviews did raise some concerns with respect to the delays in
disbursement for the reasons already discussed in previous sections of this report. All external
audits of the project's financial statements produced an unqualified opinion as to the validity of
all information and the operational reviews also showed that the project was in compliance with
the Loan Agreement. All purchasing audits were satisfactory.

2.4 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase (if any):
N/A
 
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:
 
52.      One of the pillars of the Government's overall economic strategy at the time of project
preparation was to support competitiveness and employment creation. These goals were
compatible with the Bank's own country strategy as described in the CAS, particularly the goal
of supporting policy and institutional reforms to address barriers to growth and competitiveness.
The genesis of this project was the Government's sense of urgency regarding the need to upgrade
Peru's capacity to effectively compete in the global marketplace. The competitiveness ratings
issued by the World Economic Forum among others demonstrated that Peru had not yet achieved
its full potential as a competitive economy. The Government's goal of promoting free trade
agreements meant that both the public and the private sectors needed to be prepared to take


                                               13 
 

advantage of new trade opportunities as well as effectively defend against competitive threats
that opening up of new markets might entail.

53.    The objectives supported by this project are still relevant with the current Government's
economic policies and with the Bank's country strategy. While some of the instruments or policy
styles may have shifted with the change in government in 2006, the current administration
continues to pursue trade creation as one of the principal avenues to income and employment
growth. With the signing of the Peru ­ U.S. Free Trade Agreement Peru stands to gain major
new export opportunities; however, realizing them will require further improvements in the
country's competitiveness. The successful implementation of other future trade agreements is
more likely to materialize if the objectives of this project remain a high priority.

54.     The goals of the project in terms of institutional as well as private sector development
were clear and realistic in the context of the Peruvian economy. The diagnosis contained in the
PAD identified the key issues that needed to be addressed through policy reforms, institutional
changes, and support of the private sector. The focus on economic development at the Regional
level targeting small- to mid-sized enterprises continues to be a high priority of the Government.
For these reasons, the relevance of this project is deemed to be substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives:
 
55.     The principal outcome of this project was a sustainable increase in nontraditional exports.
This goal was achieved by introducing SMEs to export markets; strengthening government
agencies involved in export-promotion; enhancing national quality standards through product
certifications and offering specialized training to SMEs on improving the quality of their
products; and identifying bottlenecks in trade logistics and taking steps to improve the efficiency
in moving goods through the country's air and sea ports.

56.     As designed during project preparation, the linkages of the project's outputs to outcomes
occur first, through institutional strengthening of the participating agencies and second, through
their project-specific activities assisting SMEs enter the export markets. Since the bulk of
project funds did not disburse until the last two years before closing, the change in the outcome
indicators reflects mostly the impact from improvements in the institutional objective, as well as
from other non-project related factors that may also have influenced non-traditional exports,
while the private sector development impact is more likely to occur in the medium- to long-term.
However, the magnitude of the impact in both cases will be tempered by the current global
economic downturn and financial crisis which have notably curtailed the volume of international
merchandise trade.

57.          The logical framework from outputs to outcome distinguished the means of entry into the
export markets according to the size of the firms. There are basically three channels for small-
and mid-sized firms to introduce new exports:1 first, large, mid- and small-sized firms that
exported directly; second, medium-sized firms that purchase products from small producers in
order to fill large orders; and third, small firms that formed cooperative associations or groups in
                                                       
1
 As stated in the PAD, the objective of the project focused on small- and medium-sized enterprises; although some
of the project activities such as PROMPYME were also aimed at micro-scale enterprises.


                                                       14 
 

order to achieve the minimum optimum scale necessary to enter the export chain. Thus a small
firm that was primarily selling to the local market could in effect become an exporter of
nontraditional products after receiving TA services from PROMPYME or one of the CITEs
resulting in an upgrade in the quality of its product that would enable the firm to sell directly to
another firm who in turn was a direct exporter. However, existing production and exporting data
do not allow a direct measure of the impact of the project on indirect exporting, but this
information could be obtained through a survey of firms that have participated in any of the
project-financed activities.

58.     The outcome indicators shown on Table 2 establish a positive correlation between the
project outputs and achievement of the development objectives. Some of the indicators were not
measurable as defined in the PAD (see Table 1) and were thus reformulated in a way that was
consistent with the original definition. The affected indicators were: the number of target
markets for Peruvian exports; the number of exporting SMEs; and the use of export-related
financial instruments. Due to the very short span of time since the project was closed and the
difficulty in extracting from the changes in the outcome indicators the precise influence of the
project, this evaluation can only establish a consistency between the outcome indicators and the
actions supported by the project.

59.      The most important indicator is the growth of non-traditional exports. Non-traditional
exports as shown in Table 2 are expressed as a percent of GDP. This is a more appropriate
measure since the original indicator specified in the PAD which used the ratio of non-traditional
to total value of exports was distorted by the impact of the surge in commodity prices on the
value of traditional exports.2 The increase in non-traditional exports from 5.0 percent in 2003 to
5.9 percent of GDP in 2008 can be attributed to the success of this project. Detailed information
on nontraditional exports shows that the increase is explained in part by the dynamic growth of
fruits, cereals, and other agro-industrial products, nontraditional fish products, textiles, paper and
cardboard, organic and inorganic chemicals, copper-based metal products, and basic metal
machinery.

59.     As shown in Table 2, significant improvement occurred in logistics costs and transit time
through Peruvian seaports. The increase in the number of concessions contracts should also
result in greater logistical efficiencies. The one component that resulted in a loss of opportunity
was the access to financing where the project failed to generate a critical mass of activity to
justify a meaningful impact on outcomes.

61.    The key contributions from project outputs to the achievement of development objectives
are summarized below:

Institutional and policy framework to increase nontraditional exports
     The regional export plans (PERXs), the committees for implementing the plans (CERXs),
        and the Product Operational Plans (POPs) represent a practical economic development
        model that has enabled Regional governments to identify key export opportunities and to
        undertake new initiatives to promote those exports.
     Training of MINCETUR, PROVINVERSION, and RREE staff on export promotion have
        helped to streamline government policies to promote nontraditional exports.
     Establishment of 10 regional offices by PROMPERU will enhance the capability of the
        public sector to increase non-traditional exports.
     Development by INDECOPI of new technical norms for products with export potential
        has strengthened the government's pro-export policy framework.
     Training of DIGESA national inspectors as well as those in the Regional government
        offices will improve the certification process and quality reliability of products exported
        from Peru.
     Training of OSITRAN staff on supervision and regulation of public transport services
        contributes to a more effective enforcement of transportation policies and thus a
        reduction in logistics costs.
     Studies on air and sea ports provided extensive information that the government used in
        making decisions regarding the privatization of port operations.

62.     These initiatives addressed three essential drawbacks to export promotion that had been
identified in the PAD: first, the existence of outdated government export strategies; second, a
lack of quality consciousness; and third, lack of institutional coordination in export promotion.

 If the data were available a more accurate ratio would have been nontraditional to total exports measured in
constant prices.


                                                          16 
 

Regional governments now have validated information on their strengths and weaknesses in
tapping the export markets. Greater coordination between MINCETUR, PROMPERU,
PROINVERSION, and RREE has made it easier for SMEs to take advantage of exporting
opportunities. INDECOPI has been spearheading new technical norms with input from industry
representatives and has been collaborating with DIGESA and other agencies responsible for
quality standards in order to engender a culture of quality exports.

Foster entry of small- and medium-scale enterprises into new export markets
    TA program by PROMPYME for micro- and small-scale enterprises introduced firms to
       export markets.
    PROMPERU's TA services to small- and mid-sized enterprises resulted in more than 100
       firms participating in international trade fairs.
    The launching of the Exporta Fácil program for postal exports resulted in a much higher
       than anticipated volume of shipments during the first year in operation.
    The development of CITE pilot production facilities have enabled local producers to
       achieve the quality standards needed to enter the export markets.
    The opening by SENASA of the first toxic residuals laboratory in Peru will facilitate the
       certification of agricultural products by an entity that is ISO compliant and thus
       acceptable to foreign buyers.
    The upgrading of the ITP laboratory will enhance the specifications of packaging and
       quality control of fish products geared for the export markets.
    By helping the Government make decisions regarding concessions contracts for the air
       and sea ports, the transportation studies will eventually contribute to the lowering of
       logistics costs.
    If the feasibility study of the multi-modal logistics hub in the main port facilities of
       Callao succeeds in attracting the necessary investments to build the facility, it will
       notably improve the efficiency of the movement of goods through the ports and may also
       generate new opportunities to serve as a logistic zone for trade between other South
       American countries and the rest of the world through Peruvian ports.

63.     Project initiatives aimed at working with SMEs to prepare them to enter new export
markets or to expand / enhance the quality of their existing exporting capacity have produced
tangible results in terms of actual export sales. PROMPERU's TA services continue to yield new
direct and indirect exports. The CITE quality branding initiatives are becoming well-known in
key export-related industries. As the new laboratory facilities become operational, exporter
access to quality certification will improve and thus greater acceptance of Peruvian products in
overseas markets.


64      Based on the effectiveness of project outputs and the positive contribution to
outcomes including the expected medium-term impact from greater private sector
participation in exporting, the achievement of development objectives is rated as
satisfactory. This rating does recognize some instances of lost opportunities primarily in the area
of access to export financing.




                                                17 
 

3.3 Project Efficiency:

65      The quality of output contributed favorably to project efficiency. The participating
agencies were in general satisfied with the work performed by the consultants and with the
quality of the equipment purchased. The PCU thoroughly reviewed all bids for consultant
services and for equipment purchases as revealed by the Bank's procurement evaluations.
However, the slow implementation progress, due in part to the complexity of the project,
detracted from its efficiency in achieving the objectives. With respect to some of the studies,
such as those dealing with logistics, the amount of information was voluminous which could
have been reduced making the output more user-friendly. The inclusion of the component on
access to financing without a noticeable stream of benefits resulted in an opportunity cost in the
form of lost time that could have been spent on other aspects of the project. The PCU's close
monitoring of project activities facilitated by periodic meetings held with all participating
agencies kept the implementation program on track. Based on the experience of the project,
efficiency is thus considered to have been moderately satisfactory.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:
66      The project has had positive outcomes in terms of the institutional capacity and assistance
of private sector firms to generate nontraditional exports with the relevance of design and
efficiency of output as contributing to the successful outcomes. Relevance and efficiency ratings
were affected by complexity of design and slower than expected implementation; nevertheless,
their impact on achievement of objectives was favorable. The overall outcome rating is thus
considered as Satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and:

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

N/A

Institutional Change/Strengthening:
67      As described in the previous sections, this project deals primarily with institution
building. While not all participating agencies benefited to the same degree in terms of improving
their ability to use their human and financial resources more effectively, the project did make a
noticeable contribution to most of them. MINCETUR's PERXs model for regional development
was assimilated effectively, although it would be useful to perform an ex-post evaluation of their
impact to better appreciate the contribution to institutional development. The establishment of
new regional offices by PROMPEX / PROMPERU was important in reaching small- to mid-
sized businesses. The upgrading of INDECOPI's capacity to issue quality norms was a valuable
addition to its institutional framework. The CITEs pilot program and other initiatives further
enhanced their image as a center that helps firms produce a better quality product.
PROINVERSION's sponsored feasibility study of the multi-modal logistic zone cast the
organization in a more proactive mode in attracting investments. And the quality improvements
in DIGESA combined with the upgrade of the SENASA and ITP laboratories took quality
control to the next level in terms of ISO standards.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to the project's development outcome is deemed as moderate
68      The support of the development outcomes depend critically on the Government's
commitment to the competitiveness agenda. A single project cannot achieve all things for
everyone nor can all the initiatives undertaken under this project be expected to continue to
support the project outcomes on the basis of just one intervention. Continual and persistent
attention by the Government to the competitiveness agenda will minimize the risk to the
project's outcomes. In this regard there are numerous opportunities for the current Government
to play a bigger role in bettering the outcomes. Perhaps another project, that builds on the
success of this operation and is structured to better fit the governing style of the current
government, would help to further expand nontraditional exports. Of course, the current global
economic downturn and financial crisis have forced the government to impose fiscal restraints
that limit the resources available for this type of project, but the medium- to long-term payoffs in
terms of increased export earnings will be considerable. Once a country loses its competitive
position, it is very difficult to regain its foothold in export markets.

69      At a minimum, sustainability of the project's development outcomes is almost assured by
market forces which will continue to drive the growth of international trade. However, with an
increasingly competitive world marketplace, the risks to the achievement of the outcomes will
arise from the opportunity costs of not having maximized Peru's potential for growth and
employment. The recently signed Peru ­ U.S. Free Trade Agreement as well as other future trade
agreements will be key drivers of the sustainability of development outcomes; but their
durability hinges on further action, otherwise Peru's gains will be diminished through lost
opportunities. Some of the areas that still need attention include the following:

       The PERXs were the beginning of a process that may not have yet been embedded in the
       economic development agenda of the Regional governments.
       Limited progress was made in the development of export supply chains. Further work in
       this area would help to determine whether this is an appropriate model for export
       development.
       The trade promotion offices of RREE are still not up to their potential as an effective tool
       in support of nontraditional exports.
       INDECOPI has made good progress in developing new technical norms, but as the range
       of nontraditional exports widens, additional norms will be needed.
       The CITEs are still not a financially self-sustaining organization, although the model has
       proven to be an effective mechanism for bolstering production quality. There is also a
       limited presence of CITEs in the more remote regions of the country. Improvement of
       technology in production is still a major obstacle to exporting.


                                                19 
 


       Negligible progress was made in improving access to export financing. There is a lot
       more involved in this area than just bankruptcy procedures. Also the best practices in
       technology and quality will not help a company that is unable to obtain financing to
       produce a better product. One of the unfortunate consequences of the current global
       financial crisis is likely to be the imposition of even more regulations that could limit the
       ability of banks to finance profitable exports.
       The transportation studies were only a first phase in reducing logistic costs. It is
       important to develop action steps to implement key recommendations of the studies.
       Greater government support of the proposed multi-modal hub in Callao will attract more
       interested investors in developing this facility. Initial presentations of the results of the
       feasibility study have stimulated private sector interest. The timing of this facility may in
       turn depend on the upgrading of the seaport which is currently underway through a
       concessions agreement.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):
70     The design of the project encompassed a very broad area of competitiveness. The PAD
provided an in-depth analysis of the institutional needs and appropriate instruments to achieve
the goals of the project. However, as mentioned earlier in this report, the final design was made
complex in terms of the scope of outputs and the number of participating agencies. The Bank
was also optimistic in expecting that a project of this magnitude could be completed in only three
and a half years. For these reasons, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is judged
to be Moderately Satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision:
71      Bank staff was diligent in monitoring the implementation of the project. While there were
four task managers during the course of the project, the changes did not have an adverse impact
on implementation. Special attention was noted in terms of supervision of the procurement
process with periodic assessments by the Bank's procurement department. The close scrutiny of
individual contracts did result in some delays in Bank response particularly to proposed terms of
reference documents submitted by the Borrower. As noted earlier, greater involvement in
supervision of project activities by the Bank's Lima office would have been helpful during
implementation. Bank performance during supervision is deemed as Moderately
Satisfactory.

 Rating of Overall Bank Performance:
72     In determining the overall Bank performance rating both quality at entry and supervision
are considered equally in view of the successful outcome of the project outputs. The overall
evaluation of Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                20 
 

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance
73       This project was conceived by the Government of then President Toledo that wanted to
build on previous macroeconomic reforms to address key obstacles to export growth. This policy
initiative had a high priority which translated into a firm commitment to the project. The
Government's feasibility study, which was done by the PCM, was a comprehensive analysis of
the factors affecting Peru's competitiveness that produced a very broad agenda for reforms. By
placing the project directly under the office of the Prime Minister the Government elevated its
visibility and provided a compelling spokesperson for its implementation. The new government
that took office in July 2006 continued to support the goal of enhancing competitiveness, but its
new policy views were not as closely tied to the objectives of this project. A reorganization in
some of the Government ministries resulted in a relocation of some of the participating agencies
and in the case of PROMPYME their exit from the project. General budget cutbacks also caused
the cancellation of some project funds. Government performance in this project is rated as
Satisfactory.

Implementing Agency Performance
74      The implementing agency was responsible for a complex project with 16 participating
agencies. The PCU was strongly committed to the development objectives. The senior members
of the staff were highly qualified. The quality of management practices was reflected in the
favorable outcomes of all operational and financial audits. The unit effectively utilized periodic
meetings with participating agencies to serve as a forum for discussion of implementation issues
and for cross-learning from individual experiences. All project documentation was well
organized and maintained in the archives. Financial management was meticulous with timely
reporting of financial information in easy to understand format. Project management was
consistently rated as Highly Satisfactory by all ISRs starting in 2005. This evaluation thus
confirms the same rating of Highly Satisfactory for Implementing Agency Performance.

Rating of Overall Borrower Performance
75     The Government's commitment and the high quality of staff in the implementing agency
were important factors in the overall performance of the project. The overall Borrower
performance is thus rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

76      The principal lessons learned are:

        Strong Government commitment to a TA project is critically important to its
        success. The genesis of this project was the Government's vision that improvement of
        Peru's competitiveness was a necessary condition for promoting growth of nontraditional
        exports. Giving the project the highest visibility by placing it under the direct supervision
        of the Prime Minister's office was strong indication of commitment to the project's
        objectives.
        The quality and commitment of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) is a decisive
        factor in the efficiency and effectiveness of a TA project. Government commitment is


                                                 21 
 

         very important to an operation's success, but the ability of the PCU to execute all the
         components of the project and to ensure the timely realization of outputs in an efficient
         manner is just as important. The PCU for this project performed above expectations and
         was able to successfully manage a complex operation. The individuals hired for the PCU
         were the right choice for this project.
         The risk associated with a TA project that has a complex design and a short
         implementation period can undermine the objectives. Project design needs to be
         focused and with a limited number of components and participating agencies.
         Implementation delays with this project can be attributed to its complexity in terms of the
         diversity of the major components and the large number of PAs. A more efficient
         approach could have been to arrange several TA loans with each specializing in a major
         component(s). Simpler projects with greater frequency may result in better outcomes over
         time. If there are concerns that support for a TA project could wane if certain components
         were to postponed until subsequent operations, then sustainability of even a single
         operation should be questioned.
         Each major component of a TA project has to meet a critical mass test for impact on
         development objectives. A major component represents a group of outputs that are
         expected to have a measurable impact on the development objectives. Component III
         dealing with access to financing did not even produce a significant output. Only major
         components that meet certain Bank criteria based on the logical framework linking
         outputs to outcomes should be considered in a project's design.
         The closing date of a TA loan should be specified in years following the date of
         effectiveness; thus in the case of this project it would have been three and a half years
         after effectiveness, or December 2007. In order to incentivize a borrower to reach
         effectiveness in a short period of time, the Bank can impose a higher commitment fee for
         late compliance with effectiveness.
         Technical Assistance projects are incubators of economic development. While TA
         loans are not a significant contributor in terms of the size of the Bank's overall loan
         portfolio, they represent an important part of the Bank's economic development mission.
         This project supported several innovative initiatives such as the PERXs and the feasibility
         study for a multi-modal logistic zone. TA loans can provide effective support for private
         sector development through carefully targeted interventions to overcome market failures.
         On the other hand, technical assistance, particularly institution building, is not a one-time
         support activity. The assumption that one operation will be sufficient to resolve instances
         of market failure is not always valid; it may resolve only one of many issues conspiring
         against development objectives.

       Project implementation was facilitated by the Government's commitment to supporting
competitiveness strategies and by the diligent and efficient management of the project by the
PCU. While the project had a slow start, resulting in two extensions of the closing date,
disbursements eventually reached 90 percent of the original loan amount (see table A.2.1. below)
with the final two thirds occurring during the extended implementation period 2007-2008. Most
of the output indicators out-performed their targets as identified in the PAD. This section
provides a description of the principal outputs generated by the project and the implementation
experience.

       Project outputs by component were basically on target with the final tally showing 12 of
the 14 agencies identified in the PAD as participating in the project plus an additional four
agencies that were added later for a total of 16 PAs. Based on total expenditures ­ both Bank and
counterpart funds, Component II was the principal component with 40 percent of total
expenditures, of which two-thirds represented the purchase of goods for agricultural products
laboratories and production equipment for the CITE pilot programs and testing facilities,
followed by Components I and IV with 19 percent each, of which 70 percent and 90 percent of
expenditures respectively were for studies, and only a minimal output of 0.1 percent for
Component III. The remaining expenditures, approximately 20 percent, were associated with the
operations of the PCU and the support of the technical secretariat of the CNC within the PCM.
Table A.2.2. shows the principal activities financed by the project. A summary of these outputs
by components is provided below.

During the implementation several changes occurred in the makeup of the PAs. Two of the
agencies that had been identified in the PAD declined to participate the restructuring of other
PAs resulted in some of their responsibilities being assigned to new entities. Both MEF and
SUNAT whose financial participation has been a very small part of the project, decided that the
work they had planned as part of the project had already been financed through other sources. In
Component II part of DIGESA's responsibilities on certification were assigned to ITP which
specialized in the fisheries industry, and similar changes were introduced in Component IV
where SIMA, a shipbuilding company, and CEPRI-Lima, the investment promotion agency of
Lima, were given new roles in the project. With respect to evaluation of environmental impact
CONAM was also assigned a small participation.

    At the time of project effectiveness, PERXs had already been prepared for 16 of the 25
      Regions in Peru, so this sub-component financed the remaining eight which were also the
      less economically developed. For each PERX, two product operational plans (POPs)
      were also completed.
    Because of the lower threshold of economic activity, there were few CITEs established in
      these Regions, which consequently limits the ability to implement quality improvement
      initiatives for micro- and small-scale enterprises.

Training and support of micro- small- and mid-scale enterprises (MSMSE)
    PROMPYME designed a program for micro- and small-scale enterprises; however, this
      agency was subsequently restructured by the Government and made part of PRODUCE
      which resulted in its disengagement from the project.
    PROMPEX which later became PROMPERU established 10 new regional offices to
      provide TA services to small- and mid-sized enterprises that were considered good
      candidates for exporting. During the implementation period these regional offices
      selected a group of 160 manufacturing firms to participate in training programs for
      exporting of which 121 eventually participated in international trade fairs.
    PRODUCE undertook studies to identify supply chains ­ primary agricultural products,
      agro-industrial goods, metal products, wood products & furniture, and textiles & apparel.
      They also implemented a TA program for small businesses and organized them in small
      groups that could then be linked directly with large exporting firms. PRODUCE worked
      with 300 out of a total of 6,000 registered firms.

Strengthening of export promotion capabilities:
     PROMPERU implemented a training program for university faculty and other
       professionals that advice small businesses on export promotion techniques.
     RREE implemented two pilot studies, in their Madrid embassy and the Miami
       commercial office, which was comprised of a market profile and also the acquisition of
       IT equipment for processing of data bases.


                                              32 
 


       RREE designed and implemented a Masters program on international commercial
       relations which was offered to a class of 29 ministry employees.
       PROMPERU launched a very successful program Exporta Fácil in conjunction with the
       postal service which offers micro- and small-scale enterprises a streamlined facility for
       shipping small value products through the postal service.

Institutional strengthening of government agencies:
     MINCETUR, PROVINVERSION, and RREE staff was trained on export promotion and
        support of small- and mid-sized enterprises.
     The staff of regional governments and regional trade promotion offices was trained on
        concessions, investment, and export promotion strategies.
     A study was completed by PROINVERSION on barriers to investment.

Component II: Adoption and Implementation of Effective Quality Practices

Develop and revise national quality norms and accreditation of control entities
    Through INDECOPI 13 technical norms were developed for products with strong export
      potential.
    INDECOPI also developed 10 training courses on good practices and quality control
      which were attended by 51 laboratories and other entities involved in certification and
      accreditation of quality standards.

Improvement of the sanitary certification process
    Assistance was provided to DIGESA on improving its inspection (93 new inspectors
      were trained on sanitary standards) and certification programs.
    Purchase of equipment for the first laboratory in the country for toxic residuals for
      agricultural products (SENASA). This will significantly reduce the time and costs
      associated with having to send samples overseas for processing.
    A similar laboratory and research facility was upgraded in ITP for fish products.

Upgrade of CITES model
    TA services were provided to four CITE laboratories for accreditation under ISO 17025.
    The project financed the acquisition of equipment for the CITE pilot production facilities
      for apparel, wood and furniture, and agro-industrial products as well as for product
      quality testing equipment.

Component III: Improve Access to Export Financing
   INDECOPI completed the training program for its staff on bankruptcy procedures and a
     communications campaign was carried out.

Component IV: Reduction of Logistic Costs
   A comprehensive national civil aviation study was completed, the first of its kind, which
     provided useful policy recommendations and helped drive decisions regarding the
     concession agreements for the regional airports.
   MTC completed a benchmark study of national air- and sea-ports with comparable ports
     in other countries in the hemisphere as well as other regions of the world. In-depth

                                              33 
 

       quantitative information was useful in negotiating the concession agreements for the
       national and regional ports.
       Through PROINVERSION a comprehensive feasibility study of a multi-modal logistics
       hub in the main port of Callao was completed. The Callao node accounts for about 70
       percent of the value of Peru's international merchandise trade. The study has generated
       interest; however, in order to attract private investors the government will have to acquire
       the land needed to develop the facility.
       OSITRAN used project funds to train its staff on supervision and regulation of public
       transport services and to improve the regulatory framework for the supervision of
       privatized transport services.
       SIMA, a shipbuilding company that also does repairs and maintenance of ships, received
       project funds for feasibility studies on upgrading their facilities and modernization of
       their shipbuilding yard.

Economic Costs and Benefits of the Project

As established in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), cost effectiveness analysis was not
applicable in this project. As stated in the PAD, the TA character of the operation implied that
quantitative economic and financial analysis was not possible or appropriate. For this reason, the
economic analysis of the project would focus on presenting the economic rationale for the
selection of the interventions supported by the project as instruments for improving export
performance based on quantitative information when available. If successfully carried out, the
project was expected to generate benefits at two levels: improvement in the institutional
framework of the government to promote exports, and in the actual growth of nontraditional
exports. For a detailed analysis of project outcomes see the main text of this report.
