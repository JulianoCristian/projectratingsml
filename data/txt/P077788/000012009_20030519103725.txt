Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
set 
within 
a 
major 
comprehensive 
effort 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Peru 
(GOP) 
to 
significantly  improve 
the country’s competitiveness 
to 
restore economic 
growth 
and 
increase 
employment. 
It 
will 
also  prepare  Peru 
to 
take  better 
advantage 
of 
new 
trade 
opportunities 
with 
its 
largest 
trading 
partner (the 
United 
States) 
under  the 
recently 
approved 
Andean Trade 
Promotion 
and 
Drug 
Eradication 
Act 
(ATPDEA). 
The 
project’s 
development objectives 
are 
to 
assist 
the 
GOP 
to: 
(i) 
establish a 
more 
streamlined, 
integrated 
and 
effective 
institutional 
and 
policy 
framework 
to 
increase 
nontraditional 
exports; 
and 
(ii) 
develop and 
implement initiatives 
designed 
to 
foster the 
entrance 
of 
new 
export 
market 
participants, especially 
small 
and 
medium 
producers. 
The project 
would 
achieve 
these 
objectives 
by 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to: 
(i) 
elaborate 
and 
implement 
a 
national 
plan to 
improve 
Peru’s competitiveness 
drawing 
from 
locally-generated 
regional 
strategies 
and 
partnerships 
with 
the 
private 
sector; 
(ii) 
strengthening mechanisms 
of 
interaction 
and 
cooperation 
between 
private 
and 
public 
parties 
at 
regional, 
national 
and 
local 
levels; 
(iii) 
disseminating 
information 
and 
training 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
selected 
public 
sector 
institutions; 
(iv) 
conducting 
pilot 
and 
small 
scale 
initiatives 
to 
test 
alternative 
schemes 
to 
improve quality 
and 
productivity; 
(v) 
analyzing new 
market opportunities, 
instruments 
for 
trade 
facilitation, inefficiencies 
in 
the 
distribution 
chain 
and 
export 
processing, 
and 
preparing 
design 
and 
feasibility 
studies 
for 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks 
in 
transport logistics; 
and 
(vi) 
refocusing 
and 
overhauling 
key public 
sector 
entities 
to 
achieve 
their 
institutional 
objectives  and boost Peru’s 
competitiveness.

The 
assistance 
strategy 
of 
the 
Bank 
Group 
emphasizes 
four 
priority 
areas: 
(i) 
support 
to 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
with 
a 
priority 
on 
public 
sector management 
and  decentralization, 
barriers 
to 
growth 
and 
competitiveness, 
and 
further 
reform 
of 
the social 
sectors; 
(ii) 
financing 
investment 
programs that have 
direct 
impact 
on 
the 
productive 
lives 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
to 
support 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors; 
(iii) 
a renewed focus 
on 
environmental 
issues 
-- 
especially 
linked to 
health, sustainable 
use 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
management 
of 
biodiversity; 
and 
(iv) 
continued 
emphasis 
on 
partnership 
with 
civil 
society  and 
on inclusion 
within 
Bank 
operations 
of 
specific 
groups 
such 
as 
youth, 
women, 
indigenous 
peoples 
and 
Afro-Peruvians. 
The 
recent 
CAS 
continues 
the 
Bank’s 
past emphasis 
on 
social 
sector 
institutional 
reforms 
and 
demand-driven 
poverty 
reduction 
programs. 
It 
also 
introduces 
a 
new 
emphasis 
on 
competitiveness 
to 
support 
the 
Government’s 
growth 
agenda. 
The 
proposed 
technical 
assistance 
project 
is 
the 
Bank’s 
first 
intervention 
on 
this 
important 
issue 
within 
this 
CAS 
period, 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
the 
analytical 
basis 
for 
future  investment 
and 
other  fast-disbursing 
programmatic 
support towards 
furthering 
the 
competitiveness and 
growth 
strategy spelled 
out 
in 
the 
CAS. 
The 
proposed 
project 
primarily 
and 
directly 
addresses 
the 
CAS’S 
first 
objective 
of 
supporting 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
address 
barriers 
to 
growth 
and 
competitiveness 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
also 
supports objectives 
(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
of 
sustainable 
environmental 
development 
and 
partnerships 
with 
civil 
society. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
four 
key 
GOP 
goals 
within 
its 
key 
development 
pillar 
of 
increased 
competitiveness 
and 
employment 
generation. 
They include: 
(a) 
improved 
strategy 
and 
policy 
formulation 
and partnership 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
through 
the 
elaboration and 
implementation 
of 
the 
GOP’s 
National 
Competitiveness 
Plan; 
(b) 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
nontraditional 
exports 
by 
reducing 
logistic 
costs, 
designing 
and 
putting 
in 
place a comprehensive 
quality certification 
and exporter 
assistance 
framework, 
developing 
a coherent 
and 
comprehensive strategy 
of 
export 
promotion including 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
related 
key 
institutions, 
and 
stimulating 
the 
development 
and 
use 
of 
export-related 
financial 
instruments; 
(c) 
fostering 
increased 
regional 
development 
by 
strengthening 
the 
regional 
councils 
on 
production, 
trade 
and 
investment 
issues, 
and 
by 
focusing 
on 
regional 
economic 
activity; 
and 
(d) 
broadening 
of 
the 
base 
and 
including 
specific 
groups 
into 
mainstream  economic 
activity 
by 
assisting 
small 
and 
medium 
firms 
to 
improve 
economic performance and integrate 
them 
into 
the 
supply 
chain 
of 
production. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
In 
spite 
of 
significant 
structural 
reforms, 
Peru’s 
economy 
has 
failed 
during 
the 
last 
decade 
to 
establish  a 
track 
record 
of 
sustained 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
After 
a  strong 
growth 
performance 
in 
the 
early 
nineties, the 
Peruvian 
economy 
is 
currently 
struggling 
to 
emerge 
from 
four 
years 
of 
recession and 
stagnation. 
As 
a result, Peru’s 
GDP 
per 
capita amounted 
to 
US$2,368 
in 
2000, 
which 
is 
about the 
same 
level 
as 
that 
for 
1970. 
After 
having 
grown 
at 
an 
average 
of 
4.3% 
during 
1994-97, 
per 
capita 
GDP 
has 
been 
declining 
at 
an 
average 
rate 
of 
0.77% 
from 
1997-2001. 
The 
combination 
of 
external 
shocks 
- 
the 
El 
Nino 
weather 
phenomenon, 
high 
cost 
and 
scarcity 
of 
external 
financing, 
terms 
of 
trade 
deterioration 
- 
and 
the 
political 
crisis 
during 
2000-2001 
explain 
the 
country’s 
faltering 
growth 
in 
the 
last 
few 
years. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
poverty 
rate 
in 
2001 
stands 
at 
54.8%, 
reflecting 
a 
rise 
of 
7.1% 
from 
1997, 
and 
undoing 
the 
gains 
-3- 
Page  8
. 
made 
between 1994 
and 
1997 when 
the 
poverty 
rate 
fell 
4.5%. 
Acknowledging 
that 
growth 
and 
strong 
institutions 
are 
vital 
to 
sustainable 
social 
and 
economic 
development, 
the 
Government’s  strategy 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
is 
organized around 
three 
central 
objectives: 
0 
Competitiveness and employment generation; 
0 
0 
Equity 
and social justice; 
and 
Institutionality, 
creating 
an 
efficient, 
transparent and 
decentralized 
state. 
International 
experience 
clearly 
shows 
that  exports  can 
be 
a 
powerful 
engine 
of 
economic 
recovery 
and 
growth, 
but 
this 
potential 
has 
been 
left 
unrealized 
in 
Peru 
due 
to  lack 
of 
competitiveness. 
In 
fact, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Bolivia, 
Peru’s exports 
per 
capita 
level 
is 
the 
lowest 
in 
the Region, 
amounting 
to 
US$268, 
which 
is 
far 
below 
the 
WTO’s 
published 
world 
average 
per 
capita 
export 
of 
US$1,051. 
For 
comparison, 
Mexico 
and 
Chile 
have exports 
per 
capita levels 
of 
US$1,487 
and 
US$1,229, 
respectively. 
Even 
much 
poorer Ecuador 
has 
an exports 
per capita 
ratio 
exceeding that 
of 
Peru 
by 
75%. 
Similarly, 
Peru 
has 
currently 
an 
exports 
to 
GDP 
ratio 
of 
16.35%, 
which 
is 
much 
lower 
than that 
of 
neighboring 
countries such 
as 
Chile 
(36.43%), 
Ecuador (34.11%) 
or 
Bolivia 
(18.34%). 
More 
surprisingly, Peru 
seems 
to 
lag 
even 
in 
areas 
for 
which 
it 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
have a 
natural 
comparative 
advantage: 
textiles 
and 
agro-industrial 
products. 
This 
is 
particularly 
surprising 
since 
Peru 
has 
high 
quality 
soil 
and 
microclimates 
able 
to 
support a 
diversity 
of 
products. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
fruit 
sector Peru’s 
fruit 
exports 
amount 
to 
only US$40 
million, 
compared 
with 
Colombia 
at 
US$800 
million, 
Ecuador at 
US$600 
million 
and 
Chile 
at 
US$1.4 
billion. 
In 
the garment 
sector, 
Peru 
is 
exporting 
US$25/per 
capita 
to 
the 
U.S. 
while 
Guatemala, 
Honduras 
and 
Costa 
Rica 
all 
export approximately 
US$300/per capita. 
The 
challenges 
for 
Peru 
to 
advance 
its 
trade 
agenda 
are 
significant. 
In 
a recent 
study 
(Global 
Competition 
Report, 
Harvard 
University 
2002)  Peru 
currently 
ranks 
65th 
of 
75 
countries 
surveyed 
in 
terms 
of 
competitiveness. 
Nevertheless, Peru 
has 
made 
important 
advances 
since 
the 
early 
1990s 
to 
put 
in 
place 
an 
appropriate 
policy 
environment 
for 
exports: 
(i) 
external 
tariffs 
have been 
more 
than 
halved; 
(ii) 
non-tariff 
barriers 
are 
among the 
lowest 
in 
the 
LAC 
region: 
(iii) 
macroeconomic 
stabilization 
and 
fiscal 
restraints have 
led 
to 
low 
inflation 
levels 
and 
credible 
and 
stable  exchange 
rates; 
(iv) 
an 
adequate 
foreign 
investment 
law 
and 
a 
reasonable 
business 
environment 
have 
attracted 
significant 
FDI 
flows; 
and (v)  there 
has 
been 
significant 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
infrastructure. 
In 
its 
most 
recent Trade 
Policy 
Review 
(2000), 
the 
WTO 
reaches 
a 
similar 
conclusion acknowledging 
Peru’s 
commitment 
to 
an 
open trade 
regime 
through 
provision 
of 
non-distorting 
incentives and 
its 
reliance 
on 
market-friendly 
policies. 
Despite 
the 
political turmoil 
experienced 
by 
Peru 
towards 
the end 
of 
the 
Fujimori 
administration, 
there 
has 
been 
little 
reversal 
in 
the 
policy 
path 
towards 
openness 
and a 
market-driven 
economy. 
Recognizing 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
the  economy 
to 
improve 
its 
competitiveness 
and 
export 
performance, 
the 
new 
administration 
of 
President 
Toledo 
has 
made  competitiveness 
a 
cornerstone 
of 
its 
economic 
policy 
and 
political 
agenda 
to 
deliver 
sustained 
and equitable 
growth 
and 
social 
development and 
has 
already undertaken 
significant 
actions towards 
achieving 
this 
objective. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
CAS 
discussions, 
the 
Government 
has 
also 
committed 
to 
the target 
of 
-4- 
Page  9
improving 
Peru’s 
international 
standing 
on 
competitiveness 
from 
its 
current 
rank 
of 
65 
of 
75 
countries, 
to 
48th 
or 
better 
by 
2006, 
and 
concomitantly 
doubling 
the 
value 
of 
exports 
from 
US$7.1 
billion 
to 
US$14.2 
billion 
by 
2006, 
with 
growth 
focusing 
on 
nontraditional 
exports. 
Consistent 
with 
its 
overall 
policy 
of 
participation 
and  decentralization, 
the  Government 
organized 
in 
2002 
a 
broad 
based 
dialogue 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
dialogue 
culminated 
in 
a 
single proposal 
by 
all 
relevant 
actors 
in 
the 
export 
industry 
on 
measures 
needed 
to 
stimulate 
exports, and 
the 
Government 
has 
moved 
quickly 
to 
implement 
the 
measures 
recommended 
as 
part 
of 
this 
process. 
Specific 
actions 
on 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
thus 
far 
include: 
Institutional Reform: 
0 
Creation 
of 
the 
National 
Competitiveness 
Council: 
Recognizing 
the need 
to 
coordinate 
actions 
across 
several 
sectoral entities, 
in 
April 
2002, 
the  Government  decided 
to 
create 
a 
National 
Competitiveness 
Council 
(NCC) 
under 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister to 
lead 
and 
coordinate 
the 
design and 
implementation 
of 
a 
National 
Competitiveness 
Plan, 
to 
be 
carried out 
jointly 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
institutional 
home 
for 
the 
competitiveness 
agenda 
also 
has 
the 
natural 
advantage 
of 
full 
political 
support and demonstration 
of 
the 
high 
level 
of 
importance 
the 
government 
places 
on 
the theme 
of 
improving 
competitiveness.

Rationalization 
of 
Key 
Entities 
Responsible 
for 
Export 
Promotion: 
In 
addition, 
in 
July 
2002, 
the Government 
also 
undertook 
a 
major rationalization 
of 
the 
key 
ministries 
with 
functions 
critical to improving 
export growth. 
The 
main 
changes 
include 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Foreign 
Trade 
and 
Tourism (MINCETUR), 
the 
merger 
of 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Industry 
and 
Fisheries 
under  a 
single 
Ministry 
of 
Production; 
the 
merger 
of 
agencies 
handling 
market 
research, 
privatization, 
concessions 
and 
attraction 
of 
foreign 
investment 
under 
one 
entity 
- 
PROINVERSION; 
and a 
decision 
to 
increase 
commercial 
and 
trade 
promotion 
activities 
through 
the 
foreign office. 
0 
Decentralized and Participatory Decision 
Making: 
The Government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
a 
policy 
of 
decentralized 
decision 
making 
through 
constant  consultations 
with 
consejos 
regionales 
to 
foster a 
bottom 
up 
approach towards 
policy 
making. 
Policy Measures 
0 
On 
the 
policy 
side, 
as 
mentioned previously, 
a 
major 
achievement 
of 
the  Government 
has 
been 
the 
successful 
completion 
of 
negotiations 
with 
the 
U.S. 
in 
September 
2002 
to 
achieve 
eligibility 
of 
Peru 
under 
the 
ATPDEA 
which 
opens 
the 
U.S. 
market 
and 
removes 
all 
duties 
on 
textiles, 
clothing, 
selected 
manufactured 
goods 
and 
processed 
foods. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
started 
bilateral 
negotiations 
with 
the 
U.S. 
for 
free trade treaty; 
0 
Based 
on 
the above dialogue, the 
Executive 
enacted a 
package 
of 
measures 
in 
August 
2002 
to: 
(i) 
provide 
new 
financial 
support 
to 
stimulate 
the 
export 
industry; 
(ii) 
lower tariffs on 
capital 
goods 
from 
7% 
to 
4%; 
and 
(iii) 
take 
new 
tax 
measures 
under 
temporary admission regimes.

Improved Corporate 
Finance/Znvestment 
Climate: 
In 
August 
2002, 
the 
Government 
also 
passed 
a new 
Bankruptcy 
Law 
to 
improve 
the 
legal framework 
for 
corporate 
restructuring 
and 
increase 
firm 
creditworthiness;

Finally, 
the  Government 
has 
also 
Trade 
Agreements: 
Tariffs

Measures: 
-5- 
Page  10
undertaken several 
measures 
to improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
its 
freight 
transport 
network 
to 
reduce 
transport 
costs 
for 
exports. 
In 
the 
ports 
sector, 
the Government 
has 
already 
privatized 
the 
port 
of 
Matarani, 
with 
measurable 
gains 
in 
efficiency: 
the 
efficiency index 
in 
Matarani 
is 
6.4 
compared 
to 
4.8 
in 
Callao, the biggest 
port 
in 
Peru. 
In 
addition, a new Ports 
Law 
was 
passed 
by 
Congress 
in 
March 
2003 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
modernizing national 
port 
infrastructure 
and 
management 
through 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
introducing  private 
participation 
in 
other transport 
sub-sectors, 
recently 
concessioning 
the 
first 
package 
of 
highways 
(Vial 
No. 
5) 
and 
the 
Lima 
international airport 
and 
preparing 
the concession 
for 
Vial 
6. 
To 
ensure 
the 
benefits 
of 
privatization, 
these 
privatized 
entities 
are 
supervised 
by 
the 
autonomous 
transportation 
regulatory authority 
(OSITRAN). 
Challenges 
to 
Increasing Peru's 
Competitiveness 
- 
a 
Focus 
on 
Exports 
This 
project 
is 
set 
in 
the context 
of 
increasing 
Peru's 
competitiveness. 
Barring 
rampant 
subsidies 
- 
not 
the 
case 
for 
Peru 
- 
exports 
are 
a 
reasonable, 
albeit imperfect, 
proxy 
for 
competitiveness. 
Countries 
that 
are 
competitive, 
export. 
While 
improving 
country 
competitiveness 
implies 
efforts 
across 
most 
sectors 
and 
institutions, 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
provided 
under the 
proposed 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
target 
those 
factors 
inhibiting 
export 
growth,  especially 
in 
the 
short 
term, 
which 
if 
successful, are 
bound 
to 
enhance 
overall country 
competitiveness. 
The 
issues 
identified below 
are 
grounded 
in 
a conceptual 
framework 
for 
export 
development and 
the 
analytical 
work 
undertaken 
in 
Peru 
which 
has 
identified 
the 
most 
salient factors that 
are 
the 
key 
bottlenecks 
to 
increasing 
exports. 
Under 
this 
framework, 
exports can 
be 
increased 
first 
by 
opening 
new 
markets. 
This 
is 
usually 
achieved 
through 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
integration 
treaties, 
including 
securing the 
reduction 
of 
external 
tariffs 
and 
non-tariff 
barriers 
in 
targeted 
markets. 
Peru 
has 
done 
reasonably 
well 
here 
with 
the 
most 
recent evidence the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
ATPDEA 
treaty 
with 
the 
US. 
Peru's 
access 
to 
other 
important 
markets 
is 
also 
adequate, 
and 
while 
such 
access 
could 
be 
improved, 
this 
issue 
does 
not 
represent an 
important 
barrier 
for 
exporting. 
New 
markets 
are 
also 
opened 
via 
improved 
market 
intelligence 
and better 
marketing. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
analysis 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
that 
Peru 
needs 
to 
and can 
do 
more 
and 
these 
efforts 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
proposed 
project 
and 
by 
a 
recently 
approved 
complementary 
Interamerican Development 
Bank 
project. 
But 
to 
access 
new 
markets 
Peru 
will 
also 
need 
to 
improve 
its 
supply 
of 
exports where the 
key 
determinants 
for 
success 
are 
issues 
of 
improving 
quality, 
lowering 
costs 
and increasing 
productivity. 
The 
lack 
of 
quality 
standards, 
certification 
and 
metrology 
is 
a 
significant 
challenge 
for 
Peru. 
Likewise, 
logistic 
costs 
in 
Peru, 
the 
highest 
in 
the region, 
represent 
another 
major 
constraint 
on 
the country's 
export 
performance. 
While 
exchange 
rate 
policy 
can be 
an 
important 
factor 
affecting 
the 
costs 
of 
exports, 
this 
is 
not 
an 
issue 
in 
Peru 
given 
its 
floating 
rate structure. 
Despite 
the 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
date 
highlighted 
above, 
the 
Toledo 
administration 
is 
well 
aware 
that 
much 
more 
needs 
to 
be 
done 
to 
address 
the 
continuing 
obstacles 
to 
expanding 
Peru's 
nontraditional 
exports 
and 
increasing 
its 
export 
competitiveness. 
Based 
on 
the 
Bank's 
analytical 
work 
and 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
GOP 
and 
various 
stakeholders, 
the 
following 
issues 
have been 
identified: 
-6- 
Page  11
a. 
Outdated 
government 
export 
strategy 
and poor linkages 
with 
the private 
sector 
Most 
trade 
practitioners 
agree 
today that 
market imperfections  do 
provide 
a 
justification 
for 
government 
intervention 
in 
international 
trade 
/ 
export promotion, 
especially 
in 
a 
developing 
country 
setting.  The 
theoretical 
argumentation  refers 
primarily to 
the  existence 
of 
external 
effects, 
which 
would 
not 
properly 
addressed 
if 
markets 
were 
left 
on 
their 
own. 
Export 
activities 
have 
for 
instance an 
impact 
on 
the 
external account 
and 
ultimately 
the 
exchange 
rate, 
which 
in 
turn 
affect 
the 
activities 
of 
all 
market participants. 
In 
other 
words, 
a 
dollar sold 
abroad 
is 
not 
the 
same 
like 
a 
dollar sold 
domestically. 
But, 
these 
externalities 
are 
not 
captured 
by 
the 
exporter 
in 
its 
investment and 
/ 
or production 
decisions. 
Similarly,  imperfect 
information 
in 
international 
trade requires 
significant 
efforts 
by 
all 
exporters 
in 
the 
collection 
and 
dissemination 
of 
market 
intelligence. 
Without 
external intervention, 
inadequate 
levels 
of 
investment  and 
coordination 
failures 
are 
often 
observed 
due 
to 
the 
public 
good 
character 
of 
information 
and 
associated free 
rider 
problems. Governments 
usually 
have a system 
of 
antennas 
and 
institutions 
in 
place abroad-a 
sort 
of 
a 
fixed 
costs-that 
with 
small  marginal 
costs 
can 
facilitate 
some 
of 
these 
market 
intelligence 
/ 
export 
promotion 
activities 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner. 
Other arguments 
often 
cited 
are 
technological 
externalities 
and 
similar 
spill-over 
effects that 
could 
have a substantial leverage 
effect 
on 
development 
efforts 
in 
other 
areas. 
Whereas 
direct  interventions 
in 
market 
processes 
such 
as 
quotas 
and 
price 
subsidies  have 
generally 
proven 
to 
be 
inadequate instruments 
of 
trade 
policy, more 
subtle and 
market-friendly 
forms 
of 
government 
intervention 
can have a 
significant impact 
in 
terms 
of 
development 
of 
a 
domestic 
export 
industry. 
The 
market-oriented 
economic 
policies 
adopted 
by 
successive 
Peruvian 
governments 
since 
the 
early 
nineties have 
undoubtedly 
yielded 
such 
impressive 
results, 
including 
a strong expansion 
of 
external 
trade, 
which 
basically 
doubled 
in 
absolute 
terms 
by 
end 
2001. 
This 
expansion though, 
relied 
on 
traditional 
sectors 
- 
mining, 
fish 
meal 
and 
hydrocarbons. 
Mining 
and fisheries alone account 
for 
two-thirds 
of 
exports. 
These 
sectors 
tend 
to 
have 
low 
growth 
potential 
and 
are 
dependent 
on 
volatile 
commodity 
markets. 
Further 
evidence 
of 
such 
export 
concentration can 
be 
shown 
by 
the 
low 
levels 
of 
manufacturing 
exports, 
consisting 
mainly 
of 
textiles, 
base 
metal 
industries,  chemicals, 
manufactured 
metal 
production 
and 
machinery, 
nonmetalic 
minerals, 
and 
agro-industry 
products 
which 
represented 
in 
2000 
about 
21% 
of 
total 
exports 
in 
Peru 
as 
opposed 
to 
an 
average 
of 
58% 
for 
the 
whole 
Latin 
American 
region. 
In 
addition 
to 
increased 
vulnerability 
to 
external 
shocks, 
the 
current 
export 
promotion 
strategy also 
appears 
to 
have 
led 
Peru 
not 
to 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
its 
export potential. 
Instead incentives  have  been 
provided 
which 
have 
led 
to 
overinvestment 
in 
the 
traditional 
sectors. 
The 
current 
Toledo 
administration 
acknowledges the  shortcomings 
in 
Peru’s 
export 
promotion 
policy 
and 
is 
committed 
to 
reform. 
Besides  addressing 
issues 
of 
public 
sector 
management, 
a 
particular 
challenge 
to 
this 
reform initiative 
will 
also 
be 
how 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
private 
sector, 
especially 
the 
producers 
of 
nontraditional export 
products, responds 
appropriately 
to 
any 
new incentive framework 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place 
by 
the 
government. 
This 
is 
not 
obvious 
since 
these 
nontraditional 
sectors 
lack 
a 
well 
developed and coherent 
supply 
chain, 
as 
well 
as 
culture 
of 
“export  orientation” 
per 
se.

Lack 
of 
quality 
consciousness 
In 
today’s 
global 
economy, 
a 
key 
prerequisite 
for 
access 
to 
new 
markets 
is 
product 
conformance 
to 
recognized  international 
standards, 
demonstrated 
through 
testing 
at 
qualified 
(accredited) 
laboratories; 
good 
practices 
in 
processing products that 
affect 
safety 
or 
health; 
and 
standards 
that 
show that management 
systems 
are 
in 
place 
to 
assure 
the 
production 
process 
is 
under 
control 
at 
all 
times. 
Compliance 
is 
usually 
accomplished 
through 
some 
type 
of 
certification 
scheme 
administered 
by 
independent 
third-party 
certifying 
bodies and 
their 
assessors. 
The 
qualifications 
of 
certifying 
bodies 
are 
verified 
by 
national 
and 
international accrediting 
organizations. 
Although 
Peruvian 
quality 
standards 
are 
largely 
based 
on 
international 
standards, 
there 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
a  strong 
awareness 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
and 
need 
for  quality 
management 
throughout 
Peru’s 
industries. 
Surprisingly, 
exporters 
appear 
to 
be 
even 
less 
quality 
conscious 
than  other 
sectors. 
As 
of 
April 
2002, 
only 
201 
enterprises 
have 
been 
awarded 
IS0 
9000 
certifications. 
Only 
30 
(15%) 
of 
these 
are 
exporters. 
In 
most 
other 
countries 
exporters 
are 
the 
early 
adopters 
and 
are 
the 
majority 
of 
those 
certified. The 
demand 
for 
IS0 
9000 
certifications 
has 
been 
so 
limited 
that 
only 
one 
IS0 
9000 
certifier 
is 
accredited 
in 
Peru 
(ICONTEC 
of 
Colombia) 
and 
they 
are 
withdrawing 
from 
the market. 
Colombia 
has 
twice 
as 
many 
IS0 
9000 
enterprises 
as 
Peru, 
while 
Chile 
has 
4 
times 
as 
many. 
These 
figures 
should 
also 
take 
into 
account that 
Latin 
America 
has 
proportionately 
the least 
number 
of 
certified 
enterprises. 
Of 
the 
worldwide total 
of 
400,000 
certified 
firms, 
the 
Latin 
America region 
has 
2.5 
percent. 
Next 
highest 
is 
Africa 
with 
5 
percent; 
Australia 
and 
New 
Zealand  have 
6.7 
percent. 
For 
comparison 
purposes 
and 
demonstrating 
this 
deficiency, 
Peru’s 
200 
certifications 
represent 
less 
than 
2 
percent 
of 
South 
and 
Central 
America’s total. Furthermore, 
Peru 
is 
not exploiting 
or 
developing 
two 
powerful 
concepts 
related 
to 
quality 
that 
could 
have a 
significant 
impact 
in 
opening 
new markets. 
They 
include 
certification 
of 
organically 
grown 
agro-products 
and 
unique and 
localized 
branding.  Peru 
is 
rich 
in 
such 
products that 
could 
qualify for 
such 
certification 
with 
very 
little 
effort. 
Examples 
include 
pisco 
(a 
distilled 
drink 
from 
corn), 
alpaca, 
potatoes 
and 
chirimoya 
(a 
well 
known 
local 
fruit). 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
weakness 
in 
adopting 
quality 
standards, 
Peru lacks 
an 
integrated 
system 
for 
quality 
management 
at 
the 
national 
level 
and a 
major private 
or 
public 
sector 
institution 
to 
champion 
a 
“quality 
agenda”. 
Instead, 
there 
have been 
only 
a 
few 
sporadic 
quality initiatives 
with 
limited 
outreach and 
sparse 
results. 
For 
instance, 
all 
the 
components 
of 
a 
national metrology 
normalization, 
accreditation 
and 
certification 
system 
(MNAC) 
have 
been 
in 
place 
with 
INDECOPI 
since 
1992, 
but 
the 
institution 
has 
yet 
to 
establish 
itself 
as 
key 
player 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
quality 
standards. 
Similarly, 
the 
availability 
of 
calibration 
services 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
problem 
at 
the 
few 
labs 
visited. 
But, 
the 
credibility 
of 
the laboratory accreditation 
scheme 
is 
questionable 
given 
that laboratories 
are 
not required 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
regular 
participation 
to 
inter-laboratory 
comparisons 
(round robin) 
and 
proficiency 
testing 
as 
required 
by 
international 
standards. 
This 
deficiency 
affects 
in 
turn 
two 
other government 
institutions, 
which 
are 
critical to 
certification 
of 
agricultural 
exports: 
SENAS 
A 
for 
unprocessed 
agricultural 
commodities 
and 
DIGESA 
for 
processed 
foods. 
Both 
institutions 
have developed 
new facilities 
and 
have 
retained 
well-trained 
technicians 
but 
need 
management 
training.

The 
strategic 
consequences 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
an 
effective national quality 
management 
system 
are 
reflected, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
current 
debate 
about a 
new 
EU 
quality 
initiative, 
known 
as 
the 
Euro 
Retailer 
Produce 
Working 
Group 
(EUREP) 
for Good Agricultural 
Practice 
(EUREPGAP), 
that 
is 
getting 
worldwide 
support. 
Peruvian 
exporters 
of 
agricultural 
products 
are 
particularly 
alarmed 
by 
the 
fact 
that, 
while 
certification 
under 
these 
quality 
standards 
is 
voluntary, 
most 
of 
the 
larger 
European 
retailers 
will 
require 
certification 
by 
January 
2003. 
The 
first 
EUREPGAP 
certifications 
have been 
Central American 
banana 
producers. 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil 
are 
putting 
systems 
into 
place. 
Chile 
has 
established a comprehensive 
system 
and 
is 
seeking 
recognition 
from 
the 
Peruvian growers 
claim 
that 
there 
are 
no 
EUREPGAP 
certifiers 
in 
Peru. 
SENASA 
does 
not 
see 
this 
as 
an 
urgent 
need, 
and 
certifiers 
like 
SGS-Peru 
claim 
there 
is 
no 
demand 
yet 
in 
Peru. 
Irrespective 
of 
the merits 
of 
these 
expressed 
views, 
the 
main 
issue 
is 
that there 
is 
no 
clear 
agency 
to 
show leadership and take a 
proactive 
approach 
in 
export 
promotion 
and the 
importance 
of 
the 
issue 
of 
quality. 
e. 
framework 
Underdeveloped export 
offer 
and capacity 
and 
uncoordinated 
export 
institutional 
Underdeveloped 
export 
product 
offer 
and 
capacity 
along 
with 
poor 
knowledge 
of 
export 
markets 
and 
limited 
market 
access 
are 
among 
the 
main 
factors 
hampering 
Peru's 
export 
performance. 
Export 
development 
efforts 
in 
Peru suffer 
from 
duplication 
of 
efforts, 
limited 
and 
poorly 
used 
resources, 
lack 
of 
strategic 
focus, 
insufficient 
accountability 
and inadequate 
coordination 
among 
institutions. 
The poor 
results achieved 
are 
not for 
the 
lack 
of 
relevant 
institutions 
with 
a mandate 
to 
promote 
exports. 
A 
recent 
study 
commissioned 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
found no 
less 
than 
24 
institutions 
from 
the 
private 
and 
public 
sectors 
involved 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
in 
trade 
promotion. 
At 
the 
government 
level 
alone, 
there 
are 
three 
major  institutions 
attached 
to 
three 
different 
Ministries 
which 
are 
performing 
similar 
activities 
yet 
not 
in 
a 
coordinated 
fashion: 
(i) 
the 
Commission 
for 
the 
Promotion 
of 
Peruvian 
exports 
(PROMPEX) 
under 
MINCETUR, 
(ii) 
the 
National 
Board 
of 
Trade  under 
MINCETUR 
and 
(iii) 
the 
Executive 
Office 
of 
Economic 
Promotion 
under 
the 
Minister 
of 
Foreign Affairs. 
There 
is 
also 
another 
institution 
focusing 
on 
small 
and 
micro 
producers, 
PROMPYME, 
housed 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Labor, 
that 
also 
tries 
to 
integrate 
these 
firms 
into 
the 
main 
supply  and 
export 
chain. 
This 
duplication 
of 
roles 
and 
functions and 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
clearly 
articulated 
country 
strategy 
on 
trade 
policy, 
export 
promotion 
and 
foreign 
investment 
has 
meant a 
lost opportunity 
for 
Peru 
to 
find 
a 
means 
to 
achieve sustained 
economic 
growth 
through 
a 
growing 
export oriented 
sector 
of 
the economy. 
The  result 
of 
a  weak 
institutional 
framework 
and 
disjointed  export 
strategy 
is 
Peru's 
underdeveloped 
export 
capacity. 
As 
an example, 
many 
of 
PROMPEXs 
initiatives 
have been 
directed 
towards 
raising 
funds 
instead 
of 
helping 
to 
develop 
new 
markets, 
programs 
and 
services 
for 
Peruvian 
exporters.  The 
institution 
has 
a 
poor  record 
at 
coordinating 
with 
other 
export 
promotion 
institutions 
and 
its 
market 
coverage 
is 
limited 
especially 
among smaller exporters. 
Moreover, 
the 
lack 
of 
coordination 
between the 
various 
agencies 
affects 
negatively 
the 
prospects 
of 
a number 
of 
very interesting 
initiatives 
currently 
underway, such 
as 
the 
CITES. 
Better coordination 
and 
support 
is 
also needed 
for 
private 
sector 
institutions 
which 
are 
almost 
equally 
duplicative 
in 
their  export 
development 
and 
promotion 
efforts. 
Two 
entities 
are 
-9- 
Page  14
particularly 
prominent: 
the 
Association 
of 
Exporters 
(ADEX), 
and 
the 
Peruvian Association 
of 
Foreign 
Trade 
(COMEXPERU). 
ADEX 
was 
created 
in 
1973 
as 
a 
nonprofit 
organization and 
its 
membership 
currently 
consists 
of 
mostly 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises. 
It 
primarily 
supports 
its 
members 
in 
lobbying 
activities, 
market 
analysis 
to 
identify 
business 
opportunities 
and 
provision 
of 
legal 
advisory 
services. 
It 
organizes 
business 
events 
such 
as 
roundtables, fairs, trade 
missions 
and 
seminars. 
This 
menu 
of 
services 
is 
basically 
the 
same 
for 
COMEXPERU, 
created 
in 
1989, 
which 
shares 
the 
same 
objectives 
of 
ADEX. 
But, 
unlike 
ADEX, 
members 
of 
COMEXPERU 
are 
primarily 
larger 
firms 
which 
did 
not feel 
that 
their 
interests were 
appropriately 
represented 
by 
ADEX. 
Overall 
the 
lack 
of 
coordination 
between 
these 
two 
business 
associations 
with 
the 
same 
goals 
and 
activities 
generates 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
process 
of 
export 
development and 
promotion, 
increases  costs 
unnecessarily, 
confuses 
outsiders 
and 
new market 
entrants, 
and 
ultimately 
leads 
to 
ineffective  export 
development. 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
export 
culture 
among 
Peruvian 
entrepreneurs. 
This 
is 
partly 
explained 
by 
the 
high 
fragmentation 
of 
production 
in 
the 
nontraditional  product 
sectors 
and 
the 
small 
size 
of 
firms. 
Increased 
integration 
of 
these 
producers 
into 
the 
supply chain 
would 
alleviate 
part 
of 
this problem. 
d. 
High 
logistics 
costs 
High 
logistic 
costs, 
as 
identified 
in 
a 
study 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
in 
2001, 
are 
another 
important 
obstacle 
impeding 
export 
competitiveness 
in 
Peru. 
According  to 
the study’s 
findings, 
Peru’s 
logistic 
costs 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
total 
revenues 
amount 
to 
about 
3 
1 
%, 
in 
contrast 
to Chile 
at about 
15%, 
and 
to 
OECD 
countries 
at 
around 
9%. 
Similarly,  inventory 
levels 
for 
raw 
materials 
-- 
a 
component 
of 
logistic 
costs 
-- 
in 
Peru 
were 
maintained 
at 
more 
than 
four 
times 
those 
of 
the 
US, 
while 
other countries 
in 
the 
Region 
had levels 
between 
two 
and 
three 
times 
those 
of 
the 
US. 
High 
inventory 
levels 
point 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
distribution 
chain. 
Some 
of 
the determinants 
of 
these 
deficiencies 
include: 
0 
the quality 
of 
stock 
and 
service 
of 
the freight 
transport 
providers. 
In 
Peru 
the 
average 
age 
of 
the 
fleet 
is 
over 
15 
years 
old, 
making 
service 
highly 
unreliable; 
0 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
cold 
chain. 
The 
offering 
of 
appropriate transport service-containers 
and other vehicles 
with 
temperature treatment 
is 
very 
low 
in 
Peru 
at 
around 
10% 
of 
the fleet 
- 
a 
level 
not 
adequate 
for 
the 
volume 
and  range 
of 
existing 
time 
sensitive  products. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
data shows 
that 
no 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
harvested 
output 
is 
reaching 
the market. 
Such 
high 
loss 
levels 
are 
particularly 
harmful 
for 
small 
scale 
producers; 
0 
lack 
of 
freight intermediaries. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
idleness 
and 
truck 
load 
factor 
average 
only 
around 
50% 
adversely 
affecting 
freight 
rates. 
Overall 
direct 
transport 
and 
insurance 
costs 
in 
Peru, 
which while 
not 
excessively 
high, 
are 
twice 
as 
high 
as 
those 
of 
Chile. 
But 
more 
relevant 
are 
the 
indirect 
costs 
related 
to 
reliability, 
time 
of 
service and 
damage 
factors, 
all 
of 
which 
exceed 
by 
large 
margin 
the 
performance 
of 
Peru’s 
neighbors. 
0 
inadequate 
technologies 
for 
goods 
packaging 
for 
all 
types 
of 
products 
but 
particularly 
for 
exports. 
Poor 
packaging 
of 
goods 
has 
resulted 
in 
high 
rates 
of 
damage 
and/or 
deterioration. 
Examples 
from 
the 
furniture 
and 
agro-industry 
sectors 
show 
deterioration 
or 
damage 
levels 
from 
poor 
packaging 
at 
about 
7%, 
when 
normal 
levels rarely 
exceed 2%. 
-10- 
Page  15
A 
second 
important 
element 
of 
high 
logistics 
costs 
are 
the 
lengthy 
and inefficient 
procedures 
in 
the 
processing 
of 
exports 
goods 
through 
the 
port 
of 
El 
Callao. 
According 
to 
a 
CAF 
study, 
El 
Callao 
is 
the 
second 
most 
inefficient port 
of 
the 
Region, 
only 
slightly 
better 
than 
the 
worst 
performing port 
- 
Puerto 
Cabello 
in 
Venezuela. 
Normal 
processing times 
often 
take 
up 
to 
twenty 
days 
when 
best 
practices 
such 
as 
in 
Chile 
show 
that processing can 
be 
completed 
within 
three 
days. 
Time 
is 
important 
not only 
because 
it 
has 
an 
important financial impact 
but 
also 
because 
it 
is 
particularly  crucial 
for 
agro-industry  products, 
which 
are 
time-sensitive 
and where 
delays 
directly impact 
product 
quality 
and 
the 
level 
of 
product 
deterioration, 
resulting 
in 
high 
losses. 
These 
procedural 
delays 
are 
compounded 
by 
inefficiencies 
in 
port 
operations 
at 
El 
Callao, 
reflected 
in 
fees 
and 
handling 
times, 
which 
add 
substantially 
to logistics 
costs. 
Another 
major 
contributor to 
high 
logistics 
costs 
are 
deficiencies 
in 
the infrastructure 
network, 
particularly 
access 
roads 
to 
El 
Callao 
and other 
regional 
ports. 
Exporters and 
other 
road 
users 
could 
benefit 
substantially 
from 
a better 
integration 
between the 
National 
Road 
Network 
and 
Lima’s 
urban 
road network 
to 
access 
Lima’s 
port 
and airport. 
Currently, 
both 
networks 
are 
unconnected, 
limiting 
and 
delaying 
access 
to 
the 
port 
and 
airport 
from 
the 
Northern, 
Central 
and 
Southern 
Pan-American Highways, 
generating 
high 
operating 
costs 
for 
trucks and 
other vehicles. 
The 
overall 
transport 
sector 
is 
hampered 
by 
poor 
road 
conditions 
and weak 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
maintenance. 
Peru 
lacks 
an 
effective 
network 
of 
distribution centers, 
particularly 
a 
most 
needed 
logistic 
and 
technology 
terminal 
at 
El 
Callao. 
The 
close 
location 
of 
the 
airport 
and 
port 
at 
El 
Callao, 
begs 
for 
that type 
of 
terminal, 
which would 
generate 
a 
powerful 
impact 
on 
reducing logistics 
costs, 
as 
demonstrated 
elsewhere. 
Lastly, 
the 
new 
security requirements 
being 
introduced 
by 
the 
U.S. 
will 
require 
Peruvian airports 
and 
ports 
to 
put 
in 
place 
new 
arrangements 
to 
meet 
them. 
The proposed 
project 
will 
be 
providing 
support 
in 
this 
area 
and 
to 
address 
the other challenges 
indicated 
above. 
e. 
Inadequate 
export 
finance 
infrastructure 
Preliminary 
results 
from 
an 
ongoing 
World 
Bank 
study 
on 
micro-constraints 
to 
growth 
in 
Peru 
indicate 
that 
limited 
access 
to 
adequate 
export finance 
instruments 
is 
one 
of 
the 
major 
problems 
of 
Peruvian 
exporters. 
This 
finding 
is 
supported 
by 
discussions 
with 
financial 
institutions 
and 
exporters, 
all 
confirming 
that 
only 
a 
few 
mainly 
large 
exporters have 
access 
to 
working 
capital 
loans 
from 
the 
banking 
sector, 
and even 
less 
to 
structured 
export finance products 
such 
as 
export 
insurance, 
international 
leasing, 
etc. 
Recent experience 
by 
COFIDE, 
the 
state-owned second-tier 
bank, 
suggests 
that 
the 
factors 
contributing to 
this 
situation 
need 
to 
be further 
analyzed 
to 
ensure 
the 
success 
of 
attempts 
of 
future 
policy 
initiatives 
to 
address 
the 
problem. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
specific 
constraints 
of 
small 
and 
medium 
exporters, 
discussions 
with 
financial 
institutions 
seem 
to 
indicate 
that 
the 
low 
level 
of 
“formalization” 
of 
SME’s 
in 
terms 
of 
accounting 
practices, 
management and 
corporate governance structure, 
quality 
standards, 
etc., 
is 
probably 
one 
of 
the 
key 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed. 
There 
are 
reasons 
to 
believe 
that the 
access 
to 
adequate 
export finance instruments 
has 
become 
-11 
- 
Page  16
even 
more restrictive 
in 
recent 
years 
due 
to 
a 
generalized 
credit 
crunch 
in 
the economy. Since 
1998, 
financial 
sector 
lending 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
has 
dropped 
significantly 
with 
the 
ratio 
of 
private 
sector 
credit 
to 
GDP 
falling 
from 
28 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1998 
to 
about 
24 
percent 
according 
to 
preliminary 
figures 
for 
2002. 
Ironically, 
this 
evolution 
has 
coincided 
with 
positive 
structural 
changes 
in 
Peruvian 
financial 
markets 
as 
a result 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
- 
World 
Bank 
supported 
- 
sector adjustment 
program 
implemented 
by 
Peruvian 
authorities between 1999 
and 
December 2001. 
Examples 
of 
such 
structural 
changes 
are 
as 
follows: 
A 
substantial 
modernization 
of 
the 
Peruvian 
financial 
sector and 
its 
regulatory 
framework, 
which 
led 
to 
market 
entry 
by 
European and 
US 
institutions contributing 
now 
to 
up 
to 
53% 
of 
the 
total 
equity 
in 
the 
banking 
sector, 
and 
thereby also 
to 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
potential 
of 
the 
domestic 
market 
to 
offer 
sophisticated 
export 
finance 
products 
and 
services; 
Adequate 
levels 
of 
capitalization 
even after adjustments 
for 
deficits 
in 
provision 
for bad 
loans 
(1 
1.4% 
as 
of 
12/3 
1/200 
1 
versus 
minimum 
required 
of 
9.1 
%). 
High 
liquidity 
of 
the 
banking 
system and 
improved 
efficiency resulting 
in 
a marked 
reduction 
of 
interest 
rates 
for 
loans and deposits even 
if 
the 
overall 
level 
of 
lending 
rates 
remains 
high 
in 
international 
comparison and the 
intermediation 
spread 
has 
changed 
very 
little 
since 
1999. 
Policy 
makers 
in 
Peru 
are 
working 
hard 
to 
find 
ways 
to 
reverse 
the 
trend 
towards 
ever-growing 
risk 
aversion 
in 
financial institutions 
and 
thereby 
end 
the 
current 
credit 
crunch. 
A 
recent 
diagnostic 
performed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
has 
identified 
two 
major 
factors 
contributing 
to 
this 
recent 
credit 
crunch: 
(i) 
the current 
indebtedness 
problems 
in 
the Peruvian 
corporate 
sector 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
efficient 
market 
exit 
mechanisms 
for 
insolvent 
companies, 
and 
(ii) 
the 
inflexible 
and 
deficient 
legal 
and 
judicial 
framework 
for 
executing 
and 
realizing 
of 
collateral. 
An 
analysis 
of 
bankruptcy 
statistics 
provided 
by 
INDECOPI 
confirms 
that 
export 
sectors are 
equally 
affected 
by 
these 
problems. 
Over a 
third 
of 
the 
1635 
troubled 
companies 
undergoing 
restructuring 
at 
INDECOPI 
in 
2001 
originated 
from 
sectors 
such 
as 
mining, 
fisheries, agribusiness 
etc. 
Solving 
this 
problem 
will 
contribute 
to 
reduce 
the 
high 
levels 
of 
non-performing 
and 
refinanced 
loans 
in 
the 
portfolio 
of 
commercial 
banks, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
reduce the 
costs 
and 
moral 
hazard 
associated 
with 
bank 
lending. 
More 
generally, 
an 
orderly restructuring 
process 
will 
also 
these 
companies 
to 
resume 
their activities 
at 
full 
scale 
and thereby 
contribute 
to 
economic 
reactivation 
and 
growth. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
project 
will 
address 
the 
issues 
described 
above, 
seeking 
improvements 
in 
the 
identified 
deficiencies 
in 
each 
of 
the 
building 
blocks 
of 
an 
effective export 
promotion 
system: 
i) 
Improving 
strategic 
planning 
and 
institutional 
framework for 
export  promotion 
through 
generating increased 
supply 
of 
export 
products  and 
building 
export 
capacity 
at 
the 
regional 
level; 
ii) 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
export 
supply 
(oferta 
exportable) 
by 
focusing 
on 
implementing  effective 
quality 
practices,  and 
use 
of 
internationally 
accepted 
standards 
and 
certifications; 
- 
12- 
Page  17
iii) 
Broadening 
the 
base 
of 
exporters 
- 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises- 
by 
increasing 
the 
relevant 
portfolio 
of 
financial 
instruments 
for 
export 
management 
for 
firms 
and 
by 
facilitating 
the 
integration 
of 
SMEs 
into 
the 
supply chain 
of 
exports; 
and 
iv) 
Reducing 
costs, 
particularly 
logistics 
and  transaction 
costs, 
by 
strengthening  and 
eliminating 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
supply 
and 
distribution 
chain, and 
associated markets; 
These 
interventions, 
as 
much 
as 
possible, 
will 
be 
done 
in 
a decentralized manner 
at 
the 
regional 
level.  Elections 
to 
choose 
regional 
and 
local 
government 
officials 
took 
place 
in 
November 
2002, 
and 
will 
inaugurate a 
new 
political 
structure 
upon 
which 
the 
project 
will 
build. 
The 
strategic 
issues selected 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
are 
based 
on 
two 
considerations.  The 
first 
being 
support for  actions 
which 
will 
have 
high 
and 
immediate 
positive impact 
on 
Peru's 
export 
performance. 
The 
second 
consideration 
is 
the need 
for much 
more 
analytical 
work to 
be 
done 
to identify 
the 
next 
set 
of 
specific 
policy 
actions and investments 
to 
relieve 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks 
as 
well 
as 
carry out 
broader 
public 
consultations 
to 
build 
the 
necessary 
public 
and 
political 
consensus 
for 
supporting 
the 
Government's  competitiveness  strategy 
and 
reform 
program.

Key 
policy 
and institutional reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
outputs 
of 
this 
project 
will 
provide 
the 
Government 
with 
a 
menu 
of 
policies 
and actions 
to 
improve 
export 
competitiveness  and 
firm 
productivity 
and 
a 
strengthened 
set 
of 
relevant 
institutions 
at 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
levels 
to 
implement 
them. 
As 
a 
result, 
it 
is 
expected that 
the Government 
will 
take actions supported 
by 
the 
project 
to: 
a 
focus 
greater 
attention 
on 
economic 
activities 
taking 
place 
at 
the 
regional 
level 
(agro-industry,  camelidos, textiles, 
etc.) 
and 
build 
greater 
local 
capacity 
by 
supporting: 
(i) 
quality 
awareness 
and 
development  programs 
as 
well 
as 
accreditation 
and 
certification 
offices 
in 
the 
regions; 
(ii) 
the 
establishment 
and 
operation 
of 
CITES 
at the 
regional level; 
(iii) 
the  development 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
regional  councils 
and 
regional 
financial 
advisors; 
(iv) 
the development 
of 
regional 
competitiveness 
strategies 
led 
by 
the 
regional 
councils 
to 
be 
fed 
into 
the 
national 
strategy; 
(v) 
the 
development 
of 
regional ports 
and 
associated 
areas 
of 
influence 
as 
poles 
for 
regional 
economic 
growth; 
(vi) 
improvements 
on 
the 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
of 
rural 
roads; 
and 
(vii) 
prioritization 
and strategy 
of 
concession 
of 
infrastructure 
from 
a 
regional 
perspective; 
-14- 
Page  19
reduce 
logistic 
costs, 
through: 
(i) 
improving 
the performance 
of 
its 
ports, 
particularly 
El 
Callao; 
(ii) 
eliminating 
unnecessary 
procedures 
to 
move 
exports and 
imports; 
(iii) 
addressing 
the 
identified 
market 
failures 
in 
the 
supply 
chain 
and 
facilitating 
the 
development 
of 
logistic 
and 
technology 
terminals, 
as 
well 
as 
new 
security 
demands 
for 
exports; and 
(iii) 
improving 
key 
infrastructure 
components, such 
as 
access 
roads 
to 
ports 
and 
selected feeder 
roads 
to 
key 
centers 
of 
production; 
increase 
access 
to 
existing 
and 
new 
markets 
for 
Peruvian 
products, 
via 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
strategy 
and 
corresponding actions 
through 
PROMPEX 
and 
the 
commercial offices 
of 
Peruvian 
embassies 
in 
targeted countries; 
increase the 
quality 
of 
Peruvian 
products 
via 
the increase 
efficiency 
of 
the 
corresponding 
agencies 
and 
the 
facilitation 
of 
a host 
of 
accreditation offices, 
an 
information 
and 
assistance 
campaign directed 
to 
producers, 
particularly 
SMEs 
on 
implementing 
quality 
standards, 
and 
integrating 
those 
firms 
in 
the 
supply 
chain; and 
increase the 
participation 
of 
a 
new 
group 
of 
producers 
particularly 
SMEs 
into 
Peru's 
export 
effort 
by 
enhancing 
their 
access 
to 
new and established 
export 
related 
financial 
instruments 
that reduce 
the 
risks 
and costs 
of 
exporting. 
Most 
of 
this 
actions 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
institutions 
strengthened 
through 
the 
technical 
assistance 
provided 
under the 
project. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
a. 
Benefits 
It 
is 
hoped that 
through 
this 
program 
of 
technical 
assistance 
Peru 
will 
begin 
to 
dramatically 
increase 
its 
exports, 
especially 
nontraditional 
products. 
This 
will 
translate 
into: 
e 
e 
vulnerability 
to 
external 
shocks, 
e.g. 
from 
commodity price 
fluctuations; 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
exporters 
at 
more competitive 
costs; 
a 
shift 
in 
strategy 
and 
government 
incentives 
towards 
nontraditional 
exports; 
broader 
product  diversification 
of 
Peruvian  export 
industry 
and 
consequent 
reduced 
accelerated and 
much 
needed 
regional 
economic development 
increased earnings especially 
for 
small 
and 
medium 
exporting 
firms; 
establishment 
of 
quality 
standards 
and 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
compliance 
with 
certification; 
lower 
transport 
costs, 
time 
savings and reduced 
losses 
from 
spoilage and 
product 
damage; 
higher levels 
of 
domestic and 
foreign 
investment 
focused 
in 
export-oriented 
industries; 
increased 
reliability 
of 
cold 
chain 
from 
production 
site 
to 
port; 
greater 
availability 
of 
insurance, leasing, 
and 
working 
capital 
funding 
and 
products 
to 
b. 
Target Population 
The 
main 
beneficiaries 
of 
the proposed 
project 
will 
be 
exporters 
in 
general 
but 
especially 
those 
for 
nontraditional 
exports, 
particularly  micro,  small 
and 
medium 
enterprises, 
other producers 
along 
the 
supply 
chain, 
transport service 
providers, 
freight 
handlers, 
and 
ultimately 
consumers 
inside 
and outside the 
region 
as 
product 
quality 
rises 
and 
costs 
are 
reduced.

Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
(a) 
Implementation 
period 
The project 
will 
be 
implemented 
over 
a 
three 
and 
a 
half 
year 
period 
(FY03-FY06). 
It 
will 
be 
completed 
by 
June 
30,2006 
and 
closed 
by 
December 
31,2006. 
The 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
reforms 
for 
export 
competitiveness 
should continue through 
the 
end 
of 
the 
decade. 
(b) 
Executing 
Agency 
The 
Borrower 
for 
the 
loan 
will 
be 
the 
Republic 
of 
Peru. 
The 
project 
will 
be 
executed 
by 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
(PCM)  through 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU). 
The 
PCU 
will 
undertake 
direct 
responsibility 
for 
project implementation. 
Additional 
technical capacity 
and 
specialized expertise 
will 
be 
available 
to 
the 
PCU 
through 
the 
participation 
of 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
agencies 
which 
will 
benefit 
from 
project  implementation. 
Project  organization 
and 
procedures 
to 
support 
project 
implementation 
are 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
a 
project 
Operations 
Manual 
(OM). 
The 
PCU 
will 
have 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
project 
coordination, 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
tasks. 
Technical 
specialists 
will 
be 
hired 
as 
part 
of 
the 
PCU 
to 
carry out 
work 
related 
to 
project 
oversight, 
monitoring 
and 
coordination 
with 
participating 
agencies 
as 
well 
as 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
to 
them, 
as 
needed. 
Responsibility 
for 
specialized procurement 
and 
financial 
management and 
administration activities 
to 
meet 
the 
fiduciary 
requirements 
of 
the 
Bank 
will 
be 
located 
in 
the 
PCU. 
Experts 
will 
also 
be 
hired 
in 
accordance 
with 
procedures 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
technical 
aspects 
of 
the 
project, 
located 
in 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
to 
the 
National 
Competitiveness 
Council. 
Establishment 
of 
the 
PCU 
with 
appropriate 
staffing, 
organization 
systems 
(including 
a 
financial 
management 
system) 
funds, 
facilities 
and 
other 
resources 
in 
a 
manner satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
loan 
effectiveness. 
To 
define 
work 
programs, 
roles 
and 
responsibilities, 
resource requirements, 
and 
expected 
results 
of 
the 
planned 
technical 
assistance 
activities, 
the 
PCM 
will 
enter 
into 
Participating 
Inter-Institutional 
Agreements. 
(PIAs) 
with 
each 
Participating 
Agency 
(PA). 
A 
satisfactory 
draft 
PIA 
has 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
PCU 
would 
not 
proceed 
with 
any 
project 
activity 
for 
a 
beneficiary entity 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank loan 
unless 
a 
PIA 
has 
been signed 
with 
the 
relevant 
PA. 
PCM 
through 
the 
PCU 
will 
hold 
semi-annual meetings 
with 
the 
PAS 
to 
review 
progress 
in 
project  implementation, 
determine  any  adjustments 
needed 
to 
the 
program 
and 
monitor 
contracting. 
The 
Bank 
will 
take 
advantage 
of 
these 
meetings 
to 
carry out 
its 
project 
supervision 
work. 
The 
PCU 
will 
provide 
to 
the 
Bank for 
its 
review 
its 
Annual 
Operating 
Plan 
by 
no 
later 
than December 
15 
of 
each 
year.

alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
a. 
Investment 
loan 
with 
technical 
assistance 
component. 
Although Bank 
support 
for 
infrastructure 
financing 
is 
contemplated 
in

alternative 
which would 
combine 
both 
forms 
of 
support 
was 
rejected  since 
additional 
work 
remains 
to 
be 
done 
in 
the diagnosis 
of 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks, 
for

The 
CAS 
envisions 
a 
series 
of 
programmatic 
policy reform 
loans 
in 
support 
of 
competitiveness. 
Nevertheless, 
the results 
of 
important 
analytical 
work 
underway 
and 
planned 
will 
be 
needed 
by 
the 
authorities 
before  embarking 
on 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
deeper 
and 
more 
comprehensive 
round 
of 
major 
reforms. 
Moreover, 
the 
regional 
elections 
in 
November 
2002 
and 
the recent 
popular 
backlash 
against concessions 
and 
privatizations, make 
it 
difficult 
at 
the 
present 
time 
to 
undertake 
significant 
policy 
reform. 
The 
Government 
envisions 
restarting 
its 
reform 
program 
in 
2003. 
Taking 
this 
into 
account 
and 
the 
need 
for 
sequencing the 
technical 
assistance 
first 
makes 
this 
possible 
approach 
impractical.

OED 
reviews 
of 
technical 
assistance 
(TA) 
operations have demonstrated that 
such 
operations have 
high 
rates 
of 
failure 
in 
achieving 
their 
development objectives and 
to 
be 
successful, 
they 
must 
be 
backed 
by 
a 
high 
level 
of 
government 
commitment 
to 
undertake 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms. 
In 
this 
case, 
this 
TA 
operation 
supports 
the 
Government’s 
own priority 
program 
for improving 
competitiveness, 
and 
this 
is 
a 
significant 
risk 
mitigation 
factor. 
Its 
institutional 
home 
in 
the 
Prime 
Minister’s 
Office 
also 
gives 
it 
political visibility 
and 
backing. 
Finally, 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
CAS, 
this 
TA 
operation 
is 
only 
the 
first 
step 
in 
a sequential 
program 
of 
Bank 
support 
with 
possible 
additional 
investment 
and 
program 
support 
for 
the competitiveness 
agenda 
during 
the 
CAS

Progress 
on 
this 
TA

will 
be

Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
Improving 
Peru’s competitiveness and increasing 
the 
contribution 
of 
nontraditional 
exports 
has 
been embraced 
by 
the 
GOP 
at 
the 
highest 
level 
as 
one 
of 
its 
key 
economic 
policies 
to 
achieve 
its 
strategy 
of 
more 
accelerated 
regional 
development 
and  greater 
employment 
generation. 
Demonstrated 
actions 
during 
2002 
by 
the 
GOP 
and the active 
involvement 
of 
major 
donors 
in 
supporting the 
Government’s 
program 
reinforce 
the 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
of 
the 
GOP 
to 
its 
competitiveness 
agenda. 
A 
high 
level 
of 
commitment 
has 
been 
shown 
by 
the 
strong interest 
and 
participation 
during 
project  preparation 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister, 
First 
Vice 
President and 
Minister 
of 
MINCETUR, 
the 
Minister 
of 
Economy 
and 
Finance, 
and the 
Minister 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
recognized that 
the 
program 
is 
tackling 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
complex 
reforms 
requiring 
the 
dedicated 
involvement 
and 
coordination 
of 
several 
public 
agencies, 
private 
organizations and 
firms 
to 
implement 
the 
national 
competitiveness 
plan 
and 
the 
many 
specialized 
actions 
being 
supported 
by 
the Project. 
It 
is 
hoped that maintenance 
of 
a 
strong 
focus 
by 
the 
Government 
on 
competitiveness 
through  major 
public 
consultations  and 
events, 
and 
at 
the 
project 
level 
through 
the 
PIAs, 
will 
contribute 
to building 
a 
broad 
public 
consensus 
and support 
for 
the 
program 
and 
its 
ultimate 
success 
in 
recognizing 
and 
building 
on 
Peru’s 
competitive 
advantages. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank’s  completed, ongoing, 
and future technical 
and 
analytical 
work 
has 
helped 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
advance 
the Government’s diagnosis 
of 
the 
major 
constraints 
impeding 
the increase 
in 
it 
export 
competitiveness and 
in 
the 
design 
and 
development 
of 
programs 
to 
address 
them. 
The 
Bank 
has 
also 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
helping 
the 
authorities 
to identify 
and 
take 
advantage 
of 
global 
and 
regional 
expertise 
to 
initiate 
actions 
on  policy 
reform 
and 
institution-building 
already underway. 
Moreover, 
its 
continued 
involvement should 
bring 
weight 
and 
credibility 
to 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
effort, 
especially 
for 
signalling 
the 
private 
sector 
on 
the 
orientation 
of 
the 
new 
export 
strategy. 
Looking 
to 
the 
future, 
the 
Bank 
is 
well 
placed 
through 
its 
planned 
broader 
lending 
for 
competitiveness 
to 
further 
support  the 
GOP’s 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
agenda 
as 
well 
as 
meet the 
significant  financing 
needs 
for 
new 
physical 
infrastructure 
working 
closely 
with 
other  donors 
and 
their 
leadership 
in 
other 
areas 
of 
the 
competitiveness 
agenda.

This 
project 
supports 
technical

to 
undertake 
significant 
institutional 
reform 
and 
the 
diagnostic 
work to 
specify 
policy 
changes 
that 
may 
be 
needed 
for productivity 
improvement, 
export 
competitiveness and 
trade 
facilitation 
in 
Peru. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
economic 
analysis 
for 
this 
project 
will 
focus 
on 
presenting 
the 
economic 
rationale

the 
selection 
of 
the 
interventions 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
as 
instruments 
for 
improving 
export 
performance,

in 
a  number 
of 
countries. 
The

be  drawing 
on 
that  knowledge 
and

The 
Bank’s  support 
to 
a 
wide

and the 
demands 
the 
program 
will

the 
full 
benefits 
of 
the 
shift 
in 
orientation 
towards 
nontraditional 
exports 
should 
be 
able 
to 
be achieved under 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
NCC. 
The

membership 
includes the 
Ministers 
of 
Agriculture, 
Production, Trade Commerce and 
Tourism, 
Economy 
and 
Finance, 
Labor, 
Foreign 
Relations, Transport and 
Communications, 
and 
INDECOPI 
as 
well 
as 
representatives 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and

NCC 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister, 
whose 
-21

office 
is 
executing 
the 
Bank 
supported 
TA

Thus, 
the 
NCC 
will 
be 
the 
high 
level body 
where progress 
of 
the 
GOP’s 
trade

program 
will 
be 
monitored 
and where

will 
be 
identified 
and  actions

address 
them 
made 
under 
the 
leadership

The 
NCC 
is

Procurement 
issues: 
The 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
is 
considered 
AVERAGE. 
It 
is 
recommended that 
the 
Bank 
carries 
out periodical 
procurement  supervision 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
project  implementation 
pace 
reflects  satisfactory 
performance, 
especially 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Before implementation 
is 
started, 
the 
Bank 
will 
assist 
the 
PCU 
in 
the start-up 
of 
project 
activities 
by 
providing 
training 
opportunities 
for 
its 
key 
staff 
in 
Bank 
procurement  procedures 
and 
procurement best practices. 
This 
will 
be 
followed 
by 
a project 
launch 
workshop 
prior 
to 
Loan 
effectiveness 
which 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
technical 
management 
of 
the project, 
and 
procurement 
and 
disbursements management 
under 
Bank 
procedures. 
Although 
there 
was 
no 
opportunity 
to 
meet 
with 
local 
private 
sector representatives, 
at 
the 
time 
this 
assessment 
exercise 
was 
performed, the 
private 
sector 
seems 
to 
perceive 
the 
PCM 
not 
as 
a technical entity, 
but 
as 
a 
public 
entity 
subject 
to  political 
interference. 
The 
latter 
highlights 
the  need 
to 
ensure 
a 
highly 
professional 
performance 
in 
the

Risks 
are 
expected 
to 
reduce 
with 
time 
as 
experience 
is 
gained and the 
proposed 
Action 
Plan 
is 
successfully 
implemented 
by 
the 
PCU. 
This 
will 
require 
close

Financial 
management 
issues: 
Overall 
Assessment. 
In 
general, 
the 
proposed 
Financial 
Management  Arrangements 
for 
the 
project 
are 
sound. 
However, 
the 
PCU 
has 
been 
created 
specifically 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
project 
design 
and 
implementation 
needs 
and therefore 
has 
no 
experience 
with 
the 
execution 
of 
IBRD 
funds. 
As 
a result 
of 
the 
assessment, 
an 
extensive 
time-bound 
Financial 
Management 
(FM) 
action 
plan 
has 
been 
agreed. 
Successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
action 
plan 
would 
result 
in 
adequate 
project 
FM 
arrangements 
in 
place 
by 
the 
effectiveness 
date. 
Risk 
Assessment: 
Country 
specific 
risk 
has 
been 
assessed 
as 
medium 
due 
to 
robust 
financial 
administration legislation, 
highly 
trained 
and dedicated 
staff 
in 
financial 
management posts and 
an 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
at 
national 
level. 
Successful 
completion 
of 
the 
FM 
Action 
Plan 
prior 
to 
effectiveness 
would 
result 
in 
an 
entity 
specific 
and

5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
As 
a technical 
assistance 
operation 
the 
project 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
have any 
potential 
large 
scale, 
significant 
and/or 
irreversible 
environmental  impact. 
All 
project 
components  have 
included 
environmental 
considerations 
to 
enhance 
environmental 
assessment 
practices 
or to 
provide 
a 
strategic 
overview 
of 
the 
industries and activities 
proposed. 
All 
design 
and 
feasibility 
studies 
for 
infrastructure  improvement 
will 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
safeguard 
policies 
and 
compatibility 
with 
Peruvian environmental regulations and 
environmentally 
sound 
construction 
standards 
and  procedures. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
training

dissemination  and 
instructional 
material, 
to 
strengthen 
the 
ability 
of 
SMEs 
in 
incorporating 
environmental 
considerations 
in 
their 
activities. 
Simplified 
environmental 
assessments 
and 
control 
mechanisms 
will 
be 
explored 
for 
each 
industry 
to 
provide practical 
guidelines 
to 
potential 
exporters. 
Quality 
control 
and 
quality 
management 
promotion 
activities 
contemplate 
training 
in 
environmental  regulations 
and 
compliance 
mechanisms, 
with 
emphasis 
on 
Environmental 
Management 
Systems 
(as 
advocated 
by 
the 
IS0 
14,000 
series). 
Furthermore, the 
project 
proposes 
to 
develop 
two 
strategic 
environmental 
assessments 
for 
industries 
to 
be 
selected, 
for 
example: 
the 
garment 
industry, 
manufacture 
of 
maintenance 
and 
cleaning 
products, 
and 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
transport infrastructure. 
The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
generate 
environmental 
benefits 
through 
greater 
awareness 
of 
environmental  regulations 
in 
all 
participants,  develop  streamlined  procedures and actions 
to 
address 
logistics 
bottlenecks, 
reduce 
spoilage  and 
lower 
vehicle 
emissions 
as 
port  freight 
handling 
and 
processing times 
improve. 
The 
project 
through 
the 
training 
component 
should 
also 
heighten 
awareness 
of 
agency 
officials 
handling 
trade matters 
to 
better enforce 
the 
terms 
of 
international 
conventions 
relating 
to 
the 
environment. 
The 
results 
of 
the strategic 
environmental 
assessments 
should 
provide 
the 
GOP 
with 
specific 
policy 
recommendations 
to 
address 
critical 
environmental 
issues.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
project 
will 
have 
an 
indirect impact 
on 
the 
poor. 
Many 
of 
the 
TA 
activities 
are 
targeted at 
improving 
the 
productivity 
of 
and 
encouraging 
new 
entrants 
to 
the 
export 
industry 
from 
small 
and 
medium 
producers 
located 
in 
the 
provincial 
areas 
throughout 
Peru. 
New 
economic 
development 
opportunities 
as 
small 
producers 
are 
integrated 
into 
the supply 
chain 
would 
help 
in 
slowing migration 
to 
Lima 
and 
limiting 
some 
of 
the 
associated 
adverse 
effects  related 
to 
increasing 
urban 
poverty 
and 
crime 
and 
violence. 
Additionally 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
direct employment benefits 
because 
of 
its 
focus 
on 
agro-industry, a 
major 
employer 
of 
the 
rural 
poor. 
Programs 
to  lower 
logistics 
costs, 
reduce 
product 
losses 
from 
spoilage  and 
damage 
combined 
with 
new 
exporting 
opportunities should 
lead to 
increases 
in 
incomes 
and

ultimately 
benefit 
all 
consumers, 
including

and 
feasibility 
studies 
to 
be 
carried out 
under 
the 
project 
to 
permit 
new

will 
also 
support 
the

Advisory 
Services 
Department 
(FIAS) 
of 
the 
World

(IC)  and 
administrative 
barriers. 
The 
IC 
study 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
late 
summer 2003. 
The 
administrative 
barriers 
study 
has 
not

2003/early 2004. 
A 
series 
of 
surveys 
of 
exporting 
and 
non-exporting 
firms 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Bank 
with 
the support 
of 
the 
CAF 
to 
analyze 
microeconomic 
constraints 
to 
growth.  Results 
are 
expected 
to

be 
available 
no 
later 
than 
fall 
2003. 
There 
are 
also 
a number 
of 
important 
publidprivate 
sector 
interchanges 
that 
took 
place  before 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
and 
in 
early 
2003 
which 
will 
foster 
opportunities 
for 
closer, 
more 
frequent 
and transparent 
contact and feedback 
between 
the 
GOP 
and the 
trading community. 
They 
include 
the 
Annual 
Conference 
of 
Executives 
(CADE) 
where 
issues 
of 
competitiveness 
are 
a 
vital 
component, 
workshops 
on 
competitiveness 
sponsored 
by 
the 
IDB, 
and 
multiple 
consultations 
being 
held 
with 
the 
support 
of 
CAF. 
Building 
on 
the 
consultations 
with 
key 
stakeholders, the 
IDB 
is 
currently 
preparing 
a 
Competitivness 
Reform 
Program 
Loan which 
will 
support 
policy 
changes 
and reforms 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
establishing 
commercial 
courts 
and 
implementing 
the 
moveable 
property 
guarantee 
law.

What institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
Government 
is 
fully 
committed 
to 
a 
participatory 
approach and the 
National 
Competitiveness 
Plan, 
which 
will 
form 
the core 
strategy 
for improving 
competitiveness, 
is 
being 
developed 
in 
close 
consultation 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of

Sustainability 
and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The 
proposed 
project 
comes 
at a 
critical time 
when 
the 
Government 
has 
identified 
the 
export 
sector, 
particularly 
nontraditional 
exports, 
as 
a 
key 
element 
of 
Peru's 
economic 
growth 
strategy. 
Moreover, 
the setting 
of 
a 
target 
for 
the 
overall 
plan 
to 
double 
such exports 
over 
the 
period 
of 
the 
current administration 
serves 
as 
a 
focal 
and 
rallying point for 
the 
many 
agencies 
and 
institutions 
which 
will 
play 
a 
role 
in 
carrying out 
the 
Government's 
strategy 
and meeting 
the 
exports 
goal. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
high 
priority 
being given 
to 
the 
contribution 
of 
the project, 
its 
sustainability 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
enhanced 
further 
because 
of 
the 
nonpolitical 
nature 
of 
many 
of 
the 
interventions 
needed, 
but 
more 
importantly, 
because 
many 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
activities 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
will 
be 
directed 
at 
supporting 
the 
private 
sector's 
efforts 
to 
improve 
product 
quality, 
transportation logistics, and 
cost 
and 
processing 
time 
reductions 
which 
should 
translate 
as 
concrete 
benefits 
to 
firms. 
These 
benefits and 
self 
interests 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
should 
serve 
as 
a 
strong 
anchor 
for 
supporting 
the 
Government's 
continuing 
efforts 
in 
promoting 
its 
trade 
agenda 
and 
undertaking additional 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms.

Critical 
Risks 
(reflecting 
the 
failure 
of 
critical 
assumptions 
found 
in 
the 
fourth column 
of 
Annex 
1): 
Government 
has 
shown 
a 
high 
level 
of 
commitment 
to 
this 
agenda 
by 
developing a 
consultative 
process 
with 
the 
private 
sector, 
placing 
the 
program 
under 
the 
Prime 
Minister's 
Office 
and 
by 
already 
taking 
several 
actions 
recommended 
by 
its 
private 
sector 
consultations. 
Nevertheless, 
this 
risk 
remains 
and 
therefore 
the 
Bank 
has 
sequenced 
its 
overall 
support 
to 
this 
trade 
facilitation

productivity

agenda 
by

Project 
Component

- 
US$7.50 
million 
Improving 
Strategic 
Planning 
and 
Institutional 
Framework for Export 
Development 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
address 
the 
shortcomings 
identified 
in 
the 
overall 
government trade 
facilitation 
strategy 
and 
the 
supporting 
institutional 
framework. 
In 
this 
context, 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
which 
includes 
selected 
diagnostic 
studies, 
training 
programs 
and 
provision 
of 
limited 
equipment 
purchases 
for 
the 
following 
purposes: 
a. 
This 
sub-component 
is 
designed 
to 
support  the 
decentralization 
of 
exports 
by: 
(i) 
allowing 
MINCETUR 
to 
develop 
export 
plans 
for 
each 
region 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
local 
authorities 
and 
the 
private 
sector; 
(ii) 
piloting five 
local 
offices 
to 
oversee 
the 
export 
promotion 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
regions; and 
(iii) 
providing 
local 
support and 
training 
and 
to 
implement 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
a 
national 
export 
culture training 
program. Regional 
offices 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
a committee 
made 
up 
by 
MINCETUR, 
PROMPEX, 
PROMPYME 
and 
PROINVERSION. 
Developing 
capacity 
at 
the enterprise 
and 
regional 
level: 
Second, 
it 
will 
support 
PROMPEX 
in 
the diagnosis, 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
technical 
assistance 
program to 
help 
selected 
companies prepare 
and 
implement 
export 
strategies 
and 
associated business 
plans. 
This 
program 
contemplates 
individualized 
company 
technical 
assistance 
for 
a 
period 
of 
four 
months 
and 
is 
designed 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
companies 
in 
the 
development and 
further execution 
of 
their 
export 
plans. 
Third, 
it 
will 
enhance 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
PROMPYME 
to 
(i) 
promote 
trade 
facilitation 
services 
to 
small 
and 
micro 
exporters. The 
capacity-building efforts 
under the 
project 
will 
focus 
on 
market 
intelligence 
services, 
advisory 
assistance, 
training 
and  equipment 
to 
enhance 
PROMPYME’s 
capacity 
to 
gather 
essential 
market 
intelligence 
on 
its 
target 
group, 
products, 
targeted markets, 
business 
trends, 
etc. 
This 
information 
will 
help 
define more 
sensible 
policies 
to 
assist 
small 
and 
micro 
exporters; 
(ii) 
design 
and 
implement 
training 
programs 
for 
small 
and 
micro 
exporters: 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
build-up 
within 
PROMPYME 
some 
capacity 
to 
design, 
and 
carry 
out 
/facilitate 
training 
programs 
for 
small 
and 
micro 
exporters; 
(iii) 
foster 
linkages between 
large 
and 
small 
producers: 
Advisory 
assistance 
will 
be provided 
to 
identify 
services 
that 
PROMPYME 
could offer 
- 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Production 
- 
to 
facilitate a 
greater 
integration 
of 
small 
and 
micro 
producers 
into 
the 
export supply 
chain; and 
(iv) 
support 
training 
and 
develop 
dissemination 
and 
instructional material to 
strengthen 
the 
ability 
of 
small 
and 
micro 
producers 
in 
incorporating 
environmental 
considerations 
in 
their 
activities. 
Simplified 
environmental 
assessments 
and 
control 
mechanisms 
will 
be 
explored 
for 
selected 
industries 
to provide practical 
guidelines 
to potential 
exporters. 
Fourth, 
it 
will 
allow 
analysis 
of 
the 
major 
constraints 
to 
exports 
by 
region. 
While 
some 
of 
the 
constraints 
are 
generic, others, 
regarding 
not 
only 
logistics 
but 
also other 
fields 
such 
as 
credit 
and

Page  40
agricultural 
pest control, 
are 
region 
specific. 
This 
study 
to 
be 
carried out 
by 
MEF 
would: 
(a) 
collect 
available 
information 
to 
get 
a 
detailed 
picture 
of 
the 
regional 
sources 
of 
Peru’s 
production 
and exports 
(both 
agricultural 
and 
manufactured); 
(b) 
look 
at those 
areas 
where exports 
appear 
to 
be 
unduly 
low, 
(c) 
interview 
producers 
in 
those 
areas 
to 
get 
their views 
on 
what constraints they 
face; 
and 
(d) 
provide 
analysis 
and 
alternatives 
to 
address 
identified 
problems. 
b. 
Strengthening 
of 
export 
promotion 
capabilities 
abroad 
and 
access 
to foreign 
markets 
To 
expand 
its 
exports 
significantly, 
Peru 
needs 
to: 
(i) 
develop 
adequate 
strategies 
for 
inter-governmental coordination 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
trade 
policies. 
This 
study, 
to be 
carried 
out 
by 
PCM 
with 
the support 
of 
MEF, 
will 
consist 
of 
a 
review 
of 
the 
different 
approaches 
adopted 
by 
various countries 
to 
identify 
“best 
practices” 
in 
this 
area 
and 
craft 
an 
adequate 
strategy 
for 
Peru; 
(ii) 
support the “Productos Bandera” 
initiative 
hosted 
by 
PROMPEX: 
Advisory 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
identify 
“flag 
products” 
for 
Peru, 
and develop and 
implement 
a 
specific 
strategy 
for 
these 
products 
or 
a 
selected 
subset 
of 
them; 
(iii) 
develop a 
pilot 
promotion 
program 
for 
selected 
target markets: 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
advisory 
assistance 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
scheme 
to 
effectively 
release 
commercial 
information 
on 
Peruvian 
products and foster trade 
relations 
with 
the 
host 
country.  The 
Foreign 
Relations 
Ministry 
is 
heading 
this 
initiative 
and 
has 
initially 
targeted 
the 
following 
markets: 
US 
(with 
emphasis 
in 
maximizing 
ATPDEA 
benefits),  China, 
Germany, 
Canada 
and 
Brazil. 
This 
effort 
involves 
the preparation 
of 
studies 
for 
specific products 
in 
target 
markets, 
business 
missions, the 
opening 
of 
a 
commercial 
office 
in 
Los 
Angeles, 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
technological  infrastructure 
and 
available  instruments 
for 
gathering 
of 
market 
intelligence 
in 
host countries and 
export 
promotion 
in 
selected 
pilot 
embassies, 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Ministry’s 
local 
commercial 
support 
division; 
and, 
(iv) 
assist

Studies 
to 
be 
performed include 
the 
following: 
(i) 
Administrative 
Barriers 
to 
Private 
Investment. 
This 
study 
will 
be 
executed 
by 
PROINVERSION 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
Foreign 
Investment 
Advisory 
Services Department 
(FIAS) 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
focuses 
on 
red 
tape

issues; 
(ii) 
Competitiveness 
Analysis 
and 
Global 
Benchmarking: 
In 
order 
to 
have 
a clear diagnosis 
of 
Peru’s 
international 
competitiveness level, 
key 
aspects 
must 
be 
compared 
with 
other countries’ 
standards. 
This 
study, 
to 
be 
executed 
by 
PROINVERSION, 
will 
clearly 
signal 
Peru’s strong and 
weak points, 
and 
thus, 
will

taken; 
(iii) 
Comparative 
Study 
on 
Fiscal 
Constraints, 
to 
be 
executed 
by 
the 
PCM 
with 
the 
support 
of 
MEF: 
Peru 
appears 
to be 
hurting 
its 
competitiveness 
because 
of 
its 
high 
taxes 
on 
capital 
goods 
- 
a 
12% 
import 
tariff 
plus 
an 
18% 
value 
added 
tax. 
This 
study 
will 
compare 
relevant 
taxes 
in 
Peru 
and other 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
to 
determine  whether  exporters 
elsewhere 
are 
advantaged 
compared 
to 
Peruvian 
ones, 
and 
what 
would 
be 
appropriate 
way 
to 
offset 
these 
potential 
disadvantages 
and 
what 
would 
be 
the 
fiscal 
costs associated 
with 
doing 
so. 
Institutional 
strengthening at 
PROINVERSION 
will 
include: 
(i) 
green 
fields 
and 
concessions 
training 
programs 
for 
internal 
staff; 
(ii) 
training, 
through 
PROINVERSION 
staff, 
to 
regional 
government 
officials 
in 
concessions 
and investment

aimed 
to 
give 
one-stop-shopping support 
to 
private 
investors; 
and, 
(iv)

Effective Quality 
Practices 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
contribute 
to 
the

level 
based 
on 
close 
collaboration 
between 
the 
public 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
It 
consists 
on 
three  sub-components: 
(i) 
quality

systems. 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
(i) 
create 
a 
national 
quality council 
involving 
public 
sector 
institutions,  universities 
and 
private 
business associations, 
and

to 
improve 
coordination 
between 
the 
various 
public 
sector 
institutions 
involved 
in

a 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
scheme 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
private 
laboratories 
and

best practices 
and 
help 
bring 
all 
testing laboratories 
up 
to 
standard. 
Third, 
an 
attempt 
will 
also 
be 
made 
to 
improve 
the 
existing 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
diffusion 
of 
technical norms and 
improve quality 
awareness, 
including 
WTO 
benefits 
and 
obligations.

PERU:

Productivity Improvement Technical Assistance Project 
Economic Rationale 
of 
Trade Facilitation and 
Export 
Programs 
Summary 
The 
empirical 
literature 
on 
the 
benefits 
to 
open 
trade and 
growth 
indicate, 
in 
general, 
a 
positive 
relationship 
between 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
Peru project 
and 
long-term 
economic 
advance. 
There 
are 
no 
comprehensive 
or 
case 
specific 
studies, 
however, 
of 
the economic 
rationale 
for 
the 
specific 
projects implemented 
in 
the 
loan. 
This 
analysis 
will 
be conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
itself 
(outlined below) 
and 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
make a 
major 
contribution 
to 
understanding the 
specific 
dynamics 
of 
reform, 
employment growth, and trade 
in 
Peru. 
It 
will 
provide 
critical information 
to 
evaluate 
more 
precisely 
the 
net 
benefits 
of 
project 
components, 
relevant 
to 
both 
Peru 
and 
other 
Bank 
operations 
in 
the region. 
There 
is 
general evidence 
in 
the 
economic 
literature 
and 
Bank 
experience 
in 
the 
region, 
that 
successful 
implementation 
will 
stimulate 
exports, 
promote 
job 
creation, and 
poverty 
reduction. 
For 
example, a 
Bank 
report 
on 
effectiveness 
of 
development 
assistance 
prepared 
for 
the 
United 
Nations International 
Conference 
on 
Financing 
for 
Development 
held 
in 
Monterrey, 
Mexico, 
on 
March 
18-22,2002 
noted 
“Where 
local 
conditions 
for 
entrepreneurship and 
growth 
are 
good, 
exposure 
to 
international competition 
increases 
the 
productivity 
of 
domestic 
firms 
and 
lowers 
input 
costs 
for 
downstream 
users, 
while 
foreign 
direct investment 
brings 
with 
it 
new 
production 
and 
process 
technologies, 
organizational 
capacity 
building, 
and 
marketing 
networks’’ 
(Goldin, 
Rogers 
and 
Stern 
World 
Bank 
2002). 
Moreover, 
a 
number 
of 
empirical 
studies 
support a 
link 
between 
openness 
to 
trade, 
liberalization 
policies, 
and 
economic 
growth, 
Among 
others, 
Dollar 
(1992), 
Sachs 
and 
Warner 
(1995), 
and 
Dollar 
and 
Kraay 
(2001) 
found 
that 
developing 
countries that 
participated 
in 
global 
trade 
experienced a 
significantly 
higher 
growth 
in 
per capita 
GDP. 
Rodrik 
(2002) 
argues 
that strong 
institutions 
and 
policies 
to 
manage 
downside 
risks 
are 
prerequisite 
for 
globalization 
to 
benefit 
economy, 
particularly 
developing 
countries. 
These 
studies 
suggest 
that 
investment 
in 
Peru 
to 
raise 
capacity 
to 
support exports and strengthened 
institutions 
in 
trade 
facilitation 
and 
competitiveness can 
create 
conditions 
which 
promote 
higher 
growth 
in 
per 
capita 
GDP 
and 
linked 
employment opportunities. 
Enhanced 
growth 
prospects and 
trade 
expansion 
through 
higher 
exports and 
lower 
cost 
imports 
in 
Peru 
is 
also expected 
to 
provide spillover 
effects 
in 
job 
creation 
in 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
firms. 
Empirical 
Evidence 
on 
Trade 
Facilitation 
and 
Export 
Promotion 
Direct 
quantitative 
analysis 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
trade 
facilitation 
on 
growth 
in 
exports 
is 
limited. 
We 
do 
have evidence 
to 
indicate, however, a general 
relationship 
between 
the 
competitiveness goals 
in 
the 
project 
and 
export 
expansion. 
Trade 
facilitation 
improvement 
can be achieved 
by 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
processes 
both 
at 
the 
border 
and 
by 
streamlining 
domestic 
regulations. 
Inefficient 
customs 
and cumbersome 
port 
logistics 
raise 
costs at 
the border. 
In 
recent 
modeling 
exercises, 
border 
costs 
are 
treated 
as 
trade-limiting 
factors such 
as 
transportation 
- 
45 
- 
Page  50
costs 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Anderson 
and 
van 
Wincoop 
2001). 
Inefficiencies 
associated 
with 
domestic 
regulatory 
barriers 
and 
other non-border barriers can 
also 
be 
treated 
as 
trade-limiting 
factors 
which 
are 
not 
explained 
by 
border 
costs. These costs 
can 
be directly modeled 
in 
a 
bilateral 
trade 
flow 
model 
known 
as 
a 
gravity 
model, 
or 
can 
be 
incorporated 
into tariff 
equivalents 
or 
effective 
rate 
of 
protection. 
In 
addition, 
Amiot 
and 
Salama 
(1996) 
quantify 
tariff 
equivalents 
expressed 
as 
real 
rate 
of 
protection 
of 
non-tariff 
barriers 
to imports 
and 
exports 
in 
Arab-Maghreb, 
including 
regulatory 
and 
administrative 
barriers, 
lack 
of 
infrastructure 
particularly 
transportation 
infrastructure, 
trade 
harmonization, 
among 
others. 
Lakshmanan, 
T. 
R 
, 
et 
al. 
(2001) 
include 
case 
studies 
on 
the 
role 
of 
transport 
integration 
in 
promoting 
trade 
for 
selected 
countries 
or 
regions 
in 
the 
world 
including 
Latin 
America 
In 
the 
area 
of 
port-related 
trade 
barriers, 
Fink, 
Mattoo 
and 
Neagu 
(2002) 
found 
that 
reduction 
of 
maritime 
transport 
costs 
can 
be 
achieved 
through 
reforms 
in 
the 
area 
of 
carrier 
agreements 
and 
the 
liberalization 
of 
port 
services. 
Micco, 
Clark 
and 
Dollar 
(2002) 
extend 
Fink, 
Mattoo 
and 
Neagu’s 
find 
that 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
a 
port 
from 
the 
25th 
to 
the 
75th 
percentile 
will 
reduce transport 
costs 
by 
12 
percent. 
Milner, 
Morrissey 
and Rudaheranwa 
(2000) 
find 
that 
the 
poor 
infrastructure, notable 
by 
increasing 
transport 
costs, 
and 
institutional 
inefficiencies contributed 
to 
the 
costs 
of 
trade 
protection 
more 
than 
tax 
on 
imports 
and 
exports 
in 
Uganda. 
Limao 
and Venables (2001) 
find 
that 
infrastructure 
is 
an 
important 
determinant 
of 
transport 
costs, 
especially 
for 
landlocked 
countries. 
Bougheas, 
Demetriades 
and 
Morgenroth 
(1999) 
find 
a 
positive 
correlation 
between 
the 
level 
of 
infrastructure and 
the 
volume 
of 
trade. 
Effect 
of 
Quality 
Investment and 
Role 
of 
Standards 
Standards 
can 
improve 
information 
flows 
between 
suppliers 
and 
consumers 
regarding 
the 
characteristics 
and 
quality 
of 
products, thereby 
facilitating 
market 
transactions. 
The 
process 
of 
standardization 
may 
reduce 
the costs 
of 
uncertainty 
(as 
measured 
by 
time 
and 
effort 
devoted 
to 
search) 
that 
consumers face 
in 
assessing 
product 
quality 
(Jones 
and 
Hudson 
1996). Standards 
facilitate 
comparison 
by 
consumers 
across 
products 
with 
common 
essential characteristics. 
In 
addition, we 
have 
some 
evidence 
that 
they 
also 
increase 
the 
elasticity 
of 
substitution 
among 
similar 
products (Harrison, 
Rutherford, 
and 
Tarr 
1996). 
Producers can 
manufacture 
to 
a 
limited 
range 
of 
technical 
specifications 
and 
support economies 
of 
scale. 
Inefficient 
companies 
are 
forced 
out 
of 
the 
market. 
We 
also have evidence that 
standards 
provide 
information 
around 
which 
firms 
can organize 
quality 
and 
performance 
standards 
(Maskus 
and 
Wilson 
2001). 
Moreover, Ahmadi-Esfahani 
and Stanmore’s 
(1997) 
study 
on price 
effect 
of 
quality 
attributes 
of 
Australian 
wheat 
suggests 
the 
importance 
of 
product 
quality 
in 
penetrating 
into 
export 
markets. 
Zhou 
and 
Spencer 
(2000) 
suggest 
that a 
country 
that produce a 
lower-quality 
product 
would 
gain 
more 
from 
investment 
to 
raise 
export quality. 
Robson 
and 
Bennett 
(1999) 
find 
a 
positive 
correlation 
between 
likelihood to 
take 
external 
business 
advice 
and 
the 
growth 
of 
business 
among 
SMEs 
in 
UK.

Albert 
Berry, 
and 
Jose 
Escandon 
(1994) 
found 
that 
Small 
and 
Medium-Size 
Exporters 
in 
the 
Columbian manufacturing 
sector 
can raise 
productivity 
and 
export 
capacity 
with 
government 
programs, 
similar 
to 
those 
which 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
the 
project 
in 
Peru. 
This 
includes 
components 
related 
to 
dissemination 
of 
information 
and technology. 
Improved 
Mechanisms 
for 
Export Financing 
and 
SMEs 
International Monetary 
Fund 
research 
support 
the 
view 
that 
export 
credit 
has 
important 
implications 
for 
export 
promotion. 
Brau 
et 
al. 
(1986) 
argue 
that 
export 
credit 
is 
vital 
for 
acquisition 
of 
capital 
goods 
and 
growth 
of 
exports 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Drummond 
(1997) 
points 
out 
a 
crucial 
role 
of 
export credit 
agencies 
in 
financing 
developing 
countries, 
particularly 
by 
providing 
investment 
insurance. 
Government-led export finance 
is 
particularly important 
where 
private 
financial 
agencies 
tend 
to 
favor 
large 
firms. 
Important 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Peru 
project, 
credit 
availability 
is 
a 
particularly 
important 
factor 
for 
growth 
in 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
firms 
(Becchetti 
and 
Trovato, 
2002). 
Ning 
S. 
Zhu. 
(World 
Bank 
1996) 
and 
Kitchen 
(1986) 
explain 
the 
role 
of 
export 
credit 
agencies 
in 
the 
foreign financing 
of 
infrastructure 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Financial 
instruments 
such 
as 
export credits 
can 
effectively 
raise 
firms’ 
export 
performance 
in 
developing 
countries, 
but 
is 
conditional 
to 
well 
functioning institutions 
and 
markets that 
mobilize 
them (Kitchen 
1986). 
Bossone (1998) 
emphasizes the 
importance 
of 
integrated 
management 
of 
assistance 
to 
financial 
sector 
reform 
to 
have 
positive impact 
on 
the 
economic 
growth 
in 
emerging 
economies. 
In 
their 
case 
study 
of 
SMEs 
in 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
Nugent and 
Linsu 
find 
that 
financial 
assistance 
is 
the 
most 
critical 
form 
of 
support 
for 
SMEs, 
and that 
financial 
support 
by 
governmental 
as 
well 
as 
other 
technical 
and 
marketing 
support 
is 
particularly 
important 
for 
SMEs 
in 
the 
pioneer 
stage 
of 
a 
new export 
industry. 
Based 
on 
the 
experiences 
of 
Thailand 
and 
the 
Philippines, 
Bernadette (1995) 
reports 
how 
long-term 
credits supported 
by 
the 
official 
development 
assistance 
(ODA) 
successfully 
promoted 
participation 
of 
small 
entrepreneurs, 
such 
as 
small- 
and medium-scale 
export-oriented 
businesses, 
including 
small 
farmers and 
agricultural 
cooperatives. 
The 
Case 
of 
Peru 
- 
What 
is 
known? 
As 
indicted 
in 
the 
PAD, 
the 
political 
crisis 
during 
2000-2001 
and 
external 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
lack 
of 
external 
financing 
and terms 
of 
trade 
deterioration 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
poverty 
rate 
in 
Peru. 
In 
2001, 
54.8 
% 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
lived 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
in 
Peru, 
which 
is 
7.1% 
greater 
than 
the 
poverty 
rate 
in 
1997. 
Poverty 
is 
more 
prominent 
in 
rural 
areas 
in 
Peru, 
the 
poverty 
rate 
was 64.7 
% 
in 
1997. The 
rural 
poverty 
rate 
is 
measured 
by 
the 
poverty 
head count 
as 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
living 
below 
the 
national 
rural 
poverty line. 
We 
do 
not 
have 
direct 
empirical 
evidence 
of 
the 
cost-benefit 
of 
investments 
in 
specific 
element 
of 
the 
project 
as 
they 
relate 
to 
addressing 
poverty reduction 
and 
job 
creation. 
This 
is 
particularly

true 
in 
relation 
measures 
which 
affect 
the 
rural 
poor. 
The 
analysis that 
will 
be 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
valuable 
new 
information 
and 
data 
on 
the 
specific 
relationship 
between 
trade, 
competitiveness, and 
growth 
in 
Peru. 
We 
do 
have general 
empirical 
evidence 
to 
support the 
conclusion 
that 
investment 
in 
trade 
facilitation 
programs support 
growth 
include 
studies 
linking 
reform 
and 
change 
in 
Latin 
America. 
Ambler, Cardia 
and 
Falazli 
(1999) and 
Dixon 
and 
Matthew 
(1996) 
found 
empirical 
support 
for 
commercial policies 
to 
promote 
exports can have substantial 
positive 
effect 
on 
competitiveness 
of 
exporting 
firms 
and 
hence 
economic 
growth. 
Among 
case 
studies, 
Alvarez 
and 
Crespi 
(2000) 
found 
that 
the 
export 
promotion 
policies 
have 
contributed 
to 
economic 
growth 
in 
Chile. 
Revesz 
and 
Lattimore 
(2001) 
examine characteristics 
of 
firms 
that 
participate 
in 
government 
business 
programs 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
such 
participation 
on 
their 
performance.  Such programs 
are 
designed 
to 
foster 
R&D 
and 
to 
facilitate export 
market 
access. 
The 
Integrated 
Framework 
(IF) 
diagnostic 
studies 
on 
trade and development 
completed 
by 
the 
Bank 
over 
the past 
two 
years 
provide 
successful 
case 
examples that 
export 
promotion 
can raise 
the 
income 
of 
the 
poorest 
in 
the 
developing 
economy 
(see 
for 
the 
example 
case 
of 
Cambodia 
in 
WTO, 
WT/IFSC/W/13,2002). 
It 
is 
also 
known 
that investment 
in 
port 
infrastructure 
and customs 
environment 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
particularly important 
for 
Peru 
due 
to 
the 
state 
of 
Peru’s 
ports 
and customs regime, 
which 
like 
other 
Latin 
American 
ports 
and 
customs 
systems, 
are 
rated 
as 
highly 
inefficient. 
“For an 
exporter, the 
costs 
of 
the 
inefficiencies 
of 
a 
typical 
port 
in 
Latin 
America 
are 
comparable 
to 
being 
9,000 
kilometers 
farther away 
from 
its 
customers.” 
(IDB 
2001). 
Other 
analysis 
of 
trade 
facilitation 
measures 
and 
Peru 
also 
document 
the 
need 
for 
improvements 
in 
Peru’s 
capacity and infrastructure. 
Wilson, Mann, 
Woo, 
Assanie, 
and 
Choi 
(2002) 
and 
Wilson, 
Mann 
and 
Otsuki 
(World 
Bank, 
2002 
mimeo) 
estimate 
the 
gains 
to 
trade 
from 
investment 
in 
trade 
facilitation, 
using 
a 
gravity 
model 
of 
bilateral 
trade 
flows. 
According 
to 
the 
specification 
in 
Wilson, 
Mann, 
Woo, 
Assanie, 
and 
Choi 
(2002) 
Peru’s 
exports 
would 
increase 
$2.7 
billion 
in 
manufactures and 
agriculture 
trade 
with 
improvement 
of 
port 
logistics 
by 
halfway 
up 
to 
the 
APEC 
average 
(23% 
increase) 
with 
investment 
in 
projects 
to 
raise 
efficiency 
in 
ports, 
such 
as 
those 
included 
in 
the 
loan 
among 
trading 
partners. 
Its 
exports 
would 
increase 
by 
$1.5 
billion 
with 
improvement 
of 
standards 
and conformance 
ability 
by 
halfway 
up 
to 
the 
APEC 
average 
(75% 
increase). 
Its 
exports 
would 
increase 
by 
$1 
12 
million 
with 
improvement 
of 
transparency 
and 
professionalism 
of 
customs 
and 
regulatory 
environments 
by 
halfway 
up 
to 
the 
APEC 
average 
(10% 
increase). 
Wilson, 
Mann 
and 
Otsuki 
also 
combines 
Dollar 
and 
Kraay 
(2001)’s 
result 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
trade 
on growth 
to 
estimate 
the 
Peru’s 
potential 
to 
increase 
per 
capita 
income 
by 
about 
$380 
as 
a 
result 
of 
improvements 
in 
ports 
and other trade 
facilitation 
measures 
in 
Peru 
its 
trading 
partners 
in 
the 
Asia Pacific 
region. 
This 
implies 
the 
potential 
of 
the 
export 
promotion 
finance 
to 
reduction 
in 
poverty 
in 
Peru through export 
expansion programs 
financed 
by 
the 
loan. 
Moreover, 
the 
costs 
of 
barriers 
in 
standards are 
likely 
much 
higher 
than 
tariffs 
to 
trade, 
including 
the 
case 
of 
Peru (Maskus 
and 
Wilson 
2001). 
In 
particular, testing 
and 
certification 
are 
serious 
obstacles 
for 
developing 
countries seeking 
to 
expand export 
markets 
(Wilson 
2001). 
The 
OECD 
- 
48 
- 
Page  53
estimates 
that 
standards 
alone 
represent 
between 
2 
and 
10% 
of 
final 
product 
costs 
(OECD 
1999). 
Many 
developing 
countries do 
not 
have 
the 
resources 
to 
apply 
standards 
and meet changing 
technical 
regulations. 
In 
Guatemala, 
for 
example, 
the 
budget 
for 
standards 
in 
2000 
totaled 
$1 
19,000 
(Kotschwar, 
Hufbauer and 
Wilson 
2001). 
This 
represents 
a 
small fraction 
of 
the 
government 
budget. 
Wilson, Mann, 
Otsuki 
(World 
Bank 
2002 
mimeo) 
also 
find 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Peru, 
improvements 
in 
standards systems 
in 
the 
Asia 
Pacific 
region, 
including 
the 
types 
of 
programs 
on 
quality 
standards 
included 
in 
the 
project 
could 
raise Peru’s exports 
by 
approximately 
1 1 
%. 
Moreover, product 
testing, 
plant 
inspections, 
and 
other procedures 
are 
also 
important 
parts 
of 
modern 
standards systems needed 
to 
support 
export 
expansion 
in 
Peru. 
consumers 
in 
Peru’s 
export 
markets 
are 
increasingly 
demanding such 
certifications 
of 
goods. 
Evidence 
indicates that programs 
to 
support 
best 
practice 
in 
testing 
and 
certification 
can raise 
quality, export 
success, 
and 
lead 
to 
expansion 
of 
employment 
opportunities, 
especially 
in 
small 
firms. 
Governments and 
A 
New 
Economic 
Competitiveness 
Assessment 
The 
project 
will 
include 
a 
new 
study 
and 
economic analysis 
on 
the 
linkages between 
trade 
facilitation, 
employment, 
and 
competitiveness 
in 
Peru. 
The 
government 
and 
Bank 
need 
this 
type 
of 
analysis 
to 
quantify 
the 
medium 
and 
long-term impact 
of 
reform 
measures 
and investment 
projects 
included 
in 
the 
loan. 
Results 
of 
the 
study 
will 
also 
help 
inform 
performance indicators 
in 
follow-on work 
in 
Peru. 
Moreover, 
the 
study 
will 
provide important new 
results 
on 
firm 
productivity, 
exports, 
and 
job 
creation 
in 
Peru relevant 
to 
potential 
lending 
operations elsewhere 
in 
Latin 
America. 
We 
plan 
to 
conduct 
the 
work 
jointly with 
a 
team 
from 
the 
National 
Competitiveness 
Council 
(CNC), 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
and 
academic 
experts 
in 
Peru 
and 
the 
region. 
The 
2.5 
project 
will 
assess 
the 
following: 
1. 
Impact 
of 
domestic trade 
facilitation 
reform 
on 
Peru’s 
export 
potential 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
port 
infrastructure 
and 
logistics, 
customs, 
and 
regulatory reform). 
2. 
The 
effect 
of 
the business 
support programs and 
export 
promotion 
institutions 
on 
firm’s 
competitiveness 
in 
Peru, 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
firms, 
and; 
3. 
The 
link 
between 
improved 
competitiveness 
in 
Peru 
and 
job 
creation, 
with 
particular 
relevance 
to 
areas 
outside 
urban 
centers. 
The 
studies 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
trade 
facilitation 
reform 
on 
Peru have 
to 
date 
focused 
on reform 
in 
importing 
countries. 
It 
is 
equally important, 
however, 
to know 
the 
effect 
of 
trade 
facilitation 
reform 
by 
exporters. 
We 
will 
undertake a cross-country trade 
analysis 
to 
examine 
the 
effect 
of 
improving port 
and 
customs 
efficiency, 
e-business 
usage, 
and 
standard 
harmonization 
on 
trade 
between 
Peru 
and 
importing 
partners 
in 
the 
Asia 
Pacific 
region. 
We 
plan 
on 
using 
data 
from 
World 
Integrated 
Trade 
Solutions 
(WITS) 
at 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
trade 
facilitation 
databases 
compiled 
by 
Wilson, Mann, 
Woo, 
Assanie, 
and 
Choi 
(2002). 
Using 
gravity 
model 
analysis, 
we 
plan 
on 
producing 
policy 
relevant 
estimators, 
and 
outlining 
policy 
priorities 
among 
reforms 
in

distinct 
trade 
facilitation 
components. 
The 
analysis 
will 
provide 
specific 
indicators 
of 
the 
effectives 
of 
project 
improvements 
in 
ports 
infrastructure, 
standards, 
and 
other 
components. 
The 
results 
can also 
be 
used 
for 
cost-benefit 
policy 
analysis 
by 
government authorities 
and 
the 
Bank. 
We 
believe 
estimated 
changes 
in 
Peru’s 
exports 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
the costs 
of 
investing 
in 
the 
trade 
facilitation 
reform. 
The 
study 
will 
identify 
the 
most 
cost 
effective way 
of 
the 
investment 
among the 
major 
trade 
facilitation 
components. 
Despite 
the importance, 
there 
are 
limited 
case 
studies 
and 
evidence that 
imply 
the 
impact 
of 
creating 
export 
promoting 
institutions, 
providing 
export 
credit, 
improving 
export 
financing 
system 
and 
enhancing 
quality 
practices 
on 
firm’s 
export 
performance and economic 
growth 
in 
Peru. 
Firm-level 
analysis 
that 
is 
complementary 
to 
this 
cross-country analysis 
is 
planned 
in 
order 
to 
identify 
(1) 
determinants 
to 
firm’s 
participation 
in 
export 
promotion 
programs, 
quality 
enhancement 
programs, and 
export 
credit 
and (2) 
the 
effect 
of 
these 
programs 
on 
firm’s 
productivity 
and 
export 
competitiveness. 
A 
firm-level 
survey 
would 
assist 
in 
analysis 
of 
the 
specific 
relationship 
between 
these 
factors 
and 
firm 
competitiveness 
in 
Peru. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
cover 
SMEs 
under 
a 
variety 
of 
environments 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
industries.  Selected 
firms 
would 
differ 
in 
ownership 
form 
and 
industries 
to be 
studied 
would 
include 
fresh produce, 
food 
processing, 
manufactures 
and services. 
Econometrics 
is 
a 
widely 
used 
method 
to 
analyze the 
impact 
of 
trade-related 
regulations 
and 
other 
economic environment 
using 
survey 
data 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Fink, 
Mattoo 
and 
Neagu 
2001; 
Micco, Clark 
and 
Dollar 
2002; 
Maskus, 
Wilson 
and 
Otsuki 
2001). 
The 
cost 
function 
approach 
using 
econometric 
methods, 
described 
in 
Maskus, 
Wilson 
and 
Otsuki 
(2001), 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
cost 
function, 
in 
an 
appropriate specification, embodies the 
information 
of 
firm 
productivity 
and cost 
efficiency 
in 
compliance 
with 
domestic and 
foreign 
requirements. 
Bank 
experience 
in 
developing 
the 
standards 
and 
trade 
database 
for 
17 
developing 
countries 
will 
provide 
a 
highly 
valuable template 
for 
such 
a targeted survey 
in 
Peru. 
The 
data 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
employment creation effect 
of 
enhancing 
quality 
standards 
so 
as 
to 
comply 
with 
foreign 
technical 
requirements. Since 
enhanced 
product 
standards 
will 
increase 
export 
competitiveness, 
this 
analysis 
will 
provide 
information 
on 
the 
link 
between 
export 
competitiveness 
and 
job 
creation. 
Particularly 
in 
rural 
areas 
in 
Peru, 
where 
poverty 
rate 
is 
prominent, 
a 
greater 
price 
premium 
of 
the 
agricultural 
products 
associated 
with 
enhanced 
quality 
standards 
will 
create 
profit 
margins. 
This 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
alleviation 
of 
rural 
poverty. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
research 
can 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
priority 
areas 
for follow-on 
capacity 
building 
in 
competitiveness 
of 
SMEs 
in 
Peru. 
Where 
expenditure 
data 
on 
the 
governmental 
programs 
and 
industrial policies 
that 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
surveyed 
firms 
are 
available, 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
will 
be conducted 
to 
identify 
most 
effective 
approach 
to 
achieve a 
given 
level 
of 
increase 
in 
firm’s 
productivity 
or 
competitiveness. 
We 
plan 
on 
engaging experts 
in 
Centro 
de 
Negocios, 
Pontificia 
Universidad 
Catolica 
of 
Peru 
and other 
leading 
universities 
in 
Peru 
in 
this 
research. 
The 
total 
analysis 
would 
require 
2.5 
years 
to 
complete 
and 
ready 
for 
consideration 
prior to 
the 
project end 
date.

Procurement 
A. 
Procurement 
Arrangements 
Procurement 
for 
the proposed 
project 
will 
be 
carried out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
Guidelines: 
Procurement 
Under 
IBRD 
Loans and 
IDA 
Credits”, 
published 
in 
January 1995 
(revised January/August 
1996, 
September 
1997 
and 
January 
1999); 
and 
“Guidelines: 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers” 
published 
in 
January 1997 (revised 
in 
September

May 
2002). 
1 
) 
Procurement Institutional 
Arrangements 
A 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
has 
been created 
specifically 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
project’s 
design 
and 
implementation 
needs. 
As 
a 
separate 
administrative 
unit, 
it 
would 
assist 
the 
PCM 
in 
tasks 
directly 
related 
to 
project coordination, 
monitoring 
and evaluation, disbursements and 
reporting. The 
PCU 
is 
adequately 
staffed 
by 
a 
Project 
General 
Coordinator; 
three 
TechnicaUSector Specialists; 
one 
Procurement 
Officer 
(PO); 
one 
Financial 
Administration 
Officer 
(FAO) 
and 
three 
administrative officers. Project 
coordination 
will 
encompass 
follow-up, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
including 
technical 
support 
to 
such 
agencies 
during 
component 
implementation. 
Technical 
Specialists 
will 
carry 
out overall project coordination 
with 
Participating 
Agencies 
(PAS) 
involved 
in 
execution 
of 
their 
respective components. 
Procurement 
and 
financial 
administration 
specialists 
will 
be 
responsible 
for review 
of 
procurement plans proposed 
by 
component’s 
leading 
agencies 
and 
provide 
guidance 
for 
their 
preparation 
and 
implementation. 
They 
will 
review 
also procurement documents 
and 
contract 
award 
requests 
submitted 
by 
said 
agencies 
and 
will 
provide 
them 
with 
technical 
assistance, 
as 
needed. 
Project administrative 
staff 
will 
undertake budget, accounting, and treasury 
related 
tasks 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
PCM’s 
Administration 
Secretariat 
for 
contracting 
and 
payment 
purposes. 
2) 
Procurement 
methods: 
The 
methods

B) 
Assessment 
of 
the 
agency’s 
capacity 
to implement procurement 
The 
institutional 
arrangement 
described 
above 
were 
assessed 
and 
found 
satisfactory. 
The 
Project Operation 
Manual 
will 
incorporate, 
in 
addition 
to 
procedures 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and selection 
of 
consultants, 
standard 
project 
documents 
agreed 
to 
be 
used 
for 
each 
procurement method, 
as 
well 
as 
model 
contracts 
for 
goods 
procured 
on 
the basis 
of 
price 
comparison 
(shopping) 
procedures. 
As 
part 
of 
project preparation 
stage, 
an 
agency 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
PCM, 
as 
a 
project 
procurement 
agency, 
was 
carried 
out 
on 
Oct. 
14-16,2002 and 
cleared 
by 
the 
RPA 
Office 
on 
Oct. 
17,2002. 
The 
assessment 
reviewed 
and 
discussed 
with 
PCM 
key 
staff 
the 
PCU’s 
proposed 
organizational 
structure 
and 
its 
interaction 
with 
a 
set 
of 
government and 
private 
sector 
agencies 
directly 
responsible 
for 
management 
of 
procurement 
tasks at 
several 
project 
components. 
Regardless 
the 
qualifications 
and 
aggregate 
experience 
of 
the core 
technical and 
administrative-financial 
team, 
there 
is 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
project 
could 
face an 
initial 
learning 
stage 
where the team 
will 
have 
to 
acquire and 
master 
Bank 
procedures 
on 
the 
job. 
To 
address 
this 
risk, 
a Procurement 
Improvement 
Action 
Plan 
was 
prepared and 
agreed. 
It 
is 
attached 
below. 
Most 
tasks 
proposed 
in 
the 
action 
plan 
are 
to 
be 
completed 
not 
later 
than 
loan 
effectiveness. 
The 
PCU 
has 
committed 
to 
a 
timely 
implementation 
of 
said 
plan. 
- 
53 
- 
Page  58
The 
risks 
identified 
in 
this 
assessment 
include: 
(i) 
the 
possibility 
of 
contracting inexperienced 
and 
unskilled 
staff 
to 
carry out 
procurement and 
financial 
administration 
tasks; 
and 
(ii) 
unrealistic 
procurement planning. 
The 
Procurement 
Improvement 
Action 
Plan 
prepared 
during 
the 
capacity 
assessment 
exercise 
has 
incorporated 
specific 
tasks 
aimed 
at 
addressing 
those 
issues, 
namely: 
(i) 
provision 
of 
Bank 
procurement training; 
and 
(ii) 
submission 
to 
the 
Bank 
of 
a 
Global 
Procurement 
Plan 
prior 
to 
negotiations 
and, 
a 
Detailed 
Procurement 
Plan 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project implementation 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
loan 
effectiveness. 
The 
overall 
project 
risk 
for 
procurement 
is 
AVERAGE. 
The 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
resulting 
from 
the 
PCU’s 
capacity 
assessment 
was 
AVERAGE. 
Nevertheless, the 
project 
agency’s 
PCU 
submitted 
a 
global 
procurement 
plan for 
project 
implementation 
that 
was 
found 
satisfactory.  Since 
PCM 
does 
not 
have 
in 
place an 
on-line 
management 
information 
system 
with 
the 
capability 
of 
carrying 
out 
project 
monitoring, 
control 
and 
reporting 
in 
a manner 
timely 
and reliable, the 
PCU 
is 
not 
be 
eligible for 
FMR-based 
disbursements 
on 
procurement 
reporting 
grounds. 
Thus, 
a 
sample 
project 
management 
report 
to 
reflect 
progress 
during 
project 
implementation 
in 
a manner satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
must 
be 
submitted 
not 
later 
than 
loan 
effectiveness. 
This 
sample 
report 
will 
serve 
as 
a basis 
to 
issue 
project 
management 
reports 
to 
the 
Bank, 
on 
a 
twice-yearly 
basis. 
C) 
Procurement 
Plan 
The 
global 
procurement 
plan 
for 
project implementation 
has 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
aggregate 
amounts and the procurement methods shown 
in 
Table 
A 
of 
this 
Annex. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
each 
calendar 
year, 
the 
Borrower 
will 
update the Procurement 
Plan 
including 
a 
detailed 
procurement 
schedule 
for 
the 
upcoming 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
As 
to 
the 
Borrower, 
said 
plan 
will 
provide 
a clear 
framework 
for 
annual 
project 
implementation 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
will 
provide 
the 
Bank 
project 
team a clear 
ground 
to 
rationalize project supervision 
efforts 
at 
implementation 
stage. 
D) 
Frequency 
of 
Procurement 
Supervision 
As 
provided 
in 
the 
capacity 
assessment 
report, 
prior 
review 
supervision 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
from 
Bank 
offices. 
In 
addition, 
the 
same 
assessment 
of 
the 
PCU 
has 
recommended one 
full 
supervision 
mission 
to 
visit 
the 
field 
aimed 
to perform 
a post 
review 
of 
procurement 
actions. 
Based 
on 
the 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
(AVERAGE) 
the 
post-review 
field 
analysis 
should cover 
a 
sample 
of 
not 
less 
than 
1 
in 
10 
contracts 
signed. 
Post 
Review 
Ratio 
One 
in 
5 
contracts 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
selection 
of 
consultants 
for 
employment 
of 
firms 
and 
individuals.

Financial Management 
Assessment 
Implementing 
Entity 
The 
project 
will 
be 
executed 
by 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
(PCM) 
through 
a Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU)

through 
the 
participation 
of 
public 
and 
private 
sector

benefit 
from 
project 
implementation. 
The 
PCU 
will 
have 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
project 
contracting,  coordination, 
disbursements, 
monitoring 
and 
reporting. 
The 
proDosed

Executive 
Summary 
and 
Conclusion 
Overall 
conclusion: 
In 
general, 
the 
proposed 
Financial 
Management  Arrangements 
for 
the 
project 
are sound. 
However, 
the 
PCU 
has 
been created 
specifically 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
project 
design 
and 
implementation 
needs 
and therefore 
has 
no 
experience 
with 
the 
execution 
of 
IBRD 
funds. 
As 
a result 
of 
the 
assessment, an 
extensive 
time-bound Financial 
Management 
(FM) 
action 
plan 
has 
been 
agreed. 
Successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
action 
plan 
would 
result 
in 
adequate 
project 
FM 
arrangements 
in 
place 
by 
the 
effectiveness 
date. 
Risk 
Assessment 
The full 
results 
of 
the risk 
Assessment are contained 
in 
Annex 
I.; 
Country 
specific 
risk 
has 
been 
assessed 
as 
moderate 
due 
to 
robust 
financial 
administration  legislation, 
highly 
trained 
and 
dedicated 
staff 
in 
financial 
management  posts 
and

management system 
at 
national 
level. 
Based 
on 
the 
material 
weakness 
identified 
during 
the 
assessment, 
entity 
specific and 
control 
risk 
ratings 
are 
substantial. 
Notwithstanding, 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
FM 
Action 
Plan 
prior 
to 
effectiveness 
would 
result 
in 
an 
entity 
specific 
and 
control 
risk 
rating 
of 
moderate. 
The 
maior 
weaknesses 
observed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
assessment 
included: 
Legal Framework:- 
the 
current regulations 
that govern 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Implementing 
Entity 
do 
not 
envisage 
the 
expanded 
functions 
which 
project implementation 
would 
entail. 
Organization 
and 
Stafing:- 
Key 
Personnel 
including 
Financial 
Management and Procurement 
staff 
have 
not 
been 
hired 
as 
yet. 
Information 
Systems:- 
The 
entity 
is 
still 
in 
the 
process 
of 
analyzing available alternatives 
for 
the 
acquisition 
and 
implementation 
of 
an 
integrated 
information 
system. 
The maior 
strenpth 
observed: 
Internal 
Controls 
including internal audits:- 
The project 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
accordance 
with 
1) 
the 
National 
System 
of 
Control which 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
the 
Republic 
and 
2) 
the 
National 
System 
of 
Accounting which 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
Accountant General 
of 
the 
Republic. 
The operations 
of 
the 
Implementing 
Entity 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
the  independent 
internal 
audit 
function 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
evaluating  compliance 
with 
these 
control 
systems. 
The 
Unit 
is 
staffed 
with 
highly 
trained 
and 
experienced 
professionals 
and 
has 
a 
comprehensive 
annual 
review 
plan 
and 
follow 
system 
to 
ensure 
timely 
implementation  of 
corrective action. 
Country 
Issues 
Financial 
AccountabiW- 
A 
Country 
Financial  Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
was 
conducted 
in 
2000 
and 
the 
Action 
Plan 
agreed 
with 
the 
Government 
in 
September, 
2001 
is 
being 
implemented. 
The 
diagnostic 
work 
concluded 
that the 
financial 
management 
tools 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
Congress 
and the 
Executive 
Branch 
included 
1) 
robust 
financial administration legislation 
2) 
highly 
trained 
and 
dedicated 
staff 
in 
financial 
management  posts 
3) 
a 
highly 
effective 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system. 
Public 
Sector 
Management 
and 
Decentralization:- 
One 
of 
the Strategic 
Elements 
of 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
issued 
in 
August 
2002, 
is 
to 
support 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms. 
Priority 
issues 
include 
public 
sector 
management 
and 
decentralization. 
While 
most 
public 
entities 
benefit 
from 
the 
integrated 
financial 
management 
systems 
and 
improved 
financial 
controls,  the 
overall 
quality 
of 
public 
expenditure 
management 
suffers 
from 
overly 
centralized 
decision-making 
and 
frequent 
and 
non-transparent 
use 
of 
executive 
decree 
authority 
to modify 
budgetary allocations.

Legal Framework 
and 
Organization 
and 
Stafflng 
The 
original 
diagnosis 
of 
a 
weak 
institution 
framework 
for 
the 
implementing 
agency 
(see 
above) 
has 
been 
resolved 
with 
the Government's 
decision 
to 
create 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit. 
This 
-61

Page  66
entity 
will 
have 
full 
authority 
to 
receive 
and 
manage 
funds. 
The 
organizational 
and 
staffing 
arrangements 
being 
proposed have been 
found 
satisfactory. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
unit 
and 
its 
staffing 
will 
be required 
prior to 
effectiveness. 
Accounting 
Policies 
and 
Procedures 
The 
Project 
will 
use 
the 
National 
Chart 
of 
Accounts- 
Plan Contable 
Gubemamental del 
Sistema 
Nacional 
de 
Contabilidad, 
which 
is 
currently 
in 
use 
by 
the 
PCM. 
In 
it’s 
present 
form, the 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
does 
not 
capture 
the 
project 
design i.e 
project 
components, 
disbursement 
categories, 
financing 
sources, 
however, 
amendment 
of 
the 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
is 
part 
of 
the 
proposed 
FM 
Action 
Plan. 
Accounts 
will 
be 
prepared 
using 
the 
cash basis 
and 
the accounting 
function 
will 
be 
computerized. 
Planning 
and 
Budgeting 
will 
be 
in 
line 
with 
the 
general government procedures regulated 
by 
the 
Annual 
Budget 
Law 
for 
2002.The 
operating 
and 
capital 
budget 
will 
be 
prepared and 
submitted 
to 
Congress 
on 
an 
annual basis 
on 
or 
before 
October 
31, 
each 
year. 
The 
draft 
budget 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Congress 
in 
November 
this 
year 
and 
will 
be 
based 
on 
planned 
expenditures 
by 
component, disbursement category 
and 
financing 
source. 
The 
Financial 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
includes  the 
finalization 
of 
the 
Operational 
Manual. 
Prior 
to 
issuing 
the 
Bank’s 
no-objection to 
same, 
due 
care 
will 
be 
exercised 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project  accounting 
system 
will 
have  the  capacity 
to 
record 
assets, 
liabilities, 
and 
financial 
transaction 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
produce 
financial 
statements 
which 
are 
both 
useful 
to 
project 
management 
and satisfy the 
IBRD’s 
fiduciary 
standards. 
Information 
Systems 
The 
entity 
is 
still 
in 
the 
process 
of 
analyzing  available 
alternatives 
for 
the 
acquisition 
and 
implementation 
of 
an integrated 
information 
system. 
Prior 
to 
effectiveness 
further 
work 
will 
need 
to  be  performed 
in 
order 
to 
evaluate 
the 
final 
proposal 
and  the  capacity 
to 
meet 
bank 
requirements. 
Project 
and 
Financial 
Reporting 
Financial 
Statements, 
prepared 
on 
the 
cash 
basis, 
will 
follow 
National Norms 
which 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
In 
addition 
to 
monthly 
financial 
statements, 
the 
PCU 
will 
prepare 
semi-annual 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
comprising 
Project 
Financial 
Statements, 
physical 
progress 
and procurement 
sections. 
The 
Annual Financial 
Statements 
will 
include: 
(i) 
the Statement 
of 
Receipts 
and 
Payments 
by 
Funding 
Source 
(with 
expenditures 
classified 
by 
budgetary 
line 
and/or 
disbursement 
category); 
(ii) 
Uses 
of 
Funds 
by 
Project 
Activities (including 
budget comparison); 
and 
(iii) 
the 
Special 
Account 
Reconciliation 
Statement. 
Finalization 
of 
the 
form 
and 
content 
of 
the 
FMRs 
and 
the 
systems 
and 
procedures 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
order 
to 
generate 
the reports 
are 
conditions 
of 
negotiations.

assessment 
is

Assessment dated 
October

The Improvement 
Action 
Plan 
will 
address 
the 
key 
risks 
identified. 
Supervision 
Plan 
Given 
the 
risk 
profile 
of 
the 
PCU 
and 
the 
extensiveness 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
a 
financial 
management 
supervision 
mission 
should 
be 
performed 
prior 
to 
effectiveness. 
This 
mission 
will 
focus 
in 
the 
Organizational 
Arrangements, 
and 
the 
Information 
and 
Reporting 
Systems 
which 
are 
to 
be 
implemented 
and 
involve 
an 
exhaustive 
review 
of 
the 
Accounting 
Systems 
and 
Procedures. 
During 
the 
first 
year 
of 
implementation 
it 
is 
recommended that 
two 
supervision 
missions be performed, supplemented 
by 
quarterly reviews 
of 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Report 
(FMRS). 
Thereafter 
on-going 
supervision 
should 
be 
through continuation 
of 
the 
FMR 
desk 
reviews, 
annual 
review 
of 
the 
external audit 
reports, 
and 
at 
least one 
supervision 
mission 
per 
year. 
The 
missions 
will 
include, among other activities,  a 
specific 
review 
of 
the 
compliance 
with 
the 
agreed 
appointment 
of 
external 
auditors 
and 
that a satisfactory Records Management 
System 
for 
the 
PCU 
is 
in 
place 
by 
no 
later 
than 
one 
year 
after effectiveness.

Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
Audits 
As 
part 
of 
the 
PCM, 
project 
transactions 
undertaken 
by 
the 
PCU 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
review 
by 
the 
Internal 
Audit 
Department 
of 
the 
entity. 
The 
Internal 
Audit 
function 
within 
the 
PCM 
is 
independent 
and 
reports 
to 
the 
country’s 
supreme 
audit 
institution 
(Contraloria 
General 
de 
la 
Reptiblica-CGR) 
and 
to 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
of 
the 
PCM. 
The 
Unit 
is 
staffed 
with 
experienced 
and 
trained 
professionals 
including 
Ten 
( 
10) 
Public 
Accountants 
licensed 
in 
Peru, 
One 
(1) 
lawyer 
and One 
(1) 
Business 
Administrator. 
The 
Scope 
and 
Coverage 
of 
the 
overall 
Annual Internal 
Control 
Plan 
will 
be 
expanded 
to 
cover 
project 
activities.  The 
Unit 
prepares 
semi-annual reports 
which 
evaluate the 
corrective 
actions taken 
in 
response 
to 
Internal 
Control 
findings. 
The most 
recent 
report 
dated 
July 
27, 
2002 
showed that 
of 
the 
78% 
(in 
number) 
of 
the 
issues 
raised 
during 
the 
first 
semester 
had 
been 
satisfactorily 
corrected. 
External 
Audits 
Annual project financial 
statements 
will 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing, 
by 
an 
independent 
firm 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank.  The  audit 
will 
be 
performed 
in 
accordance 
with 
terms 
of 
reference 
(TORS) 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
audit opinions 
would 
cover 
the 
project  financial 
statement, 
Special  Account,  Statement 
of 
Expenditures 
(SOEs), 
compliance 
with 
loan 
agreement 
and applicable 
financial  laws 
and 
regulations. 
The 
auditors 
would 
perform 
at 
least 
one 
interim 
visit 
per 
year. 
After 
each 
interim 
visit 
a 
memorandum 
on 
internal 
controls 
(“management 
letter”) 
would 
be 
produced 
to 
ensure 
that 
corrective action 
is 
addressed 
prior 
to 
year end. 
The 
PCU 
through 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
the 
Republic, 
will 
appoint 
the auditors 
within 
two 
(2) 
months after 
loan 
effectiveness. Expenditures 
in 
respect 
of 
audit 
fees 
will 
be 
financed 
with 
loan 
proceeds 
under the consultants’ 
services category.

Disbursement Arrangements 
Disbursements 
will 
be 
transaction-based 
(ie 
against  Statements 
of 
expenditure 
(SOEs), 
full 
documentation, 
direct 
payments 
or 
special  commitments). 
The 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
maintained  and 
operated 
by 
the 
PCU 
in 
the 
Bunco 
de 
la 
Nucion 
in 
United 
States 
dollars. 
Deposits 
into 
the 
Special 
Account 
and replenishments 
up 
to 
the 
authorized 
allocation 
set 
out 
in 
the 
legal 
agreement 
would 
be 
made 
on 
the basis 
of 
applications 
for 
withdrawals 
prepared 
by 
the 
PCU 
and accompanied 
by 
the supporting 
documentation 
in 
accordance 
with 
Bank 
disbursement 
procedures. 
The  Special 
Account 
is 
only 
to 
be 
used 
for  eligible 
expenditures under  the 
loan 
(under 
no 
circumstances 
may 
funds 
in 
the 
Special 
Account be 
used 
to 
cover 
the 
share 
of 
expenditures 
corresponding 
to 
the 
counterpart). 
When 
payments 
are 
to 
be 
made 
in 
local 
currency,  the 
Bank’s 
portion 
of 
the 
expenses 
will 
be 
converted 
to local 
currency 
and 
transferred 
to 
a 
local 
currency 
account 
which 
the 
PCU 
will 
operate 
and 
maintain 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the project. 
This 
account 
will 
be 
used 
to 
issue 
checks 
or 
initiate 
transfers 
to 
the 
providers 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
financing provided 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Counterpart 
funds 
will 
be 
also deposited 
into 
a 
separate 
local 
currency account 
in 
accordance 
with 
Budget 
Allocations 
approved 
for 
the 
PCU 
within 
the 
PCM. 
Upon 
request 
from 
the 
Borrower 
and subject 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
approval, payments 
may be 
made: 
(i) 
directly 
to 
a 
third 
party 
(supplier 
or 
consultant) 
for 
goods 
and 
services; 
and 
(ii) 
to 
a 
commercial 
bank 
for 
expenditures against a 
World 
Bank 
Special 
Commitment covering 
a 
commercial 
banks 
letter 
of 
credit. 
The 
PCU 
will 
operate 
and 
maintain 
all 
bank 
accounts 
for 
the 
project. 
Participating 
Agencies 
will 
certify 
to 
the 
PCU 
that  contracted 
project  activities 
are 
performed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
respective 
PIA 
and 
submit 
a 
request 
for 
payment 
along 
with 
the 
invoice 
and 
required 
supporting 
documentation. The 
PCU 
will 
then 
complete 
the 
cycle (invoice 
approval, payment 
authorization, 
check 
signing, 
check 
issuance  and 
wire 
transfers, 
monthly 
bank 
and 
special 
account 
reconciliations).
