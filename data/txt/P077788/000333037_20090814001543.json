outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the genesis of this project was the Government's vision\n            that improvement of Peru's competitiveness was a\n            necessary condition for promoting growth of nontraditional\n            exports. Giving the project the highest visibility by\n            placing it under the direct supervision of the Prime\n            Minister's office was strong indication of commitment\n            to the project's objectives. A major component\n            represents a group of outputs that are expected to have a\n            measurable impact on the development objectives. Component\n            three dealing with access to financing did not even produce\n            a significant output. Only major components that meet\n            certain Bank criteria based on the logical framework linking\n            outputs to outcomes should be considered in a project's\n            design. While TA loans are not a significant contributor in\n            terms of the size of the Bank's overall loan portfolio,\n            they represent an important part of the Bank's economic\n            development mission. This project supported several\n            innovative initiatives such as the Regional Strategic Export\n            Plan (PERX) and the feasibility study for a multi-modal\n            logistic zone. TA loans can provide effective support for\n            private sector development through carefully targeted\n            interventions to overcome market failures. On the other\n            hand, technical assistance, particularly institution\n            building, is not a one-time support activity. The assumption\n            that one operation will be sufficient to resolve instances\n            of market failure is not always valid; it may resolve only\n            one of many issues conspiring against development objectives."}, "docdt": "2009-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
