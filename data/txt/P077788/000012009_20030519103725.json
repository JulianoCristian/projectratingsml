Trade Facilitation and Productivity\n            Improvement Technical Assistance Project development\n            objectives are to assist the GOP in: (a) establishing a more\n            streamlined, integrated, and effective institutional, and\n            policy framework to increase nontraditional exports; and (b)\n            developing, and implementing initiatives designed to foster\n            the entrance of new export market participants, especially\n            small and medium producers. The project would achieve these\n            objectives by providing technical assistance to: (1)\n            elaborate and implement a national plan to improve\n            Peru's competitiveness drawing from locally-generated\n            regional strategies, and partnerships with the private\n            sector; (2) strengthening mechanisms of interaction, and\n            cooperation between private, and public parties at regional,\n            national, and local levels; (3) disseminating information,\n            and training to the private sector, and selected public\n            sector institutions; (4) conducting pilot and small scale\n            initiatives to test alternative schemes to improve quality,\n            and productivity; (5) analyzing new market opportunities,\n            instruments for trade facilitation, inefficiencies in the\n            distribution chain, and export processing, and, preparing\n            design, and feasibility studies for infrastructure\n            bottlenecks in transport logistics; and (6) refocusing, and\n            overhauling key, public sector entities to achieve their\n            institutional objectives, and boost Peru's competitiveness."}, "docdt": "2003-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
