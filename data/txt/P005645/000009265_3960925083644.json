In addition,\n            the project was to provide assistance for strengthening the\n            technical capacity and financial management of the Office of\n            Cereals (OC). The main project component, accounting for\n            more than 80 percent of total project costs, was\n            construction, rehabilitation and expansion of port and\n            storage silos and related facilities. The project had a slow\n            start due to the difficult relations between the OC and its\n            consulting engineers and the time taken to select a firm for\n            silo supervision. This project was considered to be urgent\n            because rapidly rising consumption of grain, brought about\n            by rising per capita income, increased urbanization and a\n            high population growth rate, was increasingly being met by\n            imports and this was putting strains on the\n            Government's systems for grain importing, storage and distribution."}, "docdt": "1991-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
