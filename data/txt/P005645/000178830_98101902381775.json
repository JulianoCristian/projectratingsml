complete the conversion from bag to bulk handling in\n            Tunisia's distribution system for imported grain to\n            meet the rapidly rising demand for industrially milled\n            grain. The project consists of: (a) rehabilitation,\n            adaptation for imports, and expansion of the existing port\n            silo at Bizerte, and construction of a port silo at\n            Ghannouch; (b) construction of three storage silos at Sfax,\n            Beja, and Gafsa, and expansion from 8,000 tons to 28,000\n            tons of the storage silo at Kalaa Seghira; (c)\n            rehabilitation of the Manouba storage silo; (d) construction\n            and rehabilitation of silo rail sidings; (e) acquisition of\n            about 50 bulk rail hopper cars; and (f) technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1981-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
