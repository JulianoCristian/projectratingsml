MONGOLIA: EDUCATION FOR ALL FAST TRACK INITIATIVE (EFA-FTI)
             CATALYTIC TRUST FUND PROJECT
                         GRANT
                     MARCH 16, 2007

                       TO MONGOLIA

                     DECEMBER 3, 2010
                            Extension of Closing Date
1.     The closing date for MONGOLIA: EDUCATION FOR ALL FAST TRACK
INITIATIVE (EFA-FTI) CATALYTIC TRUST FUND, Grant No. P108776 (TF058043) will be
extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2012.

2.      The Mongolian EFA FTI Project has been implemented well and has contributed to
improving access to and completion of basic education (primary and secondary education), with
particular attention to rural areas; improving the quality of basic education; expanding access to
pre-school education in rural areas: and improving project management. The entire $29.4
million grant fund was transferred to the Special Account in tranches between 2007 and 2010.
As of September 30, 2010, 87 percent of the total grant was disbursed, with only 13 percent
remaining.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete construction of the Baganuur school
complex for the following reasons. The procurement process began in 2009. However, MECS's
misjudgment of whether the bidders met the technical requirements resulted in a mistaken
representation to the Bank to obtain no-objection to reject all bids. A bidder's complaint in
February 2010 led the Bank to engage a third party review which delayed the process until the
Regional Procurement Office cleared the case for rebidding. Given the short construction
seasons in Mongolia, there is a need to extend the project for two years in order to complete
construction and equip the school. The schools in Baganuur district, a mining community near
Ulaanbaatar, are currently operating on three shifts. The construction of a new school not only
will improve the teaching and learning environment, but also enables an extension of
instructional time and improve learning outcomes. This is the only outstanding procurement
issue. The PDO will not change as a result of extension.

4. The implementation schedule is as follows:

   December 3, 2010                  Advertisement
   January 14, 2011                  Receipt of bids
   January 31, 2011                  Bid Evaluation
   February 10, 2011                 Contract Award
   April 1, 2011                     Construction begins

5.      This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was due to delays in
the release of the First tranche of the 2009 Grant and delays in procurement of the Baganuur
school              for             the             reasons               cited            above.
