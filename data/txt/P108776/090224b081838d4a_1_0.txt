                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall EFA FTI goal is to ensure universal completion of basic education and to close the gender gap and rural/urban gap in enrollment and school completion by

                         and secondary education), with particular attention to rural areas; (2) improve the quality of basic education; (3) expand access to pre-school education in rural areas;
                         and (4) improve project management.

                         The Mongolian EFA-FTI Project is financed by the international donor community and administered by the World Bank. The objective of EFA-FTI (now known as the Global
                         Partnership for Education) is to provide financial assistance to help low- and middle-income countries around the world achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on
                         education. Mongolia was approved by the EFA-FTI Board of Directors to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of $29.4 million to improve access to and quality of basic education. The
                         Project has successfully improved the teaching and learning environment in Mongolian schools. It has provided universal coverage in training of first grade and dormitory teachers,

                         training of teachers in Ulaanbaatar Teachers’ College, and mobile ICT teaching stations. The Project has also provided mobile ger-kindergarten services to herders and rehabilitated
                         schools throughout the country. The remaining activity is the construction of the Baganuur school complex and the supply of the furniture and equipment to the school. Some project
                         outcome indicators may not be met, since the original targets were set at the sectoral level and were beyond the scope of the project's interventions. However, almost all the outputs
                         of the project were fully achieved as projected. This is the last Implementation Status Report before the project's closing date of December 31, 2012.
