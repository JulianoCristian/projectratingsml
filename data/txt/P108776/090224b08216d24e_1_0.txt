                         The Mongolian Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Project is financed by the international donor community and administered by the World Bank. The objective of EFA-
                         FTI (now known as the Global Partnership for Education) is to provide financial assistance to help low- and middle-income countries around the world achieve the Millennium
                         Development Goal (MDG) on education. Mongolia was approved by the EFA-FTI Board of Directors to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of $29.4 million to improve access to and
                         quality of basic education.

                         Almost all PDO-level outcome indicators have been met following the most recent restructuring and extension of the closing date. Almost all of the outputs of the project were
                         achieved as originally projected.

                         The Project has successfully improved the teaching and learning environment in Mongolian schools. It has provided universal coverage in training of first grade and dormitory
                         teachers, training of teachers in Ulaanbaatar Teachersâ€™ College, and mobile ICT teaching stations. The Project has also provided mobile ger-kindergarten services to herders and
                         rehabilitated schools throughout the country. The remaining activity is the construction of the Baganuur school complex. This activity is expected to be completed by December 16,
                         2013.
