                                                         reason for the construction delay
                                                         was challenges with

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. Mongolia has made remarkable economic progress since its transition
in 1990 from a planned economy to a market-based one, while democratizing along the way.
Between 2003 and 2008, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 8 percent in
real terms, and this helped expand government revenues and reduce poverty. Nonetheless, nearly
a third of the population remained poor, living on less than US$1 a day.

2.      Sectoral Context. Contributors to such pockets of poverty have included significant
urban-rural disparities in both educational access and quality. A 2006 household survey revealed
a 7.3 percentage point completion rate difference between urban and rural students at the primary
level and even higher ones at the lower and upper secondary levels (17.4 and 14.3, respectively).
At the pre-primary level in 2007, a high proportion of the 57 percent of the relevant age group
enrolled in early childhood education and development programs lived in urban areas, putting a
damper on the readiness of 6-year-olds in rural areas for primary schooling. 2 Urban-rural
differences in education quality were revealed in the “2005 National Assessment of Students’
Achievement” in which eighth grade students averaged a disappointing 50 percent correct on the
mathematics test, with students in Ulaanbaatar scoring well above the mean and those from
provincial centers and district schools well below.

3.       Determinants of inequitable access and uneven quality included both demand-side and
supply-side factors. Among the demand-side factors were poor parents’ inability to pay the direct
and indirect cost of schooling – books, transportation, uniforms, and foregone labor in herding or
other income-generating activities. The supply-side factors included inequitable supply of school
infrastructure (including eco-friendly and low-cost energy and heating systems), boarding
facilities for herders’ children, teaching and learning materials, equipment, school supplies, and
teachers’ professional development.

4.     Within this context, both Mongolia’s Government Action Plan (GAP) and its Economic
Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS) prioritized strengthening basic
education in the country. In addition, the Fast Track Initiative, established to assist countries
meet their goals of attaining a perfect 100 percent basic education completion rate was seen as an
extremely relevant partner.

5.      These priorities were reflected in the nation’s Education Sector Master Plan 2006-2015
(ESMP) and its goals to: (i) to upgrade education quality at all levels of schooling and produce
citizens who can function effectively in a modern market economy; (ii) to provide education
services that can be accessed by children in all parts of the country, particularly rural areas, and
by poor and vulnerable groups; and (iii) to improve the management capacity of central and local
educational institutions at all levels. A major education reform in the early years of the ESMP
(2008-2009) was the increase of the length of basic education from 11 to 12 years. This reform
required more resources to finance the additional grade level and achievement targets, including

    A change in policy in 2006 required 6 year-olds to enter grade 1 starting in 2008-09.


                                                            1
enhanced teacher training for the new grade, additional furniture and learning materials,
expansion and rehabilitation of the infrastructure (including dormitories for herders’ children),
and the development of appropriate curricula. In addition, modern facilities were needed, such as
Information and Communication Technology (ICT), to keep teachers up-to-date.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The original Project Grant Agreement of March 2007 was prepared according to the
requirements of the Education For All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), a multi-agency
partnership, and as a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund. Given that this was a trust fund for which
the Bank had fiduciary responsibility, the grants were supervised by the Bank, but the grant
guidelines were formulated by the EFA-FTI governing board. These guidelines did not call for
alignment with Bank operational procedures and guidelines, including the preparation of a
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) with its project development objectives and key indicators.
Instead, grant documents were simply to present the purposes and activities of the first year of a
possible 3-year of EFA-FTI grant support with continued funding contingent upon successful
project implementation and funds disbursement over the grant year. The purpose and activities of
the Mongolian EFA-FTI grant for the first year (2007) were: (i) strengthening the capacity of
primary school teachers; (ii) building mobile pre-schools; (iii) construction and rehabilitation of
schools; (iv) improvement of rural school facilities; and e) grant management. In accordance
with EFA-FTI guidelines at the time, the key outcome indicators were aligned with the goals and
targets of the country’s ESMP, mainly covering basic education enrollment and transition
measures.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.     On July 31, 2009, shortly after the beginning of the third grant year, a Program Document
(PD) – similar to a World Bank PAD – was prepared for the project. The PD retrofitted on the
three annual Grant Agreements (for 2007, 2008 and 2009) an integrated/overall Project
Development Objective (PDO) statement and key performance indicators, plus a results
framework, and general agreements about project management, procurement, financial
management, safeguards, and risks.

8.       Project Development Objectives. The overall EFA-FTI goal was to ensure universal
completion of basic education and to close the gender gap and rural/urban gap in enrollment and
school completion by 2015. To help Mongolia move towards the goal of quality basic education
for all, the EFA-FTI grant aimed to: (i) improve access to and completion of basic education
(primary and secondary education), with particular attention to rural areas; (ii) improve the quality
of basic education; (iii) expand access to pre-school education in rural areas; and (iv) improve
project management.

9.     Key Indicators. The key project outcome indicators specified in the 2009 PD were: (i)
gross enrollment ratio in primary education, disaggregated by gender; (ii) gross enrollment ratio
in secondary education, disaggregated by gender; (iii) net intake in grade 1; (iv) transition rate
from primary to secondary; (v) completed baseline measures of grade 5 achievement in rural
schools; and (vi) gross enrollment ratio in pre-school education.


                                                 2
10.     In late 2012, a third project extension was processed and in it the key performance
indicators (and their targets) were modified in order to “reflect the Project’s previous extension
periods, facilitate measuring progress towards achieving the PDO, and track required core
indicators.”3 The main changes from the list in the PD were: (i) the deletion of “disaggregated by
gender” from the gross enrollment ratios; (ii) the dropping of “net intake in grade 1,” and
“transition rate from primary to secondary,” both judged to be beyond the scope of project
interventions; and (iii) the addition of core indicators required by the International Development
Association (IDA), including completion rate from primary and secondary education and others
designated by an asterisk. The revised list of PDO-level results indicators became: (i) gross
enrollment ratio in primary education; (ii) gross enrollment ratio in secondary education; (iii)
gross enrollment ratio in pre-school education; (iv) completed baseline measures of Grade 5
achievement in rural schools; (v) completion rates: (a) primary, (b) secondary; (vi) direct project
beneficiaries (number), of which are female (%); and (vii) system for learning assessment at the
primary level (rating scale) and utility of the learning assessment system. This list includes the
required IDA core indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The primary beneficiaries of this project were children and youth who were brought into
the school system by the upgrading of classrooms, dormitories, and facilities, and the pre-school
children in rural areas who have gained access to pre-primary education through the mobile ger 4
kindergartens, plus those already in the system whose learning was enhanced by improved
learning environments. Also benefiting were primary, pre-primary, and secondary school
teachers whose skills were upgraded through pre- and in-service training and access to ICT
mobile training units, and their students. Furthermore, Teachers Colleges in UlaanBaatar (regular
and kindergarten) and their staffs benefited from enhancements to their facilities and programs,
as did the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) staff members involved in the project. 5

1.5 Original Components

12.   A full description of Project components integrating those specified in the three grant
agreements (2007-2009) appeared in the 2009 Program Document 6, as follows:

13.    Component 1: Extending access (approximately US$6.2 million). This component
includes three sub-components: (i) rehabilitate and improve service facilities in 30 rural schools

  Ger refers to Mongolia’s traditional mobile housing.

  The Mongolian government’s Ministry of Education has used many acronyms over the years, but the latest is MES,
the Ministry of Education and Science, which is used throughout this document.
6
  This ICR evaluates the project based on the four components established in the PD. The Grant Agreement (GA)
was drafted at a time when there was no PD and was therefore structured along activities conducted under the first
grant (US$8.2 million) rather than project components. In developing the PD, the activities described in the GA as
well as activities conducted under the first and the second additional grants, were combined into the four
components. This ICR thus refers to the number of components as four.

and dormitories; (ii) provide furniture and equipment to schools and dormitories; and (iii) build a
new general secondary school complex. 7

14.     Component 2: Improving teaching & learning environments (approximately US$9.4
million) by providing adequate and continuous in-service training. It has three sub-components:
(i) teacher training – of primary school teachers in teaching methodologies in mathematics,
language and ICT; of first grade teachers to cope with the new in-take of 6-year-olds, and of
dormitory teachers to provide better care to boarding students; (ii) supplying mobile ICT stations
and electronic books for teachers; and (iii) rehabilitating and equipping laboratories in teachers
college in UlaanBaatar and in selected provinces (aimags).

15.    Component 3: Extending access to pre-school education in rural areas
(approximately US$13.2 million) by providing mobile ger pre-schools and rehabilitating the
kindergarten teachers’ college in UlaanBaatar. This component includes three sub-components:
(i) deployment of mobile ger pre-schools and supply of furniture, equipment and learning
materials; (ii) rehabilitation of kindergarten teachers’ college; and (iii) provision of laboratories
and learning centers to kindergarten teachers’ college.

16.    Component 4: Project management (approximately US$0.6 million). This component
includes operational costs of the Project Management Unit and technical audit of the grant.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     The EFA-FTI Project was extended three times – in 2009, 2010, and 2012 – as described
in Section 2.2 (Implementation). The extension to 2012 provided an opportunity for the Project’s
results framework indicators and targets to be formally revised, as explained in paragraph 10
above.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.    Mongolia launched 2006-2015 ESMP in 2006. It was subsequently appraised and
endorsed by members of the Educational Donors’ Consultative Mechanism (EDCM), which
declared it “a sound and credible pathway towards EFA goals” and recommended that Mongolia
be granted full membership in the EFA-FTI Partnership, which it was on September 11, 2006.
The EFA-FTI grant proposal was prepared in conjunction with the ESMP with the expectation
that EFA-FTI catalytic funds could be used by the government to help it meet its sector plan
goals. When EFA-FTI pronounced Mongolia eligible for a Catalytic Fund (CF) grant, the CF

    In the 2012 restructuring, the target number of new secondary school complexes was changed to 3.


                                                          4
Committee set the funding level at US$28.5 million for 2007-2009, based on a funding gap
analysis of the ESMP.

19.      Soon after that the Mongolian Government established an EFA-FTI working group,
consisting of the MES, the Ministry of Finance, and the EDCM, to steer the CF planning process.
The initial step of that process was the MES’s production of a technical proposal, which included
an action plan, a monitoring framework, and a description of implementation arrangements. The
action plan was to be focused on basic education, but contextualized as a sub-set of the sector’s
Master Plan (MP). Consistent with EFA-FTI requirements, this meant using the MP’s global
indictors (e.g., enrollment and completion rates) to assess project outcomes. Also, by EFA-FTI
rules, the initial grant was for one year, extendable to three, but the drafting team wrote it so that
it could be easily expanded to cover all three.

20.      Initial action plan ideas were submitted for review during an EDCM technical meeting in
October 2006, allowing donors not only to give substantive feedback but to identify whether and
how the proposed EFA-FTI funding meshed with their own plans for financial support. Feedback
from the EDCM led to revisions and improvements, setting a pattern of government-led
cooperation among partner agencies, which in Mongolia at the time was unique to the education
sector, and which set an example of good practice in aid effectiveness. Notable at the time was
how the proposed project covered parts of the MP that were not well covered by Government or
other donor funding, such as expansion and improvement of classroom and dormitory facilities
in rural areas, teacher training for new first grade teachers, and provision of mobile pre-school
facilities for children of herders. 8

21.     Once the technical proposal was finalized, it was submitted to the EFA-FTI Secretariat
for review and to the Bank, acting as the supervising entity of the CF trust fund, for further
processing. For the Bank, this meant formalizing the proposal into a Grant Agreement which,
besides covering goals and activities, specified procurement and financial management
arrangements, and a project management structure, built upon an existing Project Management
Unit that had been effective in managing ADB projects. This organizational structure and the
clear action plan for year 1 were sufficiently well developed that the Project was able to move
into high gear very quickly.

22.    The project was also notable for its rapid preparation time (less than three months
between Mongolia joining EFA-FTI and its submission of a revised technical grant proposal), its
alignment with EFA-FTI and World Bank requirements, and its addressing uncovered parts of
the ESMP, both in terms of substance and what donors were already covering. At entry, design

  This gap filling feature is detailed in the 2009 Program Document as follows: “The assistance provided to
Mongolia by the Catalytic Fund is especially important since it addresses a number of issues that donors are not
currently engaging with. The ADB’s Third and Fourth Education Development Projects have focused efforts on
curricular reform, educational planning and budget management, and the Technical and Vocational Education
subsector (TVET). UNICEF is currently addressing early childhood education and development in the country.
UNESCO is providing project support for non-formal education. The Government of Japan is providing support to
protect cultural institutions and community development projects. The USA’s Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC) is supporting the TVET subsector. While these donor efforts have been extremely beneficial for the sector, a
large gap remains between aspiration and achievement for the basic education subsector.”


                                                        5
challenges were mainly those related to the terms of EFA-FTI grants at the time, for example, the
need to plan and get financing for only one year at a time even though many of the gaps
identified took longer than that to fill, and the need to use global outcome income indicators for
assessing fulfillment of goals, even when Project interventions were of a more limited scope. 9

2.2 Implementation

23.     Implementation moved ahead briskly in the first year (2007) led by the Deputy Project
Implementation Coordinator and a small staff housed within the ADB Project Implementation
Unit (PIU). Activities went according to an annual plan drawn up by the sub-unit based on the
Grant Letter and cleared by the EDCM, which, by stakeholders’ agreement, also became the
Project’s Steering Committee. In fact, progress was so rapid that by the middle of the year there
was some concern about overly rapid disbursement of funds. This was rectified by reordering
some of the planned activities across the different years of the 3-year project. Other challenges
were difficulties in defining technical specifications for goods and services (something that the
PIU was not so experienced at), the scarcity of good construction contractors, and slow
processing of financial requests.

24.     The mid-term review (MTR), which was held 18 months after the start-up of the Project,
determined that training and construction goals were moving along as planned (often ahead of
schedule), and confirmed that project goals and activities were appropriate. The weakness
identified at this point was the lack of solid outcome indicators in the Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) results framework for demonstrating whether Project goals were being achieved and for
helping decision-makers to take appropriate corrective actions. However, this was a problem
rooted on the EFA-FTI requirement that global indicators be used for tracking outcomes, as
mentioned above, and which was a challenge for all EFA-FTI projects prepared at that time.

25.    Near the end of the Project’s second year in 2009, EFA-FTI, the Bank and the
government agreed that a PD should be developed to be retrofitted on the Project, formalizing
the objectives, components, results framework and other technical features that had shaped up
over the Project’s 2 years of implementation.10 This allowed project managers and supervisors to
view the Project as an integrated whole with improved project documentation consistent with
Bank requirements.

26.     Time devoted to PD preparation put the Project behind schedule; that, plus slow progress
in constructing a new school complex in Baganuur (a mining town not far from UlaanBaatar)
and the need for more time for a few other Project deliveries called for extending the completion
date of the Project by one year (to December 31, 2010). 11 12 In late 2010, continued delays with




9
  As the EFA-FTI CF program matured over the next 3-4 years, these requirements were loosened.
10
   This had become a requirement for new EFA-FTI projects by then.
11
   Reasons for delays in the construction of the Baganuur School complex as stated in the Recipient’s ICR: “… (i) a
booming construction market and rising construction costs; (ii) limited financial ability of the hired firm; (iii)
limited ability of the Ministry to supervise; (iv) contractual issues between the Ministry and the contractor; and (v)
extremely heavy summer rains in 2012.”


                                                          6
the Baganuur School required a time extension for another two years, during which time the
“access to basic education” component of the Project was put into “at risk status.” However, the
construction of the Baganuur School complex involved some innovative features such as the use
of new technology and an eco-friendly design, which added a level of complexity for MES and
the PIU to properly supervise this activity. This complexity coupled with the challenges already
mentioned required one more extension in 2013 to complete the school and fully furnish it. This
was successfully achieved by the end of the 2013 calendar year.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

27.     M&E designs for CF grants were, as explained above, relatively simple: EFA-FTI
expected grant proposals to be built upon education sector plans and for the M&E outcome
indicators to be those pertaining to the plan in general. Thus, the Project put forward, as outcome
indicators, national-level primary and secondary enrollment rates (gross enrollment ratios) and
completion rates, plus net intake into grade 1 and transition rates from primary to secondary
education. By the middle of the Project’s second year (during the MTR) it was noted that the
performance indicators used under the project are highly aggregated and that it would be difficult
to assess project attribution to the education system using these indicators. While this design
feature limited the assessment of project attribution, it was consistent with the EFA-FTI focus on
countries meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the established MDG
indicators for that purpose. The MTR also expressed concern about the quality of MES statistics
and recommended that at least enrollment and completion rates be broken down by gender,
urban-rural and aimag in order to show the narrowing of access gaps across gender and region
(urban-rural).

28.      The Bank and other partners (e.g., ADB) worked with the Ministry to improve its
management information system, but some systemic features of the reporting system (such as the
highly aggregated nature of data received from aimags) made it difficult to obtain disaggregated
statistics. When the retrofitted Project design was formalized in the 2009 PD, the key
performance indicators in the results framework did include enrollment breakdowns by gender
but not by urban-rural, limiting the possibility of assessing objectively whether the urban-rural
gaps has been narrowed. In the 2012 restructuring, the gender breakdown was also dropped due
to the fact that MES does not currently collect this data. This was in part due to the fact that
attribution would have remained difficult: even if there had been good breakdowns and results
showing positive changes, it is not clear how much the changes could have been linked to the
Project, since the scale of the interventions was not likely to have made much of an impact on
global indicators. Again, this was a common problem with early EFA-FTI grants. 13

29.    With respect to implementation and utilization, there is abundant evidence (e.g., from
progress reports and aide memoires) that output data were both diligently collected to track


12
   In this Project, as in the case with most (if not all) EFA-FTI projects, the three year CF grant period was found to
provide too little time to complete the Project’s activities and to disburse almost US$30 million. Challenges in
tendering the construction of a medium-size school alone took three years.

implementation progress (by both the MES and the Bank) and effectively utilized to solve a
variety of problems (output qualities and quantity, budgetary issues, logistics, etc.). For outcome
indicators the global data were collected and reported. As stated, project attribution is difficult,
which is consistent with EFA-FTI project indicators of this time period. However, the global
outcomes showed progress confirming that EFA goals of universal participation in basic
education were being reached.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

30.     Safeguards. The project triggered the Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). Due to
the fact that the EFA-FTI program at that time were not approved by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors and were not required to follow World Bank guidelines, an Environmental
Assessment was not necessary and, hence, was not conducted at the time of preparation. The task
team was aware of Mongolian laws governing school safety, standards, and environmental
management and made sure that all civil works undertaken under the project complied with
domestic laws.

31.    The project financed remodeling, rehabilitation, and construction of buildings and
dormitories, as well as the construction of one school complex. There was no land acquisition,
involuntary resettlement or loss of livelihood as a result of the project’s civil works activities.

32.     The 2009 retrofitted PD for the project included a social assessment, which noted the
existence in Mongolia of a few ethnic minority groups in Mongolia, mainly living in rural areas,
the largest of which is the Kazakh, whose student population is concentrated in the far Western
aimag, Bayan-Ulgii. Overall, Kazakh schools have suffered from the same systematic
deficiencies seen in other rural schools in Mongolia, i.e., lower overall quality, lack of learning
materials and highly qualified teachers. Kazakhs have their own language and the government
has taken actions to address this in an educational context by providing instruction and textbooks
in Kazakh. The EFA-FTI Project was designed to include aimag Bayan-Ulgii as one of its
intervention sites, providing teacher training and rehabilitation to schools serving Kazakh
children.

33.    In the course of retrofitting and producing the PD, the team classified the project as
Category C for its modest environmental impact per the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01. An
Environmental Assessment was undertaken prior to the construction of the new Baganuur school
complex and did not raise any concerns.

34.    Financial Management. Financial management in the Project was problematic at the
beginning, with problems noted in comparing actual and budgeted expenses, establishing a
proper chart of accounts (including reconciliations), managing contracts (including tracking
output quality and timeliness), financial management reporting (substance and timeliness),
documenting the receipt of goods, and tagging assets. By late 2009 many of these problems had
been overcome, to the extent that FM received an ISR rating of moderately satisfactory. During
the Project extensions (2010-2013) most of the weaknesses were overcome, and the FM rating
was elevated to satisfactory. All financial audits of the project were unqualified (clean).




                                                 8
35.     Procurement. In response to the Project’s ambitious agenda, the PIU worked hard to
award many contracts within a short period of time. However, at the beginning, due to
inexperience and unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures, it often encountered
difficulties putting out adequate technical specification and following procurement guidelines,
e.g., for tendering and shopping. In response, during the first year, the Bank provided
procurement training and extra support (reviewing and clearing contracts before they were
finalized), such that by early in the Project’s third year, things had improved considerably. By
mid-2009, however, Project procurement ratings fell again, due to delays and difficulties in
selecting a contractor for Baganuur School complex (requiring a second tendering). When by
mid-2010 the contractor still had not been selected, procurement ratings fell to unsatisfactory,
only to rise again to satisfactory once the contract got underway in early 2011. As mentioned
before, the school’s innovative and eco-friendly design added a level of complexity to this
activity, which was new for MES and the PIU and therefore contributed to the delays. However,
MES and the PIU were ultimately successful in completing and fully furnishing the school by
project closing.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.     At the close of the Project, Mongolia had already graduated from EFA-FTI (renamed
GPE) due to its being reclassified as a middle-income country. As a transition gesture GPE
awarded Mongolia a “graduation grant” of US$10 million in 2012 to continue its work in Early
Childhood Education, considered to be crucial at the time given an abrupt up-turn in the pre-
school population in the country. The new GPE grant currently being implemented is a direct
extension of EFA-FTI, covering 100 additional mobile ger-kindergartens and 17 fixed pre-school
buildings (using the model pioneered in the EFA-FTI Project) in urban and peri-urban areas. In
the pipeline is a new IDA-funded Project for US$27 million (Education Quality Reform Project)
which will extend the EFA-FTI sub-objective of “improving the quality of basic education,” and
will cover some aspects of student learning (baseline assessments) that the EFA-FTI project
aspired to support but was unable to bring to fruition. Also, the new project emphasizes in-
service teacher education for improving math and language instruction, an effort that was also
emphasized, in a preliminary way, in the EFA-FTI project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives were aligned with
Mongolia’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The objectives fit squarely into the
government’s Economic Growth and Support and Poverty Reeducation Strategy (EGSPR),
ESMP, and the Bank’s 2005-2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). They shared the common
objectives of establishing an accessible and high quality education system that would nourish the
intellectual development of Mongolian citizens while fostering economic growth. The project
objectives continue to fit into the 2013-2017 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which seeks to
address vulnerabilities through improved access to services and better service delivery, which
includes education, health, justice and infrastructure.




                                               9
38.     A strong feature of the Project objectives was their relevance to Mongolia’s Economic
Growth and Support for Poverty Reduction Strategy (2003), which recognized “the challenges of
increasing access to schooling, rural-urban and gender disparities, improving quality, and
strengthening the overall sector framework.” Its relevance to the country’s Master Plan (MP) to
Develop Education (2006-2015) was also solid, given it was developed to help deliver MP
results, especially the parts that prioritized disparities in access to quality education and the
creation of “environment and conditions” for improved primary and secondary education
services. Within the EFA-FTI arena, the Project was well aligned with the partnership’s main
goal (as of 2006) of helping partner countries reach the millennium development goals of
universal primary school completion and reducing gender disparity, and also with the
Partnership’s more recently articulated (2012-2015) goals of Access for All, Reaching Every
Child, and Learning for All.

39.     For the EFA-FTI catalytic fund grants, relevance to county education plans generally did
not imply financing broad systemic change or big strides towards closing MDG gaps; instead the
Fund encouraged flexible, high-impact, short-term goals that would advance important and often
neglected parts of the country’s educational sector plan, positioned in a way to attract other
(larger) sources of funds (foreign and domestic) for further development. The original goals of
Mongolia’s EFA-FTI were of this gap-filling variety: renovating and provisioning schools in
underserved areas, providing a limited boost to teacher skill levels; and creating high tech
teaching stations and mobile kindergartens. Therefore, relevance of objectives is judged to be
high.

40.    Relevance of Design. Relevance of project design is judged to be substantial. This
judgment is based on the fact that the project was in compliance with EFA-FTI CF guidelines at
the time, the outcome indicators adopted by the project were those for the sector plan in general,
including those that would show movement towards EFA goals of improved access to and
completion of basic education and improved educational quality, all at the national level. This
was appropriate for assessing progress on overall EFA-FTI goals, but early in the Project’s
implementation it became apparent that these indicators were less appropriate for showing
Project attribution. During Project implementation these became M&E issues, as they did for
most EFA-FTI CF projects of this generation. The challenge became how to evaluate project
accomplishments with these global indicators (inevitably showing weaknesses) while at the same
time giving the projects credit for strong performance on their original short-term goals.

41.      Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of implementation is rated substantial due
to the fact that every year the Project was successful in implementing its action plan and in
executing -- on time -- all but one of its planned contracts (more about that below). The goods
and services it delivered to target areas were of the expected quality and reached expected
beneficiaries. Although there were some validity issues with Project indictors, observers in the
field (including supervision missions and study tours from neighboring countries) noted how the
Project was able to deliver improved educational “environments and conditions” to rural and
remote areas, despite Mongolia’s notoriously difficult geography.




                                               10
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     Improve access to and completion of basic education. The results on revised outcome
indicators for this PDO show a pattern of meeting or exceeding targets, as follows:

       •   Gross enrollment ratio for primary: actual value achieved, 102.7 percent, exceeded
           the target level by 6.5 percentage points.
       •   Completion rate for primary: actual value achieved, 100 percent, exceeded the
           target level by 1 percentage point.
       •   Gross enrollment ratio for secondary: actual value achieved, 98 percent, exceeded
           the target by 2.5 percentage points.
       •   Completion rate for secondary: actual value achieved, 99 percent, is the same as the
           revised target.

43.     Moving enrollment and completion rates from the mid-90s to around 100 percent is a
significant accomplishment, especially in a country like Mongolia which faces so many
geographic and demographic challenges, and this can be used by the Government to indicate that
it has reached or is nearing EFA goals of universal enrollment and completion. However, as
mentioned in the M&E section above, these measures have limitations in their capacity to show
Project effectiveness, based on their global scope, the quality of their data and attribution issues.

44.     Another way to show Project effectiveness is to examine the intermediate outcome
indicators, which were included in the original grant agreement (derived directly from the
country’s Education Sector Master Plan) and rigorously tracked throughout the Project (see
specific outputs in Annex 2). These indicators show the Project’s setting the stage for improved
enrollments and completion by building 3 new exemplary schools, rehabilitating nearly 100 rural
school buildings and dormitories, furnishing and supplying learning materials for all classrooms
used for the new six-year-old first-grade cohort, and furnishing/equipping six schools for
children with special needs. For all of these indicators, outputs met or exceeded Project goals.

45.     Improve the quality of basic education. The indicator used to measure quality was
completed baseline measures of Grade 5 achievement in rural schools. This indicator’s target
was reached although the actual Grade 5 assessment was conducted under the IDA-supported
READ project which was being implemented at the same time as the EFA-FTI Project. It should
be noted that the Grade 5 assessment results were used to inform policy decisions and led to a
change in the teacher training curriculum. Moreover, the Grade 5 assessment was made available
on the READ website and the assessment design was used to develop 8 booklets with writing
rubrics that have helped to promote better writing skills and are being used by teachers to assess
student writing. The new Bank-supported education project will continue to work with MES on
assessment with a planned Grade 5 assessment in 2016/17. The intermediate outcome
indicators (see Annex 2) do reveal considerable Project success in “improving the teaching-
learning environment,” specifically by extending training to nearly 9,000 teachers during 2008-
2010, covering improved math and ICT teaching skills and the teaching of six-year-olds (for the
new cohort of first grade teachers). It also created mobile ICT stations and electronic books for
teachers, and improved facilities and equipment at four teacher training colleges. All output
targets related to quality were met. These outputs were considered by the education community
to have positively influenced the quality of basic education, and observations during supervision



                                                 11
missions documented examples of improved learning environment, but the evidence of Project
impact is less clear due to the lack of data on student learning outcomes and teacher
performance.

46.    Expanded access to pre-school education in rural areas. Gross enrollment rate for pre-
primary is shown to increase from a baseline of 53.8 to 77.6 percent, a very significant
improvement over the 8 year period (almost 3 percentage points per year), made even more
impressive by the difficult access and logical conditions that exist in most of the country. The
Government and many external agencies contributed to this change, but the Project included
important interventions especially in rural areas that provided more spaces for herders’ children.
One shortcoming is the lack of urban-rural breakdowns of the enrollment data to substantiate
improved preschool enrollment in the target (rural) areas.

47.     Overall rating for meeting the PDO is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

48.    Project efficiency can be assessed in various ways. If one considers value for money, it
appears that the Project did well, given the fact that it exceeded many of its production targets
but kept to its original budget; also some cost savings at the end were used to finance additional
outputs. Also, as shown in Annex 3, the Project was able, in many cases, to provide goods and
services at significant lower unit costs than comparable programs resulting in many
improvements in the cost-effectiveness of the system. This could be one explanation for how the
Project was able to deliver all of expected physical outputs, even in the face of escalating
materials and construction costs. Finally, one could consider administrative costs in the Project
compared to expenditures for actual deliverables (goods, services, and civil works). On this the
Project can be seen as very efficient, since administrative costs (funding for the Project
Implementation Unit) were only 2 percent of the total.

49.     If the consideration is the pace and smoothness of operations, the record is mixed. From
the beginning, the Project moved at a brisk pace, sometimes disbursing funds almost too fast. 14
On the other hand, since many project activities were quite new to the Ministry (e.g., creating
specifications for civil works, goods and equipment, and training services, and then shaping the
procurement processes for them acceptable to the Bank), things often moved slowly and/or had
to be done over. This was most evident in the construction of the Baganuur secondary school
complex, which took four years longer than expected (requiring retendering and 3 project
extensions) due to procurement issues, contract problems, spiraling construction costs, flow of
funds issues, heavy rains and quality (inspection) problems. Combining these factors leads to an
efficiency rating of substantial




14
  For example, the second tranche of 2008 Project funding was on track to be disbursed in June of that year well
ahead of this phase’s planned completion in December.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     This rating is based on a combination of ratings in which relevance is rated “substantial,”
efficacy “substantial,” and efficiency “substantial.”

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51.     The Project was fully aligned with the country’s poverty reduction strategy, which
viewed the role of education institutions as closing existing access gaps between urbanites and
the rural poor (most of whom are herders). Although no statistics on the increase enrollments
among the children of herders were specifically reported on, it can be deduced that project
activities did reach them since most school improvement efforts were carried out in rural areas.
Concerning gender, the 2009 objective statement mentioned EFA-FTI’s goal to close the gender
gap in basic education, but this never became a specific objective in the Mongolian EFA-FTI
project mainly because the country is unique in having a “reverse gender gap” (enrollment rates
for girls are higher than for boys, especially at the secondary school level). Therefore, no gender
gap-specific activities were included in the project. The 2009 outcome indicators did ask for
gender breakdowns for enrollment rates, but these were never reported, and in the 2012
restructuring gender breakdowns were no longer called for as explained above (see paragraph
24). Since enrollment and graduation rates were both nearing 100 percent by then, it can be
assumed that gender parity was close to being reached. Finally, social development was
addressed in many ways, among which were: (i) students enjoying more child-friendly teaching-
learning and living (dormitory) environments, which did occur given the success of the
classroom/dormitory rehabilitation efforts, and (ii) reaching rural students whose mother tongue
is not Mongolian (e.g., Kazakh), who were reached by the Project through rehabilitation of
schools and teacher training in the Kazakh cultural areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

52.     The only planned institutional strengthening feature of the Project was that for
strengthening “Grant Management,” which was relatively well implemented through training and
mentoring. In addition, the Project strengthened the country’s primary schools by training all
teachers assigned to the new 6-year-old first grade cohort and dormitory supervisors. This is an
element alleged by a PIU deputy director to have had a lasting effect on that cohort, given that
teachers move with their students. Moreover, some new building designs were pioneered (wood
frame kindergartens and the energy efficient Baganuur School complex) that are expected to be
models for schools to come. The Kindergarten Teachers College of UlaanBaatar was also
strengthened by receiving computers and computer labs, musical instruments, physical upgrading,
and materials, allowing it to strengthen its professional atmosphere and to attract better students to
this growing education subsector. With the respect to offices in the MES, many mission reports
describe the high levels of engagement of government offices, which were likely to have been
strengthened by this experience and its high output levels.




                                                 13
53.     For some time the Project did enhance the role of the country’s donor coordination
mechanism (EDCM), which was established prior to the Project’s approval, but which was given
a significant advisory role during the Project’s first three years. After 2009, in the extension years,
during which supervision was mostly focused on the Baganuur School, the EDCM’s role and
“raison d’être” diminished. However, there has been recent interest in reviving the mechanism
since donor coordination is currently more ad hoc and often limited to just two or three agencies
at once.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.     The Project, following the model set by the EFA partnership, relied on and strengthened
the EDCM. Designated by the Project as its Steering Committee, and active in reviewing and
endorsing the Project’s annual Technical Proposal and work plan, the mechanism played an
important role in the Project success. Additionally, there is evidence of this enhanced donor
cooperation during the life of the Project, for example: in the way the Project focused on building
and renovating rural classrooms while JICA did the same in the urban areas, and in the way the
ADB supported the training of first grade teachers for another two years, after EFA-FTI ran its
three year course.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

55.     In the year the Project was launched, 2007, Mongolia was hit hard by the global recession,
so it welcomed EFA-FTI grant money as a way cover capital expenditures and to further its
program development ideas, including model building and testing. This included scaling up ger
kindergarten deployment, launching a new model for kindergarten buildings (Canadian, wood-
frame), using new energy-efficient and cost-effective designs for basic school construction and
renovation, and undertaking a massive effort to train all teachers of the new 6-year-old first grade
cohort. According to Ministry officials the ger kindergarten scale up, which covered about 170 of
a potential 1,400 herder areas during EFA-FTI and another 100 during the GPE follow-up (see
section 2.5) has given the government confidence in this model. Given its stronger budgetary
situation, the government is now able to allocate its own funds for further expansion (in 2014 1.4
billion MNT were allocated for the procurement of 180-200 new units). Similarly, the Canadian
technology is being used in the construction of new pre-school buildings using state funds, inter
alia, under the “New Soums” project, conceived to stem the flow of migrants to UlaanBaatar,
including a school, kindergarten, and dormitories in each of three soums. The recently launched
Baganuur School Complex, which pioneers eco-friendly power consumption and heating systems,
will be observed over the next 1-2 years, and if considered successful, will be used as the model
for new schools from 2015.

56.    The goal of providing “adequate and continuous” training to first grade teachers would
have required five annual training events, starting in 2008, since this was the first year for the age-



                                                  14
six first grade intake, and teachers move through the five grades with their students. The Project
did provide training for all grade 1 teachers in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Training for the remaining
two years was beyond the scope of the EFA-FTI project, but was covered by an ADB project,
Education for the Poor – Financial Crisis Response Project, which allowed training to continue
over 2011 and 2012. One Project manager indicated that this effort had enduring impact, since it
helped first grade teachers create a welcoming and supportive atmosphere for 6 year olds, which
gave parents confidence to enroll their youngsters. Continuous upgrading for other teachers has
now become routinized through the work of the Mongolia’s new Teacher Training Institute,
which was established in 2012.

57.     Going forward, the MES will need to ensure that funds are made available for
maintenance and replacement of project inputs since site visits have confirmed that some Project
inputs are now showing signs of deterioration (e.g., dormitory equipment and upgrades). Even
first grade classroom furniture and toys, provided 5-6 years ago but generally very robust, are
starting to wear out or get lost (toys). 15

58.    Concerning the Project aspiration to create an assessment system for tracking basic student
learning outcomes, which never got off the ground during EFA-FTI, the recently approved IDA-
financed Education Quality Reform Project will help build a national assessment system (baseline
and periodic repeats) as one of its main components.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     CF grant, project preparation, and thus Bank professional engagement at entry, were not
as extensive as with IDA projects. As per EFA-FTI requirements, the Bank did draw up the basic
grant documents for the Project, and they were sufficient to launch the project and get it moving
quickly. During the second grant year, when the need for a more strategic “program document”
was decided upon covering all three grant years, the Bank effectively expanded documentation to
include retrofitted overall objectives, outcome indicators, fully elaborated project components
(covering all three years), a results framework, integrated procurement and financial
management arrangements, and back-up analyses of social and economic issues. This allowed
for more integrated planning of project activities and improvements in both procurement and
financial management. One project shortcoming that was noted by Bank task team leaders in the
first Project year was that the outcome indicators that had been drawn up according to EFA-FTI
specifications were too global making project attribution difficult. Given that these types of
indicators were preferred by EFA-FTI, the 2009 PD did not replace them with more project-
specific indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

60.      Bank supervision was attentive from the outset, constructively engaging both the
government in general (and MES in particular) and the other members of the EDCM, and
attending to important substantive and management issues with a good mix of experts in basic
education, economics, procurement, architecture, and financial management. In the early years of
the Project, when procurement and financial management were below Bank standards, the Bank
team provided capacity building and mentoring, which resulted in substantial improvements.
Supervision support reached its peak in 2009 when the Bank, in response to new EFA-FTI
guidelines, took the lead in the creation of a PD (see Section 2.2). After its approval, Bank
supervision (and its Aide Memoires) were followed by technically strong Implementation Status
and Results (ISR) reports. In 2012, in conjunction with a Project extension, the Bank team
successfully restructured the Project in order to reflect the Project’s previous extension periods,
facilitate measuring progress towards achieving the PDO, and track required core indicators.
When completion dates came due and had to be extended, the Bank was flexible and supportive
and was able to help steer the Project through sometimes tense times (during which the Bank
downgraded Implementation Progress to moderately unsatisfactory) to ultimate and satisfactory
completion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     The Bank performance at entry was consistent with expectations and country needs for a
short-term year-to-year EFA-FTI Grant. Solid Bank performance also typified the supervision
phase of the Project. The one shortfall noted was the missed opportunity during the new
beginning in 2009 to update the Project outcome indicators and results framework so that Project
attribution could be measured more systematically.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

62.      The government of Mongolia, represented by the Ministry of Education, was a strong
partner in the EFA-FTI program, having prepared the ground for EFA-FTI CF support by
presenting a credible poverty reduction strategy and educational sector strategic plan (2006-2015).
The country’s proposal to EFA-FTI was clearly aligned with both its own poverty reduction and
sector strategies and EFA-FTI’s goals and objectives. The Government was constructive in the
way it dealt with the education donor community (turning its consultative mechanism – EDCM)
into the Steering Committee for the Project and in putting out a mandate to the various branches
of the MES that they cooperate with the EFA-FTI PIU in implementing the Project. Ministry
ownership of the project is reflected in the fact that annually it incorporated EFA-FTI grant funds
into its annual budget. Ownership was further evidenced by the fact that when it was honored by
EFA-FTI as a best-performing project in 2009, the Minister himself went to Stockholm to accept

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     Through a MOU between the MES, the ADB, and IBRD-IDA a project coordination unit
was established within a pre-existing ADB PIU, headed by a Deputy Project Implementation
Coordinator. This was a good experienced platform for moving ahead quickly, which the PIU did.
The collaboration with relevant departments at MES was also relatively smooth. During the
several years of project management the PIU distinguished itself by completing project activities
on schedule and within budget. To be sure, in the early years the PIU was often stretched and
deviations in procurement and financial management were noted, but these were mostly overcome.
As mentioned previously, the procurement issues related to the Baganuur school construction,
combined with the challenges of contract management and civil works supervision, as well as
heavy rains did impact the timely completion of the school. However, the project was successful
in completing and furnishing the school prior to project closing. The otherwise strong agency
performance is thus attenuated to the moderately satisfactory level.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.    The government performance rating of satisfactory is combined with the agency
moderately satisfactory rating to form an overall rating of moderately satisfactory, since the
agency short-comings occurred in a single area (managing the final school contract) within an
otherwise satisfactory record.

6. Lessons Learned

65.     Low income countries, that are experiencing severe financial constraints and are able to
afford little more in education than the payment of salaries and other recurrent costs, can often
benefit greatly from the infusion of short-term grant funds for financing capital expenditures and
other development expenses, especially if that is used as a bridge to a time when they can begin
to cover capital expenditures on their own. This may be particularly true for countries in
transition like Mongolia.

66.    Connecting the delivery of services to traditional ways of doing things (for example,
putting kindergartens in movable buildings within nomad communities) can often make these
services more attractive, affordable, and culturally acceptable.

67.     The use of a consultative framework like the Education Donors’ Consultative
Mechanism, which was effectively used as a steering group during the first three years of the
Project, can be a good way to bring donors together and to promote cooperation and interagency
planning. Even more effective could be a mechanism that includes and is led by the government
(a “local education group” like those promoted by GPE) which puts the government in charge of
the external assistance agenda.

68.     In designing outcome indicators for an intervention or set of interventions like those
financed by the EFA-FTI grant, it is critical that the indicators be linked causally to project
inputs, processes and outputs so that there is no question in the end about attribution (whether the


                                                17
project contributed to change in outcomes). The indicators also need to fit to the scale of the
intervention: if the interventions are mainly local in scope, the appropriate outcome indicators
would be to show local changes; if the changes are global in scope, then global indicators are
called for.

69.    Innovative, eco-friendly building designs are becoming increasingly available in a variety
of climactic zones (include Mongolia’s, characterized by cold and windy conditions) and need to
be promoted as a way of saving resources and improving air and water quality. For Mongolia,
where heating costs can eat up a third of the budget of government services, the eco-friendly
designs like those used in the EFA-FTI Project can set a good precedent and be used as a prelude
to even greater efficiencies.

70.    Regarding school construction, given the short construction season in Mongolia due to
weather limitations, as well as booming demand, future projects need to plan carefully, assess
local capacity and supervise implementation closely. Retaining a civil works engineer on the
supervision team can be helpful.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

71.      Data in this assessment is taken from Project progress reports, aide memoires, and ISRs
that were drafted after the original completion date of December 31, 2009 (when most Project
activities were finished), and includes outputs recorded by the end of 2009 (with the exception of
the Baganuur School Complex, which was delivered in 2013). This assessment is not entirely
consistent with the assessment of outputs in the body of the ICR (Section 3.2 above) since that
one is based on a smaller (original) set of performance indicators and sometimes includes results
packaged in different ways (e.g., it counts classrooms rehabilitated compared to schools where
rehabilitation was done (below). Nevertheless, the main message in the two accountings is
consistent: it is one of the Project’s meeting its targets on almost all indicators.

72.    Component 1. Extending access (approximately US$6.2 million). This component
contained three sub-components:
       (i) Rehabilitate and improve service facilities in 30 rural schools and dormitories
           • rehabilitation of school buildings: updated target 57; actual 55 (virtually met);
           • rehabilitation of dormitories: target 23; actual 23 (target met):
           • remodeling school toilets and hand washing places; dormitory bathrooms and
              cultural information centers; target 30; actual 30 (target met).
       (ii) Provide furniture and equipment to schools and dormitories:
           • teaching kits and learning materials for 6-year-old first grade classrooms: target
              1750 schools, actual 1750 (target met);
           • desks and chairs for 6 year olds: target 1077, actual 1077 (target met);
           • dormitory facilities: target 88 dormitories; actual 88 (target met);
           • supply of kitchen facilities for school canteens (schools): target 35, actual 35
              (target met);
           • supply of furniture and equipment to schools for children with special needs: target
              6 schools; actual 6 (target met).
       (iii) Build a new general secondary school complex: the Baganuur Secondary School
       Complex (covering grades 1-11) was completed at the end of 2013 and inaugurated in
       early 2014; two other (smaller) new schools (in Huvsgul and Uvurkhangai) were
       completed under the Project: target: new schools built 3; actual number 3 (target met).

73.     Component 2. Improving teaching and learning environments (approximately
US$9.4 million). This component focused mainly on the provision of “adequate and continuous
in-service training” for classroom and dormitory teachers. It had 3 subcomponents, as follows:
        (i) Training classroom and dormitory teachers
            • in teaching methodologies in mathematics, language and ICT: Math and ICT
               teachers in 2007: target 3000; actual 2200 (partially met); in 2009: target 1962,
               actual 1962 (target met). (Note: English [language] in-service training was
               dropped.);
            • in coping with the new in-take of 6 year olds (first grade teachers): in 2008 target
               1432 (100 percent of new first grade teachers), actual 1449 (101 percent) (target
               met); in 2009 target 1602 (100 percent); actual 1602 (target met); in 2010 target
               1778, actual 1778 (target met).
            • in providing better care to boarding students (training dormitory teachers): in 2008


                                               20
               target: 500 (100 percent of dorm teachers), actual 590 (118 percent) (target
               exceeded).
           • Added to the original targets was the training of social workers for the new 6-year-
               old cohort: target 580; actual 580 (target met).
       (ii) Supplying
            • mobile ICT stations for teachers: target 550, actual 550 (target met).
            • electronic books for teachers (# of teachers reached): target 3,000, actual 6,000
                (target exceeded).
       (iii) Rehabilitating and equipping laboratories in teachers’ colleges:
           • in UlaanBaatar: target 7 labs, actual 7 labs (target met);
           • in selected (3) aimags: target 27 labs; actual 27 labs (target met).

74.    Component 3. Extending access to pre-school education in rural areas
(approximately US$13.2 million) by providing mobile ger pre-schools and rehabilitating the
kindergarten teachers’ college in UlaanBaatar. This component includes three sub-components:
       (i) Deployment of mobile ger pre-schools and supply of furniture, equipment and
       learning materials: target 171; actual 171 (target met); furniture, equipment and learning
       materials provided: target 100 percent; actual 100 percent (target met).
       (ii) Rehabilitation of kindergarten teachers’ college: target 100 percent of rehab needs;
       actual 100 percent (target met).
       (iii) Provision of laboratories and learning centers to kindergarten teachers’ college:
       target 35; actual 35 (target met).

75.    Component 4. Project management (approximately US$0.6 million). This component
includes operational costs of the Project Management Unit and technical audit of the grant.
Performance indicators for this were:
       • establishment of EDCM to supervise and approve EFA-FTI technical proposal and
          procurement plan (yes) – target met;
       • establishment of PIU (yes) – target met.

76.    The Project also tracked the number of joint missions conducted with donors and findings
reported to EDCM (target 5, actual 5 – target met).

77.    There is no information on the implementation of (a) technical audit(s) of the grant.




                                               21
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

78.     The public expenditure analysis in the 2009 Program Document provided a general
rational for investing EFA-FTI trust funds in Mongolian education by showing the high cost of
delivering education in the country (due to its low population density and hash climate) and the
fact that, despite growing national budgets for education, the government has not been able to
raise funds for need capital expenditure and development costs. The analysis also points to the
growing disparity between urban and rural areas, in which the former are losing population and
resources, and later growing too fast to accommodate comfortably all of the children who need
places in school. These conditions call for improvement in the efficiency of government
expenditures in education, and policies and programs that address growing urban-rural
disparities. These are the economic and financial issues that this annex addresses.

79.     This ICR provides a discussion of the efficiency aspects of the project in terms of unit
costs, as well as a review of the current trends in education financing. The ICR has not
conducted a “Cost-Benefit Analysis” where it calculates a “Net-Present Value” or “Internal Rate
of Return” in the absence of good data that links project activities with specific educational
attainments clearly attributable to the project.

Project efficiency

80.     One way to examine project efficiency is to examine unit costs of project inputs/outputs
compared to those of comparable products/programs. Of the many EFA-FTI Project
inputs/outputs, four are amenable to a unit cost analysis, namely, the cost for training grade 1
teachers dealing for the first time with a 6-year-old cohort, the cost of the mobile kindergartens,
the cost of the grade 1 furniture (provided to classes admitting 6-year-olds), and school building
energy costs. These unit costs are compared to the cost of similar items as an estimate of
efficiency.

81.     Training of grade 1 teachers. During July-August in 2008 the Project trained around 100
teacher trainers for 3 days each; 1449 grade 1 teachers, 532 managers, and 590 dormitory
teachers for 19 days each. In November it conducted a 3-day follow-up training for 1430
classroom teachers and 590 dorm teachers. The total number of training days for trainers,
classroom and dormitory teachers, and managers was 53,043 and the Project budget provided for
this was MNT 509 million or (at the exchange rate on July 1, 2008) US$266,839. The cost per
trainer/teacher/manager was just over US$5.

                                         EFA-FTI         READ              Non-READ
                                         Project
Unit cost for grade 1 teacher training   US$5.03         US$3.14           US$7.62

82.    This shows that the unit cost for this training was higher than that for the Bank-supported
READ project but significantly lower than that specified in the Education Sector Plan (2006-
2015) for training in general (non-READ). Economies in the EFA-FTI Project resulted from the
decision to undertake the training “in house” (using MES trainers) instead of relying on
contractors as originally planned, which would have been more expensive.



                                                22
83.     Mobile Ger-Kindergartens. According to Project figures the cost for two gers in 2008
was just over US$2,000 (two are used in one kindergarten) and their materials and equipment
was priced at approximately US$2,000 also (a total of US$4,000). Assuming that 20 children are
accommodated in a ger on average, the cost per child is around US$100. Costs in a stationary
kindergarten in 2008 (covering furniture, equipment, and learning materials, but not construction
costs) was about US$45,000 for a building with a capacity of around 150 children (US$300 per
child).

                                            Ger Kindergarten      Stationary Kindergarten
  Facilities costs per child                US$100                US$300

84.     First grade furniture for 6-year-olds. Because 6-year-olds, who entered the first grade
for the first time in 2008, are smaller than the previous cohorts (7- and 8-year-olds) right-size
furniture was provided in many Project classrooms. The Project shows a unit cost for such
furniture (desk and chair sets) of US$37.80 in 2008. Comparable would be the desks and chairs
purchased for new stationary kindergartens, which in 2008 were listed as having a combined unit
cost of US$144. Lower prices for the 6-year-olds could be attributable to economies of scale,
since over 1,000 units were purchased, and international contract bidding.

                                         6-year-olds in grade 1   New Kindergartens
 Unit cost for a desk and chair          US$38                    US$144

85.    Energy consumption at Baganuur School. The new school complex constructed in
Baganuur with EFA-FTI grant funds adopted an innovative energy and heating system,
developed by GTZ (German aid), which is promising to bring significant economies. Its
estimated energy consumption is as follows (to be confirmed during the course of 2014):

                                      Baganuur School                  Existing Schools
 Annual energy consumption per square 70 kwh                           350-400 kwh
 meter

86.    If this school complex does show promise during its first year or two it will be used as a
model for other new schools, leading to significant recurrent cost reductions throughout the
system, especially given that almost 15 percent of total educational expenditures in 2005 went to
heating costs.

87.     These items for which unit costs were calculable represent only a portion of total
expenditures under the Project, but they do show that it was able to improve the cost-
effectiveness of the education sector in many ways.

88.    Financial analysis. Various WB project documents have revealed increases in public
spending on education from the early transition period (1997) – 16 percent, to the year of Project
launching (2007) – 17.5 percent, to the original EFA-FTI Project completion date of the project
(2009) – 23 percent. These increases in financial allocations were accompanied by
commensurate increases in per student costs. For example, the public expenditure per primary




                                               23
school pupil as share of GDP per capita increased 37 percent from 2007 to 2011. 16 In pre-
primary education over the same period, per student spending by the government increased from
US$146 to US$643, largely due to a 2008 statute which required the state to provide free books,
toys, and meals to all pre-school participants. 17

89.     Over this period, government expenditures were almost entirely for recurrent costs, with
the average share of the Ministry of Education budget devoted to capital expenditures ranging
between a mere 5 and 10 percent. Consequently, the Government of Mongolia has looked to the
international donors for help in covering its capital costs. This is reflected in the budgets of the
two EFA-FTI/GPE projects in Mongolia, with EFA-FTI allocating 92 percent of its grant to civil
works and goods (48.5 percent to the former and 43.5 to the latter); and the GPE Project
allocating even a higher proportion – 98 percent – to the same (82 to civil works and 16 to
goods). The forthcoming IDA Project (Education Quality Reform Project), represents a break
from that norm, given that it funds no construction (aside from minor repairs funded through
school grants), and devotes about 1/3 of its funds to training and management There is also
evidence that the Government is starting to put more of its funds into capital expansion (e.g.,
plans to use state funds in building kindergartens within its “New Soums” project and up to 200
new mobile ger kindergartens), which is consistent with its recently reaching the status of a
middle income (IDA level III) country.

90.     State funding for education did increase over the past decade, but this did not mean that
different parts of the country benefited equally. As the century unfolded, gaps between rural and
urban areas began to widen. This revealed itself dramatically as changing urban-rural disparities
in poverty levels. In the mid-1990s the proportion of population below the poverty line was
about 35 percent, with urbanites being somewhat more impoverished than rural residents (38.5
vs. 33.1). By the end of the first 21st century decade (2010) the overall gap was still just above 35
percent, but the positions had reversed themselves: ruralites, on average, fell much deeper into
poverty than urbanites -- by a full 20 percentage points (47 vs. 27 percent).

91.     The government made narrowing the gap a priority and already by 2012 the figure in
rural areas had declined almost 12 percentage points to 35.5 -- still high, but declining much
faster than in urban areas where the rate only fell 4 percentage points (to 23.2 percent).
Realistically, the main cause of this narrowing was not so much government policy as it was the
rural poor seeking better opportunities in the city (by then more than 2/3 of Mongolia’s
population was urban). Pockets of poverty (new unabsorbed rural migrants) began to build up
there, too.

92.     This created a disequilibrium in education. As rural areas lost population rural schools
began to shrink, leading to a decline in their resources (given a strict national formula of per
capital financing). Under-resourced schools in rural areas have contributed to declines in
educational attainment there: four times more out-school school children among those in the 8-

12 age range in the countryside than in UB and aimag centers; and 38 times more primary school
dropouts in rural areas than in the national capital. The disequilibrium also meant problem in
cities, largely in the form of overcrowding or lack of access. Many urban schools now have to
triple shift, which reduces the instructional time and any possibility of individualized instruction.

93.     Also, urban areas cannot absorb the massive influx of preschoolers who are seeking
places in kindergartens. This is compounded by the recent increase in the total fertility rate (from
2.2 in 2000 to 2.7 in 2009), in part due to the government’s introduction of a child care cash
transfers payable to every family for every child. At current levels of immigration and fertility
and without any increase in supply, the gross enrollment rates in kindergartens could decline
sharply from 76 to perhaps 50 percent by 2015, well below the targeted level of near 80 percent.

94.     The global education partnership (EFA-FTI and GPE) grants were positioned to address
the above disequilibrium by providing more resources to rural schools, by building more
kindergartens for both herders and the neo urbanites, and even by erecting some new urban
schools to help reducing triple shifting and to pioneer energy-saving power and heating systems
that will help bring down operating costs. Having contributed to such causes for nearly a decade
as the supervising entity for these trust funds, the Bank is poised to start a new chapter of
educational support, that for improving educational outcomes through reforms to educational
quality, which invests more in development than in capital costs.

Implementation

95.    In cooperation with MES, the EDCM, consisting of over 40 donors operating in the
education sector in Mongolia, coordinates implementation of the EFA-FTI program with other
donors’ activities in the sector, approves the EFA-FTI’s annual technical proposal and
procurement plan, assist in program planning and implementation, share information, and
monitor the overall process of the program as articulated in TOR that was approved by the
EDCM in 2007.

96.    MES was the executing agency for the Program. EFA-FTI continued to be supported by
the Program Management Unit (PMU). The Catalytic Fund Program has been managed by the
PMU. Its Executive Director also had the dual role of being the Director of the ADB-funded
Education Development Program to ensure greater coordination among donors. The Deputy
Director was in charge of daily operation of EFA-FTI. Six other program staff members were
responsible for procurement, financial management, training, civil work, monitoring and
evaluation and driving.

97.     The EFA-FTI program implementation followed the World Bank’s procurement and
financial management rules and procedures. The EFA-FTI program staff members have been
trained in the World Bank procurement and financial management rules and procedures. The
program team ensured the policies and procedures for the flow of funds, settlement of payments,
accounting and reporting that are set forth in the Financial Management Manual. The manual has
been approved by the World Bank.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Design, Implementation and Utilization

98.     The PMU in coordination with MES took the lead on monitoring and evaluation activities
for the Program.

99.    The Project output and outcome indicators were used in monitoring and evaluation.
These monitoring indicators have been identified by the Mid-Term Review conducted in 2008
and agreed by MES and the EDCM. Recurrent costs for data collection and monitoring of the
EFA-FTI activities under this Technical Proposal supported by Program Management
(Component 4) budget.

100. The data related to output indicators provided by the PMU semi-annually. The MES
provided outcome related data annually. Progress in meeting target indicators reviewed by the
PMU semiannually and reported to the MES and the EDCM. All data collected sex-
disaggregated in order to understand and respond to gender issues.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

101. Financial managements and Audits: Financial management was rated satisfactory
throughout implementation. FM team members participated in supervision and carried out



                                              30
financial management reviews and each mission confirmed that the project has improved its
financial management system to ensure it can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and
timely information on the project implementation progress and whether the grant proceeds are
being used for their intended purposes. There were minor issues that were flagged during FM
reviews such as poor contract management, insufficient documentation for distributed goods.
According to the FM team recommendation, the PMU accurately reviewed the goods distribution
related documents upon the submission by aimag and district educational units. Other minor
issues included were absence of tagging/coding the PMU assets that were commented on by the
FM team and resolved prior to the next supervision mission.

102. Procurement: The PMU has developed the annual Procurement Plan which is approved
by the donors and the Bank and made available at the PMU/MES and in the program’s database
and on the Bank’s external website. The Procurement Plan is updated annually to reflect the
content of the technical proposal.

103. The project’s procurement performance has consistently been rated satisfactory. Bank
procurement staff was an integral part of supervision, and their reviews confirmed that the PMU
procurement documents were properly filled and procurement guidelines were followed. The
only one major issue was the construction of school complex in Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar.

Assessment of Outcomes
Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Highly relevant

104. Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives were highly relevant to the
country’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The project addressed social inequality
by increasing access to quality education for the poor, especially those living in rural areas. The
thrust of the project was consistent with government’s education sector strategy, which
emphasized increasing equity, access, and improving quality of education. The project objectives
were consistent with the government’s ESMP 2006-2015, which aims to improve education
standards and curricula and alleviate unemployment and poverty.

105. Relevance of Design. The Project was highly relevant at the design stage and remained
so at the time of the project completion. The Project’s design and objectives were fully in line
with government’s long-term strategic framework aiming to contribute to the Millennium
Development Goals.

106. Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of project implementation is judged to be
high. The EFA-FTI goal is to ensure universal completion of basic education and to close the
gender gap and rural/urban gap in enrollment and school completion. To help Mongolia move
towards the goal of quality basic education for all, the FTI grant aims to: (i) improve teaching-
learning environments for primary education and strengthen the capacity of primary school
teachers; (ii) provide mobile preschools to serve the herder population; (iii) construct and
rehabilitate schools; and (iv) improve rural school facilities (to make them more child friendly,
more healthy, and safer).




                                                31
107. The EFA-FTI grant aids about 4 percent to the government’s annual expenditure for
primary and secondary education and preschool education of roughly US$234 million. It
provided universal coverage in training of first grade and dormitory teachers, training of teachers
in UB Teachers’ College, and provision of mobile ICT teaching stations. In the provision of
electronic books for primary teachers, the national coverage reached 78 percent. The EFA-FTI
has built on the foundation of ger-kindergarten developed by UNESCO and UNICEF, and has
vastly expended the service to herders, were access was limited before. Therefore, the project has
contributed to improving the teaching and learning environment in Mongolia, particularly in
rural areas.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives

108. The performance indicators were outcome focused. All the outcome indicators were
achieved on time which can be evidence that the PDO was achieved.

109. School visits found excited results on the ground. The project outcomes were not diluted
across the country ensuring that the same follow-up activities were taking place in all the schools
visited.

110. The demand and needs for services carried out under the Project were clear from the fact
that many teachers, rural soum governors, parents of the students and remote herders have
positive feedbacks and expressed their gratitude for these activities organized within the project.

Efficiency

111. The project is rated efficient in its achievement of outputs of investment and in the impact
of interventions to improve the access, quality and relevance of pre-school and basic education.
With respect to efficacy, the project achieved most targets set at appraisal within the project
period and within the original cost estimate, under a reduced scope.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

112. The Project’s theme is to address the disparities between rural and urban schools by
supporting activities that will specifically benefit rural schools and provide them with the
opportunity to improve their educational services. Program activities take into account specific
constraints and needs faced by rural schools and have been designed under consultation with
rural teachers, other development partners, and NGOs whom have worked in rural schools.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

113. Institutional capacity has been strengthened through in-service training programs for
primary teachers and administrators. The topics covered included a new teaching skills and
methodology, teacher development, and teaching methodology improvements. Most of the



                                                32
teachers who participated in a survey indicated that the training was useful and that they could
apply the knowledge and skills they had learned to their jobs.

114. Teachers’ professional development network in rural areas helped to work schools
closely and share their experience, improve teaching methodology inspiring teachers to develop
teaching aids by themselves together with students. It emphasized the approach to empower local
teachers to improve their self-development skills in a situation of lacking funding and support
from the central government.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance

Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

115. The performance of the borrower was rated satisfactory. The government provided
adequate counterpart funding requirements and demonstrated strong commitment throughout the
project period. The government was strongly committed to education reforms and took
significant steps to improve the quality of basic education. The project design was highly
relevant to the government’s ESMP 2006-2015, and the Policy on Education of MES. It helped
increase access to and completion of basic education, especially among disadvantaged groups in
rural areas. The project was effective in achieving outcome indicators, including an increased
gross enrollment rate in primary and secondary education; it reduced dropout rates, increased
pre-school enrollment by providing mobile ger kindergartens; increased completion rate in
primary and secondary schools in rural areas. The project was efficient in achieving outcomes
and outputs, with targets achieved and some exceeded, within budget and within the project
period, except the construction of Baganuur school complex. The project is likely to be
sustainable, because project interventions have been implemented and integrated into the
education system. Institutional capacities at rural schools and kindergartens have been
strengthened. Overall, the government fulfilled its commitments and obligations.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

116. The MES displayed strong ownership of the project and provided the needed guidance
and continued support to the PMU. The Project Steering Committee (PSC) met regularly to
review the progress of project implementation. The PMU was committed and was able to
complete project activities on schedule. Despite delay in the construction of Baganuur school
complex, the PIU managed to strengthen the construction supervision and management team and
provided additional resources and vehicles for them to function effectively. The staff of the PMU
provided continuity and stability for project implementation throughout the project period. Their
knowledge of WB guidelines and procedures was useful in their work and in dealing with WB.
Overall, the performance of the borrower and the MES was rated satisfactory.




                                               33
(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Project Overview

122. Donor countries had encouraged Mongolia’s Education Development Master Plan for
2006-2015 which was approved by Government of Mongolia. Effort of Mongolian Government
and supports given from education sector donors were recognized and Mongolia was approved to
receive the grant from EFA-FTI Catalytic fund in 2006. On March 9 2007, EFA-FTI project
aimed to support effective implementation of Education Sector Master Plan started its activities
following the General Contract between Ministry of Finance and World Bank, and Memorandum
of Understanding on the implementation of the Grant between Government of Mongolia, World
Bank and Asian Development Bank were signed respectively.

123. The main purpose of the EFA-FTI project is to improve access to basic education,
enhance its quality services that are consistent with the system transition to 12 year general
secondary education and assist to Education Sector Master Plan implementation. The project
objectives were highly relevant to country priorities and consistent with global priorities.

124. EFA-FTI project had 4 components. First, extend access; second, improving teaching and
learning environments; third; extending access to pre-school education in rural areas; and fourth,
project management.
125. Project financing and cost: Total amount of grant was US$29.4 million dollars. World
Bank has served as a trusted party with responsibilities to guide the project activities,
implementation and funding.



                                               35
126. Under the supervising of the EDCM and the World Bank, MES and PIU successfully
implemented the project and contributed greatly for the effective transition to 12 years general
secondary education and achievements towards Millennium Development Goals, Education
Sector Master Plan, and Government Action plans.

Project Implementation Overview

127. The implementation of the project has greatly improved the conditions and teaching
quality for almost all Mongolia’s rural and urban public primary schools students and has
brought a significant change in teaching and learning environments specifically in rural areas.
The project was carried on smoothly during the implementation period. Most of the project
targets were met and some were exceeded. Achievements are supported generally by
progressively positive statistics in rural primary education sub-sector and there is evidence of
increased enrolment or access to primary education.

128. MES has strengthened the national level management and paid more attention on the
implementation stages providing technical and policy supports to project implementation
agencies and committed to the projects sustainability. One of the evidence of sustainability is to
continue to build ecofriendly in power consumption and heating, energy efficient school
complexes using the design created for the Baganuur School in the future. Another evidence is
the Government of Mongolia plans to create more ger kindergartens, thus 100 mobile ger
kindergartens were supplied within “Global Partnership for Education and Early Childhood
Education” project, 136 ger kindergartens were provided under “Early Childhood Education for
Rural, Nomadic and Migrant Children” project funded by ADB. In 2014, 1 billion 448 million
MNT was already allocated in the state budget for the procurement of 180-200 ger kindergartens.
Based on norm-based variable costs, the Government of Mongolia already allocated the recurrent
costs of above mentioned ger kindergartens in the state budget. Also, MES plans to build more
kindergartens using the Canadian design that was used in the EFA-FTI project, and expenditure
of building 8 wood framed kindergartens was allocated in 2013 and 2 more wood framed
kindergartens was allocated in 2014 respectively.
