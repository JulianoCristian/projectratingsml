EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ES1: The Project
AES Meghnaghat Limited (the Project Sponsor) is proposing to build, own, and operate a 450MW
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station in the People's Republic of Bangladesh (Figure ES1 -
overleaf). The power station is part of the Meghnaghat Power Sites Area (MPSA), an area identified by
the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) for development of 1200-1300 MW of power in three phases.
Specifically, the MPSA is situated approximately 27 kilometres southeast of Dhaka, near the Meghna
Road Bridge on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway (Figure ES2) and is under the administrative jurisdiction
of Sonargaon Thana, Narayanganj District.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACI ASSESSMENT
The Project Sponsor is a special purpose company, established under the laws of Bangladesh, which has
retained Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company Limited of Korea as the Installation, Erection,
and Commissioning Contractor and Hyundai Heavy Industries Limited as the Supply Contractor (herein
collectively referred to as the Construction Contractor) to design and procure equipment and build the
power station. The Project Sponsor will independently own and operate the power station, supplying
power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) for an initial period of 22 years.
To finance the power station, the Project Sponsor is currently seeking funding from the Infrastructure
Development Company Limited of Bangladesh (IDCOL), a World Bank financial intermediary, and from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consequently, the project is being planned, and will be built and
operated, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of Bangladesh, as well as the guidelines
of IDCOL and the ADB.
ES2: Legislative Requirements
The Bangladesh Departnent of Environment (DOE), a division of the Ministry of Environment and
Forests (MEF), is the agency responsible for issuing environmental approval for the construction and
operation of power stations in Bangladesh. Under -MEF guidelines, both Site Clearance and
Environmental Clearance are required from the DOE before any power station can be made operational.
An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) report was prepared and submitted as part of the Project
Sponsor's application for Site Clearance from the DOE. The purpose of the IEE was three-fold: i) to apply
for Site Clearance from the DOE; ii) provide the Terms of Reference for the Enviroranental Impact
Assessment (EIA) study; and iii) continue consultations with project affected stakeholders. Site Clearance
was obtained from the DOE on March 13, 2000.
The project is also being planned to address the environmental and social requirements of the Project
Sponsor's lenders: IDCOL and the ADB. IDCOL has been established by the GOB as a company
registered under the Bangladesh Companies Act 1994 to facilitate private investment using credit made
available by the World Bank (IDCOL, 1997). As a condition of receiving the credit, IDCOL is required to
ensure that its infrastructure projects conforrn to the environmental and social requirements of
Bangladesh as well as the operational policies, directives, guidelines, standards, and business practices of
the World Bank.
The proposed undertaking is considered a Category A project as described in the World Bank guidelines
(1998) and is subject to the highest level of environmental and social assessment. In addition to these
requirements, the ADB also has a set of environmental guidelines for thermal power stations (1993),
which have been applied to this undertaking. The Project Sponsor will utlise this EIA report as part of
their application for Environmental Clearance from the Bangladesh DOE.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
ES3: EIA Methodology
EIA, as a methodology, is a tool used to identify, quantify, and evaluate the potential impacts of a
proposed undertaking on the environment. Typically, the results are then used to assist decision-makers
in balancing the goals of the proponent with those of the project stakeholders. As a process, it provides an
accountable and traceable approach that integrates economic development with environmental
management initiatives.
Project Specific Methodology
The specific methodologies utilised in the preparation of this EIA study included: identification and
quantification of baseline environmental conditions in and around the project site; prediction and
quantification of potential environmental/social effects assisted in part by computer modelling,
professional experience, and survey programs; and evaluation of potential effects coupled with the
identification of reasonable environmental protection and mitigation measures.
The present EIA builds upon the findings and work documented in an earlier EIA of a "generic" design
combined cycle gas turbine power station at the same site. This EIA, initiated in October 1999, is based
upon the specific and detailed design made available by the Construction Contractor for the project. The
EIA requirements for the associated project facilities (including site preparation, access road, regulating
and metering station, and pipeline) as well as high voltage transmnission lines required to evacuate
electricity from the power station to the national grid were the responsibilities of other GOB agencies;
they were not within the purview of this present EIA.
Project Team
The Canadian-based firm ESG Intemational Inc. (ESG) led the preparation of the EIA. ESG incorporated
input from sub-consultants specializing in the areas of air dispersion modelling and noise assessment
(RWDI Inc, Canada), thermal plume dispersion modelling (Danish Hydraulic Institute, Denmark in
association with the Surface Water Modelling Centre, Bangladesh), social irnpact assessment (Deodar
Associates, U.S.A.), and socio-economnic specialists and Bangladesh EIA requirements facilitators (DPC
Group, Bangladesh). The UK-based consultancy, Mott MacDonald, prepared an initial draft of the Public
Consultation and Disclosure Plan and carried out early consultation activities that have been
incorporated into this EIA report.
ES4: Meghnaghat Power Sites Area
The MPSA was identified in the 1995 Power System Master Plan as a top ranked site for development of
three new private sector power stations, to be developed in three phases: Phases 1, II, and III (Acres,
1995). The Project Sponsor has signed a Land Lease Agreement and a Power Purchase Agreement with the
BPDB, a Gas Supply Agreement with Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company (Titas), and an
Implementation Agreement with GOB for the Phase I project at the MPSA (Figure ES3).

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The Phase I lands (i.e., pToject site) consist of approximately 70 acres (i.e., the power station site and  -)
cooling water channel), and were tumed over to the Project Sponsor on May 26, 2000 following site
raising, reinforcing, and grading activities by the BPDB. The BPDB has also allocated 6.5 acres of land for
the access road and 1.72 acres for the regulating and metering station to be built by Titas.
ES5: Project Description
The project site location and power station design have a number of features that make the project
attractive for power development:
*  situated adjacent to a large, flowing body of water which can be used for cooling water purposes;
n minimal involuntary resettlement of residences needed to develop the project;
*  background air quality within the airshed is good;
*  the power station wil bum indigenous natural gas;
*  located adjacent to one of Bangladesh's main highways;
*  site filling mnaterials could be dredged from the Meghna River - immediately adjacent to the
project site;
-  predominant land-uses, adjacent to the project site, contain a mixture of industrial and
commercial uses and is a burgeoning industrial area; and
•  miinimal environmental and socio-econornic impacts anticipated primarily due to the project
design, fuel type, and location.
Power Station
The power station will utilise combined cycle gas turbine technology comprising a 2+2+1 configuration
(i.e., consisting of two gas turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators, and one steam turbine
generator). The power station will be exclusively powered by indigenous natural gas fuel to be supplied
to the power station by Titas. The natural gas will be supplied through Titas' existing Bakhrabad-Demra
gas pipeline with a 500-metre spur pipeline connecting it to the project site. The natural gas contains
negligible amounts of sulphur.
Cooling of the power station will be achieved with a once-through cooling water system, utilising water
drawn from the Meghna River. After its use, the cooling water will be released back into the Meghna
River via a cooling water discharge channel. The power station will include full effluent treatment, fire
control systems, waste management facilities, and other systems required to maintain daily operations.
Construction will last approximately 23 months commencing in the last quarter of 2000 with an estimated
peak labour force of 800 workers. Approximately 50% of the peak labour force will be supplied through
local and neighbouring communities. Where appropriate, project site housing and support facilities will
be provided by the Construction Contractor during the construction phase of project development. Once
the project has been constructed, 23 to 24 personnel will be required for daytime operations and
approximately three to four persons will be required for night-time operations.

Associated Infrastructure
To allow the ultimate development of the three power stations at the MPSA, construction and operation
of various infrastructure facilities are required. Construction and operation of the associated
infrastructure for this first phase of development will be the responsibility of Titas and the BPDB as
shown below in Table ESI.

Natural gas pipeline and RMS  Titas                May 31, 2001
Construction of a 938-metre access road between the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the project site was
completed by the BPDB in August 1999 in accordance with GOB and DOE requirements. The roadway
has been raised to the same elevation as the MPSA using fill from the Meghna River. The BPDB will also
be responsible for maintaining the access road for the operational life of the project.
The BPDB was responsible for all site preparation activities as regulated by the GOB and DOE. By the last
quarter of 1999, approximately 1,888,000 m3 of fill material was dredged from the Meghna River and
placed on the project site by the BPDB. The elevation of the project site was finished to approximately
+7.83 m (PWD), which is 0.87 metres above the 200-year flood line.
In addition to this associated infrastructure, the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) is
constructing a 230 kV transmission line from Comilla to Haripur via the MPSA to connect the existing
Comilla-Chittagong 230 kV transmission line with Haripur to facilitate the balance of demand and supply
of power among the eastern, central, and western regions of the country. Construction of the
transmission line has been undertaken as part of the national grid system and will be completed by
November 2001. The power produced by the Project Sponsor will be delivered to the national grid via
this new PGCB transmission line.
The PGCB has recently awarded construction works for another 230 kV line that will be constructed from
the MPSA to Hasnabad to augment transmission capacity from the MPSA that will be required due to the
development of the Phase II MPSA lands. The construction of both transmnission lines (i.e., from Comilla
- Haripur and the MPSA - Hasnabad) is being undertaken with funding assistance from the ADB.
Construction has been initiated on the Comilla - Haripur transmission line while construction on the
MPSA - Hasnabad will soon be initiated. It is understood that environmental analyses may have been
undertaken for both transmission line in accordance with DOE and ADB requirements although the
Project Sponsor, at the time of writing, has remained unprivileged to such information.
A 500-metre spur steel pipeline will form the connecting link between the interconnection point on Titas'
gas transmission pipeline system and the power station, providing a safe and efficient method for the
transport of natural gas. Specifically, a NPS 20 pipeline will supply the natural gas to the power station.
The permanent pipeline easement will be approximately six metres in width and Titas will require an

additional six metres of temporary working space during pipeline construction in accordance with GOB
and DOE requirements. Titas has indicated that the easement for the pipeline will be located inmnediately
adjacent to the access road easement. There are no residences or other constraints to pipeline
development located within the proposed pipeline and construction easements between the main
pipeline and the project site.
A regulating and metering station (RMS), occupying an area of approximately 50 by 100 metres, will be
constructed to control the volume and flow of gas entering the power station. The RMS will also contain
facilities to adjust gas pressure under various operating conditions as well as gas metering and flow
measurement. Titas will construct, own, and operate the RMS.
ES6: Baseline Environment
Socio-Economic
Low-lying fields of paddy, banana plantations, and vegetable plots, intermixed with clusters of houses,
characterize Sonargaon Thana. The area is threaded by a patchwork of canals and watercourses allowing
boats to be used for transportation of goods and materials. By Bangladesh standards, it is a relatively
prosperous area. Annual incomes in the region surrounding the project site indicate that less than 2% of
the population live below the Bangladesh poverty line.
There are six villages located in proximity to the MPSA: Islampur, Ganganagar, Dhudghata, Kurbanpur,
Panchani, and Char Goaldi. Having adapted to the annual cycle of summer inundation, village residents  9
have built their homes on platforms to avoid flooding during the monsoon season. These village
platforms provide space for houses, sheds for cattle, kitchen gardens, medicinal plants, fruit trees, and
small orchards.
While most of the villages have not been directly affected by initial site acquisition and preparation,
several individuals in Islamnpur village have experienced direct effects. These effects include relocation of
residences, loss of agricultural lands, and loss of access to monsoon fisheries on the project site.
Land-Use
Land-use around the project site follows the pattem seen throughout the alluvial deltaic areas of
Bangladesh. Predominantly a very fertile area, the project region has seasonal mixed crop vegetation,
monoculture tree plantation, and homestead-based agro-forestry. Prior to site development, the MPSA
was utilized for the seasonal production of rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, eggplants, tomatoes, sweet
potatoes, and watermelon. During the monsoon floods, when these common crops could not be grown,
the MPSA supported a localized monsoon fishery. Within a three-kilometre radius of the project site are
numerous industrial and commercial developments that comprise the burgeoning industrial area of
Narayanganj.

A9     Water-Use
The river port at Narayanganj is a major inland port and trading centre. Various developments in the
region continue to increase this port's importance to cargo ships, fishing boats, passenger boats, and
trawlers. The Meghna River, and connecting waterways, will be relied upon for heavy construction
equipment transportation as well as being used for power station cooling and general water uses. The
Construction Contractor will only use groundwater for the provision of potable water during the
construction phase. The Project Sponsor will not use groundwater for any power station processes.
Hydrology
At the project site the mean water level of the Meghna River is 5.49 metres above sea level. During the
dry season, water levels can be as low as 0.52 metres above sea level, while during the monsoon season
water levels are much higher, with the Meghna then overflowing into the region's low-lying floodplains.
The width of the Meghna River at the project site is approximately 1000 metres and the flow discharge
rate is 6,000 to 9,000 m3/s. The river is tidal during the dry season (i.e., November through April) when
net flows are low.
The highest flood levels in the project area were recorded at the Meghna Ferryghat gauge station (15
kilometres south-east of the project site) during the monsoons of 1998, 1988, and 1974 when flood
elevations of +6.76 metres, +6.55 metres, and +6.19 metres PWD were respectively noted. The lowest
recorded elevations at the same gauging station occurred in 1994 (0.0 metres PWD) and 1982 (0.2 metres
?         PWD).
Air Quality
There are several existing industries in the immediate vicinity of the project site that are possible point
sources of air pollution, including a jute mill, a packaging and board mill, a brick yard, three cement
processing industries, and two pulp and paper mills. Future developments in the region may include a
chemical processing industry and another pulp and paper mill. Non-point sources of pollution include
cottage industries, household fuel consumption, and road and river traffic, and possibly long-range
transport of air pollutants from nearby urban areas such as Dhaka.
Monitoring data, collected in 1996 and 1999, indicate that annual average concentration of NO2 was
estimated to be 21 jLg/m3, well below the World Bank Guideline of 100 ig/rn3 and the GOB's standard of
80 Jig/m3. The maximum 24-hour concentration of NO2 was estimated to be 63 Jig/m3, well below the
World Bank Guideline of 150 jig/M3. The GOB has no 24-hour standard for NO2 concentrations.
Sound Levels
As the project site is located adjacent to several industries, there are numerous contributors to the region's
ambient noise levels. As part of the ambient conditions assessment, two separate sites were selected for
monitoring: the village of Islampur and the village of Ganganagar. These sites are representative of the
two residential areas closest to the power station and monitoring was undertaken in 1999 and 2000. The

monitoring indicates that Ganganagar is relatively quiet at night while Islampur, being next to the river,
experiences engine noise from boats navigating their way up or down the Meghna River (Table ES2).

n/m = no measurements recorded.
Terrestrial and Aquatic Flora and Fauna
Extensive agricultural, industrial, and residential developments have significantly altered the natural
habitats within the project region. No vulnerable, threatened, or endangered (VTE) floral species have
been identified at the MPSA. Published data indicate there may be habitat for vertebrate VTE species
(e.g., avian, manmalian, and reptilian species) within a ten-kilometre radius of the MPSA, but no such
habitat was found on the project site through field checking. Since the Project Sponsor's works are limited
to the MPSA, the potential for adverse effects on VTE species is considered low to negligible.
ES7: Potential Impacts and Proposed Mitigation
River Dredging and Site Filling
The Meghna River is highly turbid and carries high levels of sediments. Based upon EIA studies carried
out for and by the dredging contractor, the turbidity created by the dredge was not expected to
significantly affect long-term sediment loadings in the river and would only have a short-term effect on
benthos (i.e., bottom dwelling organisms) within and imrnmediately adjacent to the borrow areas.
Organisms were expected to quickly recolonize the affected areas once dredging is completed. The river
is sufficiently large to allow fish and other active swimrnmers that may be affected by the turbidity to avoid
highly turbid areas. Overall, no long-term  deleterious effects were expected on aquatic life due to
dredging activities.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The thermal plume modelling undertaken as part of the EIA, based upon the open channel discharge
design during the dry season, indicates that the power station's discharge temperature will typically
combine with the ambient river temperature to produce an average temperature compliant with both
DOE and World Bank standards (Figure ES4). However, following the results of the BPDB/SWMC
study, the Project Sponsor will implement whichever discharge option is determnined to have the least
adverse environmental effects.
Modelling was also undertaken to determine the potential for cooling water recirculation at the cooling
water intake during tidal conditions. The modelling indicates that thermal accumulations will likely
occur in front of the MPSA under reversing flow conditions.
It is calculated that the temperate effects of recirculation under average river conditions (i.e., a normal dry
season) at intake the will be negligible (-0.1°C). Such a small change in the intake water temperature will
have a limited, if any, affect on the discharge temperature or the characteristics of the thermal plume.
Under worst case river conditions (i.e., a near 50 year return period) a more noticeable increase will occur
(-1.8°C), however, this return is of limited occurrence and thus contributes little in terms of assessing
power station operations with regard to recirculation. Regardless, should such conditions arise, the
recirculation effects will be of a relatively short duration and are not expected to have a significant effect
on aquatic life.

~-)      Noise
The power station is being designed to meet the applicable guidelines for environmental noise. 'Where
appropriate, exhausts and air intakes will be equipped with silencers to reduce noise levels at the source.
Noise modelling, based upon conservative assumptions shows that the predicted noise level at the
nearest Village of Islampur would exceed the night-time noise limits of the DOE and World Bank. The
Village of Ganganagar is also predicted to exceed the World Bank night-time noise limit.
Construction Phase
Construction phase noise will be generated by equipment on the project site and by traffic on the road
and river networks. The most sensitive receptors for construction generated noise are the residential
areas of Islampur and Ganganagar, which are adjacent to the project site. Through the implementation of
the noise management measures, as set out in the EIA report, along with good site practices, noise effects
should be limited to a short-term intermittent increase in ambient noise levels.
Operation Phase
As required in the contract between the Project Sponsor and the Construction Contractor, mitigation
measures at noise sources (e.g., moving the power block and installing acoustical shielding) and at the
project site boundary (e.g., vegetative planting) will be implemented to ensure the power station is
compliant with both Bangladeshi and World Bank noise limits at the nearest residence.
Cumulative noise modelling, for all three phases of the MPSA was undertaken, using the data inputs for
the Project Sponsor's power station. The modelled results indicated that there are significant increases in
the predicted ambient noise levels at locations adjacent to the MPSA (Figures ES5 and ES6). Using a
conservative, worst-case scenario it is calculated that noise impacts would increase by 5 dB(A) at nearby
receptors with all three power stations operating at full load.
This increase in ambient conditions was calculated on the basis that no mitigation measures were
implemented at any of the power stations. With the installation of appropriate mitigation measures at
each power station, required to bring each consecutive power station into compliance with the applicable
guidelines, coupled with additional greenbelt planting and maintenance, the cumulative noise effects of
the MPSA are anticipated to be within regulatory levels.
Air Emissions
The Ansaldo V94.2 turbines will be installed with dry low NO, burners and are to be operated exclusively
on indigenous natural gas. Turbine start-up will utilize electricity from the national grid (i.e., no diesel-
fuelled generators will be required on-site for this purpose). The design specifications indicate that these
turbines and burners will control the emnissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO.) to levels well below the
emission guidelines of the World Bank.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Stack concentrations of NO, during normal operating conditions (i.e., loads greater than 50% which will
occur at least 98-99% of the operation time) will be about 57.46 mg/Nm3; well below the World Bank
guideline of 125 mg/Nm3 and 82 mg/Nm3 of the DOE. However, the NO. emissions at 50% or less load
of the gas turbine will exceed both Bangladesh and World Bank linits.
In accordance with the World Bank guidelines, the power station will operate with loads at or below 50%
less than 5% of the time (i.e., typically during start-up and shutdown), and/or when the overall station
load is below 28%. Operation at these reduced loads will continue for less than two hours at each
occasion. Emissions of SO2 and PM,, will be negligible, as the natural gas fuel contains neither sulphur
nor dust.
Maintaining the power station in good working order will also assist in minimizing its increased
emissions of NO2. Stack emissions will be monitored on a routine basis throughout the life of the power
station.
Ground Level Concentrations
Ground level concentrations of NO2 were calculated using the U.S. EPA's AERMOD model at worst-case
plant loads to predict short-term and long-term ground level concentrations of NO2. The results of the
modelling indicate that the contribution of the power station, plus the existing background levels, will be
compliant with the applicable guidelines of the DOE and World Bank (Table ES3).

NOTE. Scenario I assurnes the power station is operating continuously at 100% load with duct firing.
Scenario 2 assumes that both turbines will operate continuously at 50% load (simrilar to start-up and shut-down conditions).
The model was also run to assess the cumulative effects of the ultimate development of three power
stations at the MPSA. The modelling indicates that all air quality guidelines would be maintained (Table
ES4). A post-construction monitoring program will be implemented by the Project Sponsor to confirm
the model's predictions.

NOTE: Scenario I assumes the continuous operation of all three power stations at 100% load.
Scenario 2 assumes that at each power station one turine would operate continuously at 100% load while one was operating
continuously at 50%r load.
Greenhouse Gas Contributions
Comnbined cycle systems typically operate at higher efficiencies than conventional boiler-steam power
systems. This allows a greater amount of electricity to be generated per unit of fuel utilised and thus,
minimises the volume of greenhouse gases released per unit of electricity produced. Natural gas has a
low carbon content compared to the other hydrocarbons fuels, which results in lower emissions of CO2
per unit of heat released. Therefore, the efficiency of the combine cycle gas turbine, coupled with the use
of indigenous natural gas fuel, will reduce emissions of CO2 per unit of power produced.
Economic Dislocation
The Project Sponsor has reviewed the compensation provided by the BPDB as part of the acquisition of
the project site and determined that supplemental management measures would be appropriate. A
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), following IDCOL, World Bank, and ADB guidelines, has been prepared
setting out the methodology for carrying out these supplemental activities.
Specifically, development of the project site and the associated infrastructure, by various government
agencies, has affected households through the loss of private agricultural land holdings and access to
cultivatable land. The BPDB dredging activities also affected local fisherfolk.
The RAP presents details of the supplementary support measures the Project Sponsor intends to provide
for each affected stakeholder group, which include: access to a vocational skills training program;
possible jobs during the construction phase; construction of an elementary school in the village of
Islampur; funding to assist in the construction of an access road to Islampur; and construction of local
hospital.

Involuntary Resefflement
Baseline surveys indicate that BPDB development of the project site resulted in the resettlement of four
households. The Project Sponsor, while not involved in the land acquisition process of the BPDB, has
included these households within their supplementary support measures of skills training and job
prospects.
ES8: Environmental Action Plan
An environmental action plan (EAP) has been developed setting out the project mitigation, management,
monitoring, and ongoing consultation activities for the project. Environmental management requirements
for project contractors have been and will continue to be incorporated in contractual agreements and the
Project Sponsor will implement oversight procedures and personnel to ensure compliance. The detailed
monitoring program, to be implemented and followed by the Project Sponsor, focuses upon compliance
with the environmental, social, health, and safety standards of the GOB, IDCOL, and the ADB.
Specific monitoring items included under the EAP include: NOx emnissions, ground level concentrations
of N02, noise, river morphology, ambient water temperatures, cooling water discharge temperatures,
effluent quality, fisheries survey, success of vegetative plantings, commnunity liaison, and occupational
health and safety reporting.
ES9: Public Consultation and Information Disclosure
For this project, public consultation and information disclosure activities were undertaken based upon
the public consultation and disclosure plan (PCDP) and in accordance with the applicable regulatory
guidelines. The PCDP was implemented using a phased approach that involved a wide spectrum of
stakeholders. To date, consultation program has been completed in three phases as summarised below.
Conceptual Design
Preliminary consultations were undertaken in 1997 as part of a generic EIA report prepared for the ADB
and BPDB based upon a conceptual project design. The conceptual design was used to conduct
preliminary consultations with governrmental agencies, non-governmental organisations, and nearby
villages. Specifically, stakeholders included the DOE, IUCN, the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies
(BCAS), and the villages of Islampur, Ganganagar, and Dhudghata.
Phase I Consultations
Building upon the infornation obtained during the Conceptual Design phase, and following the award of
the first phase of the MPSA to the Project Sponsor, Phase I consultations were carried out by the Project
Sponsor. These consultations, completed between July and August 1999, were undertaken based upon a
new project-specific design. Various stakeholders were consulted, including the IUCN, BCAS, DOE, the

All of the issues identified by the stakeholders during the Phase I consultations can be mitigated and/or
avoided through various project design changes and the continually evolving Social Responsibility
Programme of the Project Sponsor. Despite the issues, there was general widespread support for the
project.
Phase Jl Consultations
Phase II consultations, completed between April and July 2000, consisted of formal and informal
meetings with project stakeholders, courtesy calls, and a national workshop in Dhaka in order to provide
and discuss the findings of the draft EIA report. This final EIA report has been prepared for submission
to the DOE and the project lenders, based upon the consultations conducted to date, as well as comments
received from the project lenders.
Stakeholder Key Issues and Project Response
The key project-specific issues that have been identified by the project stakeholders during the public
consultation activities are described below with the project response shown in italics. Most of the issues
identified are beyond the direct control of the Project Sponsor as they relate to the activities of the BPDB.
•  BPDB access road: the fenced access road to the MPSA has blocked previously existing field
equipment, livestock, and human transportation pathways and has increased vehicular traffic
volumes where there once was none.
The Project Sponsor will request the BPDB to determine an amicable solution on behalf of the project
stakeholders affected by the blocked routes.
*  water logging: development of the access road has lead to increase water logging on lands that
were previously dry during the growing season. This has reduced crop productivity and affected
planting practices.
The Project Sponsor will request the BPDB to maintain the drainage culvert openings to facilitate
increased surface water movement. The Project Sponsor's CLO will from time to time monitor field
conditions in addition to his/her normal community liaison role.
*  sand transport: site filling activities, with no subsequent vegetative cover, has resulted in sand
blowing off the MPSA, affecting both local food and water resources for human consumption.
Sand transport off-site has also affected the productivity of the adjacent lands.
The Project Sponsor will suggest to the BPDB that they may wish to place a vegetative cover on the Phase
II and III lands of the MPSA.

*  site filling: during this activity the BPDB filled lands beyond those they officially acquired
resulting in additional land losses to those inunediately adjacent to the MPSA site boundaries.
The BPDB and the Project Sponsor will jointly survey the project site during the coming dry season and
fix the land boundaries with permanent marker posts. Landowners can sell the excess material or, can use
itfor building purposes.
*  labour: since the MPSA has been acquired and filled by the BPDB, local persons have lost access
to agricultural labour jobs, which has in tum affected their personal incomes.
During construction, the Project Sponsor will ask the Construction Contractor to preferentially hire those
directly affected by the development of Phase I MPSA lands. Others affected by Phase I development, and
losing 20% of their income, or who's income is below the poverty line', will be eligible for enrolment in a
vocational skills training programfunded by the Project Sponsor.
*  housing: it was noted that four houses and one structure had been relocated/lost due to the
acquisition of the MPSA lands.
The Project Sponsor believes that the lost houses were fairly compensated by the GOB. One person per
household will be eligible for enrolment in a vocational skills training program funded by the Project
Sponsor. The CLO will also be available to liaise with the project stakeholders should any issues remain
unresolved.
* river bank erosion: at the village of Islampur, there was concern about bank erosion associated
with dredging and the subsequent slide of the village into the river.
As part of the EAP, the Project Sponsor intends to monitor river morphology in the vicinity of the project  i
site. Post-dredging bethymetry shows that the river in front of the village was not dredged, reducing the
concern that changed morphology might affect Islampur.
*  compensation: comments were received clainiing that the compensation paid by the GOB was
low. Also, surveys indicated that compensation money could not be invested in alternative
income eaming means. Consequently, many of those affected by the acquisition and filling of the
MPSA may have experienced a decline in their income.
The compensation paid by the GOB is considered by the Project Sponsor to be equal to or more than the
market price of land in the area at that time. Since then the price of land has risen, and some stakeholders
mayfeel the compensation was low.
To address the negative effects of the project, the Project Sponsor will ask the Construction Contractor to
preferentially hire able-bodied affected persons during the construction phase. The Project Sponsor will
also provide a vocational skills training program for those households losing 20% or more of their income
due to Phase I development of the MPSA or whose annual incomefalls below the Bangladeshi poverty line.
The poverty line is defined as 18,000 Taka per year.
'The 'poverty line" is defined as Taka 18,000 per year.

ESID: Summary of EIA Findings
The Project Sponsor's power station can be developed with minimal deleterious effects on the natural
environment and on local socio-economic conditions through the various mitigative measures identified
in the EIA. Standard good site practices and operating procedures, in conjunction with the project's EAP,
will provide effective management, monitoring, and mitigation programs to address the identified
concerns. All emissions from the power station, as well as daily operational activities, will be compliant
with DOE, ADB, and IDCOL enviromnental guidelines and health and safety standards and procedures.
The BPDB site preparation activities involved both economic dislocation and involuntary resettlement for
a small number of households. The form of support to be provided by the Project Sponsor to affected
people has been developed as part of the extensive consultation work that has been integrated as part of
the RAP and PCDP activities.
Finally, the power station will operate on indigenous natural gas and will deliver some of the cheapest
electrical power in the world. Its implementation will help Bangladesh to reduce the gap in demand for
and supply of electricity and restore stability in load management on the national grid. The power station
will further relieve the stress that daily load shedding has put on the BPDB, MEMR, and local consumers.

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
AES Meghnaghat Limited (the Project Sponsor) is proposing to build, own, and operate a 450MW
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station in the People's Republic of Bangladesh (Figure 1.1).
The power station is part of the Meghnaghat Power Sites Area (MPSA) and is under the administrative
jurisdiction of Sonargaon Thana of Narayanganj District (Figure 12). Specifically, the MPSA is situated
approximately 27 kilometres southeast of Dhaka City by road, near the Meghna Road Bridge on the
Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.
The land for the power station has been leased from the Government of Bangladesh under a long-tern
land-lease agreement and the power from the station will be sold to the Bangladesh Power Development
Board (BPDB) under the terms of a 22-year power purchase agreement. The Project Sponsor was granted
the concession to build, own, and operate the power station following an open bidding process.
The power station has been proposed in response to Bangladesh's demand for a stable supply of electrical
power. It is estimated that only 15% of the Bangladesh population has access to electricity. Furthermore,
while roughly 80% of Bangladesh's population is rural, only 5% receive electrical power. (Independent,
1998; Zaman, 1997). Consequently, inadequate supply leads to frequent blackouts (see Attachment in
Appendix 11). The problems associated with the existing power supply are further compounded by the
estimated 10% annual growth rate in demand (Canadian High Commission, 1995).
AES Meghnaghat Limited is a special purpose company established under the laws of the Bangladesh to
build, own, and operate the power station. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the AES Corporation2. The
Project Sponsor has employed Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company Limited of Korea as the
Installation, Erection, and Commissioning Contractor and Hyundai Heavy Industries Limited as the
Supply Contractor, herein collectively referred to as the Construction Contractor.
To finance the power station, the Project Sponsor is currently seeking financing from the Infrastructure
Development Company Limited (IDCOL), owned by the Government of Bangladesh and funded by the
World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consequently, the project is being plarmed and
will be built and operated in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of Bangladesh and the
guidelines of the IDCOL and the ADB.
1.1 Project History
1.1.1 MPSA Acquisition
In 1984, Acres Intemational Limited (Acres) and BPDB jointly undertook a 20 year Power System Master
Plan (PSMP). The PSMP was funded by a technical assistance grant from the ADB and was publicly
released in 1985. The 1985 PSMP identified two key sites for large power generation facilities in
Bangladesh: Meghnaghat and Baghabari.
In 1995, and again funded by a technical assistance grant from the ADB, Acres and BPDB updated the
1985 PSMP. The 1995 PSMP created a new planning horizon for the period 1996 - 2015. The plan was
designed around identifying the least-cost investment sequence required to satisfy the country's growing
2 Information on AES Meghnaghat Ltd., the AES Corporation, and the ElIA study team are provided in Appendix A.

demand for electricity. During the preparation of the 1995 PSMP, several private-sector power investors
expressed interest in constructing power stations at the MPSA. From both technical and economic
perspectives, the 1995 PSMP identified the MPSA as the "next most probable large site" for development
(Acres, 1995).
Following the recommendations in the PSMPs, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR)
assigned the BPDB the responsibility to develop 1,200 - 1,300 MW of electricity generation capacity in
three phases at the MPSA (Figure 13).
The BPDB acquired the MPSA land through the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj (DC)
under Land Acquisition Case No. 4 of the fiscal year 1995-96 (L/A Case No. 4/95-96). The BPDB's
acquisition of the land from its private and public landholders followed the procedures required under
the Bangladesh Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982. The DC started the
acquisition process in December 1995 and delivered possession of the land to BPDB in May 1997.
In accordance with the notification issued by the Office of the DC in the Bangladesh Gazette, published
on May 28,1998, the MPSA consists of 230.77 acres of land, of which 145.515 acres were owned by private
landowners and 85.255 acres by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB). This land was used primarily for
paddy cultivation during the dry season and a monsoon fishery during the wet season.
After completion of the site filling and embankment protection works and subsequent construction of an
access road by the BPDB, 70 acres (the project site) out of the total 230.77 acres of the MPSA was leased to
the Project Sponsor for development of the power station. This corresponds to the "Phase I" portion of
the MPSA, as shown on Figure 13.
1.1.2 Altematives and Cost-Benefit Analyses
Several mninistries within GOB have previously evaluated project alternatives as part of their individual
planning and development activities. The results of the various evaluations, set out in detail in Appendix
B, are sunmmarized below in Table 1.1.
Table 1.1: Preferred Project Alternatives
Issue Analysed             Preferred Alternative
Project sHte location      MPSA (Phase I)
Project fuel resource     Indigenous natural gas
Generation technology      Combined cycle gas turbine power station
Mode of transportation     River transport for project materials
Electrical lines           The Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PCGB) to construct and maintain under ADB funding and
PSMP recommendations as part of national grid system to evacuate power from the MPSA and balance
supply-demand between the eastem and westem parts of the country.
Natural gas pipeline       Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (Titas) to construct and maintain
independently of this power project. The 0.5 km pipeline will supply gas to all the phases at MPSA.
A quantitative cost-benefit analysis (Appendix B) was also completed to determine if the preferred
project alternatives were the least-cost options. The results of the cost-benefit analysis supports the
preferred project altematives (Table 1.1) as the favoured options for the development of a new, large
thermal power station for Bangladesh.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1.1.3  Environmental Approval
In 1996, following the land acquisition process initiated in 1995, the BPDB and the ADB sponsored an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study of development of a power station at the MPSA. The EIA
study was prepared by the UK-based consultancy Mott Ewbank Preece (MEP), now Mott MacDonald
Limited, using a "generic" or conceptual design for the project. MEP's EIA report was issued in May 1997
and is publicly available from the ADB.
In 1997, the BDPB formed the Meghnaghat Power Company as a special purpose company to initiate
development the MPSA prior to completion of the public bid process. The BPDB assumed that the
Meghnaghat Power Company would be transferred to the successful bidder and the bidder would
develop the project in the name of this company.
In order to advance the environmental approvals of the project the Meghnaghat Power Company
submitted the 1997 EIA study to the Bangladesh Department of Environment (DOE). The report was
submnitted in support of the Company's application of "Site Clearance" (see Section 2.1 for a description
of the Bangladesh DOE approvals process). On the basis of the MEP 1997 report, DOE issued conditional
Site Clearance to the Meghnaghat Power Company (see Appendix El, Part II for the conditions).
The negotiations between BPDB and AES Corporation of the USA (the first-ranked bidder) concluded
with the project agreements being signed between the BPDB and AES Meghnaghat Limited, a company
formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the AES Corporation. Upon consultation, the DOE indicated
that the Site Clearance issued to the Meghnaghat Power Company would not be transferable to AES
iMeghnaghat Limited, and that a new site clearance application would need to be submitted in the Project
Sponsor's name.
DOE advised that as the Project Sponsor, AES Meghnaghat Ltd. should submit an application for Site
Clearance using the 1997 EIA study, along with any new supporting data they might wish to provide.
The Project Sponsor then prepared an Initial Environmental Examination Report (ESG International,
1999b), using the 1997 EIA as a primary resource. The Site Clearance application, supported by the Initial
Environrnental Examination, was submitted to the DOE on December 9,1999.
On March 12, 2000, the DOE issued a letter to the Project Sponsor giving Site Clearance authorization to
commence construction of the project. Appendix El, Part I provides the Site Clearance letter, including
the list of conditions specified by DOE. Among other things, the Site Clearance letter directed the Project
Sponsor to prepare an EIA report and submit it to DOE for review and approval. To the extent possible,
DOE's Site Clearance comments have been incorporated into this final EIA report; especially Section 5
that provides the results of detailed modelling and analysis of the effects.
The Project Sponsor conummissioned the environmental and social sciences consultancy firm ESG
International Inc. (ESG) of Canada to prepare an EIA study (this report) based upon the specific design
for the project as set out in the construction contract and other signed project agreements. Prior to ESG's
involvement, certain preliminary EIA work had been initiated by Mott MacDonald, including Phase I of
the public consultation program. This final EIA subsequently builds upon MEP's 1997 report by
incorporating analysis of the Project Sponsor's specific design for the power station.

1.2  Key Project Features
The Project Sponsor signed the following project agreements on July 29,1999:                     V
Agreement                           Signatory Party    Reference
Implementation Agreement (IA)            GOB          Appendix DI
Land Lease Agreement (LLA)              BPDB           Appendix D2
Gas Supply Agreement (GSA)               Titas        Appendix D3
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)          BPDB           Appendix D4
There are several associated projects being undertaken by separate and independent sponsors that are
linked to the project, including:
*  site preparation and construction of the access road - under the terns of the Land Lease Agreement
the BPDB is responsible for preparing the site and construction of the 938 metre access road;
*  interconnection to the National Grid - the PGCB is responsible for constructing and operating
three separate 230 KV double circuit electrical transmission lines that will interconnect the power
station to the National Grid. The lines are being installed to connect the eastem region of the
country with the westem region and to balance the demand-supply ratio between the two
regions. Additionally, the lines will to connect the power station to the national grid and
complete the "Dhaka Transmtission Ring", an important objective of the 1995 PSMP; and
*  natural gas pipeline - under the terms of the Gas Supply Agreement Titas is responsible for
constructing and operating a 500 metre natural gas pipeline between its mainline and the MPSA,
as well as a regulating and metering station (RMS) within the land area prepared for the MPSA
Cooling water for the power station will be withdrawn from and discharged to the Meghna River on a
continuous basis. To discharge the cooling water, the Project Sponsor will construct a cooling water
discharge channel to the far end of the MPSA. To further lessen the potential effects of cooling water
discharge on the aquatic environment, the Project Sponsor is currently considering discharge via an
underwater pipeline, into the Meghna River (i.e., -150 - 200 metre in length). Regardless of what option
is ultimnately selected, operation and maintenance activities will be the responsibility of the Project
Sponsor, and all applicable guidelines will be complied with.
Boiler feed water, closed cooling water, potable water, and service water for the power station will be
taken from the Meghna River. A deep tube well, as approved by the DPHE, may remain on-site
following construction, to be used as an emergency means for providing potable water to power station
employees.
The Project Sponsor and the Construction Contractor have identified the various machineries that are
discussed throughout this EIA. The power station will utilize a 2+2+1 configuration comprised of two
Ansaldo V94.2 gas turbine generators (GTG), two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG), and one steam
turbine generator (STG). Both of the GTGs and the STG will have a multi-shaft design. No black start
capabilities are required since the power station will be started by importing electrical energy from the
National Grid. The power station start-up curves, for varied shutdown periods, as well as the shutdown
curve are provided in Appendix G.

3. completion of site preparation and filing works by BPDB - February, 2000
4. acquire Site Clearance certificate from DOE - March, 2000
5. initiate on-site construction works - October, 2000
6. acquire Environmental Clearance certificate from DOE - October, 2000
7. completion of construction activities - April, 2002
8. site clean-up and testing - April, 2002
9. start of commercial operations - September, 2002.
This project schedule is based upon a 23-month preparation and construction period determined by the
Project Sponsor and Construction Contractor as the time required to render the power station
operational.
1.4 EIA Process
The contents of this EIA study are designed to meet DOE, IDCOL, and ADB requirements for an EIA
report as described in Section 2. For ease of interpretation, the EIA has been divided into two volumes:
Volume 1, summarized below, contains an condensed version of the key EIA study findings; while
Volume II contains the supporting technical explanations used to compose Volume I.
This EIA study will be used as a key document for obtaining:
* Environmental Clearance as issued by DOE under the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997; and
* Approval from IDCOL under their Environmental and Social Framework.
The MEP 1997 EIA study was submitted to the ADB by the BPDB to demonstrate project compliance with
ADB environmental guidelines and to address ADB review procedures. The ADB has informed the
Project Sponsor that the 1997 EIA report addresses ADB guidelines and review requirements, and on that
basis the ADB will provide environmental clearance for this project. A courtesy copy of this EIA study
will be forwarded to the ADB for their files.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
A key component of EIA methodology is identification and description of the pre-project environmental
elements in the study area, or "baseline conditions". During this ELA study the following analyses were
undertaken to establish and confirm the baseline conditions of the study area:
* general socio-economic household survey (Appendix I2)*;
* community profile of the six villages adjacent to the MPSA (Appendix I3);
* numerical model testing of the BPDB's dredging activities and a post dredging analysis
(Appendix 14 and Attachment 14-1);
* laboratory analysis of dredged river materials (Appendix 15);
*  a summary review of Bangladesh's cyclonic storms (Appendix 16);
* ambient air quality monitoring (Appendix 17);
* ambient noise monitoring (Appendix 18);
* surface water and groundwater laboratory analysis (Appendix I9);
- ecological survey and IUCN classifications (Appendix 110);
* fisheries survey (Appendix 111);
* road traffic survey (Appendix 112);
* river traffic survey (Appendix 113);
*  disease vectors in Bangladesh (Appendix 114);
e archaeological and cultural sites survey (Appendix 115);
e general land-use survey (Appendix 116);
* detailed land-use survey (Appendix 117);
* project affected persons surveys (Appendix 118)*; and
* construction contractor's execution plan (Appendix 119)
Detailed descriptions of the methodologies used to complete these baseline studies are also provided in
the appendices (Volume 11 of this EIA report).
NOTE: studies marked with an asterisk (*) contain person-specific field notes and surveys and are considered
confidential. Such confidential documentation is held by the Project Sponsor for release on a need-to-knew basis only.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
2. LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY, AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
Environmental approvals for the construction and operation of power stations in Bangladesh fall under
the jurisdiction of the DOE, a department under the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MEF). This EIA
study is also required to address the environmental and social review requirements of the Project
Sponsor's lenders and their partners. Consequently, this section discusses the applicable legislative and
regulatory requirements of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and the guidelines and policies of
IDCOL and the ADB.
2.1 Government of Bangladesh
2.1.1 EIA Requirements
The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act, 1995 (BECA) stipulates "no industrial unit or project shall
be established or undertaken without obtaining environmental clearance from the Director General of
DOE." BECA assigns DOE the decision-making power for reviewing and evaluating EIA studies,
including issuing Site and Environmental Clearances.
As regulated by the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997 (ECR), DOE requires that the Project Sponsor
obtain Site Clearance prior to construction activities and Environmental Clearance prior to operation of
the power station. The ECR assigns development projects into four categories according to their potential
for adverse environmental impacts. Schedule 1 of the ECR identifies power stations under the red
category; the category requiring the most detailed level of environmental and socio-economic assessment.
The environmental clearance process for red category projects involves three-steps as shown on Figure
2.1. Step one involves obtaining Site Clearance to permit pre-construction and construction activities.
There is a prescribed process for applying for Site Clearance that includes submission of the [nitial
Environmental Examination (ESG, 1999b). As noted, the Project Sponsor obtained the Site Clearance
certificate from the DOE on March 12,2000 (Appendix El, Part I).
The second step is to obtain approval of the EIA study. The EIA is to be prepared on the basis of the scope
of work identified in the Initial Environmental Examination, and upon any conditions specified by the
DOE in their Site Clearance letter. As indicated, the DOE's comments have been incorporated within this
EIA study. After approval of this EIA study by the DOE, a Letter of Credit can be opened for all imported
equipment and machinery.
The last step in the approvals process is securing Environmental Clearance. This permit is required before
the power station can be operated. In certain circumstances (undefined in the guidelines), this three-step
process can be combined into one step (as shown in Figure 2.1), pending a pre-arranged agreement with
DOE (MEF, 1997). Such an arrangement was not followed for the AES Meghnaghat project.

2.1.2 Additional Requirements
Bangladesh has established Environmental Quality Standards for parameters such as air, water, and other
industrial emissions as set out in the Environment Conservation Rules (Appendix E2). Additional
information, pertaining to the principal organisations responsible for environmental protection and other
relevant envirornmental policies of Bangladesh, is provided in Appendix E3.
2.2 Infrastructure Development Company Limited
IDCOL has been established by the GOB as a company registered under the Bangladesh Companies Act
1994 to facilitate private investment using credit made available by the World Bank (IDCOL, 1997). As a
condition of receiving the credit, IDCOL is required to ensure that its infrastructure projects conform to
the environmental and social requirements of Bangladesh as well as the operational policies, directives,
and business processes of the World Bank. The operational policies of the World Bank are set out in
Section 2=.
In 1997, IDCOL published its Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), the main text of which is provided
in Appendix E4. Among other things, the ESF sets out the environrmental and social policy of IDCOL,
establishes applicable environmental and social standards/guidelines, and provides the procedural
framework for processing candidate projects.
The environmental and social assessment process of IDCOL is summarised in Figure 2.2. An EIA
(referred to by IDCOL as an Environmental Study Report or ESR) represents one of several required
steps.
2.2.1 EIA Requirements
In order to demonstrate compliance with the World Bank's environmental and social requirements, all
projects involved with IDCOL must submit initial screening reports, terms of reference, an EIA, Lenders
Agreements, compliance reports, and audit compliance reports to the World Bank. Before projects can
proceed, the World Bank must approve the terms of reference, the EIA, and associated agreements
(IDCOL, 1997). Since IDCOL funding is involved in this project, the approvals process for this project
follows these World Bank requirements.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The ADB guidelines further specify that such environmental effects should be considered in all EIAs
relating to thermal power stations (Appendix E6). Some of these effects include problems due to project
location, problems relating to planning and design, construction and operational issues, and impacts
from power transmission facilities. The ADB also requires that EIA studies include:
*    an assessment which delineates the significant environmental effects of the project;
*    a description and quantification of the effects;
*    a description  of feasible mitigation  measures for minimising, eliminating, or offsetting
unavoidable adverse effects; and
*    a recommendation of the most appropriate mitigation and/or enhancement measures.
2.4   International Conventions
Bangladesh is party to several international environmental conventions, which include: Biodiversity,
Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes,
Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, and Wetlands. Bangladesh has also signed the Law of the Sea
Convention, although this has yet to be ratified.
2.5 Concordance Analysis for Project Requirements
In order to ensure that the project has addressed the requirements of the GOB, IDCOL, and the ADB, an
analysis has been undertaken to examine the concordance of policies, procedural issues, and guidelines of
the three institutions (Table 2.1). Incorporated with the analysis, are the corresponding sections of the
EIA report that address the specific policy, procedural, and/or guideline requirements.

As shown in Table 2.3, S02 emissions from the power station should be less than 0.2 metric tons per day
(tpd) per MWe. As well, the concentration of SO2 in flue gases should not exceed 2,000 mg/Nm3 (dry at
15% oxygen). For combustion turbine units, the maximum NO. emission level is 125 mg/Nm3 (dry at 15%
oxygen). Particulate matter (PM1o) emnission linmts are 50 mg/Nm3 (World Bank, 1998).

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The MPSA was identified in the 1995 PSMP (Acres, 1995) as a top-ranked site for development of three
new private sector power stations, to be developed in three phases (Appendix C). The MPSA is situated
approximately 27 kilometres southeast of Dhaka by road (Figure 1.2).
The concession agreement between the Project Sponsor and the BPDB allows the Project Sponsor
exclusive development of Phase I of the MPSA, which consist of approximately 70 acres of land. The land
was scheduled to be tumed over to the Project Sponsor on November 15, 1999 following completion of
site filling and grading activities by the BPDB, however the Project Sponsor could not take possession
until May 26, 2000 due to the existence of some defects with the site filling works. The site was
eventually taken over once the BPDB agreed to pay for the remedial work, which the Project Sponsor is
currently executing via the Construction Contractor.
As described in the Implementation Agreement, areas of responsibility for the project were divided
among the Project Sponsor, Titas, the PGCB, and BPDB. Project Sponsor is responsible for the following
specific works related to construction of the power station which includes: administrative offices; central
control and electrical rooms; warehousing facilities; dormnitory; and workshops. Titas and the BPDB, state
owned boards/companies, are responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the
following associated infrastructure:
* site preparation and a 938 metre access road completed and maintained by the BPDB; and
• a 500 metre natural gas spur pipeline and a RMS to be constructed and maintained by Titas.
The Project Sponsor is not involved in any way with the construction and/or operation activities of the
BPDB or Titas. However, since the Titas and BPDB works (i.e., spur pipeline, RMS, and access road
construction) are not receiving development capital from any international lending institutions, the
Project Sponsor, as part of its social responsibility program, volunteered to mitigate their social effects by
sponsoring a RAP (Appendix K).
The PGCB, a subsidiary company of the BPDB, will construct a high voltage transmission line that will
run from Comilla to Haripur via the MPSA. The line will connect the eastern region of the country to
Dhaka (i.e., the central region) and the western region in order to facilitate a balance in the demand-
supply of electricity in the country. The AES power station will be connected to this line to deliver power
to the national grid. Future power stations at Meghnaghat will also be connected to this transmnission
system via construction of another high voltage line from the MPSA - Hasnabad to evacuate power from
the future power stations.
Cooling water will be discharged to the Meghna River via a cooling water discharge channel constructed
and operated within the MPSA by the Project Sponsor as shown in Appendix C. However, the BPDB
and SWMC are currently assessing the possibility of extending a cooling water discharge pipeline
roughly 100 to 150 metres in length into the near mniddle of the river's main channel. The Project Sponsor
will implement whichever option is determined to have the least adverse environmental effects.
In addition to the project site specific and associated infrastructure activities, consideration has also been
given to the typical lifecycle of a 450 MW power station, to better anticipate potential concerns.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
3.1  Life Cycle Overview
A life cycle analysis identifies the major issues and concerns that are likely to evolve over the life of a
project. For a power project, these issues are construction, operation and maintenance, and
decommissioning. These issues have been considered during the EIA prior to any non-reversible actions
being undertaken by the Project Sponsor, contractors, and other project associates. The following sections
identify the key activities to be completed and facilities to be constructed and operated over the lifetime
of this project.
3.1.1 Site Preparation
The 1997 MEP EIA recommended that the MPSA be raised to eliminate seasonal floods. Under the terms
of the Land Lease Agreement, the access road and site preparation works, including raising the level of
the site, were the responsibility of the BPDB.
The Chinese company, China National Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation
(CWHEC), was hired by the BPDB to raise the MPSA's elevation one metre above the 200-year highest
flood level (HFL), which is +8.0 m Public Works Datum (PWD) or +7.54 m above the mean sea level
(MSL). Approximately 1,880,000 m3 of fill material was dredged from the Meghna River for the Phase I
site works, completed in September 1999, resulting in a finished site elevation of roughly one meter above
the HFL.
3.1.2  Construction
The Construction Contractor and their subcontractors will construct the power station and adhere to the
Construction Contractor's Safety, Health, and Environmental Policy and Procedures Manual (SH&E Manual)
(Appendix F).
Project site construction activities, leading up to the operation of the power station, are anticipated to take
23 months (Figure 3.1). To complete the construction works within this period, a peak labour force of 800
persons will be required, representing an accumulated total of 13,298 person-months. Approximately 50%
of the peak labour force may be supplied through local and neighbouring communities. Local skills and
personnel that will be required during construction include: welders, riggers, pipe fitters, iron and plate
workers, painters, carpenters, masons and plasterers, duct workers, and tinsmiths. A summary of
Construction Contractor's activities and general requirements is contained in Appendix 119.
Where appropriate, project site housing and support facilities will be provided by the Construction
Contractor during the construction phase of project development in accordance with their SH&E Manual.
As set out in the SH&E Manual, the Construction Contractor will be required to provide additional
services such as toilets, food, water, and healthcare. Table 3.1 outlines the anticipated housing and
support facility requirements. The project site is sufficiently large to allow these facilities to be located
within the boundaries of the Project Sponsor's leased lands.

In accordance with the Construction Contractor's SH&E Manual, drinking water will be supplied and
dispensed to workers in a manner which prevents contamination. Only water approved by the
Construction Contractor, consistent with the GOB's Environmental Quality Standard for Drinking Water,
will be utilized for drinking and cooking activities. Water outlets dispensing unsafe drinking water will
be clearly identified and posted in both English and Bengali as "Caution: Water Unfit for Drinking, Cooking,
or Washing." Further, sanitary containers and waste receptacles for paper-recyclable cups will be
provided to minimize spread of disease through use of "common" cups.
Washing facilities will be provided as needed by the Construction Contractor to maintain sanitary and
healthy working conditions at the project site. Each washing facility will be provided with water, soap, an
individual drying mechanism, and metal-covered receptacle(s) for waste. Separate cleaning facilities will
also be provided for workers engaged in the application of paints, coatings, or other works where
contaminants may be harmful.
The Construction Contractor will also provide toilet facilities at the project site in the following ratios:
Number of Workers: Minimum Number of Facilities
< 50: ....            1 toilet
50 - 500: ..     .. I toilet and I urinal per 50 workers
> 500: ....           I toilet and 1 urinal per 100 workers after the 500 mark.
Toilets will be constructed so that the occupants will be protected against weather and falling objects. All
cracks will be sealed and the doors will be tight fitting, self-closing, and latchable. In addition, each toilet
will be equipped with a metal, plastic, or porcelain urinal, as required. Sufficient lighting and adequate
ventilation will also be provided.
As part of the SH&E Manual, the Construction Contractor has also developed construction dust control
measures, sediment and erosion control measures, and procedures to dispose of waste materials
generated during construction. These detailed measures and procedures are set out in Appendix F.
Approximately 160 specialized personnel, who are not expected to be available in the local area, will be
hired from outside the local area and/or country. The specialized personnel are required to complete
construction tasks such as installation of the gas turbines and their generators, HRSG, steam turbine and

proximity to Dhaka City, Narayanganj, other developed areas near the project site, and the Construction
Contractor's housing provisions, it is anticipated that these persons will be able to find pre-existing local
accommodations.
All of the major power station components (e.g., GTG, STG, and HRSG) will be manufactured outside of
Bangladesh and shipped via ocean barges to the Country's second largest seaport at Mongla. From
Mongla Port, major power station components and other heavy and long distance cargo will be
transported to the project site via an inland river route, on barges owned by the Construction Contractor.
The planned route remains navigable throughout the year and is safe for transport during the monsoon
season.
To avoid the congestion and frequent labour slowdowns of Chittagong Port, as well as exposure of cargo
to stormy seas during transfer of materials to the project site across the Bay of Bengal, the country's
primary port at Chittagong will not be used for heavy equipment transfer. Some light cargo may be
offloaded at Chittagong Port for transportation to the site on trucks via the Dhaka-Chittagong highway.
A wharf will be constructed at the project site to allow the unloading of the cargo transported by barge.
The Construction Contractor has received permission from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport
Authority (BIWTA) to construct the wharf at the project site (Appendix D5).
During the approximate 23-month duration of construction and erection of the power station, various
vehicles and heavy equipment will be required. Table 3.2 outlines the typical types of construction
equipment that the Construction Contractor may use during construction of the power station.

3.1.3 Operation and Maintenance
There will be no Operations and Maintenance contract with a third party operator, as the power station
will be owned and operated by the Project Sponsor.
According to the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement, the power station will operate on a dispatch
basis at operational loads between 25% and 100% of the rated capacity. However, it is anticipated that the
power station will operate at 100% load due to the current power shortage in Bangladesh and the
projected low cost of power produced by this station relative to other power stations in Bangladesh. At
partial plant loads the individual turbines will be operated at different loads to maximize overall
efficiency and mninimize NO, emnissions. For example, at 50% plant load one turbine could be operated at
100% load instead of both turbines at 50%.
The turbines will operate for approximately 8,000 hours per year with approximately 35 - 40 starts per
year. The power station will require power to be irnported from the grid in order to start the turbines (i.e.,
there will be no "black start" capability). However, an emergency diesel generator will be installed to
provide back-up power for safe shutdown of the power station and associated systems in emergency
situations.
Titas will supply natural gas to the power station under the terms of the Gas Supply Agreement. The
agreement specifies the quality and quantity of the sulphur-free, indigenous natural gas to be delivered
to the project site. A continuous supply of natural gas will be required for the operation of the power
station and to maintain uninterrupted power production to supply the national grid. It is estimated that
the power station will utilize approximately 80,000,000 standard cubic feet (SCF) per day when operating
at 100% load. The natural gas will be delivered to the power station from the RMS at a minimum pressure
of 160 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and a maximum pressure of 200 psig.
Lubricating and hydraulic oils, in standard 45 gallon steel drums, will be delivered to the power station
on a regular basis. The drums will be stored at the project site in an area provided with secondary
containmnent until their contents are transferred into use. It is estimated that the power station will
consume 250 drums of lubricant per year. Where possible, the drums will be sent for reuse or for
recycling at local facilities. The estimated quantities of oil are shown in Table 3.3.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
Most of the traffic associated with plant operations will be related to shift changes that may occur two to
three times per day depending on the shift schedule. An estimated 23 to 24 personnel will be required for
daytime operations and approximately 3 to 4 persons for nighttime operations. Carpooling will be
encouraged to minimize plant-generated traffic. It is anticipated that vehicles with loads of five tonnes or
more will not occur more than two to three times per week. These heavy vehicles would be involved in
the transfer of heavy loads such as bulk lube oil drums to or from the power station.
3.1.4 Decommissioning
The design life of the power station is estimated to be 25 years, three years longer than the Power
Purchase Agreement term. However, it is not uncommon for power stations in today's market to have a
longer useful life than the design life. If the Power Purchase Agreement, Land Lease Agreement, Gas
Supply Agreement, and the other relevant agreements are not extended or renewed, and an alternative,
economical fuel is available, the power station may be retrofitted to support alternative power
generation. This option is possible, provided that the required retrofits and new emissions rates meet the
applicable standards and guidelines.
If retrofitting is not a feasible option, and the operational life of the power station has expired, the power
station will be decommissioned according to the requirements of regulatory authorities at that time.
Provided that the plant is operated as set out in this EIA study, there should be no significant
enviroranental liabilities that will require clean up or remediation.
3.2 Power Station Facilities
3.2.1 CCGT System
The Combustion Process
Gas turbines are internal combustion engines comprised of three major components: an air compressor, a
fuel combustor, and a power turbine. Ambient air is drawn in and compressed up to 30 times its ambient
pressure and is directed to the combustor section where fuel is introduced, ignited, and burned. These
hot combustion gases are diluted with additional air from the compressor and are then directed to the
power turbine. Energy from the hot, expanding exhaust gases is then captured in the form of shaft
horsepower.
The heat content of the exiting gases can either be discarded via a stack without heat recovery (simple
cycle), or used to raise steam for a steam turbine generator (combined cycle) (Figure 3.2). The power
station will not operate in simple cycle except when the steam turbine bypass is in use. No bypass stack
will be used.
The Gas Turbines
The Ansaldo V94.2 gas turbines for this project will consist of a single shaft design containing 16 stages of
axial compression and a four stage axial turbine sharing a common rotor. The turbine is suitable for
driving generators at both base and peak load scenarios and is designed for 50 Hertz (Hz) operation. The

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
V94.2 is a heavy-duty gas turbine generator (GTG) capable of burning both gaseous and liquid fuels. The
nominal base load power output at the International Standards Organisation (ISO) conditions3 is 159 MW
for natural gas and 155.5 MW when burning light oil (Ansaldo, 1999).
Although the Ansaldo V94.2 GTGs are capable of dual combustion, natural gas will be the only fuel used
to power the plant. No liquid back-up fuels or on-site storage facilities will be included for the GTGs.
The Ansaldo/Siemens hybrid bumers contained within the V94.2 GTGs utilise a dry low NO, burner
which will operate on natural gas in diffusion mode up to 50% of load and in pre-mix mode at all loads
above 50% and up to 100% of the rated capacity. NO,, emnissions increase gradually from 0 to 50% load. At
all loads above 50%, the pre-mix mode greatly reduces NO,, emissions. Maintaining combustion
temperature along with excess oxygen levels in the turbines will further minimise NO, emissions while
increasing the efficiency of the power station.
The HRSGs
Two triple pressure HRSGs will be installed as part of the CCGT system; one for each of two GTGs. Each
HRSG will be optimized for the available exhaust heat from each GTG and to the requirements of the
steam turbine generator (STG). The HRSG will contain an extended surface water tube-type boiler,
complete with economnizer, superheater, and other ancillary equipment. Steam from the two HRSGs will
be sent to a single steam turbine.
The STG selected for the project can utilize more steam than can be generated from the heat contained in
the exhaust gases of the GTGs. To generate the additional heat needed to operate the STG at 100% of its
rated capacity, natural gas will be fired in duct-burners installed in the HRSGs.
The Steam Turbine
Fuji Electric of Japan will provide the STG. The STG will capture a portion of the remaining heat energy
after initial firing and combustion in the GTG and will be capable of a nominal base load power output of
approximately 189 MW at 100% load. The power block for this project is shown in Figure 33.
3.2.2 High Voltage Substation
A 230 kV substation is required to process the power produced by the CCGT into a form suitable for
transmission and delivery to the BPDB. Transmission will occur via a 230 kV line (to be developed by the
PGCB) running from BPDB's existing substation at Comilla to the Haripur Substation. The Project
Sponsor will be responsible for construction of the high voltage substation, which will include a double
bay, SF6 breaker and other ancillary structures. All substation facilities will be free of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs). Under the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement, the BPDB has the option to buy
the substation from the Project Sponsor to facilitate power transmission from future power stations at the
MPSA (phases IJ and III), and to assist with the overall load management of the national grid.
3ISO conditions are based upon ISO 2314 and DrN (Gerrnan Standardisation Institute) 4341 standards.

3.2.3  Power Station Fuel
Natural gas will be supplied to the project site via an underground steel pipeline to be constructed and
operated by Titas (Section 3.3). A natural gas specification has been written into the Gas Supply
Agreement as a guarantee.
An analysis of a natural gas sample obtained from the Titas gas field is shown in Table 3.5. This analysis
indicates that the natural gas is primarily comprised of methane and ethane. Minor proportions are
comprised of other hydrocarbons (e.g., propane and butane) and inert gases such as carbon dioxide and
nitrogen. The natural gas to be supplied by Titas is free of sulphur and ash. The Titas Gas Field,
discovered in 1962, has probable and proven reserves totalling 4.133 TSCF.

Prior to entering the combustion chamber, the natural gas will be compressed and heated to
approximately 200°C. Heating will vaporize any liquid droplets entrained in the natural gas, improving
the operating efficiency of the CCGT.
3.2.4 Plant Control Systems
Power station functions will be controlled by a digital microprocessor-based DCS, operated from the
central control room. Operation of the DCS will involve the implementation of interface facilities for the
acquisition and analysis of plant data to be achieved through the use of a redundant data highway,
communicators, processors, and operator consoles.
Comprehensive controls, instrumentation, and alarm equipment for the gas turbine will also be
integrated with the DCS to monitor daily plant operations. This control system, the Ansaldo GTCMPS94,
is fully automated, including automatic start-up, operation, shutdown, drive and fuel control, GTG
protection, and monitoring.

In the event of adverse operating conditions, an emergency shutdown system will be activated in order to
automatically shutdown discrete equipment, a system, or the power station in a safe and controlled  W
manner. An emergency backup diesel generator will be installed to provide power to safely shut down
the system.
3.2.5 Cooling Water Systems
The cooling water system for the power station will be comprised of a once-through cooling water system
(CWS) and a closed cooling water system (CCWS). The process flow diagrams for both cooling water
systems are-provided in Appendix G.
Cooling water will be withdrawn from the Meghna River via an intake channel. The highest and lowest
water levels assumed during preliminary design were +5.65 metres and +0.946 metres (PWD) and were
determined based upon information supplied by the BWDB. Based upon these design parameters, the
bed of the intake channel was set at a level of -3.56 metres PWD and the channel crest at +8.2 metres
PWD. These channel levels will be further evaluated during the detailed design stage of the project.
3.2.5.1 Once-Through Cooling Water System
The CWS will utilize water withdrawn from the Meghna River. The Project Sponsor has received a No
Objection Certificate from the BWDB for taking and discharging the water (Appendix D7). Spent water
will be returned to the river after it has passed through the CWS. The CWS will supply water to the
condenser of the STG and to the closed cooling water heat exchanger. Two single stage, suction impeller
circulating water pumps will be installed independently within the CWS intake structure so that they can
be isolated for maintenance activities while sustaining basic water intake requirements.
Other components of the CWS include intake stop gates, bar and band screens, a water pump for the air
compressor, wet well pumps, anti-fouling system, ultrasonic fish deterrent device, intake and discharge
pipes, and associated electrical equipment and instrumentation.
In order to conduct routine maintenance activities, stop gates will be made of carbon steel sheets that can
be closed individually at each inlet of the intake structure. Guide frames for locating the stop gates will be
provided within the CWS intake chambers.
Removable coarse bar screens will be installed to prevent large pieces of trash (vegetation and other
items) and large fish from entering the intake structure. If appropriate, a trash rake may be installed to
remove the items collected on the coarse bar screens, either by mechanical or manual operation. Smaller,
rotating self-cleaning band screens, or similar less lethal screens such as inclined-plane screens, will be
installed to eliminate the potential for fine trash and small fish to enter the intake structure. Should trash
and/or fish enter into the intake structure, they may plug the condenser tubes during continuous
operation. Where appropriate, a set of pressurized wash pumps may be installed to assist with the
cleaning of the band screens.
Chlorine will be used as an anti-fouling material to prevent growth of bacteria, algae, fungi, or other
mnicro-organisms within the pipelines, condenser tubes, valves, and other control elements in the
circulating line. Shock doses will be applied at the suction point of the circulating cooling water pumps,

two or three times a day, for a total time of approximately one hour within each 24-hour period. The
cooling water discharge line will be provided with a system to control the free chlorine content in the
outgoing water so that the value of residual chlorine in the discharge cooling water will meet both
Bangladesh and World Bank guidelines.
3.2.5.2 Closed Cooling Water System
The CCWS will supply demnineralised cooling water to the GTG and the STG oil coolers, pumps, thrust
bearings, steam and water samplers, air compressors, and any other equipment requiring cooling water.
Indirect coolers will be utilized, capable of dissipating the total heat rejected within the system at 100%
load.
Two auxiliary circulating water pumps will be provided to supply the necessary cooling water for the
CCWS. These pumps will be of a vertical type, drawing suction directly from the main circulating water
intake structure, and are capable of operating independently. During shutdown activities, operation of
the main circulating water pumps is not required and they will be shutdown. Consequently, booster
pumps, drawing suction from the discharge of the main circulating water pumps, are not required. Two
additional, horizontal centrifugal, closed cooling water pumps will be provided to circulate the closed
cycle cooling water.
One water head tank will be installed to provide the necessary buffer volume to meet expansion due to
varying water temperatures in the system. The water head tank will contain an appropriate level of water
to ensure that sufficient pressure is maintained throughout the system and to replenish system losses. A
small diameter pipe will be used to connect the water head tank to the CCWS.
Demineralized water will be used as make-up for the CCWS. As the system will be highly pure and free
from inorganic or organic matters, there will be a minimum need for controlling growth of any micro-
organisms in the cooling water distribution network. However, the cooling water has potential to be
fouled due to leakage of raw water in the CCWS heat exchangers.
Chlorine or sodium hypo-chlorite may be injected at low concentrations into the CCWS to control the
growth of bacteria, algae, fungi, and other micro-organisms and prevent fouling. To protect the CCWS
from corrosion or deposition of scale, an anti-corrosion agent and scale dispersant (e.g., phosphonate,
polyphosphate, or azole) may be applied periodically. If required, other standard biocides (e.g., polycrin)
may be injected into the CCWS to aid in controlling unwanted build-up within the system. Since the
cooling water will circulate within closed-loop systems, discharges due to leakage and on-going water
requirements will be minimal.
3.2.6 Water Supply and Treatment Systems
3.2.6.1 Water Supply System
Systems will be constructed for the supply of water to the general service water, potable water, and water
treatment plant systems as follows:
general service cold water to the boiler, ventilation and air conditioning system plant control
rooms, battery rooms, and other relevant areas of the power station;

* potable water for drinking, showers, basins, sinks, kitchens, and any other fittings and equipment
used by staff; and
#  hot general service water for cleaning of washable ventilation filters and other equipment as
required.
Water will be supplied from the Meghna River via the cooling water intake structure. As an emergency
backup to river water, solely for the purposes of potable water requirements, the Project Sponsor may
maintain deep tube wells to extract groundwater. Permission for such works has been obtained from the
Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE).
A filtration and chlorinating plant will be installed to treat raw water for service water, fire fighting, and
potable uses. In addition, make-up for boiler water and closed cooling water will be treated in the
derineralization plant. The treated, potable water will be temporarily stored in a small, elevated water
storage tank (i.e., 10 m3) to ensure a constant supply of water in case of supply interruptions.
3.2.6.2 Water Treatment System
The Water Treatment System (WTS) is designed to include the processing of raw water through
clarification, filtration, demineralisation, and storage of service and potable water (refer to process flow
diagrams in Appendix G). Raw water for make-up, service, and potable water will be pre-treated
through one or several of these processes. A portion of the filtered water will be treated in the
demineralisation plant, which will consist of ion exchangers and a regeneration system with chemical
feed facilities. The WTS can provide potable water for human consumption, service water for general
plant requirements, and dernineralized water for the condenser and HRSG boiler.
The wastewater from bottom of the clarifier will be sent to the chemnical wastewater pond where it will be
mixed with regeneration and dewatered waste prior to pH adjusting. The clarified water from the top of
the clarifier will be passed through a pressure filter. From there, it will be distributed for use in the
service water, potable water, and demineralisation systems.
The microprocessor-based DCS control system will allow the option to regenerate the exchangers
individually or in groups to match system loading requirements. An operator will identify the
exchangers to be regenerated via a selector switch. The regeneration rinse system will be optiniized in
order to minimise wastewater production.
3.2.6.3 Clarifier
Raw water, supplied from the river, will be pumped into the clarification system after primary settling
and aeration. Before entering the clarifier tank, treatment chemicals such as lime, alum, and coagulant aid
will be added to the water, as necessary, to aid filtration of the suspensions and to partially reduce water
hardness. At 100% load conditions, the power station will produce approximately 622 m3/day of clarified
water, of which roughly 475 m3/day will be further treated in the demineralisation plant, 26 m3/day will
be chlorinated for supply as potable water, and the remaining volume will be consumed for various
services in the power station.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Several inputs are used in the clarification process and are discussed below. Specific toxicity, handling,
and storage procedures for these chemicals will be covered in detail in the plant safety procedures and
draft emergency response plan (Appendices LI and L2).
1. Lime ICa(OH)2]: a lime solution may be added to partially reduce the hardness of the raw water.
Lime reacts with the dissolved calcium and magnesium bicarbonates, and forms insoluble
calcium carbonates and magnesium hydroxide that precipitate from the water. These are
removed as sludge along with other solids.
2. Aluminium Sulphate [A12(SO4)31: alum quickens the precipitation of the suspended solids in the
water. Its addition also depresses the solubility of magnesium hydroxide helping to further lower
the hardness on account of magnesium.
3. Coagulant Aid: an organic polymer will be added as an aid to the aluminium sulphate and to
accelerate filtration of the suspensions, which otherwise will not precipitate.
4. Chlorine [C12] / Sodium Hypo-Chlorite INaOCC]: either chlorine or sodium hypo-chlorite will be
used to destroy the pathogenic and other harmful micro-organisms present in the water to make
it suitable for drinking. The value of residual chlorine in the discharged cooling water will meet
both the drinking water guidelines of Bangladesh (0.2 mg/I) and the World Bank (0.5 mg/l).
Any sludge generated by the clarification and filtration process will mainly contain suspended solids
settled in the clarifier, and the precipitated reaction products which are predominantly harnless calcium
carbonate [CaCO3J and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2]. Sludge generation by the WTS is expected to
be approximately 600 kg/day. Appendix 19 shows the laboratory results of the river water analysis. A
process flow diagram for the power station's water balance is included in Appendix G.
3.2.6.4 Demineralisation Plant
Demineralized water storage tanks and a distribution system will be installed as part of the WTS. An
acrylic base anion resin exchanger will also be incorporated into the design of the WTS, to increase
resistance to organic fouling, enabling the generation of the following water quality:
conductivity: < 0.5 micro S/cm at 20°C;
total dissolved solids: < 0.5 mg/1 (including silica); and
*    total silica: < 0.05 mg/l as SiO2.
The demineralisation plant will use both sulphuric acid and caustic soda to regenerate the exhausted ion
exchange resins. Sulphuric acid will be delivered at 98% strength while caustic soda will be delivered in
liquid form at 46% strength. Cylindrical storage tanks, located at ground level, will be provided to
contain these solutions, with a usable storage capacity of:
*    98% sulphuric acid: 20 tonnes plus one month's requirements at full load; and
*    46% caustic soda: 20 tonnes plus one month's requirements at full load.
The storage tanks will be situated within a secondary containment area capable of containing 110% of the
total tank capacity. Both parameters are described below:

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. Sulphuric Acid [H2S04]: sulphuric acid will be used to regenerate the cation-exchange resin
employed in removal of cations from the water. Sulphuric acid restores the active anionic sites of
the exhausted resin by replacing the hydrogen ion for calcium, magnesium, and sodium ions
absorbed in the resin during the ion exchange process. These metal ions are removed with the
regeneration waste in the form of their respective soluble sulphates. Any surplus acid leaving
with the regeneration waste will be neutralized by adding the equivalent amount of alkali in the
neutralisation basin of the wastewater.
2. Caustic Soda [NaOHI: caustic soda will be used to regenerate the exhausted anion exchange
resins employed in removal of anions from the water. The soluble sodium salt reaction products
will be removed with the regeneration waste. Any excess alkali leaving the system will be
neutralized in the wastewater treatment plant by adding the equivalent amount of acid.
3.2.6.5 Summary
Table 3.6 summarises the primnary water type and associated water quality parameters required for the
power station operations. An overview of the various chemicals that are likely to be utilised in the WTS,

3.2.7   Wastewater Treatment System
Wastewater, including settled sludge from  the clarifier, waste from  the belt filter press and chemical
storage area, regeneration waste from demineralization plant, and HRSG blow-down, will be collected in
a chemical wastewater pond (refer to process flow diagrams Appendix G). Cleaning waste from the
HRSG will be collected in an abnormal wastewater pond, to be then directed to the chemical wastewater
pond after prelimninary treatment with air blowing. Waste from the powerhouse, transformer area,
workshop, and maintenance house, which contain oils, will be gathered into an oily wastewater pond
and then passed through a Corrugated Plate Interceptor (CPI) oil separator, to skim the oil from the
wastewater. The oil-free wastewater will be transferred to the chemical wastewater pond and the
skimmed oil will be stored for disposal.
The CPI oil separator functions on the principle of differences in the specific gravities of oil and water.
This separator incorporates inclined plates and corrugated packs mounted parallel to each other. As
wastewater flows between the plates, the lighter oil globules float up the plates into the concave upper
corrugations and coalesce into larger globules. They then move along the plates to the trailing edges or
"weep holes", and then to the floating layers at the surface. Separation is achieved due to gravity and the
inclined plate.
The efficiency of a CPI oil separator is directly  proportional to its surface area. Thus, to maximize
efficiency, the surface area is increased by installing parallel plates in the separator chamber. The plates
are installed in an inclined position to encourage oil collected on the under sides of the plates to move
toward the surface of the separator, whereas sludge collected on the plates gravitates toward the bottom
of the separator. The plates are corrugated to improve the oil and sludge collection ability of the
separator.

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MECHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The efficiency of a CPI oil separator is approximately 90% and the effluent coming out of the separator
will have less than 10 ppm of oil; below both the Bangladesh and World Bank guidelines. Of the daily
generation of 249 m3 wastewater in the plant, oily waste will constitute approxirnately 65 m3.
The wastewater from the chemical wastewater pond will be pumped to a pH adjustment tank for
neutralisation either by acid or by alkali depending on the pH. A coagulant will be added to the
coagulation tank to aid settlement of the suspended particles in the wastewater. The wastewater will then
be directed to a sedimentation basin where the sludge will gradually settle to the bottom of the tank to be
collected by a rotating scrapper. The sludge collected from the bottom of the sedimentation basin will be
mixed with a polymer for further thickening and the concentrated sludge will then be dewatered with a
belt-filter press, to be collected in a hopper for disposal after drying. The wastewater from the belt filter
press is sent back to the chemical wastewater pond.
The treated, clear effluent passing over the sedimentation basin will be held in an effluent tank and then
discharged into the Meghna River along with once-through cooling water. Prior to discharge of the
treated wastewater from the effluent pond, it will be monitored for pH and temperature. When required,
corrective measures will be taken to reduce the discharge temperature or to adjust the pH to ensure
effluent discharge limits are met.
The Project Sponsor is planning the off-site recycling/disposal of the waste lubricants and hydraulic oils,
which will be undertaken through a licensed contractor. This contractor will reclaim the oil from the
waste and sell the product for permitted reuse. Such recycling facilities and contractors are currently
operating in Bangladesh under license from the MEMR and administered by the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (e.g., Min Oils Limited who operate near Dhaka).
3.2.7.1  Wastewater Discharge Rates
The power station has been designed for a raw water intake flow rate of 743 m3/day, however, actual
intake will be approximately 622 m3/day at Normal Continuous Operation with duct firing (NCODF)
(refer to process flow diagrams Appendix G). Specifically, 474.5 m3/day will be treated in the
demineralisation system  to feed 431.4 m3/day into the HRSG system as boiler make-up water.
Regeneration waste of 43.1 m3/day from the demineralisation system will be sent to the chemical
wastewater pond, where clarification waste (11.5 m3/day), filter wash (29.2 m3/day) and dewatered
waste (4.6 m3/day) will be collected for neutralisation in the pH adjustment tank. The 83.8 m3/day of
chemical waste, 96 m3/day of HRSG blow down and cleaning waste, and 65 m3/day of oily waste will
together constitute 248.7 m3/day wastewater entering the pH adjustment tank. After further treatrnent
and settlement of sludge in the sedimentation basin, 244 m3/day of clear, treated effluent will be
discharged into the Meghna River.
From the filtered water storage tank, 26 m3/day will be supplied to the administration building for
human consumption, and 81 m3/day will be supplied to meet various service requirements of the power
station. The sewage coming from the administration building will be treated separately in a sewage
treatment plant and then will be discharged into the Meghna River along with the once-through cooling
water. To decontaminate the sewage effluent, chlorine will be injected into the treated effluent before
nixing with outgoing cooling water.

in accordance with the maximum effluent discharge noted in Table 3.9.
3.2.8 Boiler Blowdown
Water used in the HRSGs will be supplied from the Meghna River via the demineralization system. Prior
to use, most of the water impurities will be removed in the demineralization plant. To maintain steam
quality, spent water in the HRSG will be blown-down (i.e., boiler blow-down) and discharged with the
wastewater. It is anticipated that approximately 50 tons/day of boiler blow-down will be produced to
maintain efficient operational levels.

1. Hydrazine IN2HJ]: both diluted and concentrated hydrazine will be utilised for treatment of boiler
water. It is anticipated that approximately 1.6 kg/day will be required for plant operations.
2. Diluted Hydrazine: diluted Hydrazine (containing 1% as N2H4[H20) will be applied at the outlet of
the Condensate Pump (CP) to remove the dissolved oxygen in the condensate and control the pH
of the feed water during normal operation of the power station. Hydrazine reacts with the
dissolved oxygen (02) to form water (H20) and nitrogen (N2). Complete de-oxygenation is
required to minimise corrosion caused by high temperature and pressure in the boiler.
3. Concentrated Hydrazine: concentrated hydrazine (containing 38% as N2H4.H20) will be applied at
the outlet of the CP and the make-up line to remove the dissolved oxygen in the condensate
during start-up from a vacuum break condition and after a long period of shut-down.
4. Ammonia: anmmonia water (2% as NH4OH) will be applied at the outlet of the CP to control the
pH of the boiler feed water during start-up of the plant. During normnal operation, part of the
injected hydrazine turns into ammonia, and therefore no additional ammonia injection is
required to control the pH. An estimated 25.6 kg/day of ammonia will be required during
normal operations.
5. Sodium Phosphate Bi-Basic (Na3PO4): tri-sodium phosphates (1% as phosphate) will be applied at
the inlet of High Pressure (HP), Intermediate Pressure (IP), and Low Pressure (LP) drums of the
boiler to control the pH of the water and to remove hardness. The phosphates precipitate
whatever small amount of calcium ions reach the boiler water through the treatmnent system or
leakage from the condenser. It is anticipated that 6.7 kg/day of sodium phosphate will be
required for the normal operation of the power station.
3.2.9 Cooling Water Discharge
Cooling water and other treated effluents will be returned to the river via an open-air concrete channel.
The easement for the cooling water discharge channel occupies lands within the boundaries of each of the
three phases of the MPSA. The cooling water discharge channel easement (called the "Demised Corridor"
in the Land Lease Agreement) occupies a strip of land running westward along the riverbank from the
Project Site boundary to the extreme westem boundary of Phase III of the MPSA (Figure 4.3). The width
of the easement is 30 m and it has an overall length of approximately 1,000 m. The total area occupied by
the cooling water discharge channel is approximately eight acres.
The BPDB and SWVMC are currently assessing the likely effects of discharging the cooling and wastewater
near the middle of the main Meghna channel by extending the discharge channel via a 200 - 300 metre
underwater pipeline. Pending the results of this assessment, the Project Sponsor will implement a
discharge method that balances the potential effects with the economics of the Power Purchase
Agreement.

3.2.10 Materials Storage and Handling
On-site storage of liquid and solid materials will be required once the power station is operational.
Storage tanks for clarifier, condensate, and service water have been incorporated into the power station
design. These tanks will consist of steel shells set on concrete frames and will be located above ground. In
addition, storage tanks will be provided for lubricating oils, water treatrnent chemicals, make-up water
treatment, and waste treatment. Where appropriate, storage facilities will be designed with secondary
containment mechanisms.
As noted, chlorine (Cl2) will be used to control the growth of micro-organisms in the cooling water
systems. Chlorine will be purchased in solid form due to handling and safety considerations of highly
pressurized liquefied chlorine.
All chemicals will be transported, handled, and stored according to standard accepted practices as well as
the instructions provided by the manufacturer. This includes storage in clean, cool, well ventilated, and
secure locations. Proper spill clean-up materials will be readily available in all areas where chemicals are
used and secondary containment facilities will be utilised where appropriate. In addition, all individuals
will wear protective equipment (including gloves, masks, and eyewear) during handling and clean-up
activities.
Handling precautions, protective equipment, and clean-up procedures are discussed in both the Plant
Safety Procedure Manual and Emergency Response Plan (Appendices LI and L2, respectively).
Additional, specific information regarding the toxicity, safety, handling, and storage procedures for
individual chemicals will be made readily available to all employees potentially coming into contact with
53^       the chemnicals.
3.2.11 Fire Fighting System
The power station will be self-supportive in respect to fire protection and suppression. The water-based
fire fighting system is an integral part of the plant design and will be installed by the Construction
Contractor. Installation will comply with the standards of the U.S. National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) and/or the Loss Prevention Council (LPC); whichever is more stringent. Approval for the fire
fighting system will also be obtained from the local Thana Fire Officer.
The water-based fire fighting system will include the following main components:
*  fire fighting installation for all buildings and equipment;
*  site hydrant ring main;
*  fire fighting pumping installation;
•  fixed spray water systems;
*  outdoor fire hydrants; and
•  fire alarm system.
Fresh water used for fire protection will be withdrawn from a 600 m3 raw water storage tank by two fire
pumps. To ensure the operation of the fire pumps under emergency conditions, one will be powered by a
diesel engine, with the other by electrically. The capacity of the raw water storage tank is based upon a

two-hour water supply with fire pumps operating at 100% capacity (i.e., the largest single fire risk plus
not less than 31.5 1/sec).                                                                          w
To support the movement of water from the raw water storage tank to the hydrant ring and spray
systems, electric and diesel driven fire pumps, as well as a jockey pump, pump starting and control
equipment, strainers, and other ancillary equipment will be installed.
3.2.12 Septic Tank System
During operation of the power station, it is anticipated that 23 to 24 persons will be required during
daytime with 3 to 4 persons required during the night; generating a minimum of 10 m3/day of waste. The
sewage coming from the administrative building, control room, maintenance workshop, storage,
electrical substation, laboratory, security guard posts, and the guesthouse will be collected into a septic
tank. The septic tank will serve as a combined settling and skimming tank as an unheated-unmixed
anaerobic digester. The tank will be made of concrete, fibreglass, steel, or other suitable material, and be
tested for water tightness and structural integrity after installation. Access ports will be provided to
permit inspection and maintenance.
In a typical septic tank, solids in the incoming wastewater settle to form a sludge layer at the bottom of
the tank. Grease and other light materials float to the surface where a scum layer is formed as floating
materials accumulate. Settled and skimrned wastewater flows from the clear space between the scum and
sludge layers to a disposal field (often called leached field). The organic material retained in the bottom of
the tank undergoes facultative and anaerobic decomposition and is converted to more stable compounds
and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and hydrogen sulphide (H2S).
Over time, the sludge will accumulate in the tank, even though the volume of solid materials deposited is
being reduced continually by anaerobic decomposition. Material from the bottom of the tank that is
buoyed up by the decomposition gases will often stick to the bottom of the scum layer increasing its
thickness. The long-term accumulation of scum and sludge can reduce the effective volumetric capacity
of the tank, requiring periodic pumping out of the sludge. When required, this sludge will be delivered in
tank containers to the municipal authority for further treatment and disposal.
The final treatment and disposal of the liquid effluent from the septic tank is by means of sub-surface soil
absorption. This is typically accomplished with shallow trenches filled with a porous medium, that
provides partial treatment of the effluent, and distributes the effluent to the permeable soil surfaces. The
effluent from the septic tank discharged to the disposal field infiltrates into the soil primarily through the
trench sidewalls. Once the effluent has passed through the soil surface, it enters the unsaturated soil zone
between the ground surface and the groundwater. Effluent moves over soil particle surfaces and through
capillary pores using gravity.
The treatment provided by the disposal field occurs as the effluent flows over and through the porous
medium used in the disposal field trenches; as it infiltrates into and percolates through the soil.
Treatment by the porous medium in the disposal field occurs through a combination of physical,
biological, and chemnical mechanisms.

Drawings of a typical septic tank system along with a soakage pit (in place of disposal field) are shown in
Appendix G. Final design, capacity, and engineering details of the septic tank system  to be installed will
be developed as part of the detailed engineering and design of the power station.
3.2.13 Sludge Treatment
Carry over of carbon and other resins with the regeneration waste are anticipated to be negligible during
operations and thus will not produce any significant quantity of solid waste. Any materials produced can
be safely disposed of without special precautions. Possible on-site use may involve using the sludge for
site filling activities: The sludge generated in the dewatering facilities will be thickened, dewatered,
dried, and disposed of through a licensed contractor(s) for use in land-filling. This solid waste will mainly
contain inorganic matter and reaction products precipitated in the clarifier and other microscopic
particles captured in the filtering units.
Table 3.10 provides a general overview of the predicted sludge generation from power station
operations.

The toxicity of sludge from the water treatment system will be analysed in a laboratory for heavy metals
such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc, and bacteria, on a monthly basis during
initial plant operation. Toxic organics (e.g., pesticides) will also be subjected to laboratory analysis during
the initial plant operation if testing facilities can be located in Bangladesh. Where off-site disposal is
required, it will be carried out through a licensed contractor and/or appropriately disposed of in a
nearby landfill if available.
Sludges collected from the septic tank, carbon filter, cation and anion exchangers, and mixed bed polisher
will be transferred to a municipal authority (e.g., Dhaka City or Narayanganj) for further treatment
and/or safe disposal.

3.2.14 Emergency Generator
An emergency diesel generator will be installed within the power station to assist in shut-down activities
and to maintain the basic operating systems during adverse operating conditions such as failure of the
National Grid. An alternatively fuelled generator is required to ensure the safe operation and shut-down
of the power station should natural gas flows be disrupted.
The emergency generator will include the following key equipment:
*  battery and charge with a capacity capable of six consecutive attempted starts;
• distillate fuel oil tank with sufficient volume for two hours of operation at 1000/0 load; and
*  a local control panel for control of the generating set.
3.2.15 Site Drainage
On-site stoTnwater drains will be incorporated into the power station design based upon a design storm
of 50 years using the Wallingford Procedure. Contaminated effluent will be treated at the source, prior to
discharge into the stormwater drains. The probable sources of contamination include:
i  transformer compounds and possible oil spillage;
e  effluent from HRSGs cleaning and other non-oily contaminated sources, oil separators, and
chemical treatment;
e  effluent from feed water treatment plant; and
e  workshop, laboratory, and storage areas.
3.2.16 Ancillary Structures
Ancillary structures such as a guardhouse, a parking area for approximately seven cars, an overhead
crane, and amenity facilities are all part of the power station design. These facilities contribute to the safe
and efficient operation of the power station. A small guesthouse, capable of housing up to 6 personnel,
has also been incorporated into the project design.
3.3 Associated Infrastructure
To facilitate the development of the MPSA for thermal power generation, additional infrastructure is
required. Construction and operation of the associated infrastructure will be the responsibility of Titas
and the BPDB (Table 3.11). The following sections suimmarize the salient details of the infrastructure
required to develop the power station.

3.3.1 Site Preparation
The BPDB was responsible for all site preparation activities within the MPSA. The BPDB hired CWHEC
to undertake the necessary dredging, filling, and grading activities. At the time of writing this report, site
preparation works had been completed for the Phase I lands with an estimated 1,880,000 m3 of dredged
material placed on the project site to raise it up to approximately 0.87 m above the 200 year highest flood
level.
A numerical modelling report was completed by CWHEC in June 1999, prior to commencement of
dredging activities (Appendix 14) and three sites (i.e., borrow areas) were identified by CWHEC as
suitable locations for dredging (Figure 3.4). Within the borrow areas, the average excavated depth was
four metres. The deeper water areas likely resulted in a reduction of water flow velocity over the borrow
areas, while the adjacent areas may have experienced a slight increase in flow velocities. However, the
flow regimes of the Meghna River channel, above and below the project site and borrow areas, should
5         have remain basically unchanged (CWHEC, 1999). CWHEC's post dredging bathymetry is contained in
Appendix 14, Attachment 14-1.
3.3.2 Access Road
Construction of a 938 metre long access road by the BPDB, from the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway to the
project site, was completed in October 1999. The BPDB is also responsible for maintaining the access road
during the operational life of the MPSA.
In keeping with Bangladeshi construction practices, the access road was built primarily by manual labour
with minimal support by mechanized equipment. As per the conditions outlined in the Land Lease
Agreement, the access road was constructed to the following standards:
*  surface type: paved;
*  length: 937.9 meters;
#  carriage-way width: 6.2 mietres;
*  road surface gradient: 3 percent;
*  embankment slope: 1:1.4
*  terrain/design speed: level/ 70 km/hr.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The elevation of the access road is +7.54 metres PWD, which is 0.54 metres above the 200 year highest
flood level (+7.0 m PWD). The slopes of the road embankment are 1V:1.4H on both the landside and
riverside of the access road. A road base of approximately 300 mm was overlaid upon a 200 mm granular
sub-base. Surfacing consisted of a 15 mm bituminous surface dressing with a 75 mm penetration
bituminous macadam. A more detailed description of the access road construction and use is contained in
Section 5.
3.3.3 Natural Gas Pipeline and RMS
3.3.3.1 Natural Gas Pipeline
A 500 metre steel pipeline will link the interconnection point on Titas's gas transmission pipeline with the
power station, providing a safe and efficient method for the transport of natural gas. Specifically, a NPS
20 (i.e., twenty inch diameter nomninal pipe size) pipeline will supply the natural gas to the power station.
Titas will construct, own, and operate the connecting natural gas pipeline. The permanent pipeline
easement will be approximately six metres in width (i.e., 20 feet). Titas will also require an additional six
metres (i.e., 20 feet) of temporary working space during pipeline construction. To the extent possible, the
permanent and/or working easements will overlap the access road right-of-way.
The short pipeline will be situated imnmediately adjacent to the access road on land unconstrained by
natural features or buildings road. The route foUows good land-use planning practices of grouping linear
facilities within a contiguous strip of land. This route will also minimize the socio-economic effects of
resettlement, dislocation, loss of agricultural lands, and land-use conflicts associated with establishing a
completely new corridor (Weir and Reay, 1984).
3.3.3.2 Regulating and Metering Station
A RMS is required to control the volume and flow of natural gas entering the power station. The RMS
will contain facilities to adjust gas pressure under various operating conditions, as well as serve as a
telecommunications tower for information relay backup. Titas will construct and operate the RMS and
supply the Project Sponsor with an RTU suitable for the hard wire of analogue signals from the RMS to
the power station's DCS system. As per the terms of the Gas Supply Agreement, data will be supplied on
a real-time basis for the following parameters:
*  gas volumetric flow-rate - instantaneous and total;
*  gas pressure - static and differential;
•  gas temperature;
*  total energy - in British Thermal Units (BTUs);
*  gas composition and density;
*  calorific value - in BTU/SCF; and
*  specific gravity.

An area of approximately 50 by 100 metres will be required for the RMS adjacent to the project site. The
RMS will be located in the north-eastern corner of the project site, adjacent to the BPDB access road
(Appendix C). Because the RMS can be situated on the project site, no off-site altematives were
considered. Ultimately, the location of the RMS was determined so it would coincide with the location of
the Titas pipeline and by engineering considerations and operating efficiencies. The Plot Plan and Route
Map for the pipeline and RMS are shown in Appendix H3, Attachment 4.
3.4 Dispatch of Power
As part of the 1995 PSMP, the PGCB will construct a 230 kV transmission line that will connect BPDB's
existing substation at Comilla North to the existing substation Haripur; with the financial assistance of
the ADB. The Comilla-Haripur 230 kV line will cross over the Meghnaghat site to evacuate the power
from the power stations to be built on MPSA. Comilla North is connected to Chittagong via a 230 kV
transmission line.
Construction of the Comilla-Meghnaghat section of the new high voltage line has been awarded to a
Chinese contractor (i.e., China United Electric Import and Export Corporation), while the Meghnaghat-
Haripur section has been awarded to an Indian Contractor (i.e., RPG Transmission Limited).
Construction of the total line is now in progress. The target completion date of the Comilla-Meghnaghat
section is December, 2001 and that the Meghnaghat-Haripur section is May 2001. This line will be
directly conmected to the substation, situated on Phase I lands of the MPSA, to be constructed by the
Project Sponsor.
Since the MPSA will likely support additional power stations (i.e., phase II and III), the PGCB will soon
begin construction of another 230 kV transmission with funding from the ADB to support the evacuation
of this new power. The contract for construction has already been awarded.

4. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
The primary objective of identifying and describing existing environmental conditions is to provide an
understanding of the baseline conditions prior to undertaking any development activities. The intent is to
apply the predicted effects of the development to the identified baseline conditions, in order to assess the
significance of such effects and any need for mitigation.
To establish the existing environmental baseline conditions at the MPSA and in adjacent areas, the
following studies and activities were completed:
*  surface water and groundwater sampling at the MPSA;
#  laboratory analysis of dredged materials;
*  general socio-economic household survey;
*  community profile of adjacent villages;
*  ecological survey and screening for possible IUCN species;
*  fisheries survey;
*  road traffic survey - Dhaka-Chittagong Highway;
*  river traffic survey - Meghna River;
*  archaeological and cultural sites survey;
*  general and specific land-use surveys;
*  ambient noise monitoring;
* ambient air quality monitoring; and
*  review of cyclonic storm occurrences.
To supplement the primary data and information generated as part of the activities listed above, various
secondary data sources (i.e., published materials and literature) were collected and reviewed. The balance
of this chapter summarizes the existing baseline environmental conditions in and around the MPSA. A
national overview of the country's baseline conditions is contained in Appendix 11.
4.1 Project Region
Bangladesh is divided into six administrative divisions (comparable to provinces or states). Within these
administrative divisions are administrative districts (similar to counties), Thanas (equivalent to
townships), unions, and villages (Figure 4.1). The project site is located in Sonargaon Thana - one of five
Thanas within the Narayanganj District. The other four Thanas include Bandar, Narayanganj Sadar,
Rupganj, and Araihazar. Sonargaon Thana is situated on the south bank of the Meghna River (Figure
1.2).
Slightly south-west and downstream of the project site the Meghna converges with the Dhaleswari
(Kaliganga) River and the Shitalakhya River. A further 13 kilometres further south from this convergence,
the Meghna River joins with the Padma River; known as the Ganges River in India. The Meghna and the
Padma are two of the largest river systems in Bangladesh. Originating in the Himalayas, they both
discharge into the Bay of Bengal, and along with the Bramamputra River they have created one of the
largest river deltas in the World.

of 759.57 km2. Currently, the population density is 2,310 persons/kin2, which is significantly higher than
the national average of 874 persons/km2. There are a total of 314,890 households in the district, making
the average household size 5.6 persons. The gender distribution of Narayanganj District is roughly 1.15
males per every female (Government of Bangladesh, 1991).
4.1.2 Thana Characterization
Once referred to as the 'seat of the Mighty Majesty', Sonargaon City was the capital of East Bengal
between 1338 and 1605. The city's importance was based on its strategic location in relation to river
access, connecting Bangladesh to the important trading areas of the Middle and Far East. The port was
also widely relied upon for exporting the region's esteemed muslin cloth to the West. Due to its past
importance, Sonargaon is well endowed with numerous temples, Hindu shrines, and mosques. Local
tourists seeking architectural splendour and archaeological interest often frequent the historic city (DPC,
1999c).
Sonargaon Thana is characterized by fields of paddy, banana plantations, and vegetable plots intermixed
with clusters of houses (mohallahs or sub-village settlements). The area is also threaded by a patchwork of
canals and watercourses. By Bangladeshi standards, it presents a picture of relative prosperity (Appendix
12). Average annual incomes in the region surrounding the MPSA indicate that less than 2% of the
population live below the Bangladesh poverty line. This is corroborated by the fact that 90% of the
Region's houses are made of Corrugated Iron (CI) sheets popularly known as tin. This type of structure is
considered superior to typical bamboo and mud housing found in poorer regions of the country (DPC,
1999a).
Undoubtedly, the proximnity of the Narayanganj Industrial Zone is a major contributor to the higher than
average household incomes in Sonargaon Thana. The zone not only provides employment opportunities
for local people, but also provides a ready market for vegetable producers. The comnmunities surrounding
the MPSA have a high percentage of individuals involved in non-agrarian occupations; 26.7% have
formal salaried jobs. Other occupations include fishing (16.3%), small trade (15%), and cultivation (15%)
(DPC, 1999a). The region's male literacy rate, at 34.1%, is above the national average of 32.4%, although
the female literacy rate of 17.9% is well below the national rate (DPC, 1999b) (Appendix 13).

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.1.2.1  Land and Water Use
Sonargaon and Bandar Thanas are the most agrarian Thanas within the District. While the land
surrounding the MPSA is predominantly residential and agricultural, there are a number of commercial
and industrial enterprises in the imnnediate area (Figure 4.2). These include both cottage industries and
large manufacturing plants (Appendices 116 and 117). Narayanganj Sadar Thana includes Narayanganj
Town and the surrounding urban area. This area is very well known for jute, textiles, other small
industries, as well as being a regional port and trading centre. The other two Thanas in the District,
Rupganj and Araihazar, are being gradually developed into industrial zones.
The Meghna River is used as a major waterway for both commercial and passenger transport. Although
Sonargaon functions as an irnportant port on the Meghna, the largest port in the District is Narayanganj.
This port has developed as a major centre for cement, pulp and paper, plastic, shipbuilding (i.e., river
vessels), chemical, and textile industries.
4.1.2.2 Physiographic and Hydrogeological Regions
Annual wet-season flooding by the sediment-rich waters of the Meghna, Jamuna, and Padma results in
widespread sediment deposition. The country's soils are a mnixture of estuarine, fluvial, and alluvial soils
of varying texture, age, and thickness. In the south, near the Bay of Bengal, deltaic sediments can attain a
depth of more than 1,000 metres. By comparison, sediment layers in the north of Bangladesh are
relatively thin (MEP, 1997).
aM        Sonargaon Thana is a typical representation of alluvial delta deposit regions in Bangladesh as human
settlements have transformed the area into a predominantly residential and mixed crop production
region. Typical crops include rice, oil seeds, fibre plants, and vegetables that are grown and cultivated at
various times throughout the year. There is very little "natural" forest remaining in the area of the MPSA
and there are no ecologically significant areas.
4.2 Project Site
Data was collected through both primnary and secondary in-depth field studies undertaken as part of this
EIA study. Primary data collection techniques included surveying, sampling, interviewing, and
observation. Data collected through primary surveys was undertaken in a culturally sensitive fashion
(i.e., cognizance of literacy rates and the influences gender), largely by persons native to Bangladesh.
To supplement the primary data, secondary and published data sources were consulted. The following
section describes the original conditions of the project site prior to the acquisition and filling activities at
the MPSA.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.2.1  Land Conditions                                                                              N
4.2.1.1  Topography, Geology and Soils
The project site, and indeed the entire region, has a flat topography with very little relief or changes in
elevation (Figure 4.4, Photo 1). Elevations along the Meghna River range from 0.1 metres to 5.3 metres
above mean sea level near the MPSA. During the wet season (i.e., June to October), the entire
undeveloped project site was subject to flooding (Figure 4.4, Photo 2) (MEP, 1997). Consequently,
development of the MPSA required fill material to be placed on-site to raise the MPSA's elevation to a
point approximately one metre above the 200-year flood line (Appendix 14) (Photos 3 and 4 Figure 4.4).
An index of photo locations and a land-use overview of the MPSA is shown in Figure 4.3.
The MPSA is underlain by several hundred metres of alluvial sediments. The surface is covered by two
metres of alluvial silt, which is underlain by approximately 0.3 metres of silty sand and sand. This surface
material lies above horizontally bedded clay and sand (MEP, 1997). Two dredged soil samples were
collected at the project site during site filling and grading activities. The results of the laboratory analysis
are summarized below and shown in detail in Appendix 15.
Laboratory analyses were undertaken for the following parameters: metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons
(TPH), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phenoxy acid
herbicides, organophosphorus pesticides, EPA 608 priority pollutant pesticides, polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), and asbestos. Since neither the Governnent of Bangladesh nor the World Bank have
established criterion for soil quality, the analytical results were compared to the Canadian Council of
Ministers of the Environment (CCME) and the U.S. EPA guidelines; yielding the following results:
phenoxy acid herbicides and organophosphorus pesticides were not detected during the chemical
analysis;
* EPA 608 priority pollutant pesticides, PCBs, and VOCs were not detected during the analyses;
various PAHs compounds were detected during the analysis (e.g., phenanthrene, pyrene, and
chrysene), however, all parameters are within the guidelines;
-  asbestos was not detected in any samples; and
*   various metals were detected during the analyses and are within the guidelines, with two
exceptions: arsenic and selenium.
At one sample site the chemical value calculated for arsenic was 3.8 mg/kg; 1.4 mg/kg above the U.S.
EPA guideline, however, the value falls well within the CCME guideline of 12 mg/kg. The CCME
guideline, used for comparison purposes, relates to the protection of human health based upon the
ingestion of dirt and is a conservative value among international standards. Subsequently, the Project
Sponsor undertook no additional sampling.
At most of the sample sites, the chemical analysis yielded results that were less than 60 ppm. However,
the laboratory equipment used in the analysis could not specify levels below 60 ppm, which makes it
hard to derive any meaningful conclusions. Although the CCME guideline of 10 ppm is likely exceeded,
the U.S. EPA guideline of 8,500 ppm has not been breached. Subsequently, the Project Sponsor
undertook no additional sampling.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.2.1.2 Seismicity
The project site is located in Seismic Zone 2, an area classified as having potential for intermediate
intensity earthquakes. This intensity can be up to VII on the Modified Mercalli Scale (MMS) (i.e.,
approximately 6.2 on the Richter Scale) (Muniruzzaman, 1993). The United States National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration catalogue of earthquakes for the period 1900 to 1988 contains seven events
in Zone 2 with epicentral intensities ranging from VI to VII on the MMS (Hossain, 1989). The basic
horizontal seismic coefficient for Zone 2 is 0.15. It is understood that seismic risk at the project site is
moderate and would not pose a major constraint to development of the project.
After completion of site preparation works, the BPDB allowed the Project Sponsor to inspect the site. In
the geotechnical investigation performed during the inspection, the site was found to have potential for
soil liquefaction under earthquake conditions.
At the cost of the BPDB, the Project Sponsor has undertaken soil improvement works to ensure the site is
free from liquefaction potential under earthquake conditions. Additionally, the Construction Contractor
will design the structures of the power station with due consideration for seismic load.
4.2.2 Atmospheric Conditions
4.2.2.1  Climate
Bangladesh has a typical, cyclic monsoon climate: summers are hot and humid, with abundant rainfall
and south-westerly surface winds, while winters are dry and cool with north-easterly winds.
Temperatures in the project area range from summer highs of 35°C to winter lows of 13°C (Bangladesh
Meteorological Department, 1995). Average monthly precipitation values for the Dhaka area are
provided in Table 4.1.
The large seasonal variation in precipitation has a major effect on groundwater levels, river flows, and
flooding. Mean annual precipitation at Dhaka is approximately 2,000mm (Bangladesh Meteorological
Department, 1995).

and Precipitation data for Dhaka Moritoring Station (Latitude 23° N, Longitude 900 23 minutes E), 1991-1995.
The predominant wind directions at the weather station closest to the project site (i.e., Dhaka airport) are
from the south and southeast. For example, over a yearlong period, southem winds occurred 20% of the
time and winds from the southeast occurred 9.5% of the time. Wind from the north occurred 3% of the
time (Bangladesh Meteorological Department, 1999).
Wind conditions at the Dhaka airport are calm approximately 50% of the time. The most common wind
speeds in the region are 0.51 - 1.54 m/sec which is equivalent to one - three knots (21% of the time) and
2.06 - 3.09 m/sec equivalent to four - six knots (20% of the time). Wind speeds greater than 3.09 rn/sec
are uncomnmon (Bangladesh Meteorological Department, 1999; MEP, 1997).
Due to its geographical location and low-lying terrain, Bangladesh is vulnerable to the destructive forces
of large cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal. Appendix 16 lists all cyclonic storms occurring between
1960 to 1998 that have caused major life and property losses. Generally, coastal areas are mostly affected
by these cyclones. The MPSA is located at such a distance from the Bay of Bengal that it has never been
hit by direct cyclones.
4.2.2.2 Air Quality
The key pollutants of concem for thermal power stations are NO2, 502, and particulate matter. The
following discussion of ambient air quality focuses on NO2, as the power station will emit no S02 and
little particulate matter.
Nitrogen Dioxide
There are various existing industries in the immediate vicinity of the project site that may contribute to
background levels of NO2 including a jute mill, a packaging and board mill, a brickyard, three cement
processing industries, and two pulp and paper mills. Non-point source contributors include cottage
industries, household fuel consumption, and road and river traffic. There may also be contributions by
long-range transport of NO2 from the metropolitan area of Dhaka.
Background air quality was determined by monitoring NO2 concentrations in the study area. MEP
monitored ambient concentrations of NO2 in the study area during preparation of the 1997 EIA. MEP's
monitoring was carried out using passive diffusion samplers at eight locations representing both urban
and rural environments. The program was run for three months and the results are summarized in
Appendix 17.

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAC-r ASSESSMENT
Additional ambient air quality monitoring was completed in 1999 as part of this EIA. The monitoring was
again conducted using passive diffusion samplers. The program was run over a three-month period at six
monitoring stations (Figure 4.5).
Data from the two monitoring programs were used to estimate the annual average background NO2
concentration and the maximum 24-hour NO2 concentration. The data and methodology are provided in
Appendix 17. The annual average concentration of NO2 was estimated to be 21 pg/m3. This is well below
the World Bank Guidelines of 100 pg/m3 and GOB's standard of 80 pg/lm3
The maximum 24-hour concentration of NO2 was estimated to be 63 ,ug/rn3, well below the World Bank
Guidelines of 150 pg/m3. The Government of Bangladesh has no 24-hour standard for NO2 concentration.
Particulate Matter
The Bangladesh DOE put, as a condition of the Site Clearance document, that the Project Sponsor should
monitor particulate matter at the project site, as high levels of dust can accelerate mechanical damage to
gas turbines. Subsequently, the Project Sponsor monitored 24-hour average total particulate matter
concentrations at the project site over a period of five days, starting on April 2, 2000. The monitoring was
complete using a portable "minivol" sampler manufactured by AirMetrics of Eugene Oregon, USA.
The sampling was completed at the same location used for noise monitoring in Islampur (see Figure 4.6
for reference). The particulate matter levels ranged from a low of 34 pg/rn3 to a high of 64 pg/m3,
however, the sources of the particulate matter cannot be determined from this sampling regime. Potential
sources include nearby industrial activities, road traffic, and dust brought in from surrounding exposed
area of the MPSA by wind action. The turbine manufacturer will complete additional detailed monitoring
to optimize the filter designs for the turbines.
4.2.2.3 Ambient Noise
As the project site is located adjacent to several industries, there are numerous contributors to ambient
noise levels in the area. Within a three-kilometre radius of the project site, there are pulp and paper mills,
cement processing industries (e.g., clinker grinding plants), food processing industries, a jute mill, a
packaging and board mill, a garment industry, and a brick field; all of which contribute to ambient noise
levels (Figure 4.2).
Measured Noise Levels
Ambient noise levels in the vicinity of MPSA were monitored as part of background data collection
activities from September 4 through September 6, 1999 capturing both weekend and weekday noise
levels. At the request of the DOE, additional monitoring was undertaken from April 2 through April 7,
2000 (Appendix J1). Monitoring during both periods was conducted at the villages of Islampur and
Ganganagar. These centres were selected based upon their sensitivity to noise from the power station
(i.e., they are residential areas), proximity to the project site, representation of the larger area, and
security for equipment and personnel (Figure 4.6). Data collection utilised a Larson Davies Model 812
Type 1 integrating sound level meter.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
A summary of the measured one-hour average Leq values for each monitoring site and period is provided
in Table 4.3. Values are presented by Leq, (energy averaged sound exposure), which is one of the most
robust predictors of human response or annoyance to noise. Specifically, it represents the steady sound
exposure over a given time period that is equivalent in energy to the varying sound level of the
environment being measured. Detailed sampling methodology and the 1999 results are presented in
Appendix 18.

NOTE: daytime is defined as the hours from 07:00 - 22:00, while nighttime hours include the hours between 22:00 - 07:00.
n/m = no measurements recorded.
The higher noise level at Islampur in 1999 may be attributed to the noise generated by the dredgers
engaged in filling the MPSA. The changing ambient noise monitoring results were influenced by
spurious high-level noise events such as vehicle horns, animals, human voices, and the Islamic calls to
prayer (i.e., Azan). These events serve to increase the L,, values in certain 30-minute periods. However,
no particular event was determined as being more dominant than any other. Ambient noise levels vary
throughout the day, but do follow a typical diurnal pattern with a night-time "dip" characteristic of
urban environments. The daytime levels are dominated by nearby industrial/conmmercial sources that
operate during the day, road and river traffic, and other activities within the village.
Applicable Guidelines
Although the ADB does not have it's own guidelines for ambient noise, the MEF and World Bank have
developed guidelines for ambient noise conditions (Table 4.4). As described previously, the general area
of the MPSA includes residential, conmmercial, and industrial land-uses. For purposes of characterizing
the ambient noise levels within the MPSA, Bangladesh guidelines for mixed-use areas are most
appropriate. World Bank guidelines for residential areas have been utilized in the absence of specific
mixed land-use guidelines.

: The values shown are from Schedule 4, Noise Pollutioni Standards (MEF, 1997). N/a = not available.
Under the World Bank guidelines (1998), if ambient conditions exceed the recommended guideline
threshold, the assessed ambient value can be substituted in place of the guideline value. Using the 1999
monitoring results, this would have been the case for night-time noise levels at Islampur (i.e., a higher
threshold value than the guidelines). However, using the lower monitoring results obtained in April
2000, to provide a more representative scenario for predicting worst-case noise impacts, such
substitutions are not warranted. Consequently, based upon the April 2000 monitoring data, the final
f          sound level guidelines applicable to this project are shown in Table 4.5.

4.2.3   Hydrological Conditions
4.2.3.1 Wetlands
The national economy and the people of Bangladesh are inextricably linked to the productivity and
sustainability of Bangladesh's vast system of wetlands that are seasonally variable in their characteristics.
According to the Ramsar Convention (1971), wetlands are defined as areas of marsh, fen, peatland, or
water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh,
brackish, or salt. Wetlands can include areas of marine water, whose depth at low tide does not exceed six
meters.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
By these definitions, it is estimated that Bangladesh possesses seven to eight million hectares of wetlands
in the form of permanent rivers and streams (480,000 ha), estuarine and mangrove swamps (610,000 ha),
shallow lakes and marshes (120,000 - 290,000 ha), large reservoirs (90,000 ha), small ponds and tanks
(150,000 - 180,000 ha), shrimp ponds (90,000 - 115,000 ha) and seasonally flooded flood plains (5,770,000
ha) (Nishat, 1993). Aquatic plants, reeds, and algae characterize most wetlands in Bangladesh. In
addition, wetlands provide suitable habitat conditions for a large number of finfish, prawns, crabs,
turtles, bivalve and gastropod mollusks, and birds (DPC, 1999e).
Neither the IUCN nor the GOB have identified the MPSA or the adjacent waters as a critical ecological
resource (IUCN, 1999), an ecologically critical area, or sanctuary (BCA, 1995). Further, as the MPSA was
historically utilised for seasonal agricultural cultivation by local persons during the dry season. The
MPSA is characterized as an island surrounded by the river on three sides and is best known to the local
people as a char (i.e., island). Its official name in the government land record still retains this descriptive
word: Char Ramzan Sonaullah. Finally, the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies and Nature
Conservation Movement (1994) have not identified any wetlands within or adjacent to the MPSA.
4.2.3.2 Surface Water
At the project site, the mean water level of the Meghna is 5.49 metres above sea level (a.s.l.). During the
dry season, water levels can be as low as 0.52 metres a.s.l., while during the monsoon season water levels
are much higher causing the Meghna to overflow onto the region's low-lying floodplains. The width of
the Meghna at the project site is approximately 1,000 metres (Figure 4.7, Photo 5) and the flow discharge
rate is 6,000 to 9,000 m3/s (Danish Hydraulic Institute, 1997).
Water levels near the Meghna Ferryghat have been recorded by the BWDB, since 1968, at three hour
intervals which include both daily high and low levels. Figure 4.8 shows a plot of the daily high and low
water levels for the period form May, 1997 through May, 1999. Review of the monthly variations in
water level indicate that water levels fluctuate daily as well as seasonally. Water levels in this stretch of
the Meghna are generally at their lowest during November to June, while reaching their peak July to
October.
Ambient water temperature during winter is assumed to be 25 °C while ambient water temperature
during summer is assumed to be 32 °C (BPDB's RFP dated 1997). The Construction Contractor has
undertaken additional on-site water temperature sampling to verify the initial data provided by the
BPDB. The most recent results were recorded during the monsoon period from July 11 through August
17, 2000, which indicate a water temperature range of 29°C to 31°C (AES Meghnaghat, 2000).

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The results indicate a high level of turbidity in the Meghna River when compared to the drinking water
-        standards of Bangladesh. It is anticipated that these levels will decrease during the drier winter season as
lower water flow rates during this period will decreases sediment transport. It should be noted that in
both sampling locations, the ambient level of lead (Pb) and dissolved oxygen (DO) was found to be
higher and lower, respectively, than the corresponding GOB standard.
Additional sampling of DO concentrations near the project site was undertaken in August 1999. The
results also indicate a low DO value of Meghna at 3.04 mg/l (Appendix 19). In comparison, DO sampling
conducted as part of the AES Haripur power project on the Shitalakhya River, indicates fluctuations in
DO which appear to vary by season, but remain relatively low:
* April 1998: 6.16 mg/I;
* October 1998: 3.68 - 4.41 mg/l; and
#  November 1998:3.38 mg/l.
Likely causes contributing to the low DO levels may include, but are not limited to: little whitewater/
chop in this reach of the river, high levels of turbidity may marginalize aquatic photosynthesis, warm
water temperatures, and industrial discharges.
4.2.3.3 Salinity Regime
As noted in Section 4.1, the Meghna joins the Dhaleswari and Shitalakhya Rivers approximately six
kilometres downstream of the project site. This combined flow then joins the Padma River a further 13
kilometres downstream of their confluence, above the Town of Chandpur. Like most rivers originating in
the Himalayas, the river flows of the Padma (the Ganges) are regulated as they pass through Indian
Territories.
DHI/SWMC, as part of the Meghna Estuary Project Study (2000), conducted an analysis of the intrusion
of salinity into the Meghna estuary for both the dry and wet seasons (Figures 4.9 and 4.10). As shown on
the figures, salinity reaches into the lower Meghna, but not up to Chandpur. As noted, the MPSA is an
additional 40 kilometres upstream of Chandpur and it is very unlikely that saline water will ever intrude
up to the MPSA unless there are drastic changes to the combined flow regime of the Meghna, Padma, and
Jamuna.
4.2.3.4 Sea Level Rise
Specific information on the possible extent of sea level rise (SLR) in Bangladesh is meagre and current
models of anthropogenic climate change are not accurate enough to provide useful information in regard
to SLR. However, using predictive information from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and the
Climate Research Unit, University of East Anglia (United Kingdom), SWMC carried a simplified
simulation of SLR based upon a SLR of 30 cm; which is predicted to occur sometime between 2050 and
2100 (SWMC, 1993).

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The results of this study were summnarized in SWMC's 1997 report that was presented as part of the MEP
1997 EIA report. The results indicated that with a peak inflow increase of five percent and dry inflow
decrease of 15%, corresponding to a SLR of 30 cm, river stages between Chandpur and Bhairab Bazar
would increase by approximately 15 - 20 cm. (SWMC, 1997).
Since the river seasonally fluctuates between +1 to +6.76 metres PWD, and the project site has been
constructed to approximately +8 metres PWD, the foreseeable effects of SLR are negligible, with regard to
this project.
4.2.3.5 Groundwater
Previous studies have estimated that the approximate depth to the water table in the project area during
the dry season is six metres. However, it has also been determined that depth to the top of the main
aquifer is close to 50 metres (MEP, 1997). The region's groundwater is used extensively for both domestic
and agricultural purposes. It is believed that 53% of the population uses groundwater for domestic
purposes, and one-third of agricultural lands are irrigated by groundwater (MEP, 1997).
Rivers, canals, and other surface waters are relied upon by 40% of the country's population for their
entire domestic supply of potable water, however, within the project area approximately 91% of
households access potable water via hand tube wells (DPC, 1999a). The two villages closest to the project
site, Islampur and Ganganagar, use groundwater as their main source of water (MEP, 1997).
A concem for approximately one-half of the Country's population is the naturally high levels of arsenic in
groundwater. Arsenic is known to exist at elevated rates in the groundwater of 28 administrative 
districts. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that acceptable levels of arsenic should be no
higher than 0.05 mg/litre of drinking water. However, arsenic levels in Bangladesh have been as high as
2.9 mg/litre of drinking water. For reference, high rates of groundwater extraction can leach arsenic from
the soil and lead to arsenic contamination of well water (Gain, 1998).
Groundwater sampling at the MPSA was undertaken on September 2, 2000 from a deep tube well bored
to approximately 100 metres at the project site. Selected results are shown in Table 4.7 with the complete
results contained in Appendix 19.

This is a provisional guideline of the WHO. This is a provisional guideline because of lack of suitable testing methods. The
previous guideline was 0.05 mg/L.

Based upon the results of the laboratory analysis, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, arseric, and
fluoride levels at the project site are within both GOB standards and WHO guidelines. Iron is C.1 mg/L
above the WHO guidelines, while the concentration of manganese is 0.07 mg/L above both the GOB and
WHO guidelines. Such small exceedences are unlikely to have any human health effects.
4.2.4 Biological Conditions
4.2.4.1  Terrestrial Flora and Fauna
The landscape of the project area is flat, with village settlements and industrial units on lands raised to
about 4-5 metres above sea level (Figure 4.7, Photo 5). Open fields, as well as artificial and natural water
bodies, characterize the area surrounding the rural villages adjacent to the MPSA. Much of the region's
agricultural land is subject to annual inundation and remains submerged for up to four to five months
during the summer. Thus, there is drastic seasonal variation in the environment. However, because of
extensive agricultural, industrial, and residential development, truly natural terrestrial habitats
characterized by indigenous flora and fauna are absent from the project area. No designated nature
reserves or parkland areas are present in the project area (DPC, 1999d).
Although the project site and surrounding area have limited natural habitats, Bangladesh as a whole is an
important wintering ground for nearly 300 species of migratory birds. Specifically, the country is
situated at the crossroads of two migratory flyways for species such as the Asian Dowitcher and the
Indian Skimmer (Gain, 1998).
Flora
Low growing grasses, herbaceous vegetation, and other common plant communities constitute the floral
habitat in the project area and vary with the seasons. Data collected through field visits, observations,
interviews, and investigations suggests that the project area contains a plant community of
approximately 82 floral species. As the project site was used for growing agricultural crops, only those
plants (e.g., paddy, vegetables, wheat, and jute) and some conmmon low growing grasses, were present on
the MPSA prior to the site filling activities of the BPDB (DPC, 1999d).
Besides seasonally cultivated agricultural crops and vegetables, the major plant species as identified
during the site survey are shown in Appendix 110. Institutional sources, local community members from
the project area, and field observations indicted that no vulnerable, threatened, or endangered plants are
anticipated to be growing on the MPSA.
Fauna
The fauna near the project site is representative of urban fringe area species. Primary consumer species at
the project site consist mainly of small organisms such as insects, and large herbivores such as hoofed
mammals. Oligochaetes, soil mites, nematodes, along with other insects and invertebrates play an
important role in the terrestrial ecosystem (MEP, 1997).



AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Of a possible 600 avian species in Bangladesh, approximately 35 to 40 species were identified as being
possible within a 10-kilometre radius of the project site. Most avian species in the project area are
common and include the Pariah Kite, the House Crow, and the Brahami Kite. Four avian species whose
range includes the project region have been categorised by the IUCN as being lower risk but near
threatened4. These include the Red-Headed Vulture, Tawny Fish Owl, White Rumped Vulture, and the
Grey Headed Fish Eagle. The Imperial Eagle and the Blyth's Kingfisher were identified as vulnerable,
while the Oriental Stork was identified as endangered (DPC, 1999d).
Approximately 20 species of mammals can be found near the project site. The only endangered terrestrial
species whose range includes the project site is the Asiatic Golden Cat. It has been identified as lower risk
but near threatened. Again, site conditions and field observations suggest it is unlikely that this species
would be found at the MPSA. Other mammals in the area include the Jackal and the Mongoose (DPC,
1999d).
There are 11 species of reptiles and amphibians whose range includes the project site. Of these, the
Gharial is endangered, the Spotted Pond Turtle is lower risk but near threatened, and the Black Soft-shell
Turtle is critically endangered (DPC, 1999d). MEP (1997) stated that while all of these species may be found
within a ten-kilometre radius of the project site, no endangered or threatened species occur at the MPSA
itself. The field informnation collected as part of this EIA study confirms MEP's conclusion. More
information on species living near the MPSA can be found in Appendix 110.
4.2.4.2 Aquatic Flora and Fauna
The many rivers that flow into Bangladesh, and through the project area, annually contribute alluvium
from Nepal and India to Bangladesh, continually expanding and creating river chars in perpetuity. It is
estimated that Padma alone carries over 1.4 billion tons of alluvium per year, enriching the surrounding
floodplain soils (Bigalow, 1995).
Even though there is a large sediment to water ratio in the Meghna River, it still provides rich habitat for
many flora and fauna species. There are a wide variety of fish and shellfish species near the project site,
many of which are of great significance to both subsistence and comrnmercial fisher folk (Appendix I11).
Comrmon river species include the grass carp and the mirror carp. There are a number of endangered
species in the Meghna River, and include the Lal chanda, Kali baus, Boal, Bacha, Gonia, Ayre, Kajuli,
Tatkini, and Ghaura. Furthermore, there are 21 species of threatened fish in this Meghna (DPC, 1999e).
Following the annual flood cycles, there are four phases of aquatic habitats for inland water species that
provide seasonal habitat for a variety of fish:
*    dry season: occurring from December to March, water remains only in perennial rivers and
canals and most fish congregate to live through this drv season;
*    pre-monsoon season: from April to early June water level rise and fish move to shallower areas in
search of spawning grounds. Migrations occur over both great distances (e.g., major carps) and
small distances (e.g., floodplain breeders such as koi and mola);
4 The IUCN categorization scheme includes: Extinct. Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, and Lower
Risk. There are three categories within Lower Risk that include. Conservation Dependent, Near Threatened. and Least Concern (IUCN,
1996). See Appendix 110 for definitions of each category.

_   monsoon flood season: during the months from June to September, river larvae and fry move to
floodplain areas for easier feeding and growth, although they are highly susceptible to natural
and fishing mortality during this season;
post-monsoon season: during October through December, the flood waters recede, shrinking the
floodplain feeding areas and fostering the movement of fish back into the deeper waters where
they await to begin the cycle again (Ali, 1997).
Although not observed during the field investigations, a notable species whose reported seasonal range
includes the Meghna river area is the Ganges River Dolphin (locally known as Shushuk). According to
IUCN, this species falls within the endangered species category. This porpoise's range extends into the
Padma, Brahmaputra, Karnaphuli, and Meghna river systems of India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
The IUCN has stated that the entire population of Ganges River Dolphins are considered endangered due
to a population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations. This is based upon direct
observations, a decline in quality of habitat, and possible exploitation. Perhaps the greatest threats to this
porpoise are dam construction on the Ganges River (now over 20 and which have fragmented the
population), boat traffic, pollution, and loss of habitat (DPC, 1999e).
Aside from the main riverine tract of the Meghna, other aquatic habitats can be found at the project site
and along the main channel. These include shallow channels, marshy areas, and floodplains within which
water levels vary greatly between the dry and wet seasons. Within these varied habitats, a variety of
aquatic plants, algae, macro-invertebrates, plankton, and fish are typically found depending upon the
seasonal habitat phases (MEP, 1997).
4.2.5 Socio-Economic Conditions
Six villages, considered representative of the socio-economic make-up of the greater MPSA area, were
surveyed as part of the General Household Socio-Economic Survey conducted for the EIA (Appendix 12), and
include: Islampur, Ganganagar, Dhudghata, Char Goaldi, Panchani, and Kurbanpur (Figure 4.11). These
villages were the main focus of the social analysis as approximately 97% of the project-affected-persons
live and/or work within these villages. For continued reference, the remaining project-affected-persons
were also surveyed during the collection of baseline conditions.
Lifestyles in the project area have adapted to the annual cycle of sunmmer inundation by floodwaters,
often in quite complex ways. The project site, the low lying paddy lands along the side channels of the
Meghna, and extensive areas leading further inland beyond the line of villages, are all flooded for
anywhere from four to nine months of the year, depending on the strength of the summer monsoon and
the height of the land. For this reason, the villages are built on platforms a few feet above the normal high
inundation level, with protection and anchoring by trees and other vegetation.
Undoubtedly, most parts of these villages were raised by hand filling long ago. This process is still visible
where new residential or bazaar lands are being created or where older land is in need of repair. The
village platforms provide space for houses, sheds for cattle, kitchen gardens, medicinal plants, fruit trees,
small orchards, a local market, schools, and other public buildings. Depending upon the severity of
monsoon rains, some village platforms themselves go under water, forcing people onto their roofs or over
to the main highway embankment for reprieve from the high waters.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.2.5.1   General Village Features
Similar to most villages in Bangladesh, each of the six villages surveyed consists of traditional institutions
like neighbourhoods (para), lineages (gushti), and comrnmunity (samaj). For example, Dhudghata has seven
paras that collectively contain nine gushtis. In most samajs, there is a leader who provides commanding
influence over the community members. The role of community leaders in Bangladesh is quite important
from a social control and power structure perspective (DPC, 1999a).
In the rural areas of Bangladesh, hunger characterizes poverty, as is also the case with the villages
surveyed. At the time of the survey, approximately 20% of the households reporting had experienced
prolonged hunger in the seven days prior to the survey, with more than 80% reported the consumption of
fish over the same period (DPC, 1999a).
Within the villages surveyed, flooding is a seasonal event, but varies in scale and intensity most years.
Under normal climatic conditions, approximately 10% of households in the river fringe areas experience
flood conditions. However, in 1998 when one of the most severe floods was recorded in Bangladesh,
more than 91% of the households were inundated by waist high water which also disrupted road and
comrnunication networks (DPC, 1999a).
Additional information obtained from the General Socio-Economic Household Survey is contained in
Appendix 12. The following village specific socio-economic profile was attained from a study sample of
sixty households; ten from each of the six villages. The study was carried out between July 25 and August
25, 1999 and is reflective of the seasonal lifestyles experienced by those who live in the villages.
Additional data is provided in Appendices 13.
4.2.5.2 Islampur
Islampur is located immediately adjacent to the proposed project site. Figure 4.7 (Photo 6) shows the
section of the village that lies at the southeast cormer of the project site. The village has approximately 80
households and a total population of 1,200 people. The average household size is 15 people. Of the
conmmunity's population, there are five main lineages. The population mix is approximately 70% male
and 30% female (DPC, 1999b). The male literacy rate in Islampur is 38.9%, while the female literacy rate is
17.9% (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 1994). While the community is predominantly Moslem, however,
one or two families observe other religions. As in all six of the villages, conflicts are settled through
meetings with the community's elders.
The village has very few amenities. For example, Islampur has one canal that is primarily used for social
and economic purposes and one shop that sells essential goods only. The majority of the community lacks
both electrical and sewage facilities. However, a small group of 100 men live close to the ship repair yard
and have access to electricity. A single hand pump, located in the middle of the village, supplies the
community's water (MEP, 1997).

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
To access other amenities, such as education and medical care, villagers must travel several kilometres.
For example, there are two high schools within five kilometres of the village, a madrasa' within seven
kilometres, a college is five kilometres away, and the closest hospital is six kilometres from the village
(DPC, 1999b).
4.2.5.3 Ganganagar
Ganganagar is a slightly smaller community than Islampur, although it covers a greater land area. It is
located northeast of the project site. Its location with respect to the MPSA access road is illustrated in
Figure 4.7 (Photo 7). There are 70 households and a total of 800 people in the village with an average
household of 11 family members. The cormrmunity has three main lineages and a male to female ratio of
60:40 (DPC, 1999b). The male literacy rate in Ganganagar is 31%, while the female literacy rate is 13.2%
(Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 1994). Almost 100% of this village is Moslem.
There are two ponds and two canals in the village. While there is no primary school in Ganganagar, there
are two high schools located one and four kilometres away, and two colleges within three kilometres of
the village. Ganganagar is located within two kilometres of a madrasa. The closest hospital is five
kilometres away (DPC, 1999b).
The housing standard in Ganganagar is generally better than that found in Islampur. While the village is
connected to the power grid, not all homes have electricity. Additionally, there are no sewage facilities
and water is supplied via hand pumps (MEP, 1997).
4.2.5.4 Dhudghata
Dhudghata occupies a large area and is located to the north of the project site. There are 425 households
in the village with a total population of 5,000, primarily from nine lineages. Each household contains
between nine and ten individuals and almost 100% of the villagers are Moslem (DPC, 1999b). The male
literacy rate is 26.8%, while the female rate is 12.5% (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 1994).
Dhudghata has four ponds, two canals, and two ditches. Most educational institutions are located within
close proximity to the village. A primary school is located within three kilometres, a high school is within
one kilometre, with both a madrasa and a senior madrasa located within one kilometre. The closest
college is two kilometres away from Dhudghata. Although Dhudghata does not have direct access to a
hospital, there is a health clinic within two kilometres (DPC, 1999b). WVater is supplied to the village via
tubewells and hand pumps. While there are no sewage facilities, the village does have access to electricity
(MEP, 1997).
A madrasa is an institution for religious education

4.2.5.5  Kurbanpur
Kurbanpur is located northwest of the project site. The village has 241 households with a population of
2,100. The average household size is roughly nine individuals and there are three main lineages in
Kurbanpur. The male literacy rate in the village is 25.2%, while the female rate is 13% (Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics, 1994). Like the other communities, almost 100% of the individuals are Moslem.
The village has two ponds and three ditches. All schools are within close proximity of the village; partly
since Kurbanpur is very close to Dhudghata. The primary school, the high school, and the senior madrasa
are all within one kilometre, while the college is within two kilometres of the village. Like Dhudghata,
Kurbanpur has access to a health clinic, which is one kilometre away (DPC, 1999b). Although the village
is connected to the power grid, not all houses have electricity. The community has no sewage facilities
and water is supplied via hand pumps (MEP, 1997).
4.2.5.6 Panchani
Panchani is located to the west of the project site and there are 176 households in the community. The
total population is 2,400, for an average household size of between 13 and 14 individuals. Panchani has
six main lineages (DPC, 1999b).
The male literacy rate in the community is 30.1%, while the female rate is 18.8% (Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics, 1994). The community has two ponds, one canal, and three flood plains. The primary school
and madrasa are both within 0.5 kilometres of the village and the closest college is two kilometres away.
There is no hospital in the community, but there is a health clinic (DPC, 1999b).
4.2.5.7 Char Goaldi
Char Goaldi is located adjacent to Panchani, to the west of the project site. It has 241 households with a
total population of 2,500, for an average household size slightly over 10 individuals. (DPC, 1999b). The
community is comprised of six lineages. The community's male literacy rate is well above average at
52.5%. The female literacy rate is also high at 31.8% (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 1994).
The village has one pond, one canal, and two ditches. The primary school is within 0.5 kilometres, the
senior madrasa is within 1.5 kilometres, and the college is within 2.5 kilometres. As the health clinic is
located in Panchani, it is 1.5 kilometres from Char Goaldi (DPC, 1999b).
4.2.5.8  Road and River Transportation
The road and highway infrastructure in Bangladesh is not well-developed. The existing infrastructure has
also suffered from neglect and from flooding damage. For example, the devastating 1998 flood seriously
damaged the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, which passes through the project region. The flood eroded the
slopes and shoulders of the road, carved pockets, pits, and holes, and weakened old bridges. To help
mitigate future flood damage, the governnent has taken recent initiatives to build more bridges, and
widen and elevate roads.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Road traffic often consists of a mixture of cars, buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, pedal rickshaws, and
pedestrians. Approximately 80% of vehicles are reconditioned and in disrepair. Air quality along the
major roadways is seriously degraded due to the high pollutant emissions from vehicles (DPC, 1999g).
Traffic along the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway is busiest between 13:00 and 14:00 hours. Appendix 112
contains detailed information on vehicle traffic, pedestrian traffic, and traffic accidents in the project
region.
The Meghnaghat river port is a major inland port and trading centre. Development in the region continue
to increase this port's importance to cargo ships, fishing boats, passenger boats, and trawlers. As a result,
a two-day survey was undertaken to estimate total river traffic flow near the project site (Appendix 113).
Results indicate that the most popular traffic includes trawlers, country boats, cargo ships and fishing
boats (DPC, 1999h).
4.2.5.9 Agricultural Development
With mixed crop vegetation, limited monoculture tree plantations, and homestead based agro-forestry,
the project area is no different than many other areas of alluvial delta in Bangladesh. Generally a very
fertile agricultural area, the study area predominately grows high yielding rice varieties and rabi crops on
a seasonal basis. The villages near the project site typically have backyards with scattered trees comprised
of species common throughout the country.
As discussed previously, the project site prior to filling was predominantly covered with mixed crop
vegetation driven by seasonal variations in the environment. The crops include rice, wheat, pulses,
7779.,*i'  oilseeds, vegetables (tomato, eggplant, etc.), sweet potato, and watermelon. These are grown mostly
during the dry months (October-November to March-April) because the agricultural land remains under
water during the sumrnmer months.
Rice is the most popular crop in the region accounting for 31% of overall production. Its popularity can be
attributed to its importance as a subsistence food for most villagers. Other important crops in the region
include wheat (20.84%), oil seeds (20.72%), vegetables (18.54%), and jute (9%). Of the available
agricultural land, 88% is under cultivation of which 49% of that land can be found in the villages. More
than 67% of cultivated land is under irrigation (Appendix 12). This is well above the national average of
40%. The rest of the land remains irrigated by traditional methods such as the swing baskets and ditches
(DPC, 1999a).
4.2.5.10 Gender Issues
The majority of women in the project area live within the confines of the household; an arena still
thoroughly regulated by custom and devotion to domestic work and the raising of children. Purdah, in
the form of strict veiling, is not strongly observed in the area, although women lack mobility and
expeditions outside the home usually require permission from the head of the household. There is a
strong tradition of female modesty, based upon the perceived requirements of Islam.
Given the sensitive nature of interactions with village women, a Bangladeshi female sociologist
conducted both field interviews and a focus group session with potentially affected women. The field
interviews and focus group feedback confirmed the expectation that women have important roles in the

agrarian cycle. Women are particularly involved in the care of kitchen gardens, seeds and seed beds, and
the processing of paddy when it is brought in from the fields. These functions are undertaken in the
home and women of the affected households say they did not visit the char area during the period of
cultivation. Women do not claim to have a role in famnily decision-making, but their knowledge of the
crop cycle and fishing arrangements indicate that their role is important, albeit informal (DPC, 1999a).
In the six villages surveyed, female literacy rates were an average of 16% lower than male literacy rates.
This is reflected in school enrolment, where only 30% of rural primary school students are female even
though there is a 1991 government declaration that primary education be mandatory for all children.
Similarly, less than 25% of secondary students and fewer than 15% of university students are female
(Bigelow, 1995). However, new programs have been developed to assist older women who bypassed
school in their youth to improve their literacy.
Of the 46 women who attended a focus group session, only six could not write their own name. The fact
that 189 local women work in the garment factory is a significant figure. However, there was reluctance
by the women to admit this, perhaps because this kind of factory work is still regarded as
unconventional, suspect, and injurious to their reputations (DPC, 1999a).
While gender ratios in the six villages tend to be more or less even among those aged 44 and below, the
gender distribution is very uneven among those 45 and above. Among those aged above 45 years, there
are 60.7% males and 39.3% females. In the villages surrounding the project site, 51.7% of families use
birth control. The most cornmon contraceptive method is the birth control pill. Infant and matemal
mortality rates are considered low in the project region (Appendix 12). The infant (under 5) mortality rate
in 1998 was 1.7%, whereas the matemal mortality rate was also 1.7% (DPC, 1999a).
4.2.5.11 Public Health
Although the villages are faring well economically, malnutrition and health issues remain a concem. In
the seven days prior to the household interviews, 20% of households reported that they had experienced
some form of "starvation" (DPC, 1999a). In terms of diet, 81% of households reported that they had eaten
fish within the last seven days. While many households cultivate their own food, that source is not
sufficient for all their dietary needs. Approximately 63% of households obtain rice from the market, 91%
obtain vegetables from the market, and 70% of households obtain their fish from the market. Close to 20%
of households were forced to rely entirely upon the river as their only source of fish (DPC, 1999a).
When asked what type of medical treatrnent they sought, 76% of households reported having been to one
of the region's hospitals. However, 43.3% also reported visiting folk healers when they are ill. Diseases
villagers must contend with include Malaria, Hepatitis A, B, and C, Typhoid, Dengue fever,
Schistosomiasis, and Cholera (Appendix 114). Very few households have latrines, which makes for poor
sanitary conditions in the villages. Only 33.3% of households reported using latrines (DPC, 1999a)
(Appendix 12).

4.2.5.12 Aesthetic Values
The landscape at the MPSA does not offer natural aesthetic value to the project. The topography of the
area is relatively flat with elevations typically less than 2.3 metres above mean sea level. Thus,
opportunities to use natural landscape features to obscure the power station are limited. Other land-uses
near the MPSA include industrial, commercial, and residential developments. The visual nature of these
buildings and structures are similar to those structures of the power station and may lessen its visual
impacts (MEP, 1997).
Further, the Meghna River Bridge, situated approximately 1000 metres north of the MPSA, extends to a
height of approximately 20 metres above the river, while the existing Meghnaghat - Comilla transmission
line towers are 140 metres in height. Both of these elevated features, coupled with the other existing
industrial land-uses surrounding the MPSA, may also serve to lessen any visual impacts associated with
the power station.  Furthermore, aesthetic issues are not considered significant by local people
particularly in this densely populated area of Bangladesh and are secondary to the people's desire for
reliable electricity (MEP, 1997).
4.2.6 Cultural Conditions
4.2.6.1  Religious Characteristics
Sonargaon Thana, part of former Bengal, boasts a rich history. While the area was under competing
~          influences for some time, it is believed that Moslem rule was officially established throughout all of
Bengal between 1322 and 1328. Prior to Moslem rule, Sonargaon Thana was predominantly Buddhist.
Even today, the relics of a 13th century Buddhist palace can be found within a 10-kilometre radius of the
project site (Appendix 115).
Under Moslem rule, Sonargaon became the capital of East Bengal. Fifteenth century Chinese voyagers
wrote that Sonargaon was a splendid walled city, with broad roads, temples, and bazaars. This history
has left the region with a number of forts and tombs, which reflect the architectural influences of the time
(Figure 4.10). Witl-iin a 10-kilometre radius of the project site are the Hajiganj, Sonakanda, and ldrakpur
forts (-1660 A.D.), the tomb of Bibi Marium (1700 A.D.), and the palace of Isha Khan (DPC, 1999c).
Today's Bangladesh is 84% Moslem, 15% Hindu, 0.6% Buddhist, and .03% Christian (Bigelow, 1995).
These variant religious influences have resulted in a number of mosques, Hindu shrines, and other holy
areas within a 10-kilometre radius of the project area. These include the Jam-e-Mosque (1700-1750), the
shrine of Noor Mohammad Shah, the Qadam Mobarak Mosque, the holy place of Langalband, the shrine
of Sultan Giyasuddin (1399-1410), the Sree Sree Joy Kali temple (1277), the Sree Basudeb temple (1277),
and the Mahakali temple (1500), and are shown on Figure 4.12 (DPC, 1999c).
4.2.6.2 Quality of Life
In the survey, when asked how they spent their spare time, 90% of villagers stated that they spend most
of their leisure time gossiping, visiting neighbours, and having tea. Approximately 50%° of villagers,
primarily those who have access to electricity, reported spending time watching television and listening
to the radio (Appendix 12). Mlusic, theatre, dance, and art also remain important components of rural life
(DPC, 1999a).

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Only 2% of villagers eam incomes that are below the Bangladesh poverty line (i.e., 15,000 Taka or USD
330/annum). Of the villages surveyed, more than 40% of households earn between 15,000 and 40,000
Taka and 10% of households earn more than 100,000 Taka (US$ 2,200) annually. This income range
suggests that the local population is faring relatively well economically as compared to other areas of
Bangladesh (DPC, 1999a).
Housing conditions also indicate a better than average economic situation. Approximately 90% of houses
are built with corrugated iron (CI) sheets, while 5% of houses are made of brick. Only 1.7% of houses are
made completely of mud (DPC, 1999a).
Approximately 25% of households reported receiving aid from various non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), with 20% receiving loans from commercial banks, and 27% of people having salaried
occupations with commercial, government, and NGO organizations. Male household heads generally
dominate these salaried positions. Approxirnately 16.3% of people are involved in fishing, 15% are
involved in small trade and cultivation, and 6% work as wage labourers in both agricultural and non-
agricultural sectors (DPC, 1999a) (Appendix 12).
4.2.6.3 Knowledge of Proposed Project
Through the fieldwork activities, it has been deternined that approxirnately 85% of household members
have heard about the proposed power station. These numbers are now expected to be virtually 100%
since the completion of site filling activities and Phase of the II PCDP. When asked, 78.3% felt that they
would not be affected by the project and were in favour of the project proceeding as long as sufficient
compensation packages were offered to the villages (Appendix 12).

5.  IMPACT IDENTIFICATION, MANAGEMENT, AND MONITORING
5.1   Introduction
This EIA adopts a project life cycle assessment format and builds upon the findings of the IEE report
(ESG Intemational, 1999b) and the MEP 1997 EIA study. It focuses on the development of specific
management initiatives during the construction, operation, and decommissioning phases of the project to
ensure that: i) the people closest to the project receive the projected benefits; ii) environmental and socio-
economic impacts are minimised; and iii) health and safety impacts are kept to a minimum. To optimize
the life cycle assessment, linkages between potential impacts (i.e., key environmental issues), mitigative
measures (i.e., management actions), net effects (i.e., residual effects), and monitoring programs (i.e.,
management decision tools) are explicitly made.
A summary of project issues, based on the project site configuration, is presented in tabular format in
Section 5.5. The tables provide the basis for development and implementation of a detailed
Envirornmental Action Plan, which is discussed in Section 6 of this EIA study. Certain issues have been
identified as requiring a greater level of infornation and analysis than can be conveyed solely through
the use of tables. These are referred to as project specific key issues and are sumumarised in Section 5.4.
Where appropriate, supporting technical inforrnation is provided in the appendices to which the reader
with a specific interest can refer.
7           5.2  Compliance with World Bank Operational Policies
IDCOL guidelines require the project to comply with all World Bank environmental and social safeguard
policies. The applicable World Bank policies, along with a brief statement indicating project cornpliance
with each policy, are provided in Table 5.1. Included also are comments on compliance of the power
station with the draft World Bank polices on Labour and Public Disclosure of Information.

5.3 World Bank Key Issues
The World Bank guidelines for new thermal power stations (1998) sumunarize the key production and
emission control practices necessary to achieve compliance. This sertion identifies the applicable issues
and describes how each has been addressed during project planning activities.
Issue 1: Choose the cleanestfuel economically available.
As natural gas is available domestically and is cleaner-burning than oil or coal, the power station will
utilize indigenous natural gas for fuel.
Issue 2: Select the best power generation technologiyfor thefuel.
Selection of the power generation technology and pollution control systems should be balanced with
the environmental and economic costs and benefits based on the site-specific EIA. Combined cycle
technology, utilizing dry low NO, burners, will be used to generate power. Combined cycle
technology possesses the most efficient process for producing power from natural gas, in addition to
minimizing the rate of air emissions per unit of power produced. The EIA identified no significant
environmental costs that could be alleviated by using alternative power generation technology (e.g.,
conventional steam boiler, simple cycle gas turbine).
Issue 3: For pollution control, consider that particulate matter smaller than 10 microns in size (PM20) are most
importantfrom a health perspective, and acceptable levels of removal are achievable at relatively low cosf.
The emission rate of PM,, will be well below both the emission guidelines of the World Bank and the
emission standards of the GOB.
Issue 4: For pollution control, consider that low NOx burners and other combustion modifications can achieve NOx
reductions.
The gas turbines will be equipped with dry, low NO, burners that at loads above 50% have NOx
emissions well below emission guidelines of the World Bank and the emission standards of the GOB.
Issue 5: Before adopting expensive control technologies, consider the option of achieving offsetting reductions in
emissions of critical pollutants at other sources within the airshed to achieve acceptable ambient levels.
Preliminary baseline ambient air quality monitoring indicates that the project site is located in a
relatively clean airshed, as defined in the World Bank guidelines (1998). The combination of
combined cycle technology, sulphur and dust-free natural gas, with dry, low NO, bumers will allow
the power station to operate within ambient air quality guidelines and preclude the need for
offsetting emission reductions.

Issue 6: Sulphur oxides removal systems that generate less wastewatcr are nor-mally preferred.
The sulphur-free natural gas being used precludes the need for desulphurisation technologies.
Issue 7: Ash disposal and reclamation should be managed to minimize environmental impacts.
Ash will not be generated by the power station.
Issue 8: Consider re-circulating cooling systems where thermal discharge to water bodies may be of concern.
The power station is situated on the Meghna River, one of Bangladesh's largest rivers. Thermal
plume modelling indicates that the power station can operate within the applicable World Bank and
Bangladesh guidelines for thermal effluent (Appendix J3).
Issue 9: A comprehensive monitoring and reporting system is required.
The Project Sponsor will follow the comprehensive monitoring program that has been set out in the
Environmental Action Plan, in Section 6 of this EIA Report.
5.4 Project Specific Key Issues
The key project issues were determined to be:
*  dredging of the Meghna river for material to raise the site;
*  cooling water abstraction and discharge;
.  noise levels in adjacent rural villages; and
*  ground level concentrations of NO2 and PM,,; and
*  economic dislocation of project affected people.
These key issues are addressed in the following subsections. Other issues of a more routine nature,
including occupational health and safety, waste disposal, and natural hazards are addressed in Section
5.5.
5.4.1 River Dredging and Site Filing
The Land Lease Agreement, implemented under the laws of Bangladesh, required the BPDB to raise the
project site one meter above the 1 in 200 vear flood level by November 15, 1999. This translates
approximately to eight metres above the mean w ater level based upon Public Works Datum (PWD). The
filling was required as the undeveloped site was subject to seasonal flooding.
Dredging and site filling activities are not included in the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules
(1997) list of project categories that require an IEE or EIA report. The BPDB did, however, obtain Site
Clearance from the DOE to execute the site filing works and construction of the access road based upon
the 1997 EIA report prepared by MEP. The BPDB and their subcontractor, the China National Water
Resources and Hydropowver Engineering Corporation (CWHEC), were responsible for mitigating and
monitoring the associated effects.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
River sediments are the principal indigenous source of fill material in the low-lying areas of Bangladesh.
Fill material for the project site, as for the entire MPSA, was obtained from the Meghna River by dredging
a total area of approximately 2 kin2, to an average depth of four metres. Approximately 8,000,000 m3 of
fill were required to raise the MPSA to the desired level and was completed in the first quarter of 2000.
Typical effects associated with dredging (i.e., turbidity and sedimentation) are discussed in section
5.4.1.
The CWIHEC undertook the dredging and site filling works under the supervision of the state run agency
BPDB. AES was not involved in assisting with or overseeing any of these works, and were given only
controlled/limited access to inspect the works completed up to August 1999. The numerical modelling
testing report and post-dredging bathymetry carried out by CWHEC and Survey 2000 are contained in
Appendix 14 and Attachment 14-1. At the time of writing, no other documentation had been provided by
the BDPB to the Project Sponsor.
5.4.1.1 Waterlogging
During the public consultation meetings, it was noted by local residents from Islampur and Ganganagar
that waterlogging of lands had occurred as a result of construction of the BPDB access road. Water that
had moved freely across the land, prior to the access road, was now restricted in its flow and
accumulating.
At the time the access road was constructed, the BPDB also constructed a culvert beneath the road to
facilitate the movement of water. Maintaining the openings of the culver should resolve this problem.
However, should the waterlogging problem  persist, it is anticipated tlhat the Project Sponsor's
Conmmunity Liaison Officer will be alerted to the issue and take the appropriate follow-up actions with
the BPDB.
5.4.1.2 Scouring and Flow Effects
The CWHEC analysis of scouring and flow effects related to dredging (Appendix 14) included
examination of:
*  flow conditions for the embankment protection adjacent to the MPSA;
*  changes in river flow velocity distribution after dredging; and
*  riverbed scouring distribution and local scouring after MPSA development.
It is understood that the dredging plan implemented by CWHEC included three borrow areas in the
vicinity of the MPSA (Figure 3.4):
i.  Borrow Area A: located immediately west of the MPSA, with an area of approximately 0.5 kmi.
According to the Tender Documents, CWHEC concluded that dredging of this area would have
little effect on the flow conditions and riverbed scouring;
ii.   Borrow Area B: located immediately to the south of the MPSA and adjacent to Borrow Area A,
roughly centred within the main channel of the river, with an area of approximately .1 km2.
CWHEC's modelling predicted that dredging of this borrow area would have limited adverse

effects to local scouring depths and velocity distribution. The modeling report commented that
dredging of Borrow Area B may strengthen the transportation capacity of the main channel; and
iii.   Borrow Area C: located outside of the main channel of the Meghna River immediately north of
the MPSA with an area of less than 0.25 km2. CWHEC's modelling report did not discuss
potential scouring effects for Borrow Area C.
Survey 2000, on behalf of CWHEC, has prepared a post-dredging bathymetry report, a copy of which is
provided in Appendix 14-1. Relative to the pre-dredging river bottom level, the report lists the depth to
which sediments were removed from the Meghna riverbed during the dredging activities. Consistent
with the initial dredging plan, dredging occurred to an approximate depth of four metres through the
majority of the dredge area.
5.4.1.3  Turbidity and Sedimentation Effects
Dredging activities can affect aquatic life through direct physical effects to organisms in the dredging
area (e.g., sessile organisms including plants, molluscs, and benthos) and through indirect effects related
to organisms in proximity to the dredging area. The indirect effects are caused by increased turbidly
levels in the water and by downstream deposition of sediments released in the water by the dredging
activity.
Given that the Meghna River has naturally high turbidity levels and high rates of sedimentation, the
indigenous populations of aquatic life are pre-adapted to these conditions. The dredging was not
expected to significantly affect long-term sediment loadings in the river, and had only a short-term effect
on benthos (i.e., bottom dwelling organisms) within the borrow areas and in downstream areas affected
by increased sedimentation. Such organisms are expected to quickly recolonize the affected areas
following the completion of dredging activities. Generally, solids suspended during river dredging
operations re-settle within 500-1000 meters of the dredge (Bohlen et al., 1979; Koba and Shiba, 1981).
The river is sufficiently wide (i.e., -1,000 metres) to allow fish and other active swimmers that might have
been affected by the turbidity to avoid the highest turbidity areas. Overall, no long-term deleterious
effects are expected on aquatic life due to the temporary increased turbidity levels and corresponding
downstream sedimentation.
5.4.1.4  Flood Water Distribution
As noted, the project site has been elevated to approximately +8 metres PWD, roughly one metre above
the 200 year .design storm event level. The riverbanks north and south of the project site have been
spuriously built up to accommodate various industries and commercial ventures, however, some areas
remain in a relatively "natural" state.
Given the width of the Meghna River in the proximity of the project site, elevating the MPSA to its
current height is not anticipated to have a significant effect on downstream land-uses. Considering the
existing seasonal fluctuations of the Meghna River, elevating the project site is not expected to affect local
rises in river water depth.

5.4.2  Cooling Water Discharge
The power station will withdraw approximately 15.5 m3/sec (56,000 m3/hr) of water from the Meghna
River for once-through cooling purpose. The Project Sponsor has obtained a No Objection Certificate for
the water withdrawal from the Bangladesh lnland Water Authority (Appendix D7). Under normal
operating conditions the cooling water will experience a 5.5 °C temperature rise as it passes through the
steam condenser. It will be returned back to the river at a downstream point located approximately one
kilometre from the water intake (Figure 4.3).
In rare circumstances it will be necessary to operate in by-pass mode, routing the steam from the HRSG
around the steam turbine (i.e., l1% of the operating tirne and only for approximately ten minutes to allow
for the safe shut down of the power station). In bypass mode, the increase in temperature across the
condenser will be rise to 9.5°C and then decrease again as the shut down process advances towards full
stop.
The average of the annual minimum  discharges recorded by Bangladesh Water Development Board
during the years 1990 through 1995 was 1,987 m3/sec. Abstraction of water at 15.5 m3/sec for cooling
purpose is 0.78% of this average minimum discharge. The past record shows that rninimum discharge
occurs during the last week of November. During this period, the river becomes tidal and exhibits bi-
directional flow.
Cooling water dispersion simulations were carried out by the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI)/Surface
Water Modelling Centre (SWMC) as part of the 1997 EIA report. The 1997 modelling was based upon a
conceptual design and layout for the power station. Specifically the 1997 modelling assumed a cooling
water output of 8 m3/sec at a temperature 8°C above ambient from each of the three power stations at the
MPSA. The 1997 modelling predicted that the warm water effluent could be released to the river in
compliance with DOE standards and World Bank guidelines and without significant effects on aquatic
life.
These simulations were updated as part of this EIA study using the specific design parameters for the
power station (Table 5.2). The model also examined the potential for cumulative effects from
development of the Phase II power station at the MPSA. Phase III was not considered as the timing of its
development is uncertain and the BPDB has not yet issued any bid package for the project.

For modelling purposes, it was assumed that the Phase II power station would be of the same design as
the Phase I power station and would discharge from the same discharge location (i.e., an open cooling
water discharge channel situated at the riverbank, not via a discharge pipe into the middle of the river as
is currently under consideration by the Project Sponsor). The detailed results of the modelling are
provided in Appendix J3. The following subsections summarize the model methodology and results. In
addition, a detailed analysis of potential effects on aquatic life was carried out, as documented in
Appendix J4.
5.4.21 The Model and Its Inputs
Two professional computer based numerical modelling packages were applied to the study: MIKE 11 and
MIKE 21. The primary modelling tool used was MIKE 21, a comprehensive two-dimensional modelling
system used to examine hydrodynamics, heat and mass balances, and sediment transport, including
thermal discharges. The modelling was based upon the operational discharge characteristics as provided
by the Construction Contractor for the power station (Table 5.2). Figure 5.1 shows the intake and
discharge locations used in the model, together with the control points that were selected for presentation
of time series (TS) data from the hydrodynamic (HD) and advection dispersion (AD) simulations. The
corresponding co-ordinates are shown in Table 5.3.

The cooling water design characteristics were integrated into the model along with the flow velocities,
water level data, and bathymetry of the River. The modelling focused upon the worst case, low flow dry
season conditions that may occur once in every 50 years as determined from a hydrological analysis of
the River (SWMC, 1997). Under a normal low flow dry season, the water levels and flows are much
higher than the worst case situation assumed in the model. During periods of moderate and high river
flows, typical of wet season conditions, cooling water is quickly assimilated by the relatively high flow
volume of the river and thus does not pose a concern
Based upon the SWMC hydrological analysis of the Meghna River (1997), it was found that the first two
weeks of February 1991 represent the worst flows in the 50-years return period (i.e., an adverse dry
season period). Thus, this time series represents a practical worst-case situation in terms of the extent of
the mixing zone and potential for recirculation of the cooling water, as it is based upon adverse
assumptions about water flows and levels (Figure 5.2).                                               m
The graph of current velocities presented in Figure 5.2, shows that the river is tidal during the selected
dry season time series (i.e., at the HD-TS point), with velocities ranging from -0.5 m/s (flood flow) to
+0.31 m/s (ebb flow). Surface water levels over this same time series range from 0.85 meters (low tide) to
1.6 metres (high tide) above the zero mark. All elevations are relative to PWD.
5.4.2.2 Model Results
Based upon the model inputs and using excess temperatures, the largest distance from the discharge port
to the estimated envelope of the 3°C isotherm has been calculated using the worst-case flow as described
above. Table 5.4 shows the calculated distances for the four operating Scenarios.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
When the phase I power station is in operation, the maximum distance that the 3°C envelope may extend
downstream is one kilometre based upon the worst case low flow (i.e., I in 50 years). Under operating
scenario 2, with the phase I power station operating in bypass mode, the downstream distance was
calculated on the basis of continuous operation in bypass mode over an extended period of time (i.e., 360
hours). However, in actuality, the phase I power station will only operate in bypass mode for a short
period of time; a maximum of ten minutes as it shutdowns. Thus, the effect of the 9.5°C excess
temperature increase under bypass operating conditions will only persist for a short time period and will
likely be similar in effect to scenario 1.
Under operating scenario 3, when the phase I and II power stations will operate in normal mode, the
downstream distance of the 3°C envelope will extend to 2.2 kilometres. Under operating scenario 4,
phase I in normal operation and phase Il in bypass mode, the downstream distance of the 3°C envelope
will extend 4.5 kilometres. Both distance were calculated based upon the I in 50 years worst case flow
conditions and an extended operating time (i.e., 360 hours) in bypass mode.
It is expected that the above distances would rarely, if ever, be encountered during the lifetime of power
station due to the: i) limited operating time in bypass mode of the phase I power station; and ii) flow
conditions occurring once in every 50 years at the same time as the power station is operating in bypass
mode. Thus, in an average dry season, the downstream distances will be much lower than those
predicted by the model.
Dilution percentages, including the effects of cooling water recirculation at the isotherm edge, were also
calculated and are discussed in section 5.4.2.4.
Scenario 1: Normal Operating Conditions
The modelling indicates that under worst case low flow conditions (i.e., I in 50 years), the maximum
distance from the discharge port to the downstream edge of the 3°C isotherm is one kilometre as
discussed above. However, under a normal dry period, the downstream distance would be much shorter,
possibly around 100 metres, and is not expected to have any significant effect on aquatic biota.
Figure 5.3 shows the time series of excess temperature at selected locations (i.e., the AD-TS points) in the
river within the model area (see Figure 5.2). As shown in Figure 5.3, at the downstream point located
approximately one kilometre from the discharge port (illustrated by the black line in the upper part of the
figure), the excess temperature does not exceed 3°C at any time during the 15 day modelling period. In
fact, most of the time the increased temperature is around 1°C. Although these values apply to the
specific simulation period, recall that this time series was selected as the adverse dry season period based
upon hydrological analysis of the River (SWMC, 1997).
In a reversing tidal flow that prevails in the driest part of the dry season, the thermal plume will extend
upstream part of the time and downstream part of the time. Under these conditions, any given location
will only be affected by the thermal plume part of the time (except in close vicinity of the outfall), in
which case the average excess temperature will become much less as can bee seen from the time series.
Such a plume is not expected to have any long-term effects on aquatic life: i) for the short duration that
the plume is present fish would be able to avoid it; and ii) the warm water of the plume is buoyant
compared to the cooler ambient water of the river and thus bottom dwelling species and benthos would,   !

for the most part, be unaffected. The plume will not present a lethal barrier to plankton and will not have
a long-term effect on plankton abundance.

Excess temperature increases at cooling water intakes I and II are limited to roughly 1°C or less
throughout the modelled cycle as illustrated in the bottom graph of Figure 5.3. Such a limited increase,
coupled with the short duration of the increase, is not anticipated to affect the operating conditions of the
phase I power station. This potential for water recirculation is discussed further in Section 5.4.2.4.
Figure 5.4 shows the time series of excess temperature during a normal wet season. As shown in the
figure, the excess temperature at the furthest downstream point (i.e., AD-TS point 25,58) is negligible
(-0.1°C). During this period, cooling water is quickly assimilated by the relatively high flow volume of
the river and thus does not pose an environmental concern. The potential for cooling water recirculation
under this model cycle is also negligible, not affecting power station operations.

.Scenario 2: Bypass Operations
The chance that bypass operations will coincide with the 50-year worst-case flow is extremely remote. As
noted, the power station will only operate in bypass mode when the steam turbine is out of operation due
to mechanical malfunction and/or for the time required to reduce the combustion turbines to 50% load.
Similar to the malfunction shutdown period, the required timne for such a load reduction is also ten
minutes. For this short duration, the power station will discharge cooling water at 9.50C. For continued
reference, steam turbines have a higher reliability factor compared to combustion turbines. Thus, plant
mec-hanical malfunctions are more likely to be related to the reliability of the combustion turbines rather
than that of the steam turbine.
The distance from the cooling water outfall to the downstream edge of the 30C isotherm during bypass
operations was estimated to be 3.6 km during the 50 year worst case flow. This distance has been
estimated based upon the assumption of continuous power station operation in bypass mode for 360
hours. Thus, the actual Y0C isotherm resulting from the ten minute bypass operation period will be much
less in distance and duration, posing minimal concern for aquatic biota.
Scenarios 3 and 4: Cumulative Effects
To examine the possible cumulative effects, modelling was also carried out to assess the effects of
operation of the AES Meghnaghat power station in combination with the second phase power station,
both discharging at the same location. Two scenarios were considered: Scenario 3 - both plants in normal
operation; and Scenario 4 - AES Meghnaghat in normal operation and the Phase II plant in bypass
operation. The chance of both plants operating in bypass mode was considered so remote a possibility as
to not warrant consideration.

The time series of excess temperature for operating scenario 3 is shown in Figure 5.5. At AD-TS point
25,58, situated in the side channel approximately one kilometre downstream of the discharge port, a
maximum excess temperature of 3°C is experienced only a few times and for a short duration during the
two week model cycle. An average excess temperature at this point is roughly 20C over this model cycle
compared to a 1°C excess temperature under operating scenario 1. At the other two AD-TS points, the
3°C marker is not exceeded at anytime throughout the same model cycle. The bottom graph on Figure
5.5 shows the excess temperature at intakes I and II which are discussed further in Section 5.4.2.4.

For Scenario 3 the thermal plume, in worst-case conditions, extends 2.2 kilometres downstream of the
discharge port. Similar to Scenario 2, Scenario 4 is of minor concern due to the short duration of time that
bypass operations will persist (i.e., ten minutes).
Figure 5.6 shows the time series of excess temperature during the west season for scenario 3. The excess
temperature at the downstream AD-TS point (25,58) is roughly 0. 2°C. The figure also indicates that
during the wet season, thermal discharge poses no concem for aquatic biota.

5.42.3 Summary of Thermal Plume Modelling
The majority of time throughout the year, the thermal plume coming from the cooling water of the AES
Meghnaghat power station will be relatively small, with the distance to the downstream edge of the 3°C
isotherm falling well within 100 metres from the discharge port. This is not expected to have a significant
effect on aquatic biota and is considered to comply with World Bank guidelines.
Under unusual worst case conditions corresponding to the 50 year low flow event, the 3YC isotherm will
extend up to one kilometre downstream if the power station is in normal operation. Again, the short term
and infrequent nature of this operation mode, coupled with the 1 in 50 year low flow event, is not
expected to cause any significant long-term effects on aquatic biota.
5.4.2.4  Potential for Cooling Water Re-circulation
Computer modelling was also undertaken to determine the potential that cooling water recirculation
might have on the thermal discharge plume. Specifically, MIKE 21 modelling was undertaken for the dry
season, when the Meghna River is dominated by tidal flows with negligible net flows.
The results of the computer modelling predicted that, with tidal conditions, thermal accumulations
would occur in front of the MPSA under reversing flow conditions (i.e., the upstream movement of
water). Consequently, recirculation will occur, further increasing the discharge temperature. The

predicted effects of thermal accumulation upon cooling water discharge are summarised in Table 5.5
with the detailed results shown in Appendix J3.

Note: 'ave' and 'nax' refer to the actual simulation period that covers a tortnightly tidal cycle with a negligible net flow.
As indicated in Table 5.5, the temperate effects of recirculation under the worst case low flow conditions
(i.e., 1 in 50 years) at intakes I and II will be negligible under average tidal cycle, even with both power
stations operating. For example, when the phase I power station is in normal operation, the predicted
average excess temperature at has been calculated at 0.1°C, while the maximum excess temperature will
be 0.9°C. When both the phase I and II power stations are in normal operation the average excess
temperatures are still negligible at 0.1°C at intake I and 0.2°C at intake II. Such a small change in the
intake water temperature will have a limited, if any, effect on the discharge temperature or the
characteristics of the thermal plume.
Over the modelled tidal cycle, there is some minor variations to the mean recirculation values shown in
Table 5.5. The variations, based upon the worst case low flow tidal conditions, are shown in Table 5.6.
The table indicates that if the phase I power station is operating during the adverse low flow period,
intake I will experience excess temperatures above 0.5°C, but below 1.0°C, 4.9% of the time. Such limited
occurrence are not anticipated to affect operating condition or aquatic biota.

1.0°C 4.9°o of the time, and above 1.5°C only 1.4% of the time. At intake 11, under the same conditions,
excess temperatures of 0.5°C are predicted 12.2% of the time, while excess temperatures of 1.0°C, 1.5°C,
and 2.00C are anticipated 7.2%, 3.5%, and 0.6% of the time, respectively.

Under maximum adverse river conditions (i.e., the estimated 50-year return period), the temperature
effects of recirculation are more noticeable at intakes I and II, ranging from 1.8 - 2.2°C. However, as
noted the 50-year return period is of limited occurrence and therefore contributes little in terms of
assessing power station operations with regard to recirculation and environmental effects (DHI, 2000). In
the event that these recirculation conditions occur, the effect will be of a relatively short duration and is
not expected to have a significant effect on aquatic life.
Based upon the predicted modelling results, no protective or mitigative measures are recommended to
mninimise the potential effects of cooling water recirculation (Appendix J3). However, an alternative
discharge method, that is an underwater pipeline discharging to 100 - 150 metres into the Meghna River,
is currently under study by the Project Sponsor and the BPDB. Pending the results of this study, which
will also include an evaluation of potential environmental effects, the Project Sponsor may implement the
pipeline alternative if it is shown to reduce the extent of the mixing and dilution zones, as well as
minimize the probability of cooling water recirculation.

5.4.2.5 DOE Effluent Temperature Standards
Under normal operating conditions the power station's discharge will be 31.5°C during winter when the
ambient temperature is estimated to be 25°C, and 37.5°C during summer when the ambient temperature
is assumed to be 32CC. These temperatures meet the DOE requirements that discharged effluents be 45°C
or below during winter and 40°C or below during summer.
Under the unusual circumstance when the power station must operate in bypass mode, the effluent
temperatures will be 34.5°C in winter, which is well within the DOE limit of 45°C, and will be 41.5°C in
summer, which marginally exceeds the DOE limit of 40°C. The power station is expected to operate in
bypass mode ten minutes only on each occasion the steam turbine is tripped. As noted, steam turbines
are more reliable with than gas turbines and operation in bypass mode would be limited and/or unlikely.
Thus, exceedance of the DOE limit of 400C will rarely occur and due to its short duration (i.e., ten
minutes), it is anticipated that rare exceedance will not have adverse impacts on aquatic biota.

5.4.2.6  Fish Impingement and Entrainment at Water Intake
Damage to fish and other aquatic animals may occur by either impinging larger organisms against the
fixed bar screens or by entraining small organisms in the cooling water as it is pumped through the power
station. Impingement of aquatic organisms can be caused by hydraulic forces in the intake stream prior
to its flow through the coarse bar screen and rotating band screen, and is often lethal due to starvation,
exhaustion, asphyxiation, and exposure to descaling or rake mechanisms. Entrainment may damage
organisms passing through the MCWS by physical impact, pressure changes, thermal shock, or chemical
toxaernia (USEPA, 1976).
The fixed bar and travelling band screens, or similar less lethal screens such as inclined-plane screens,
will aid in reducing the number of aquatic organisms entering the CWS. Impingement will be reduced
through the installation of electronic fish deterrent devices. The effect of impingement on small aquatic
organism populations is expected to be minor as these organisms typically have high recruitment rates.
In addition to the consideration already given to these factors in the EIA, the Construction Contractor will
further evaluate these recommendations during the detailed design phase, and in light of the detailed
description of potential effects on aquatic life as provided in Appendix J4.
5.4.2.7  Water Circulation Patterns
Based upon the findings of the Aquiatic Environmient Evaluation (Appendix J4), no significant effects are
expected on river water circulation patterns due to the operation of the water intake and discharge
structures. Any minor changes in water circulation pattems will be limited to the area imnmediately
adjacent to the intake and discharge structures, thus allowing sufficient room for fish movement outside
of the affected areas.
However, there may be some localized effects on turbidity levels in the immnediate vicinity of these
structures. Given the high ambient concentrations of suspended solids within the Meghna, the existing
adaptations of the aquatic flora and fauna, and the eventual return of the affected areas to pre-operation
conditions once the substrate has stabilized, any effects associated with turbidity will be temporary and
minor (Appendix J4).
5.4.3 Noise
5.4.3.1   Construction Phase
During construction, noise will be generated by the operation of heavy equipment and pile drivers on the
project site, vehicular traffic on the access road, and boat traffic on the river. The most sensitive receptors
for construction generated noise are the residential areas of Islampur Village and Ganganagar Village.
The Construction Contractor is contractually obligated to meet DOE noise standards and World Bank
Guidelines at the nearest residential receptors during the construction period. Generally, it is expected
that the Construction Contractor will be able to manage noise levels to meet this obligation. However, it
is also expected that in certain circumstances noise will exceed the targets (e.g., noise generated during
construction of facilities that are in close proximity to the villages).

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
It is generally accepted that construction activities will result in short term nuisance effects, including
noise. To minimize these effects, the Construction Contractor should restrict potentially significant
nuisance noise activities, such as pile driving, to daytime hours. In addition, sources of continuous noise,
such as portable generator sets, should be shielded or located so as to not be a nuisance to adjacent
residential areas.
Implementation of the above measures, along with the noise management measures set out in "Section
23.5 - Noise" of Hyundai's Safety, Health and Environment Policy and Procedures Manual (Appendix F) and
the good site practices set out in Table 5.11, will ensure that noise impacts will be limited to a short-terrn
intermittent increase in daytime noise levels.
5.4-3.2 Operation Phase
During operations the power station will be a continuous sources of noise emissions. The potential for the
emissions to result in nuisance noise has been determined by comparing the noise levels contributed by
the power station at surrounding, offsite receptors to the applicable standards and guidelines (section
4.2.2.3).
Land-uses adjacent to the MPSA include residential (rural villages), conmmercial, open/agricultural, and
industrial. There are no institutional land uses, such as a school or a hospital, in the vicinity. The most
sensitive noise receptors in the vicinity of the power station were identified as the adjacent villages of
Islampur and Ganganagar (Figure 1.2).
Propagation of the noise emissions from the power station into the surrounding environment was
modelled using environmental noise modelling software. Details of the noise modelling methodology
and results are provided in Appendix 11. A summary of the salient details is presented below.
Information input into the environmental noise model included: the noise emissions levels of the various
equipment of the power station; the layout of the equipment on the site; the topography and surface
characteristics of the surrounding area; and, climatic conditions, to generate noise isopleths (or contours)
for the area surrounding the site. A conservative approach was utilized when considering the effects on
the model by the following variables:
*  information on the actual sound levels to be emitted for certain power station equipment was not
available. For this equipment, sound level inputs were estimated from the maximum allowable
noise levels as specified in AES's Master Specification document and from worst-case sound
levels from similar equipment presented in published literature;
*  it was assumed that all equipment would be operating continuously;
*  no provisions were made to account for the attenuation effect of buildings and structures; and
*  historical meteorological data from Dhaka airport indicate temperature inversions occur 40% of
the time and periods of calm winds occur about 50% of the time. These climatic conditions, which
occur primarily during the night, present worst-case conditions for noise propagation.
The model predicts that daytime noise levels at all surrounding villages, commercial, and industrial areas

homestead areas of Islampur Village, while only the World Bank guidelines are also exceeded in
Ganganagar Village. These exceedances occur at nighttime because allowable noise levels are lower at
night and because noise propagates further during the frequent nighttime temperature inversions.

Note: grey shading represents predicted exceedance.
These results are considered worst-case as they are based on conservative noise emission levels for
certain machineries and because the attenuation effects of existing buildings and structures are not
accounted for. It is expected that the actual noise levels will be less than the levels predicted by the model
and will likely fall within the applicable standards and guidelines. Several mitigation measures are also
available that will ensure noise levels are managed to acceptable levels as detailed in the following
section.
5.4.3.3 Mitigation
A number of mitigation measures are available to control the noise from the power station, to ensure that
noise levels in Islampur and Ganganagar meet GOB standards and World Bank guidelines. However, the
specific mitigation measure to be applied will be the prerogative of the Construction Contractor, as the
Construction Contractor is contractually obligated to build the power station so that it can be operated in
compliance with DOE standards and WB Guidelines at the nearest residential receptors (Appendix D6).
Several possible mitigation measures, as outlined below, have been identified that could be utilized by
the Construction Contractor to meet this obligation. The Construction Contractor may also, during
detailed design, determine additional or alternative measures to meet this obligation. The mitigation
measures that have been identified are:
1. Acoustical shielding and silencing of the prime noise sources.
The most significant noise sources are the gas turbine air intake filters, the transformers, tlhe
HRSGs, and the HRSG feedwater pumps. Potential mitigation options for reducing the noise
contributed by these sources include:
installation of acoustic silencers (e.g., acoustical louvers or duct silencers) on the gas turbine
air intake filters;

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
*  increasing the acoustical effectiveness of transformer enclosures or erecting a noise barrier
between the transformers and the receptor(s) of concern;
* installation of an acoustic enclosure or barrier around the HRSG feedwater pumps or on-site
relocation;
* installation of acoustical insulation on the outer surface of the HRSGs, increasing the mass of
the HRSG walls, or erecting a noise barrier between the HRSGs and receptor(s) of concern;
and
* on-site relocation of support buildings to act as a noise barrier between the major noise
sources and the receptor(s) of concern.
2. Planting a 15 metre wide green belt around the eastern edge of the project site.
That is, separating the power station from the villages will be undertaken by the Project Sponsor.
Where feasible, a smaller green belt will be planted around the remaining perimeter of the project
site. Species will include local vegetation such as Jackfruit, Mango, Mahogany, Jalpai, Black
Berry, Teak, etc.
3. Planting vegetative screens.
Vegetative screens will be planted immediately adjacent to extraneous ground level noise
sources, assisting in lowering the noise emissions from the power station.
These and/or other measures identified by the Construction Contractor will allow the power station to be
constructed to meet the applicable noise standards and guidelines. Noise levels at the residential
receptors will be further monitored while the plant is in full operation and during worst-case nighttime
conditions. If the monitoring indicates that there is an exceedance, the Construction Contractor will be
required to undertake remedial measures to bring the power station into compliance, as specified in
AES's Master Specification document.
5.4.3.4 Cumulative Noise Effects
Using the current location of the AES Meghnaghat power station and positioning the other two possible
power stations on their respective plots equidistant from each other, noise contours were reanalyzed.
This was done to gain an understanding of the potential cumulative effects of all three power stations,
which may be developed at the MPSA. Input parameters for each power station were considered to be
the same as the AES Meghnaghat power station.
The modelled results (Figures 5.9 and 5.10) indicated that there are significant increases in predicted
ambient noise levels at locations adjacent to the MPSA. Using a consenrative, worst-case scenario it is
calculated that noise impacts would increase by 5 dB(A) at nearby receptors with all three power stations
operating at full load. This increase in ambient conditions has been calculated on the basis that
mitigation measures have not been implemented at any of the power stations (Appendix J1).

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
With the installation of appropriate mitigation measures at each power station, required to bring each
consecutive power station into compliance with the applicable guidelines, coupled with additional
greenbelt planting and maintenance, the cumulative noise effects of the MPSA are anticipated to be
within regulatory levels.
Since the Project Sponsor cannot regulate nor control the activities of other power developers, it will be
the responsibility of each new power station owner to ensure the cumulative noise effects remain within
the applicable guidelines.
5.4.4 Air Quality
The combustion of fossil fuels in thermal power stations can results in emission of airbome pollutants
including sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen (NO.) and greenhouse gases
[primarily Carbon dioxide (CO0)2. Emissions of particulate matter and sulphur are primarily determined
by the content of sulphur and dust in the fuel. The natural gas fuel for the AES Meghnaghat Power
Station is naturally free of sulphur and dust. Therefore, there will be negligible emissions of these
pollutants from the power station. This leaves NO, and CO2 as the pollutants of concerm. The following
subsections discuss compliance of the power station with the applicable guidelines and standards for
emissions of NO, and CO2.
5.4.4.1   Oxides of Nitrogen
The power station has been designed to operate in compliance within the NO, emission guidelines of the
World Bank and the standards of the GOB. The NOx emission rate of the V94.2 gas turbine engines at
varying load factors is shown in Figure 5.11 and Table 5.9. As shown, at loads above 50%, the low NO,
burners to be installed on the turbines will reduce the NO, emissions of the engines to levels well below
the applicable standards of GOB and guidelines of the World Bank.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
At loads between 5% and 50%, the NO, emission rate will exceed the World Bank guideline and GOB                  )
standard without selective turbine use. However, in accordance with World Bank guidelines, the plant
will operate with GT loads at or below 50% less than 5% of the time. In terms of actual time required for
the power station to reach 50% load after initial start-up, the Project Sponsor has provided calculations
based upon their past experience in operating simnilar CCGT power stations and plant start-up and shut-
down curves provided in the Construction Contractor's (EPC) contract:
Hot Start          Warm Start           Cold Start
GT I        90 min              120 min             150 min
GT2         30 min               35rmin              40 min
Although the power station is capable of up to 150 starts per year, the predicted frequency of hot starts is
20 times, warm starts 10 times, and cold starts twice per year. Based upon these stoppages, the Project
Sponsor has calculated the total duration of the plant running at loads of 50% or less will be
approximately 38.5 hours per year. This accounts for less than 1% of the total forecasted operating time
(8,000 hours/year) and includes a nine-minute stop time for the GTGs after each occurrence.
Essentially, the only times that a gas turbine will operate at loads below 50% are during start-up and
shutdown and/or when the overall station load is below 28% (Table 5.10). Start-up and shutdown
conditions will occur less than 3% of the total operating time; consistent with the World Bank guidelines.

The operation of the power station at loads below 28% will be rare, and is not expected to exceed 2% of
the station's operating time, considering: i) the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement identify the
minimum dispatch rate for the power station at 25%; and ii) the power station is designed to operate as a
base load plant.
The cost of power from the power station will be low compared to other power sources in Bangladesh.
Thus, it is expected that the dispatch rate will be at loads of 90% or more at least 900/a of the time. The
dispatch load will depend upon sufficient demand and upon sufficient transmission infrastructure to
distribute the power. These factors provide a reasonable basis for the assumption that the power station
will operate at loads below 50%, less than 5% of the time.
During operation NO, emission rates will be monitored to verify compliance with the applicable
standards and guidelines. Details of the monitoring program are set out in Section 6.

5.4.4.2   Stack Height Calculation
Screening level dispersion modelling was completed to identify the optimal design height for the power
station's exhaust stacks. The following summnary of the modelling is based on the detailed report
provided in Appendix J2.
Stack height is a key consideration when determining a power station's contribution to ground level
concentrations of air pollutants. A preliminary estimate of the required stack height was calculated using
Good Engineering Practice (GEP), as defined by the U.S. EPA (1985). These calculations indicated a GEP
stack height of 64 metres.
A range of stack heights around the GEP height (i.e., 50 - 75 metres) was then modelled using the U.S.
EPA's screening level dispersion model, SCREEN3. The screening level modelling indicates that the
optimal stack height, to minimize off-site impacts, is 60 metres. This corresponds closely to the GEP
height of 64 metres. Consequently, the final optimal stack height identified was 60 metres (Figure 5.12).
5.4.4.3 Effects on Ambient Air Quality
Detailed numerical air quality modelling was completed to predict the effect that plant emissions will
have on ground level concentrations of air pollutants in the airshed of the power station. The following
summary of the modelling is based on the detailed report provided in Appendix J2.
Ground-level concentrations of NO2 and PM,, were predicted using the U.S. EPA's recently developed
dispersion model known as AERMOD. AERMOD offers several advantages over previous models,
including better simulation of plume rise and buoyancy, dispersion around hills, effects of terrain
rouohness, and plume dispersion in both convective and stable boundary layers.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The modelling was undertaken for two scenarios. Scenario I assumes the plant will operating
continuously at 100% load with duct firing. Scenario 2 assumes that both turbines will operate
continuously at 50% load (in actual practice this scenario will occur rarely arnd only during start-up and
shutdown). These load situations are considered the worst-case scenarios as the mass flow rates for
pollutants of concem (NO, and PM,O) are at their highest (Figure 5.8). The calculation of background air
pollutant levels is provided in Appendix 17.
The modelling indicates that ground level concentrations of NO2 and PM,, will remain well within the
applicable guidelines and standards (Tables 5.12 and 5.13). During full load conditions (i.e., Scenario 1),
the maximum predicted contribution to 24-hr average ground level concentrations of NO2 is 9 pg/M3.
The total with background is 72 pg/m3, which is well below the World Bank guideline of 150 pg/in3. The
project's effect on the annual average concentrations of NO2 is also small, and is well below the applicable
guidelines and standards. In addition, PM,, concentrations are negligible and remain well below the
relevant guidelines.
Ground level concentrations will remain below the relevant guidelines and standards even if the power
station were to operate continuously with both turbines at 50% load (Scenario 2 in Tables 5.12 and 5.13).
In reality, the power station will rarely operate in this worst-case emission scenario, as described in
Section 5.4.4.1.

5.4.4.4   Cumulative Effects on Ambient Air Quality
Detailed modelling was completed to assess the cumulative effects on ambient air quality by the AES
Meghnaghat Power Station, as well as the phase II and III power stations (Appendix J2). The modelling
assumed that the phase II and III power stations would have emission characteristics identical to the AES
Meghnaghat project.
Two scenarios were analysed: Scenario 1 assumed continuous operation of all three plants at 100% load;
and Scenario 2 assumed that at each power station one turbine would operate continuously at 100% load
while one turbine would operate continuously at 50% load. Scenario 2 is considered a reasonable worst-
case situation and in actual practice is not expected to occur with any frequency, and certainly not
continuously for any extended period of time for reasons set out in Section 5.4.4.1.
Results from the modelling indicate that ground level concentrations of NO2 and PM,, will remain well
within the applicable guidelines and standards during operation of the three power stations (Tables 5.14
and 5.15). During full load conditions (i.e., Scenario 1) the maximum predicted contribution to 24-hr
average ground level concentrations of NO2 is 19 pg/m3 (Table 5.14). The total with background is 82
pg/M3, which is well below the World Bank guideline of 150 pg/M3. Effects on the annual average
concentrations of NO2 are similarly small, and are well below the relevant guidelines and standards. The
cumulative effect of the three power stations on ground level concentrations of PM,, levels are smaller
still, and are not considered to pose a significant concem.

5.4.4.5 Greenhouse Gas Contributions
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
The objective of the 1992 United Nations Fr-amewor-k Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to achieve
"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." All countries that ratify the Convention
agree to jointly assume responsibility for the protection of the global atmosphere, with the recognition
that developing country greenhouse gas emissions will exceed those from the industrialized nations
within the coming generations. The Convention took effect on March 21, 1994 and has been ratified by
over 100 of the 165 countries that are signatories. Bangladesh signed the Convention on June 9, 1992 and
ratified it on April 15, 2994. In Bangladesh, the Convention came into force on July 14, 1994.
As a Least-Developed Country (LDC) under the Convention, Bangladesh does not have any emission
restrictions. However, it does have obligations to measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions within
the country. According to the UNFCCC, Bangladesh has not instituted a National climate change website,
nor has greenhouse gas emissions data for Bangladesh been reported in the UNFCCC Greenhouse Gas
Inventory Database (United Nations, 2000).
Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, was
adopted on December 11, 1997. Over 84 countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, but Bangladesh is not
yet a signatory member. The Kyoto Protocol calls for industrialised countries to reduce their average
national greenhouse gas emissions to about 5% below 1990 levels by the year 2012. However, developing  v
and least-developed countries (including Bangladesh) are not required to limit their greenhouse gas
emissions.
The World Bank and Carbon Dioxide
The World Bank's guidance note, Greenhouise Gas Abatement and Climate Change, is included within the
Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (1998), and describes the World Bank's efforts in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The following three focal areas are identified: i) energy efficiency; ii)
renewable energy; and iii) mainstreaming of global environmental concems. The guidance note includes
a sumrnmary of relative emissions factors for utility and industrial combustion systems, including
combined cycle gas turbines.
Of all the alternatives listed in the guidance note, with the exception of wood-fired boilers, combined
cycle gas turbines offer the lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor. As in many places throughout
the World, wood is not a viable fuel source for large-scale electricity production in Bangladesh. Straw or
other biomass fuels might be available but again are not practical for large-scale electricity generation.
CO2 is a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels and currently there are no GOB, IDCOL, World
Bank, or ADB guidelines for CO2 emissions. However, the World Bank has published an emission factor
for natural gas fuels. Although not an emission guideline, the emission factor does provide an indication
of average relative CO2 emissions among varying technologies without taking into account combustion
efficiencies. For natural gas utilized in combined-cycle gas turbines, the World Bank emission factor for

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
CO2 is 56,100 g/GJ energy input. Natural gas to be utilized by the proposed power station has a
comparable CO2 emission factor of 59,177 g/GJ energy input at full load.
As discussed in the World Bank's handbook and in Appendix B, combined cycle systems typically
operate at higher efficiencies than conventional thermal power systems. This allows a greater amount of
electricity to be generated per unit of fuel used and thus, minimizes the volume of greenhouse gases
released per unit of electricity produced. The efficiency of the CCGT design, coupled with the use of
indigenous natural gas fuel, will result in the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions per unit of
electricity generated by the power station.
5.4.4.6 Afforestation Program and Greenbelt
The Bangladesh DOE, in its issuance of Site Clearance indicated that the Project Sponsor should address
"Afforestation" in the EIA, and that it should develop a greenbelt around the project site (Appendix El).
Afforestation Program
It is understood through additional personal communication with DOE that the afforestation condition of
approval refers to the planting of trees along local highways as a measure to help improve local air
quality. However, in Bangladesh, tree planting along highways is understood to be the responsibility of
the Roads and Highways Department and the Department of Forestry.
The Department of Forestry has established standard programs for roadside plantings. For example,
mahogany is considered a suitable roadside species and is planted at a density of 48 trees per km. The
Project Sponsor will discuss how it can contribute to the roadside planting efforts of the Department of
Forestry. Specifically, the Project Sponsor will suggest that it sponsor a tree-planting program for the
stretch of the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway between the Kanchpur Bridge on the Shitalakhya River and
the Meghna River Bridge near the project site.
Greenbelt
The DOE has indicated that the Project Sponsor should develop a greenbelt at the perimeter of the power
station. As discussed previously, there is sufficient land within- the project site to develop an attractive
greenbelt area. The greenbelt being developed will be compatible witlh site lines required for site security
and will assist not only with the absorption of CO2 emissions, but w%ill also soften the view of the power
station from ground level, improving the aesthetics of this industrial area.
Initially, 800 young trees will be planted along the southern and eastern boundaries of the project site as
part of the greenbelt plantings. As of September 2000, the Project Sponsor had planted 500 mahogany
trees along the eastern boundary of the project site; the remaining 300 trees will be planted by the
season's end.

5.4.5  Economic Dislocation
5.4.5.1   Meghnaghat Power Sites Area
In 1995, the Deputy Commissioner of Narayanganj District, for the BPDB, instituted eminent domain
proceedings to acquire 230.77 acres of land, comprising 145.515 acres of privately owned land and 85.255
acres of government land, under powers granted to him by the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable
Property Ordinance, 1982 (Ordinance) and subsequent amendments. This land area was acquired for the
MPSA on Char Ramzan Sonaullah, Sonargaon Thana, in the Narayanganj District. As per the Deputy
Comnissioner's property assessment under the 1982 Ordinance, the BPDB deposited Taka 55,694,474.83
in the Commissioner's public account on January 7, 1997, as the compensation for land, other properties,
and administrative fees, and requested the land be handed over to the BPDB. At that time, the
government also held some lands that were leased out to local persons for agricultural activities.
On May 14, 1997, the Deputy Comrnissioner formnally handed over possession of the 230.77 acres to the
BPDB. On September 2, 1997, the Deputy Commission further confirmed with the BPDB that since
compensation had been distributed to the affected people, and possession of the land had been
transferred to the BPDB, there was no legal restriction (barring DOE Site Clearance) to start construction
of the power stations.
However, the BPDB did not make any efforts to occupy the MPSA lands until March 1999, when
construction of the access road and site filling activities were initiated. Until March 1999, the former
private landowners and public leaseholders continued to cultivate the MPSA lands. As of the end of July
1999, approximately 85% of the compensation payments had been distributed with the remaining 15%
being withheld due to the fact that the true landowners could not be identified. A summary of land
acquisitions and compensation payments is shown in Table 5.16.

Building upon the initial compensation paid by the GOB on behalf of the BPDB to the project affected
peoples of the MPSA, the Project Sponsor prepared a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the
development of Phase I of the MPSA (Appendix K). The RAP sets out the Project Sponsor's plans to
provide further support to the project-affected persons, recognizing that the GOB may not have fully
compensated these individuals.

5.4.5.2   Project Site
According to the field surveys undertaken for this project, land acquisition and site filling activities for
Phase I of the MPSA have already affected approximately 544 households. The major resettlement
impacts identified in the Project Sponsor's RAP are summarised in Table 5.17 and are as follows:
1. Permnanent loss of 0.20 acres of homestead land by four households. This translates into the loss
of five dwellings, 12 trees, homestead crops (e.g., melons, squash, and gourds), and four latrines;
2. Permanent loss of 50.81 acres of privately-owned agricultural land (which includes 42.60 acres for
the power station, 6.49 acres for the access road, and 1.72 acres for Titas' RMS);
3. Permanent loss of access to 27.40 acres of government-owned land (khas), most of which was
leased out to cultivating households. The remaining portion was infonnally held by 25
households, comprised of a mix of influential people and squatters; and
4. Immediate loss of access to land and water resources by landowners, leaseholders, tenants,
renters (bandhakee), permanent field labour (bandha), and households involved in individual and
community fishing enterprises. Loss of such access had an immediate impact on the incomes of
these households, including incomes from the cultivation of crops, fruit, and fuel wood, care of
livestock, and fishing.

these numbers will be further verified and checked for accuracy and duplication.
Private Landholders
Private land lost forms part of the project site area (i.e., 51.01 acres which includes homestead lands).
Specifically, 78 plots have been identified on the project site, 23 on the RMS site, and 69 plots cross the
access road area for a total of 170 plots held by 196 title holders. The demised corridor (i.e., cooling water
channel) affected no private land holdings.
Immovable Properties
It was found in the baseline surveys that a small nurnber of immovable properties were affected by the
development of the project site, which included five structures, four latrines, and 12 trees. As the BPDB
had already taken possession of the site land, and their contractor, CWHEC, was carrying out site filling
works thereon, baseline surveys did not locate any dwellings, trees, or latrines on the project site.
At the time of survey, all four of the dislocated households had relocated in the nearby villages of
Islampur, Islampur Adarsha Gram, and Ganganagar.  Two of the households had resettled in
Ganganagar, one was found living on unauthorized khas land in Islampur Adarsha Gram, while the last
family was living with relatives in Islampur. To the extent possible, the households had relocated their
houses and other infrastructures onto their new homestead lands.

Public Leaseholders
The BPDB has paid the GOB for 27.40 acres of land to form Phase I of the MPSA. Specifically, 45 plots
have been identified on the project site with an additional 10 plots crossing the demised corridor. This
creates a total of 55 plots leased by 45 leaseholders. The access road and RMS do not affect public land
holdings. Initial compensation has been paid by the GOB to these project-affected peoples.
Loss of Livelihood
Approximately 283 households have lost more than 50°% of their annual income due to site preparation
and site filling works. Specifically, loss of livelihood, related to the development of the project site, has
affected five groups: leaseholder households; agricultural wage labour; sharecroppers; individual and
community fisherfolk; and unauthorised holders of Khas land. This group will be provided with
appropriate vocational skills training to compensate for loss of livelihood and/or be recommended for
priority jobs during the construction phase.
Others
Titas is responsible for the acquisition of the easement required for the natural gas pipeline. Titas will
acquire this easement through the Deputy Commissioner at Narayanganj, and will make compensation to
the affected landowners as entitled under Bangladesh law.
The designated pipeline land, generally adjacent to the access road, is currently used for cultivation
during the dry season only. As the pipeline is of linear construction, the landowners who will be affected
will mainly be those affected by construction of the MPSA access road, but it is expected that they will
only be marginally affected as most work could be overlapped with the existing easement.
The PGCB is responsible for the acquisition of the right-of-ways (ROW) for the electrical transmission line
that will interconnect the power station to the existing 230 KV substations at Haripur and Comilla North.
Since development capital is being provided by the ADB for the transmission line, the PGCB will be
subject to the ADB's environmental and social policies and guidelines. These policies are expected to be
sufficient to address the land compensation issues expected to arise as part of development of these lines.
5.4.5.3 Entitlement Framework
In addition to the compensation distributed by the BPDB for the MPSA lands acquired under Bangladesh
Law, the Project Sponsor will provide supplemental programs and facilities via the RAP that is within
their Social Responsibility Programme budget. These items include:
access to construction jobs: the Project Sponsor will ask the Construction Contractor to first hire
qualified PAPs based upon the identification card system to be implemented by the Project
Sponsor. The ID card will be issued to those households losing 20% or more of their income as
a result of the project or whose annual income falls below the poverty line;

v vocational skills training: the Project Sponsor will secure funds within their Social Responsibility
Programnrme to ensure skills training for project affected households losing 20% or more of their
family income or whose annual income falls below the poverty line. One member per
household would be eligible for the training program;
*    elementany school construction: the Project Sponsor will construct an elementary school in the
Village of Islampur;
village road constrmction: the Project Sponsor will provide financial assistance for construction of
an earthen access road to the Village of Islampur; and
hospital construction: the Project Sponsor will also construct a land based or floating hospital that
is equipped with primary health care and treatment facilities. It is expected that preference will
be given to a floating hospital so that it may service a wider area.
The various PAPs that have been identified as eligible for the above programs include: agricultural wage
labourers, sharecroppers, fisherfolk (both individual and community), private landowners, leaseholders,
and unauthorised PAPs on govemrnment land. The underlying objective of these programs is provide the
affected groups with skills necessary to find jobs in the burgeoning industrial centre at Meglnaghat.
5.4.5.4 Implementation Costs
Not including any admninistrative costs, the direct costs associated with the implementation of the RAP
for MPSA Phase I works, within the responsibility of the Project Sponsor, are shown in Table 5.18. At the
time of writing, it is anticipated that Project Sponsor will spend US$1,220,000 on the programs and
facilities described in section 5.4.5.3.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
The mitigation and monitoring actions proposed to avoid cr minimize impacts during construction and
operation of the power station were identified in Section 5 of this EIA Report. This section presents the
specific plan for implementing the mitigation and monitoring requirements within the framework of an
Environmental Action Plan (EAP). The following principles were used to guide the preparation of the
EAP:
*  focus on occupational health, safety, and environment risk prevention;
* affordable, safe technologies are used wherever failure of equipment would have a significant
effect on safety, health, or the environment;
* conformance with relevant standards, codes, and practices will be considered in the application
of the safe technologies;
*  all activities will be performed in a safe and effective manner and all equipment will be
maintained in good operating conditions for the protection of health and safety of all persons and
the conservation of the environment and property;
X all necessary precautions are carried out to control, remove, or otherwise correct any hazardous
materials leaks and/or spills, or other health and safety hazards; and
a construction of the power station will meet relevant international standards which ensure
sufficient technical levels of safety.
At the time this EIA was completed certain detailed planning and design activities were still to be
completed. Thus, this section describes the EAP at the level of detail available at the time of writing.
When the detailed actives are completed, they will be integrated within the framework of the EAP and an
update prepared by the Project Sponsor. Currently, the EAP address the following key components:
management activities and systems;
plans, procedures, and programs;
monitoring activities;
*   implementation schedule and cost estimate; and
*   plans for integrating the EAP within the overall development plan for the project.
6.1 Environmental Management
The Project Sponsor is committed to constructing and operating the power station in an environmentally
responsible manner and in compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and
guidelines. The Project Sponsor will adopt an environmental policy that states the principles and
intentions of the enterprise in relation to its overall environmental performance. Such principles and
intentions will be communicated to each employee as well as the nature of their individual
environmental responsibilities. Where appropriate, staff training will be undertaken to ensure their
continued environmental performance.



AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The Project Sponsor is also conmnitted to the creation and implementation of programs to reduce the   2
probability of occurrence of deleterious environmental incidents. As required, contingency plans will be
developed for dealing with such adverse incidents, should they occur.
The Project Sponsor will expect the same level of environmental performance from its agents, suppliers,
and contractors and will stipulate this in any legally binding agreements it enters with these parties.
The Project Sponsor will also ensure that appropriate corporate resources, personnel and reporting and
accountability systems, are in place for the successful implementation of the EAP. They will, on a
continuing basis, review the objectives of the EAP as well as the company's success in achieving them.
Where objectives are not being achieved corrective action will be taken. The EAP objectives will also be
modified over the life of the project, as appropriate, to reflect changing environmental laws, regulations,
standards, and technologies.
6.2 Plans, Procedures, and Programs
As part of the EAP objectives outlined above, several plans, procedures, and programs will be developed.
They will guide all stages of project construction, operation, and deconummissioning so that the
environmental performance of the power station is optimized. The following sections present an
overview of the plans, procedures, and programs that will be developed for the power station.
6.2.1  Resettlement Action Plan
The Project Sponsor will implement the RAP as discussed in Section 5 and detailed in Appendix K. For
reference, the RAP was finalized following the public consultations that were completed on the findings
of the Draft EIA. Where revisions are required, based upon lending agency conmnents, they will be
incorporated into the RAP. The RAP has been designed to ensure that certain groups of project-affected
persons receive training to assist in compensating them for losses of income and of structures directly
related to development of Phase I of the MPSA.
6.2.2 Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan
Specific elements of the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP), described in Section 7, extend
beyond the timeframe of the EIA. The Project Sponsor will carry out such elements based upon the
schedule set out in the PCDP.
6.2.3 Emergency Response Plan
During pre-operational mobilization the Project Sponsor will develop an Emergency Response Plan (ERP)
for the operational activities. The manual will be based upon existing manuals that have been developed
for other power stations owned and operated by the AES Corporation worldwide, including the AES
Haripur Power Project in Bangladesh.

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
J      The ERP will address, among other things: a Chemical and Petroleum Spills Contingency Plan (e.g.,
chemical handling, storage, and spill management); a Natural Hazards Management Plan (e.g., cyclones
and flooding); civil unrest; and fire and explosions.
6.2.4 Health, Safety, and Environmental Procedures
The Construction Contractor has in their Construction Contract commnitted to the health and safety
procedures as outlined in their Safety, Health, and Environment Policy and Procedures Manual (Appendix F).
The procedures will be revised to include the additional procedures set out in Table 5.2 of this report.
The Project Sponsor will operate the power station and will be responsible for the development of Health,
Safely, and Environmental Procedures Manuals for both construction and operational activities. The manuals
will be based upon existing documents that have been developed for other combined cycle power
stations owned and operated by the AES Corporation worldwide, including those approved for the AES
Haripur Power Project in Bangladesh.
A summary occupational health and safety handbook will be created and supplied to every operations
employee to promote on-the-job safety and environmental performance. Once the manual and handbook
are finalised, and where required, they will be forwarded to the appropriate reviewing agencies.
6.2.5 Operation and Maintenance Program
* During pre-operational mobilization the Project Sponsor will develop a Plant Operation and Maintenance
Program for op5erational activities. The program will be based on existing programs that have been
developed for other power stations owned and operated by the AES Corporation worldwide, including
the AES Haripur Power Project in Bangladesh.
This program will cover predictive/preventive maintenance, routine maintenance, annual overhauling,
inspection of equipment and vessels, the procurement of spare parts, and maintenance of optimum
inventory levels in order to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital costs. It will also include
a schedule for regular inspections of vehicles and equipment, sanitary facilities, and waste collection,
containment, and disposal facilities. If appropriate, this program will also include measures for the
periodic inspection of the access road and its drainage culverts.
The regular maintenance that will occur through the Plant Operation and Maintenance Program will
optimize the operating condition of equipment, thereby, ensuring that production and emission of
pollutants are mininised.
6.2.6 Staff Training Program
The Project Sponsor will develop a trainin-g program to ensure power station staff receive training
appropriate to irnplement the Emergenicy Response Plan, the Health, Safety, and Enviroiiinental Procedures,
and the Plant Operations and Maintenance Program, as appropriate.



AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Training will begin as the initial staff complement is hired during the pre-operational mobilization
period. There will also be ongoing training and specific training for new-hires. Graduated testing and
certification by supervisors and the operations manager will ensure that all trainees perform at an
acceptable level prior to being assigned a position.
Various equipment suppliers will supplement the staff training program while they are available at the
project site during pre-commissioning and commissioning. They will provide training for plant start-up,
shutdown, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The training will cover the gas turbines, compressors,
steam turbine, boiler, water treatment, switchgear, distributed control system, analyser, and other
specialized instruments.
The Project Sponsor will develop the staff training program that will be implemented by the Construction
Contractor under their supervision.
6.3 Monitoring
Environmental monitoring, which started with the collection of primary background data as part of the
EIA study, will continue with appropriate follow-up activities during operation. The monitoring will
provide data on key environmental, social, and occupational health and safety aspects and on the
effectiveness of mitigation measures implemented as part of this project. The monitoring procedures
noted here directly link to the impacts and the mitigation measures discussed in Section 5. This section
sets out in specific detail the key aspects of the Project Sponsor's monitoring program.
The Project Sponsor will implement the monitoring and follow-up programs summarized in Table 6.1.
Additional details of the programs are set out in the following subsections. Once a year, or at shorter
intervals if required by the regulatory agencies and project lenders, a summary of the monitoring
information will be submitted to the DOE, IDCOL, and the ADB. The compilation of the report will be the
task of the person(s) nominated by the Project Sponsor to be in charge of environmental issues. The
report will follow the format of the form provided as Appendix L3.

6.3.1  NO, Emissions
NO, emissions will be measured in each stack on a routine basis during start-up, shutdown, and
operation at low loads (i.e., when any gas turbine is operating at 50% load or less). This emission
monitoring will be conducted for the first quarter after plant commissioning and on an intermittent basis
every year following the U.S. EPA Method 7 [40 CFR Part 60 (Appendix A)] or equivalent. Samples will
be collected by a probe installed in the stack and analysed for NOx by colorimetry and other techniques in
the laboratory.
6.3.2 Ambient Air Quality
A monitoring program will be carried out to measure ground level concentrations of NO2 in the airshed
of the power station for the first 6 months of operations. This monitoring program will be implemented
prior to power station start-up to confirm baseline conditions, and will be carried out at a minimum of
three locations: one being at the project site and two being in areas where worst-case effects are
anticipated. Suggested monitoring locations are the Villages of Dhudghata, Tangarchar, and/or
Sonargaon. Final locations will be determined during the detailed design phase.
Twenty-four hour samples would be collected once every three days (for a total of 10 per month) at each
monitoring station. At each station one-month averages would also be collected. The monitoring
program will utilise passive sampling devices available from the Canadian based Maxxam Laboratories,
or equivalent. These passive devices are capable of successfully monitoring 24-hour concentrations. The
monitoring program should use good sampling procedures including use of replicates, travel blanks, and
field blanks.
In addition, the monitoring program will make provisions for collecting or purchasing the following
meteorological parameters from the vicinity of the MPSA: wind speed, wind direction, temperature,
humidity and cloud cover.
6.3.3 Noise Emissions
Noise monitoring should be scheduled to commence with the start of power station testing at full load
and at two other times throughout the first year of operation. The monitoring should take place at the
locations were background noise monitoring was completed (see Appendix jl) and the program should
be designed to collect the maximum hourly Leq value that occurs during the day and during the night
using an integrating type I noise level meter. The program should be designed to distinguish between
noise generated by the power station and noise generated from background sources. The measurements
at each location should be completed over a minimum 24-hour period.
The monitoring should be repeated following any major overhauls that might affect noise emissions, but
not less than once every 12 months.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
6.3.4 River Morphology
There have been concems that the project may alter the pattern of river flow and river morphology due to
dredging activities, river scour, and thermal discharges. Where feasible, the Project Sponsor will co-
ordinate with the SWMC, BIWTA, BWDB, and the BPDB to monitor river flow and scour patterns in the
Meghna River. Such monitoring activities will not be the prime responsibility of the Project Sponsor,
however, they will assist in such monitoring, as reasonable, when asked by these agencies. As owner and
leasor of the project site, BPDB was responsible for development of the project site and maintenance of
the embankment protection works along the Meghna River and all other sides of the project site.
6.3.5 Ambient River Temperature
During the public review of the project, concerned was raised over the ambient river water temperatures
referenced in the EIA report. To assist the Project Sponsor in their monitoring efforts, that is to
continually examine the potential effects that increasing ambient river water temperatures may have on
the power station's preformance, testing will be undertaken using a temperature probe during both
construction and operation as outlined in Table 6.1.
6.3.6 Cooling Water
Should cooling water be discharged via the open channel, effluent temperature will be measured at the
point of discharge (see Table 6.1), on a quarterly basis. Monitoring of surface water temperature will also
be undertaken in the area of the mixing zone as defined by the thermal plume model. A temperature
probe will be utilized to map the location of the mixing zone on a quarterly basis (incorporating worst-
case periods) following the start of commercial operations. Worst-case conditions are expected to occur
during February to April when net river flow is at a minimum.
Monitoring will also occur during extraordinary circumstances, such as when the power station is
operating in steam turbine bypass mode. To aid in defining low net flow periods, on a monthly basis the
power station manager will obtain data regarding water levels from relevant Bangladesh authorities such
as BWDB.
6.3.7 Effluent Quality
On a quarterly basis throughout the life of the project, grab samples of undiluted effluent will be taken
for laboratory analyses of total suspended solids, oil and grease, chlorine, chromium (total), copper, iron,
and zinc, while temperature, dissolved oxygen content, pH, and conductivity will be measured in the
field. Sampling would also be completed following any spills, plant upsets, or other events that could
affect effluent quality.

6.3.8  Fisheries
During power station construction, and for the first three years thereafter, the Project Sponsor will
undertake a fisheries survey in the inmmediate vicinity of the power station. Assisted by specialized
personnel from Dhaka University, or other reputed institutes, in-water surveys will be completed to
determine specific species compositions within 500 metres upstream and downstream of the project site.
Various methods of survey are available (Table 6.1), with the most available and appropriate methods
ultimately selected by the Project Sponsor's study team.
6.3.9 Vegetation Growth
The Project Sponsor, in conjunction with the Department of Forestry, will carry out by-annual site
inspections during the first five years of operation on the success and growth of any trees planted as part
of the Afforestation Program (section 5.4.4.6). Where trees have been damaged or ultimately die off, the
Project Sponsor in consultation with the Department of Forestry will replant an alternative species to
maintain the CO2 offset created by the initial planting.
6.3.10 Social Concerns
The procedures for monitoring of resettlement issues are specified in the RAP (Appendix K). The Project
Sponsor will also be responsible for reporting on ongoing consultation activities and results as part of its
annual reporting requirements as detailed in the PCDP (Chapter 7) and tracking of other PAP issues as
they arise. Where appropriate, the Project Sponsor will implement a complaint tracking procedure with
the suimmary results provided on a monthly basis to the plant/environmental manager(s).
Formal and informal public consultations were undertaken as part of MEP's 1997 EIA report. At that
time, the residents of Ganganagar and Islampur were also able to express their concerns regarding the
conceptual development of the MPSA. Their concerns are described in Section 7.4.2, however, most
residents elected to continue their residency in the villages despite the proposed development of the
MPSA.
Additional meetings were held during September and October 1999 to supplement and complete Phase I
of the PCDP. Both formal and informal consultation techniques were utilized during activities held with
governmental organizations, NGOs, and local PAPs. A description of the key issues identified by the
stakeholders is set out in Section 7.4.4.
Following similar implementation techniques utilized during the Phase I consultations the Phase II of the
PCDP was carried out based upon the findings of the draft EIA report during the period from April to
July 2000. A description of the stakeholder's key issues is provided in Section 7.4.5.

6.3.11  Occupational Health and Safety
The Project Sponsor will implement an internal incident tracking and corrective action program to
monitor any incidents that may OCCUT at the power station. The details of the monitoring and corrective
action mechanisms will be set out in the Health, Safety, and Environmental ProcedLures for the power station,
which will be prepared during the detailed design phase.

Implementation of the EAP will occur sirnultaneously with the planning and development of the power
station. Specific responsibilities to carryout the various programs and plans of the EAP will be assigned
to project personnel and an accountable management system established. Management will also provide
the essential resources for the EAP to be implemented.
An  environmental compliance manual will be prepared  which  clearly  states the environmental
responsibilities of the Project Sponsor. Ensuring environmental compliance will primarily be the
responsibility of the SHM and Plant Manager. The SHM's responsibilities will include the overall co-
ordination of the environmental issues during construction. The SHM  will also be responsible for the
implementation of mitigation measures, monitoring programs, supervision of personnel and monitoring
laboratories, and reporting the results within the company and to the relevant authorities during the
operational life of the power station.
Contractors will be responsible and accountable for the actions of their company and employees. These
responsibilities will be incorporated into the contract documents consistent with the recornmendations of
the EAP.

7. PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
For this project, public consultation and information disclosure activities were undertaken based upon
the public consultation and disclosure plan (Appendix MI) and in accordance with the applicable
regulatory guidelines. The public consultation and disclosure plan (PCDP) was irnplemented using a
phased approach that involved a wide spectrum of stakeholders.
Consistent with current consultation and disclosure techniques, the PCDP and this section of the EIA
outline various methods and techniques to facilitate meaningful consultation with the project
stakeholders, including formal and informnal meetings, courtesy calls, in-field contact, and surveys of
project affected villages and groups in a culturally appropriate manner.
The identification of stakeholders, conceptual design consultations, and Phase I consultations were
undertaken by Mott MacDonald. A summary of all completed and planned public consultation and
information disclosure activities are shown below:

completed to date as well as the planned future consultation and disclosure steps that will be undertaken
following submission of this final EIA report to project lenders and regulators.
7.1 Defining the Terms
Public Consultation
Public consultation is a tool for initiating and managing communications among the Project Sponsor,
project stakeholders, and other project affected persons. It provides an avenue for the reviewing agencies,
lending institutions, and the Project Sponsor to improve their decision-making capabilities, while
fostering an environment of understanding by actively involving organizations, groups, and individuals
directly affected or involved in the project.
Consulting with project stakeholders involves those persons or groups who have the ability to influence
the project's outcome. Early identification of these groups, especially those stakeholders who are poor or
marginalized, is essential to generating good consultation results.

FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Information Disclosure
Effective consultation is driven in part by adequate and culturally appropriate disclosure of information
to project stakeholders in a timely fashion (i.e., in the local language and before irreversible project
decisions are made). Disclosure of information is critical if project stakeholders are to have meaningful
input and participation in the decision-making process. Exchange of information will also allow project
stakeholders to better understand the trade-offs between project benefits and disadvantages and, if
executed properly, can facilitate a greater trust in their new corporate neighbour (IFC, 1998).
7.2 Regulatory Context
The consultation and disclosure activities have been developed and carried out to address the following
regulatory requirements and guidelines:
*  EIA Guidelines for Industries, DOE, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of the
People's Republic of Bangladesh, June 1997; Section 4.11, Public Participation.
*  Environmental and Social Framework, IDCOL, Dhaka, Bangladesh, May 1997; Annex 8, Public
Consultation and Consensus Building.
*  Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook, the World Bank, 1998; Part 11, Public Consultation.
*  Environmental Assessment Requiremnents and Environmental Review  Procedures of the Asian
Development Bank, ADB Office of the Environment, 1993; Appendix 3, Public Involvement.
*  Handbookfor the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects, ADB Social Dimensions Unit, 1994.
The following subsections summarize the requirements of the DOE, IDCOL, and ADB as set out in the
documents listed above.
7.2.1 Bangladesh DOE Guidelines
In June 1997, the DOE, under the purview of the MEF, issued the EIA Guidelinesfor Industries. The general
requirements for public participation as set out in the guidelines are:
...an EIA study should involve the public as part of the decision-making process....To
achieve effective public participation, it is necessary to comnmunicate with as many
people as possible, as early as possible, and through as many different ways as possible.
This requires pre-planning, resources, identification of target groups, and a variety of
techniques for effective conimunication. [Section 4.11]
The guidelines do not provide any specific guidance on consultation or disclosure methods or timing.
7.2.2 IDCOL Guidelines
The public consultation and disclosure requirements of IDCOL are set out in their ESF (Appendix E4).
The ESF adapts World Bank Group guidelines for IDCOL projects, but emphasises this in a context first
of awareness building followed by consensus building:

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MECHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
(i) awareness building: the provision to the affected communities of information regarding project
activities, likely impacts, and possible mitigation measures. At this stage, the stakeholders can be
commnunicated with through a variety of methods, including small group discussions, public
meetings, and reviews of the environmental and social assessment activities.
(ii) assessment of perceptions: a directed effort to record the views of the commnunity about the project,
its impacts, and options to mitigate such impacts.
(iii) building consensus: a stage where major disagreements that may emerge in stage two can be
addressed. Should such disagreements occur, efforts should be made to resolve them amicably
through negotiated agreements. Less important unresolved issues should be documented.
(iv) finalisation of agreements: the final stage, where agreements are translated into commitments and
an allocation of responsibilities, together with agreements to provide resources, if required.
IDCOL, through the World Bank guidelines, directs project sponsors to consult with relevant
stakeholders, including affected groups, non-govermnental organisations (NGO's), and local authorities
regarding the environmental and social aspects of the project, and take their views into account (World
Bank, 1998). The World Bank also recommends that preparation of the PCDP should define a technically
sound and culturally appropriate approach to public consultation and disclosure of information about
the project.
7.2.3  Asian Development Bank Guidelines
The ADB has no official guidelines for the inclusion of a PCDP, however, they do advocate public
consultation. In their Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects (1994), they encourage the
use of key informant interviews, group interviews, workshops, and rapid reconnaissance surveys to
gather information from villagers, government officials, farmers, women, and vulnerable groups on local
environmental and social conditions. The ADB feels that these opinions are crucial to the overall project
success.
The Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures of the Asian Development
Bank (1993b) is another relevant ADB document that outlines how public involvement can be
incorporated into the EIA process.
7.3 Consultation and Disclosure Methodology
When developing a methodology for public consultation and information disclosure it is important to
understand the extent to which stakeholders may be interested in the project; based on their perceptions
and concems (Petts, 1999). Interested stakeholders may include those who:
*  are affected by spatial proximity to the proposed project;
*  are economnically affected by the proposed project;
*  feel the project threatens their culture or traditions; and
*  believe their values are challenged by the proposed project (Creighton, 1981).

MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Another objective of the methodology must be to develop a representative understanding of people's
view%s about the area in which they live, community characteristics and environmental resources that are
important to them, and the extent to which they have knowledge about certain issues. Additionally,
special considerations may be required to facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples, those who
pursue traditional lifestyles, or those who constitute a miinority (Canter and Sadler, 1997).
Since many of the issues addressed within an EIA are of public concem, or are matters that would benefit
from public review and conmnent, a procedural framework that facilitates public participation and input
is required. Such a framework must also contain mechanisms to monitor consultation and disclosure
activities on a continuous basis during construction and operation activities.
Building upon the various methodological objectives and the applicable regulatory requirements, the
following consultation and disclosure methodology was developed and implemented for this project
(Figure 7.1). Where possible, the methodology conforms to traditional Bengali mechanisms for
consensual consultation and local decision-making.

The consultation and disclosure methodology utilised several techniques to communicate and exchange
infornation with project stakeholders, which included:
*  informal, small group discussions with stakeholders during field activities;
• group meetings with women stakeholders;
*  community/village meetings at Islampur and Ganganagar;

* meetings with regional political and administrative leadership;
* courtesy calls on NGOs, local corporations, and other interested parties;
* an EIA workshop; and
* socio-economic surveys of adjacent villages.
In all cases a contact record was kept of those attending each meeting in addition to the meeting minutes.
The project minutes record questions and concerns expressed by meeting attendees and the answers
provided by the Project Sponsor and/or its representative. The resulting documentation is used as a tool
to help identify commnunity perceptions and concerns.
7.4 Results of Consultation and Disclosure
Based upon the consultation and disclosure phases presented in Figure 7.1, the following subsections
describe each phase of the methodology as well as the relevant information obtained during the
consultation and disclosure process.
7.4.1 Stakeholder Identification
Stakeholder identification is generally undertaken to determine who will be affected by the project (i.e.,
project affected persons) and who can contribute to the decision-making process (e.g., non-governmental
organisations). Additionally, special techniques may be required to facilitate the involvement of
disadvantaged persons and/or gender groups.
Provisional Stakeholders
Although there was no explicit methodology given in the 1997 EIA report (i.e., conceptual design phase)
related to stakeholder identification, provisional stakeholders were identified and included:
Islampur villagers;
Ganganagar villagers,
Dhudghata villagers;
the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies;
World Conservation Union; and
*    Department of Environment.
Current Stakeholders
Identification of project stakeholders is an ongoing process and consequently the list will be refined
during each phase of the process. The current list of project stakeholders and their stake in the project are
shown in Table 7.1. This table has been created as working inventory, to be utilized by the Project
Sponsor and associated project representatives throughout the entire consultation and disclosure process.

7.4.2 Conceptual Design (1997 EIA Report)
Public consultation and information disclosure during the conceptual design of the project were
undertaken to ensure that strategic project decisions avoided major environmental and social risks while
optimizing project benefits. Public participation and input received during this stage of project
development were useful mechanisms for assisting with preliminary determinations related to site
selection, infrastructure requirements, production capacities, and process designs.
Based upon the findinigs of the 1995 PSMP, the MPSA was identified as a top ranked site for development
of three new private sector power stations to be developed in three phases (Acres, 1995). Consequently,
an EIA Report (1997), containing both formal and informal consultations and information disclosure
mechanisms, was undertaken based upon a conceptual project design (Appendix M2). A summary of the
provisional stakeholders' (identified above) perceptions and concerns is provided below.
IUCN                      *  the MPSA is not covered by any wetland areas or other protected areas
* use of natural gas fuel versus coal fuel should be considered
BCAS                      *  study should be seen as a model for other power developments
* highlight the fact that an EIA is being undertaken
Village of Islampur       .  village should not be shifted and people did not want to be relocated
* adequate compensation should be provided to each landowner whose
land is to be taken as part of development of the MPSA
* would be pleased if jobs could be provided and other "bonus"
compensatory measures such as supply of running water, renovation of
the mosque, access to site medical facilities, and supply of electricity
would be viewed as a net benefit
Village of Ganganaga1     .  major issue was that of compensation for land being taken - adequate
compensation package be developed
* additional requests included jobs for village persons, a new school be
constructed in the village, and renovation of the village mosque

Village of Dhudghata   .  generally in favour of the project provided an adequate compensation
package was provided
The 1997 EIA Report included a two-tiered list of recornmendations, which were:
minimum requirement:
*  the project should assure Islampur villagers that they will not be resettled or relocated;
* the project should provide an adequate compensation package;
•  the project should provide jobs during construction for at least one member per family for those
families whose land is being taken away; and
• the project should provide jobs during construction for others from nearby villages.
additional beneCfits
*  the project should provide running water for the villages of Islampur and Ganganagar;
* the project should provide some street lighting for the villages of Islampur and Ganganagar;
* the project should provide access to site medical facilities for the residents of Islampur and
Ganganagar;
* the project should construct a primary school for children for these two villages; and
:  the project should renovate the two existing mosques at these villages.
Tlhe stakeholder perceptions and concems, and the 1997 EIA Report recomrnendations, represented the
starting point for development of the PCDP for the specific project design. These recommendations have
been reviewed as part of the detailed project planning process and were addressed during Phase II
consultations.
7.4.3 Planning for Public Consultation and Disclosure
A PCDP was developed by Mott MacDonald in July 1999 in order to bring continuity to the consultation
and disclosure process, avoiding confusion among the project stakeholders (Appendix Ml).
Subsequently, the PCDP and the results generated by it to date have been used to guide the consultation
and disclosure section of the EAP as discussed in Section 6. Where appropriate, the EAP will be updated
by the Project Sponsor based upon the outcome of future consultation and disclosure activities.
Contact Vectors
Public contact at the MPSA initially occurred as a consequence of orientation visits to the project site by
government officials, the Project Sponsor, and other interested parties. Representatives from the
following groups have visited the project site in the period from 1996 through to August 2000, having
contact with local persons and groups:

*  Development Planners and Consultants (Bangladesh based environmental consultancy);
*  Development Design Consultants, Ltd. (Bangladesh based land surveyor); and
*  Mott MacDonald, formerly Mott Ewbank Preece (U.K. based environmental consultancy).
These site visits were to appraise the MPSA for multiple power station development and to review
potential environmental and social issues associated with development of Phase I of the MPSA. During
the site visits, the groups have come into contact with interested or curious local people and dialogues
about the project have resulted. While these dialogues were not part of a structured PCDP, they served to
impart general information about the project to local people and have helped form local perceptions
about the project.
7.4.4 Phase I Consultations
o         Phase I consultations were undertaken in July, August, and September 1999 following award of the Phase
I project at the MPSA to the Project Sponsor by the BPDB. Various stakeholders were identified and
consulted, based upon the works undertaken during the conceptual design stage, including the IUCN,
BCAS, DOE, the District Cornmissioner of the Narayanganj District, Sonargaon Thana Land
Commissioner, and the Chairman of Pirozpur Union Parishad, among others (Appendix M3).
The key issues identified by the project stakeholders during Phase I consultation activities included:
*  concerns regarding the land acquisition process;
•  interest in developing a market centre on the toe of the char;
•  potential emissions impacts (i.e., air, noise, and thermal);
*  potential for nearby industry to expand and employ additional persons should a stable supply of
electricity be provided (e.g., Apparel Ltd. could employ an additional 200 person half of whom
could be female and Meghna PET Industries could employ an additional 150 male workers);
•  health and safety risks associated with gas explosion;
*  effects on the existing fisherv;
*  impact of dredging on the geology and flow stability of the river, downstream erosion, and local
ecology; and
•  public participation and interaction are key components.

7.4.5  Phase ll Consultations
The second phase of public consultations was carried out following the completion and public circulation
of the draft EIA report. Prior to comnmencement of Phase ll PCDP activities, the Project Sponsor prepared
an executive summary of the EIA report's findings (Appendix M4) and disseminated it to project
stakeholders. The project team also prepared a Project Brochure in Bangla for distribution at the village
meetings and a Fact Sheet for distribution at the National Workshop (Appendix M4).
During development of the draft EIA and Phase I consultations, several mechanisms were identified to
best solicit public comment on the project during Phase II activities, including:
* mouza meeting at Dhudghata village for project-affected-persons;
# women's meeting at Dhudghata village;
* meeting for regional stakeholders in Sonargaon Thana;
* national workshop on the EIA in Dhaka city for project stakeholders; and
* courtesy calls as necessary on district and national representatives not otherwise brought into the
discussions on the EIA.
Building upon these suggested consultation mechanisms, various meetings and discussions were held
with other project stakeholders during the course of the second phase of PCDP, and included:
* village meeting with the inhabitants of Islampur (April 25, 2000);
* village meeting with the inhabitants of Kurbanpur (April 26, 2000);
*  village meeting with the inhabitants of Kurbanpur (May 9, 2000);
*  village meeting with the inhabitants of Islampur (May 10, 2000);                              e
* village meeting with the inhabitants of Ganganagar (May 12, 2000);
# village meeting with the women of Kurbanpur (May 15, 2000);
: village meeting with the women of Ganganagar (May 17,2000);
* village meeting with the inhabitants of Panchani (May 19, 2000);
* regional meeting with local and area elites and other PAPs at Pirojpur Union Parishad office
(une 13, 2000); and
*  a national workshop in Dhaka for project stakeholders Uuly 3, 2000).
A record of those persons and groups attending each meeting was kept by the project team. In addition,
meeting minutes recorded the questions and concerns expressed by the participants and the answers
provided by the Project Sponsor's representatives (Appendix M5).
The key issues identified by the project stakeholders during Phase II consultation activities included:
*  BPDB access road: the fenced access road to the MPSA has blocked previously existing field
equipment, livestock, and human transportation pathways and has increased vehicular traffic
volumes where there once was none. These factors have made it difficult for young children to
get to school.
* water logging: development of the access road has lead to increase water logging on lands that
were previously dry during the growing season. This has reduced crop productivity and affected
planting practices.

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
*  sand transport: site filling activities, with no subsequent vegetative cover, has resulted in sand
blowing off the MPSA, affecting both local food and water resources for human consumption.
Sand transport off-site has also affected the productivity of the adjacent lands.
* site filling: during this activity the BPDB filled lands beyond those they officially acquired
resulting in additional land losses to those immediately adjacent to the MPSA site boundaries.
* labour. since the MPSA has been acquired and filled by the BPDB, local persons have lost access
to agricultural labour jobs, which has in tum affected their personal incomes.
* housing: it was noted that four houses and one structure had been relocated/lost due to the
acquisition of the MPSA lands.
* river bank erosion: at the village of Islampur, there was concern about bank erosion associated
with dredging and the subsequent slide of the village into the river.
* shrimp "nala": it was suggested that the small, back river channel north of the project site,
currently closed as a result of the access road, be reopened to re-establish shrimp catches in this
area.
* compensation: it was claimed that the compensation paid by the GOB was low. Consequently,
many of those affected by the acquisition and filling of the MPSA had experienced a substantial
decline in their quality of life. This was directly linked to a loss of income they had experienced
due to BPDB activities.
• local improvements: it was suggested that the Project Sponsor undertake construction of two
primary schools - one at Islampur and the other at Kurbanpur. It was suggested that local road
improvements be established to increase the accessibility to the various villages affected by the
MPSA.
Although most of the issues raised during the Phase II consultation process are the result and
responsibility of the BPDB, the Project Sponsor has committed to undertaking various follow-up and
supplementary activities, which are shown in Table 7.2.

7.4.6 Construction Phase Consultations
During construction of the power station, the Project Sponsor is planning to continue to receive advice
from the project stakeholders through the CLO. The CLO will serve as a point of contact between the
Project Sponsor and the local communities and function as a channel to communicate local concerns to
the Project Sponsor during the construction period. The CLO will also be involved with consultations on
possible solutions to remedy any issues that may arise.
Phase I, and Phase II consultation and disclosure activities have provided specific contact points and
persons in the project area that will be useful for the CLO. The CLO will also take responsibility for
working with any NGO's and community groups that bring project related issues before the Project
Sponsor.
7.4.7 Operation Phase Consultations
The Project Sponsor will continue its contact with project stakeholders through the CLO during the initial
period of operation and for as long as this seems an effective two-way channel for conmmunication. By
this time, as a long-term presence in the locality, the Project Sponsor will be developing additional
informal contacts. In time, the Project Sponsor may develop other local relationships and channels of
communication, which could benefit the local area. This may include the modalities by which the Project
Sponsor continually develops its social responsibility programs.
7.4.8 Integration of Public Consultation Findings into EIA
As illustrated in Appendix M3, there are some issues that will have to be addressed during project
implementation. These issues have been taken into consideration by the Project Sponsor in power station
design, impact assessment, and specification of and comrnitment to impact mitigation measures.
Chapters 5 and 6 indicate what actions/measures will be taken to address specific public issues.
7.5 Disclosure Plan
The PCDP was provided to most of the stakeholder groups noted in Table 7.1. This included the area
political and administrative leadership, interested entities in GOB, and NGOs. In addition, socio-
economic surveys were carried out in the Villages of Islampur, Ganganagar, Dhudghata, Kurbanpur,
Char Goaldi, and Panchani. In each case, contact with local persons resulted in communications about
the project and avenues were opened to conmnunicate comments and concerns to the EIA study team.
Locally, the most extensive period of consultation to date occurred during preparation of the draft EIA
and the subsequent Phase 11 meetings. Considerable contact with the project area population also
occurred during fieldwork for the social impact assessment component of the EIA. The most intensive
consultation occurred with those groups directly impacted, fisherfolk and the villagers of Islampur and
Ganganagar, who reside closest to the project site.

7.5.1 Information Materials
To assist with the dissemination of information, throughout the life of the project, the following materials
may be produced in bulk for provision to the public and/or selected stakeholder groups as part of the
information disclosure process:
*  pamphlet on the project: this document (i.e., a non-technical summary in Bengali) will provide
simplified, but accurate information about the project, its envirorrnental and social impacts (e.g.,
during construction and operation), and planned mitigation activities. As much as possible, the
pamphlet will use pictures and cartoons to illustrate information.
* final EIA report: copies of the non-technical summary of the final EIA will be made available to the
concerned ministries and agencies of the GOB, regional political and administrative leadership, and
those NGOs with a significant presence in the project region that are also concemed with EIA issues.
Locations will be provided where all interested groups may also review copies of the final EIA report.
Copies of the final EIA would be in addition to those provided to the DOE, IDCOL, and ADB as part
of the processes of project approval and certification.
Copies of the updated EAP (subject to negotiations of the investment agreement among ADB, IDCOL,
and the Project Sponsor) will be distributed to the DOE as well as the project lenders.
7.5.2 Resources and Responsibilities
In order to facilitate its own involvement in the consultation and disclosure process, the Project Sponsor
will engage a CLO to serve as its point of contact with the community. The CLO will be the main point of
contact with the community and PAPs. This appointment will be made prior to implementation of
construction phase PCDP activities, so that the CLO can assist the Project Sponsor in organizing meetings
with the PAPs (e.g., on the revised RAP), among other tasks.
Since public consultation and disclosure at the local level emerged in part from the process of preparing
the EIA, the Project Sponsor's environmental consultants organized the initial small group meetings with
the most vulnerable groups. Continued involvement with these groups will give the CLO strong
familiarity with local issues, groups, and leaders. This will enable the CLO to take over responsibility for
managing the task of public consultation as the project moves through the construction phase and into
the operation phase.
7.5.3 Grievance Mechanisms
The Project Sponsor recognises the need to maintain a clear channel through which project stakeholders
can express their grievances with assurance that these will be heard and addressed by project managers.
For the purposes of the power station, any individual or group that feels aggrieved by some project
activity will have the right to attend the regularly scheduled meetings with the CLO to present their
grievance either verbally or in writing. The CLO will pass the grievance on to the appropriate individual
within the Project Sponsor's organisation.

AES MEGHNAGHAT LIMITED
MEGHNAGHAT POWER PROJECT
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
In the first instance, if the Project Sponsor cannot resolve the complaint within one month, attempts to
find a solution by activating traditional methods of mediation in the community should be initiated;
usually by a respected elder. In the event that an individual or a group still feels its grievance is being
ignored, or should unresolved tensions between the power station management and the local community
over an issue persist, the two sides could invoke a mediation panel. Should this occur, the three-person
mediation panel would consist of an appointed member by each side to the dispute, as well as a third
jointly appointed member. The mediation panel would attempt to find a solution acceptable to all sides.
The CLO will be responsible for ensuring that the mediation panel is appointed and available for conflict
resolution.
In the event that disadvantaged or poor stakeholders (e.g., women) wish to lodge a grievance with the
management of the power station, but are unwilling to attend a meeting of the CLO, they should pass
their grievance to the CLO through the female conumunity organizers of the local NGO.
7.5.4 Reporting
To date, five reports have been prepared as part of the public consultation and information disclosure
methodology adopted for this project, and include:
*  conceptual design - 1997 EIA report (Appendix M2);
*  PCDP based upon 1997 findings - July 1999 report (Appendix Ml);
*  Phase I consultations - summarized above and detailed in Appendix M3;
*  Draft EIA report - April 2000 presenting the findings of the environmental and social review of
this project; and
*  Final EIA report - September 2000 outlining the findings of Phase II PCDP activities as well as the
environmental and social aspects of the project.
The results obtained thus far have been reviewed and incorporated into the overall consultation and
disclosure methodology. The Project Sponsor will be responsible for reporting on ongoing consultation
activities and results as part of its annual reporting requirements. This will include the results of
consultation with relevant stakeholders throughout the construction and operation phases of the project.
Reporting on public contact will be included in the annual monitoring reports submitted by the Project
Sponsor to the ADB and the IDCOL where appropriate.
