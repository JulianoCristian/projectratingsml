level. IDCOL promotes private\n            participation in infrastructure development. Potential\n            environmental impacts are: 1) polluting emissions; 2) change\n            in biological diversity and ecological equilibrium; 3) land\n            acquisition and forced resettlement; and 4) health and\n            safety hazards. Possible adverse environmental and social\n            impacts will be mitigated by 1) integrating waste management\n            measures and maintaining the environmental quality of\n            project locations; 2) ensuring that the standards of living\n            and income levels of project affected persons are improved,\n            or at least restored after project implementation by\n            participatory resettlement and appropriate economic\n            rehabilitation; 3) minimizing pollutants; and 4) reducing\n            pressure on natural resources."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
