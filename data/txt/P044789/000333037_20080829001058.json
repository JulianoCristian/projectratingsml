Infrastructure Development Project (PSIDP) for Bangladesh\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was significant, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: The original project design envisaged that\n            Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) will\n            finance major greenfield investment projects with majority\n            private sector ownership. Other forms of private sector\n            projects such as joint ventures were not envisaged. If other\n            kinds of public-private sector arrangements and more types\n            of infrastructure had been eligible, IDCOL could have built\n            a more diversified portfolio of investments that could have\n            catalyzed the project. Bank assessments of other projects\n            like PSIDP involving financial intermediaries similar to\n            IDCOL that are agencies of government but at the same time\n            independent of government have concluded that such\n            structures are inherently flawed due to governance and\n            control issues stemming from acting as a fiduciary without a\n            clear mandate and clear delegation of responsibility.\n            However this does not appear to have been the case in the\n            PSIDP project as IDCOL did in fact demonstrate its\n            competency when it financed the Meghnaghat sub-project under\n            PSIDP and in subsequent project financings without PSDIP\n            support. In addition as the experience of financial\n            intermediaries such as the Infrastructure Leasing and\n            Financial Services company and IREDA in India will suggest,\n            it is not impossible in principle to establish such public\n            sector agencies with a high degree of professional\n            competence that are able to act entrepreneurially with\n            operational independence at arms length from government."}, "docdt": "2008-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
