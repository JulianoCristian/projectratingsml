This project has two components: project\n            financing and sub-project transaction development. The\n            financing component supports sub-projects in mobilizing\n            adequate debt financing if they meet funding eligibility\n            criteria, where the sub-project sponsors have reached the\n            limit of mobilizing market-based financing. It is expected\n            that the sub-projects will be structured as\n            build-operate-own (BOO) or build-operate-transfer (BOT)\n            projects (or variations thereof), and financed on a limited\n            recourse basis. Transaction development is a government-led\n            function involving initiatives by project agencies, line\n            ministries, and other parastatals. Technical assistance will\n            be available to Bangladesh agencies and line ministries to\n            promote private sector participation, both at a policy level\n            and to promote specific transactions.  Assistance is also\n            required by line managers and ministries prior to\n            transactions, to establish proper framework and policies,\n            identify viable sub-projects, and carry out feasibility\n            studies. During transactions, assistance is required to\n            conduct competitive and transparent procurement processes,\n            market sub-projects to encourage good competition among\n            quality sponsors, and manage the entire process of\n            structuring, documentation, bidding, negotiations, and\n            concession awards. After award, a core advisory services\n            unit will be set up to continuously assist the private\n            sector developer and the public sector counterpart agency\n            with the project's timely construction, operation, and regulation."}, "docdt": "1997-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
