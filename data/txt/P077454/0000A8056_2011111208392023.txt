                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objective of the Project is to build productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain watersheds in ways that sustainably increase productivity
                         and curtail degradation of fragile lands and ecosystems.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The global environmental objective will entail protection of globally significant mountain ecosystems by mainstreaming sustainable land use and biodiversity
                         conservation considerations within agricultural and associated rural investment decisions. This integrated management approach will also provide replicable
                         models for comparable areas throughout the country. The GEF objective is mainstreamed into the overall development objective and outcomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The field implementation of the originally planned Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project (CAWMP) activities was completed in 2010, with a total of 3,845
                         subprojects financed by small grants with an aggregate value of over US$7.4 million covering 402 villages. About 43,000 (75%) of the households participated in the farm productivity
                         and land resource management investments, and 60% of the households participated in the rural infrastructure investments. Monitoring shows that 96,600 ha are covered by land
                         resource management and other project activities that address land and ecosystem degradation. Of this area, about 85,000 ha results from pasture-related activities, and about
                         3,000 ha results from the planting of over 1.3 million trees. An inventory of rare and endangered plants in the four project watersheds has been finalized and 425 species have been
                         described.

                         The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has approved the inclusion of Tajikistan's US$ 5.4 million grant proposal for a follow-on project in the GEF 5 work program.

                         The period for the ongoing project has been extended for an additional year, to April 30, 2012. Project activities during this final year comprise three special initiatives (in market
                         development, pasture management, and gravity-fed irrigation support) as well as completion of the final evaluation and dissemination activities.
