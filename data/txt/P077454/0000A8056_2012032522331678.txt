                         The objective of the Project is to build productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain watersheds in ways that sustainably increase productivity and curtail
                         degradation of fragile lands and ecosystems.

                         The global environmental objective will entail protection of globally significant mountain ecosystems by mainstreaming sustainable land use and biodiversity
                         conservation considerations within agricultural and associated rural investment decisions. This integrated management approach will also provide replicable models
                         for comparable areas throughout the country. The GEF objective is mainstreamed into the overall development objective and outcomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The field implementation of the originally planned Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project (CAWMP) activities was completed in 2010, with a total of 3,845 rural
                         production investments financed by small grants with an aggregate value of over US$ 7.4 million covering 402 villages. Results indicate that these investments are financially,
                         socially and environmentally successful and sustainable. Participation exceeded expectations -- about 43,000 (75%) of the households in the project villages participated in the farm
                         productivity and land resource management investments, and 60% of the households participated in the rural infrastructure investments. Monitoring shows that 96,600 ha are
                         covered by land resource management and other project activities that address land and ecosystem degradation. Of this area, about 85,000 ha results from pasture-related activities,
                         and about 3,000 ha results from the planting of over 1.3 million trees. An inventory of rare and endangered plants in the four project watersheds has been finalized and 425 species
                         have been described.

                         The one-year extension to April 30, 2012 is enabling the project to address further issues related to market development, pasture management, and gravity-fed irrigation through
                         special initiatives, and is also supporting project evaluation and dissemination. There is good progress on these activities.
