SUMMARY
The proposed Restructuring is required in order to: (a) enable the Project to address further
requirements related to irrigation, pasture management, and market development; and (b)
provide continued support for the completion and dissemination of the project evaluation. It
revises the January 2011 Project Restructuring, which was processed but not finalized, and seeks
to deepen the project impact.

Preliminary assessment of the past project activities highlights the need to develop farmer-based
guidelines and methods to address the special issues of irrigation, pasture management, and
market development. First, there are areas in the project watersheds where the primary
requirement is for on-farm investments for gravity fed irrigation. This will increase the farmers’
incentives to ensure sustainable management of the adjoining upland catchment areas. Also, the
more intensive production in the irrigated areas will help relieve the land degradation pressure on
the uplands. Second, participatory pasture management would be more effective if it involves all
pasture stakeholders in an entire jamoat and thereby can address requirements that are broader
than what can be undertaken at a small herder group or village level. Third, there are project
areas where subproject investments (e.g., over 933,000 fruit and nut trees) are beginning to
generate significant aggregate production and now would benefit from market development
support. In addition to addressing these three issues, there is a need to complete the impact
evaluation of the original activities, including implications, and disseminate these findings, as
well as to later update the evaluation at the end of the extension period.

The proposed changes include: (a) extension of the closing date by one year; (b) consolidation
of disbursement categories and percentages to simplify final project administration; (c) reference
to mass media services provided by the government-owned enterprise as an incremental
operating cost; (d) addition of a sole source selection (SSS) as a procurement method for
consultants; (e) minor revisions of the Results Framework; and (f) other revisions to ensure that
past legal amendments and current updates of the cost estimates are accurately and consistently
reflected in the official financing and cost data.


PROJECT STATUS
The originally planned project activities have been completed in accordance with the agreed
December 31, 2010 completion date. Activities from January – April 2011 have largely
comprised settling of project expenditures payments and accounts, monitoring and evaluation,
and planning for the extension period. Cumulative accomplishments are still in the process of
being measured and assessed but indicate that the agreed project results targets have been
achieved and in several cases exceeded. Highlights include the following:

•   Financing of more than 3,800 subprojects is directly benefiting over 43,000 households
    (compared with the target of 32,000), in four upland areas of the country. Poverty is reduced.
                                                 1
     Farm productivity and land resource management subprojects are generating incremental
     returns of US$ 100 to US$ 300 annually per household to these 43,000 households and about
     34,000 households are participating in rural infrastructure subprojects.
•    Over 96,000 ha (compared to a target of 78,000 ha) are covered by project activities that help
     prevent land and ecosystem degradation, of which about 85,000 ha resulted from pasture-
     related activities and almost 3000 ha resulted from the planting of over 1.3 million trees.
•    About 9,000 rural people (compared with the target of 8,000) have received technical
     training under the Project. A competition on best agricultural practices has involved about
     400 farmers.

Project implementation is acceptable to the World Bank and in compliance with all Bank
Guidelines and the Legal Agreements, including those regarding audit requirements.

The Project Restructuring is being undertaken at the request of the Ministry of Finance dated
April 26, 2011.

It is currently anticipated that about US$ 950,000 (8%) from the International Development
Association (IDA) Credit and IDA Grant will be unspent as of the current closing date of April
30, 2011, although much of this is already disbursed to the Designated Accounts. During the
May 2011 – April 30, 2012 period of the proposed extension of the closing date, it is anticipated
that these funds would be used to cover costs of the activities during the extension period,
including Project Management Unit (PMU) staff, consultants, training, dissemination, and
operating costs.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Results/indicators. The proposed changes in the Results Framework would not change the
Project Development Objective (PDO) or Global Environment Objective (GEO). The 2008 Mid
Term Review (MTR) made minor modifications in the results indicators to facilitate practical
measurement and to take into account updates in the budget. These modifications were adopted
by both the Government and the Bank, and reflected in the official PMU Semi-annual Progress
Reports and the Bank Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). The Government has
now requested that these changes be reflected in a Supplemental Letter, on a retroactive basis to
2008. The updated framework also includes two core indicators on the number of beneficiaries.
In addition, it includes an additional target for the seventh year outcome, i.e., the extension
period. In summary, the revisions comprise the following:

Components. The proposed activities during the extension period would include: (a) focused
support to develop farmer-based guidelines and methods for irrigation, pasture management, and
market development; (b) support for evaluation and dissemination; and (c) project management
and coordination. They are consistent with the original PDO and considered high priority. No
changes in the names and legal descriptions of the project descriptions or implementation
program covenants are required. Grants for gravity-fed irrigation subprojects would be part of
the rural infrastructure subcomponent, grants to support jamoat pasture management plans would
be part of the land resource management subcomponent, and grants for market development
would be part of the farm productivity subcomponent. Technical advisors, Non-Government
Organizations facilitation support, training, and dissemination would be part of the Institutional
Support and Capacity Building Component. The evaluation and fiduciary advisors, as well as

                                                          3
Project Management Unit (PMU) staff, local consultants, and PMU operating costs would be
part of the Project Management Component. Detailed arrangements and guidelines for the
irrigation, pasture management, and market development activities will take into account the
project and other relevant local and international experience, and climate change issues. The
proposed activities and arrangements have been appraised and found to be acceptable to the
Bank. They are economically justified and in accordance with the original economic analytical
framework.

Financing. The Financing Plan data in the Project Data Sheet is inconsistent with the data
presented in this Project Restructuring Paper due to: (a) ways in which Global Environment
Facility (GEF) Grants and the US dollar equivalent of IDA Grants are recorded in Bank system
data; and (b) changes in the estimated contributions from the Government and the beneficiaries,
which have been previously agreed at appraisal or in association with legal amendments at
effectivenesss and the MTR, but not consistently reflected in Bank documents and data. The
tables below therefore include additional columns to summarize these previous revisions. The
text below focuses on the proposed new revisions.

   •   Project Costs. The proposed Restructuring corrects the data to reflect the previous
       revisions, and updates the project costs to take into account actual expenditures and the
       additional costs for the additional year. To-date, the costs have been lower than expected
       at the MTR due in part to changes in the exchange rate and also because some of the
       specific activities expanded less than expected (e.g., micro-finance, discretionary budget
       for subprojects, expansion of Facilitating Organization support), or had lower unit costs
       (e.g., PMU staff expenses).

   •   Financing Plan. The proposed Project Restructuring incorporates the previous revisions,
       and takes into account updated estimates of the Government counterpart expenditures, as
       well as the fluctuations in the US$ equivalent value of the IDA Credit and Grant. In
       retrospect, the earlier estimates of Government counterpart (and hence the total amount
       of financing) did not correctly reflect the Government financing requirements associated
       with the agreed IDA and GEF financing disbursement percentages.

        •   Disbursement arrangements. In response to the government’s request and consistent with
            the Country Financing Parameters, disbursement arrangements are being simplified to
            ease project administration and facilitate a flexible approach. This is being done through
            an increase in the percentage to 100% and consolidation into one combined allocation for
            the IDA Credit, and one combined allocation for the IDA Grant. This will make final
            disbursements easier to process. The GEF Grant Agreement does not require revision
            and GEF Grant funds will be fully utilized by April 30, 2011. Expenditures under several
            of the existing categories, when combined with the portion being financed by the GEF,
            have already been financed close to or at 100%. Hence the percentage of financing from
            IDA now needs to be increased in any case to cover the portion that can no longer be
            financed by the GEF funds. The IDA Credit and the IDA Grant will each have an
            allocation in one new category covering all eligible expenditures. Eligible expenditures
            in the form of “Grants” for Farm Productivity, Land Resource Management, Rural
            Infrastructure, Research and Demonstration, and Mobilization, will be financed at “100%
            of amounts disbursed” and all other eligible expenditures will be financed at 100%. The
            provision and associated category for “unallocated” is eliminated. The new combined
            category and disbursement percentage will become effective upon Government
            countersignature of the Amendment.

        •   Reallocations. In accordance with the revised arrangements described above, the
            category allocations are being revised as specified in the table below.

Procurement. The inclusion of an additional procurement method, single source selection (SSS),
for both individual consultants and consultant firms, is proposed in order to facilitate the final
period of project implementation. This provision would enable continuity of assignments and
contracts with individuals and firms who are uniquely qualified for highly specialized
assignments, for tasks that represent a natural continuation of previous work carried out by the
same consultant, or for very small assignments. A provision for SSS for individual consultants
and consultant firms will facilitate more efficient and appropriate procurement processing for
these types of contracts.

Closing date. The Closing Date needs to be extended by one year from April 30, 2011 to April
30, 2012. This will be the first extension of the Project. As explained above, the proposed
extension is needed to: (a) enable the Project to address further requirements related to
irrigation, pasture management, and market development; and (b) complete the impact
evaluation and to disseminate these findings. The PDO remains achievable. Project impacts
would be increased and more thoroughly understood.

Implementation schedule. The PMU has prepared an implementation and procurement plan for
the period of the extension which is acceptable to the Bank. The development of the detailed
arrangements and guidelines for the irrigation, pasture management, and market development
activities, together with the evaluation of the original project activities, will precede the field-
level implementation of the facilitation support, small grants, and other new field level activities.
