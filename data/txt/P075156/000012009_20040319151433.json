The project has\n            the following four components: Component 1) represents an\n            innovative aspect of the proposed project and has an high\n            replication value throughout Albania and the region. The\n            component consists of three main parts: (i) the\n            establishment of Constructed Treatment Wetlands and related\n            facilities in the areas of Durres, Lezha and Saranda, (ii)\n            the construction of the sewage main collectors required to\n            connect the current sewerage systems to the new treatment\n            facilities, and (iii) sewerage network rehabilitation and\n            extension. Component 2) will assist the Ministry of\n            Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOM)\n            to carry out the following tasks: (i) technical assistance\n            for the development of the Kune Vain Management Plan; (ii)\n            training for Kune Vain administration staff, rangers, staff\n            from the relevant line ministries and members of NGOs on\n            natural resource management and integrated ecosystem\n            management; (iii) implementation of selected priority\n            measures; and (iv) design and implement a monitoring program\n            for water quality and biodiversity indicators in the Kune\n            Vain Managed Area and the coastal areas impacted by the\n            project. Component 3) will finance: (i) organization of a\n            stakeholder consultations program for the preparation and\n            implementation of the management plan; (ii) design and\n            implement awareness campaigns on project goals and benefits\n            of an integrated ecosystem management, local\n            communities' role and responsibilities in managing\n            natural resources including payment of environmental\n            services; (iii) organization of training and workshops for\n            practitioners and decision-makers on the technical, economic\n            and environmental benefits of constructed wetlands and\n            integrated ecosystem management; (iv) design and\n            implementation of an environmental education and\n            communication program for local communities; (v) design and\n            implementation of a pilot teacher's training program in\n            ecology and environmental education in selected schools; and\n            (vi) technical assistance to develop a replication strategy,\n            including the identification.
