Management Project\n            outlines expected negative environmental impacts and\n            proposed mitigations. To ensure maintenance of water\n            quality, levels, and water flows, as well as ecological\n            balance, specific indices will be monitored periodically.\n            Also to reduce the risk of water contamination, protect the\n            constructed treatment wetlands (CTW) by a flood protection\n            dyke; remove topsoil before construction and substitute\n            impervious clay liners to protect groundwater; and follow\n            procedures for sludge removal and disposal. To protect\n            biodiversity, habitats, and rare species, prepare a\n            comprehensive monitoring program and set guidelines for\n            contractors. No significant increase in mosquitoes is\n            expected, so the risk of malaria is low. Mitigations\n            comprise a management plan that combines biological and\n            chemical control measures; and creating buffer zones with\n            greenbelts around all sites. To control the social risk\n            associated with odors emanating from wetlands when waters\n            begin to stagnate, elaborate a plan for water control\n            measures to avoid putrification; and create buffer zones. An\n            environmental management plan will address reducing the\n            impact of the silt clay or clay sand material extraction for\n            CTW embankments or excavation deposits."}, "docdt": "2003-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
