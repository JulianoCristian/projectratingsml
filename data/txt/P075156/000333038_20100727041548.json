Project (IWEMP) for Albania were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include: it is unrealistic\n            to expect that a country like Albania, with weak\n            environmental support and understanding of the general\n            population and many within the administration, will, within\n            the limited period of a five-year project implementation\n            period, accept and implement best practice of managed and\n            protected nature reserves. As a result, project objectives\n            must be set realistically with due regard to the time needed\n            to change behavior and culture. The project name is IWEMP.\n            Yet, the project failed to apply successfully the integrated\n            nature of wastewater projects that require attention be paid\n            to the: (i) connection of buildings to the sewerage system;\n            (ii) the collection of wastewaters to secondary sewers in\n            the streets; (iii) the interception of the collected\n            wastewater and conveyance to the wastewater treatment\n            plants; and (iv) the safe and environmentally disposal of\n            the treated effluents. It is risky to rely on a private\n            operator to solve the many problems that face water supply\n            and wastewater operations. Specifically, the employment of a\n            private operator presumably meant that the Government was\n            planning to rely on private management in the future which\n            in turn means that the IWEMP expected the management\n            operator to guarantee sustainable operations of the sewerage\n            system and of the wastewater treatment plants. After the\n            departure of the management operator the capacity to operate\n            and maintain the project infrastructure is uncertain,\n            endangering project sustainability."}, "docdt": "2010-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
