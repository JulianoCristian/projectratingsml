PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - BACAU FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1020-RO)
PREFACE
The Bank approved a loan of US$60.0 million equivalent, In June
1974, to Banca de Investitil (Borrower) to assist in financing of the Bacau
Fertilizer Project (Loan No. 1020-RO) implemented by Bacau Enterprise
(Beneficiary).
The Project was a part of Romania's plans for increasing rapidly
the domestic fertilizer manufacturing capacity, for both local consumption
and exports by putting to more economic use its natural gas resources, as
well as to promote domestic equipment manufacturing capabilities. Work on
the Project commenced in April 1974. The individual constituent plants
included in the Project were commissioned over a period of time from August
1978 to May 1981, excluding a by-product utilization plant which was
commissioned in December 1983. After the commissioning of the major
production plants, IND staff visited Romania in August 1981 to Initiate
preparation of the Project Completion Report (PCR). Two follow-up missions
visited Romania in June 1982 and December 1982, to discuss the initial draft
PCR prepared by Banca de Investitii, artached as Annex 9.
Further comments received from the Borrower, which are also
included as Annex 10, have been taken into account in the revised text.
This Project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - BACAU FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1020-RO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project Is a part of the overall Romanian strategy for more
economic use of its natural gas resources to meet its growing domestic
demand for fertilizers, as well as to maintain its position as a fertilizer
exporter. The project is among 8 new fertilizer plants originally planned
for completion during 1973-80 which aimed at, besides subserving the
above-mentioned strategy, complete absorption of imported fertilizer
technologies, as well as promotion of equipment manufacturing capabilities
within the country (paras 1.02 and 1.03).
The project was originally planned to be located at Tecuci but
later changed to Bacau because of risks of contaminating the large
underground water reserves in the Tecuci area. The project includes
facilities for production of two main final products, namely urea (420,000
tpy), and Diammonium Phosphate (DAP, 208,000 tpy), as well as plants for
production of intermediates (ammonia, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid),
utilities and offsites, and byproduct recovery (phosphogypsum board,
fluorine salts, and cryolite) (para 2.02).
The project's main production units were commissioned over 32
month period starting August 1978. The phosphogypsum board plant, a
byproduct utilization unit, was commissioned in November/December 1983.
The delay of 40 months with reference to appraisal estimate in completing
the main components of the project has been mainly due to: (i) delay in
commencement of main engineering work caused by change in project site;
Cii) requirement of additional studies caused by substituting DAP in place
of ammonium nitrate in the product slate, considered a more appropriate
fertilizer both for Romanian agronomic conditions, and for export
marketing; (iii) delays in delivery of some of the imported equipment, and
materials required for domestic equipment fabrication; and (iv) delays in
delivery of key high pressure equipment from domestic sources caused by
longer learning time taken in fabrication of sophisticated equipment for
the first time in the country.
The total project costs, both in local currency and US$ terms,
have remained substantially the same as at project appraisal. In US dollar
terms, the total capital cost at US$180.9 million was only about 1.4% above
the appraisal estimates. The reduction in costs of civil works and
erection together with project's contingency provision was offset by
increases in costs of equipment, engineering, training, commissioning, and
working capital (para 3.10).
The project's FRR at 6.4% is higher than 4.5% estimated at
appraisal. The slightly higher FRR now estimated reflects the pricing
arrangements for domestically marketed fertilizers, which are linked to



production costs (para 5.08).   The project's ERR at 3.8X is significantly
below the appraisal estimate of 13.2Z reflects the sharp real increases in
energy costs, and the depressed world-market prices of fertilizers (paras
5.01 and through 5.07). While much of the implementation delay was due to
local manufacture of some key equipment, contributed in part by delays in
imported materials and components, the technology transfer aspect which is
among the country's objectives is deemed successful. Within the existing
Romanian system of responsibilities delimitation among the project
enterprise, the supply and works contracts agencies and the administrative
ministries involved, there are areas in which the project enterprises
management could be given greater flexibility in making decisions required
for expenditious project implementation, transcending as necessary the
limitations imposed by contractual terms. The manner in which greater
degree of autonomy in implementation decisions can be given to project
enterprise management will have to be evolved over time and will be pursued
in the context of future projects in the country.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - BACAU FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1020-RO)
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Bacau Fertilizer Project represents the first Bank operation
in Romania and as such also the Bank's first operation in its fertilizer
sector. Romania began in the early 19709 a major fertilizer capacity
expansion program, which included eight large fertilizer plants, expected
to be brought in operation between 1973 and 1978. These plants were built
as a part of the Government's (GOR) policy for more economic use of its
natural gas resources to meet its domestic demand for fertilizers, and to
maintain its position as a fertilizer exporter.
1.02     Prior to 1960, the fertilizer Industry In Romania consisted of a
few, small plants producing primarily single superphosphate and ammonium
nitrate. The first significant capacity expansion occurred during 1964-73
and comprised several relatively large, amonia-based plants to produce
urea and ammonium nitrate, as well as triple superphosphate plants. The
second, large capacity expansion program aimed at doubling domestic
production capacity (from 1.11 million tons per year of nitrogen (N) to
2.48 million tons, and from 0.44 million tons of equivalent phnsphorus
pentoxide (P205) per year to 0.93 million) took place during 1973-80,
through the construction of 8 new fertilizer plants. Their capacities and
the then planned commissioning years are shown below.

1.03     To expand production capacity, as planned, quickly and more
efficiently, to facilitate complete absorption of imported technology and
know-how, as well as to promote domestic equipment manufacturing
capabilities, Romania built six of these plants based on the same
technologies. The Bacau plant is one of these six, although with a scope
somewhat different from the other projects. Romania has largely achieved
the above objectives, despite delays in plants commissioning.



1.04     The chemical fertilizer industry is administered by the Ministry
of Chemical Industry through the Craiova Chemical Fertilizers Industrial
Central (the Central), an autonomous production agency, modeled on the
structure of the Craiova Chemical Enterprise. The Central, which has under
it 11 individual fertilizer production enterprises, ensures appropriate
coordination, general management, orientation, and control of the
fertilizer subsector. The Central also approves new capacity creation, and
production plans proposed by individual enterprises.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation and Approval, Loan Approval, and Effectiveness
2.01     The Project was first identified in April 1973, and a preliminary
techno-economic feasibility study presented to the Bank in July 1973.
During the Bank's September and November 1973 appraisal missions, the
Project product slate was further discussed and modified on the basis of a
Bank-retained consultancy study carried out by Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA), on domestic agronomical and export market requirements. The
product slate was modified primarily to replace ammonium
nitrate/nitrophosphates with Urea/DAP and to increase P205 production
capacity. The above modification, accepted by the Romanians, constituced
an important Bank contribution to make the Project design more appropriate
to Romanian agricultural requirements. The appraisal was completed in
March 1974 and a loan of US$60 million to the Project was approved by the
Board on June 27, 1974. The loan agreement became effective as of December
31, 1974, after the definitive techno-economic feasibility study based on
the modified Project design, was prepared for subsequent incorporation of
the Project into the Romanian Plan. The loan proceeds were channeled
through Banca de Investitii (Romanian Investment Bank, IB), the borrower,
to the Bacau Enterprise,the beneficiary. The Bank loan had a maturity
period of 15 years, including 4 1/2 years of grace, at an interest rate of
7 1/4% p.a. plus a commitment charge of 3/4% p.a. on the principal amounts
not withdrawn.
B. Project Description and Technologies
2.02     The Project was intended to produce two main products: (i) Urea
(420,000 tons per year, tpy); and Diammoniam phosphate (DAP, 208,000 tpy).
Byproducts and production capacities included: (i) drv phosphogypsum board
(100,000 tpy); (ii) fluorine salts (2,300 tpy); and (iii) cryolite (700
tpy). The basic raw materials consisted of domestic natural gas (0.5
billion cubic meters per year); imported phosphate rock (350,000 tpy); and
imported sulfur (138,000 tpy). Besides the above main products and
byproducts production facilities, the Project also included the following
intermediates plants: (i) a single-train ammonia plant (300,000 tpy); (ii)
a two-train sulfuric acid plant (200,000 tpy.per train); (iii) a
single-train phosphoric acid plant (110,000 tpy, expressed as P205); and
(iv) utilities generation, and other offsite facilities to support the
Project's production facilities.



-3-
2.03     The urea plant is based on STAMICARBON (Netherlands) techonology;
the DAP plant on GIRDLER (U.S.A.) technology: the ammonia plant on KELLOGG
(U.S.A., and U.K.) technology; the sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid
plants on IPROCHIM (Romania) technologies; and the phosphogypsum board
plant on PEC (France) technology.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      All production and support facilities were envisaged to be
commissioned by January 1978. Most of the production facilities were in
fact commissioned in late 1978 and 1979. The urea plant was commissioned
in April 1981, representing a delay of about 40 months. The phosphogypsum
board plant, a smaller and relatively unimportant auxiliary unit, was
commissioned in end 1983 (most phosphate fertilizer plants in the world
discard the gypsum byproduct without conversion to a useful product). The
commissioning dates of individual plants and the reason-, for the delays are
discussed in para 3.07 below. The actual Project cost including working
capital and preproduction interest is about 5.7Z less than the appraisal
estimate of US$200.8 million equivalent (details in Section III H).
Production build-up has been slower than earlier anticipated due to two
major reasons.  Firstly, actual production, consumption and exports of
fertilizers in Romania have been lower than those anticipated at appraisal
due to overall recession (details in Section IV B). Secondly, the capacity
utilization rates have been hurt by asynchronous and delayed commissioning
of the constituent units of the Project. While delays in domestic supply
of key equipment to the urea unit contributed in part to the overall
Project delayl/, Romania has acquired very good experience in fabrication
of sophisticated equipment for chemical industry, which constitutes a
long-term benefit to the country.
B. Project Location and Scope
3.02      The Project was originally planned to be located at Tecuci, about
75 km north of Galati. In 1975 it was decided to relocate the plant site
in Bacau, about 300 km from Bucharest in the northeastern part of the
country, to eliminate the serious risk of contaminating the large
underground water reserves in the Tecuci area. While the location change
caused some delays, the Project benefitted from the more experienced
construction capabilities of the Bacau judet, which has a good record in
chemical plant construction, to which it was assigned.
1/ The Borrower strcssed that the delay was caused mainly by the change of
project site from Tecuci to Bacau. (See Annex 10.) The elements which
contributed to the Project delay as well as the magnitude of delay from
each element are detailed in para 3.07. The Bank's version, while not
negating the contributory factors, seeks to underline the most
important cause.

C. Project Management
3.03      The main Project execution responsibility was apportioned between
(i) the Engineering and Design Institute (IITPC), formerly IPROCHIM, for
engineering of all non-licensed facilities; (ii) the construction and
erection trusts (primarily Bacau Industrial Construction Trust), managed
through the Ministry of Industrial Construction, for all site construction
works; (iii) Industrialexportimport (formerly Romchim), managed through the
Ministry of Machine Building Industry, for procurement of equipment and
materials; (iv) equipment fabrication enterprises, some under the Ministry
of Chemical Industry, and others under the Ministry of Machine Building
Industry, for manufacture and supply of equipment; and (v) the Bacau
Enterprise.
3.04      The Director of the Bacau Enterprise had the primary
responsibility for contracting and coordination with the above-mentior.ed
agencies, contracts administration, mobilizing the necessary resources for
construction, startup of units, and training of manpower. Each agency
involved in project execution, furnctioned within the framework of their
respective contracts, which included a system of penalties for
non-conformance with the contractual performance obligations. Periodic
coordination meetings, held as a part of the system by the Enterprise
Director, could resolve routine problems through agreements with the
concerned agencies. However, when unforeseen implementation problems
occurred, the enterprise generally had to depend on the Central or the
Ministry of Chemical Industry for corrective actions, especially when the
agencies involved operated under the administrative control of other
ministries. Such corrective action decisions could be based on national
priorities from time to time, and may not always be in conformity with the
needs of the Project's immediate objectives. While the existing system
arrangements nelped Project implementation, it also brings out that the
limited powers of the Enterprise director are not consistent with his
responsibilities .2/
D. Employment and Training
3.05      The Project currently employs 2,340 personne'l (SAR estimate:
2,400), consisting of 2,160 as direct labor and the balance as management
and support personnel. During 1976-81, 736 personnel were trained
(on-the-job training of 411 personnel, and full-time vocational and
technical school training of 325 personnel) in plant operations and
maintenance. Training was carried out i1a other fertilizer plants in the
country, abroad and at the plant site by foreign licensors' and equipment
suppliers' personnel. The training progress was fully satisfactory.
2/ The Borrower does not agree with the substance of paras 3.03 and 3.04
(See Annex 10.) The system of contracting, and delimitation of
responsibilities in Romania has been fully recognized and reflected in
paras 3.03 and 3.04. However, the information gathered during
supervision missions leads Bank staff to believe that there is room for
giving a greater degree of autonomy to the project manager to take
expeditious commercial decisions to overcome problems without
contravening the applicable legal provisions.



-5-
E.   Procurement
3.06      Initially, 69 equipment and material packages were expected to be
procured under International competitive bidding (ICB), following the
Bank's guidelines, and no Romanian supplier was expected to participate in
the bidding. The Bank did not, therefore, assess domestic capability for
these Items at the time of appraisal. During negotiations, however, it was
agreed that domestic suppliers would be allowed to participate in the
bidding, largely on the basis of statements made by Romanian authorities
and accepted by the Bank on domestlc capabilities. Of the total actual
value of the 69 packages of US$52.3 million, US$41.0 million representing
78.4% in value terms (62 packages) were procured from outside Romania, and
the balance of US$11.3 million was won by Romanian agencies, under ICB
procurement procedures. Practically all of the forcign supplies under ICB
originated from West European countries (Annex 1) reflecting the
familiarity of suppllers In these countries with the Romanian market.
F.   Project Implementation Schedule
3.07      After about two years of preparatory work on planning and
preliminary engineering, the main Project implementation work was scheduled
to start in April 1974. The Project was expected, at the time of
appraisal, to commence production in January 1978. The actual
production commencement dates of the individual constituent units is shown
in Annex 4. The Urea unit, which was delayed most, commenced operations in
April 1981 representing a delay of about 40 months. The Inordinately long
Project implementation period was caused by a number of factors as
discussed below:
(i)   Change of Project Site:  The Project was initially planned to be
sited at Tecuci and preliminary engineering work, especially
on utilities and offsite facilities, was based on conditions
specific to the Tecuci site. However, as mentioned earlier, the
site was shifted in 1975 to Bacau because of the perceived large
risks of contaminating the large underground water reserves in
Tecuci area. With the change of site, and of design parameters,
the basic design had to be reworked suitably, which delayed
commencement of main engineering work by an estimated 6-9 months.
(ii) Change in Project Scope: Prior to appraisal, the Project product
slate included production of nitrophosphate. During the early
1973 Project appraisal, Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) was included
in the product slate, in place of nitrophosphate, since DAP was
considered more suitable for the Romanian agronomic conditions
and urea, rather than Ammonium Nitrate, was considered more
appropriate for the export market. The change in the Project
profile required additional studies, and overall revision of
Project documentation. The redesign of the installations led to
delays in work commencement of about 4-6 months.
(iii) Delays in Foreign Procurement: Urea technology selection took an
estimated 6-9 months longer than was expected due to relatively
poor response from bidders, and additional time taken for the
technology selection process. Major delays occurred in
the procurement of foreign equipment (air compressor for ammonia
unit; furnaces and heat recuperators for sulfuric acid unit;



- 6 -
measuring and control apparatus for ammonia unit); of materials
(reformer tubes for ammonta unit); and of materials and machinery
required for local fabrication of urea plant high pressure
equipment (tubes, and tube sheets for stripper, and numerically
controlled drilling machines).
(iv) Delays in Local Procurement: Major delays occurred in the
construction and delivery of four high pressure equipment for the
urea plant--urea reactor, scrubber, stripper and condenser.
These items were reserved by Romanian authorities for local
supply as similar equipment would be required for other urea
plants being built in Romania, and developing domestic
fabrication capabilities of such sophisticated equipment would
therefore reduce the foreign exchange expenditures of above
projects and would be in line with the country's economic
development policies. The longest delay occurred in the case of
the carbamate stripper delivery. Normally, Stamicarbon, the Urea
unit process licensor, requires the stripper to be fabricated in
a shop with previous experience in constructing such equipment.
However, after inspecting several fabrication shops in Romania,
Stamicarbon accepted the Plotesti shop as qualified to undertake
the fabrication. Fabrication of the equipment at the Ploiesti
shop however required: (i) new machinery such as heavy plate
rolling machines, numerically controlled drilling machine, and a
high capacity gantry crane, (ii) prequalification of welders for
the special construction material; and (iii) very close stage
wise inspection and testing to maintain dimensional precision and
rigid welding quality requirements. The delivery and
commissioning of the imported numerically controlled drilling
machine was delayed by nearly 3 years (commissioned in May 1979,
compared to earlier expected schedule of May 1976). Imported
tubes for stripper fabrication were delayed by around 4-6 months
and when delivered were rejected on Stamicarbon site inspection.
Tubes replacement involved further delay of about 15 months--the
time taken to include the requirement in the pipe manufacturer's
next rolling program. Besides, the 1977 earthquake disrupted
Project construction activities due to redeployment of cranes and
shifts in priorities in fabrication shops.
3.08      While domestic capabilities for sophisticated equipment
fabrication were possibly achieved through intense cooperation of the
licensor (Stamicarbon) and the engineering contractor (Coppee-Rust) the
penalties in terms of overall Project delay of 40 months were
disproportionately large. Institutional flexibility enabling the
enterprise to reorder equipment and materials as needed, and airfreighting
delayed shipments could have reduced delays. The constraints of the
project management and contracting systems did not permit quick, pragmatic
changes in implementation strategy when unforeseen circumstances arose. In
short, the system did not easily permit response to project emergencies.
Exact chronology of events leading to the delayed ex-works delivery of the
stripper in May 1980, compared to the contracted delivery in 3rd quarter
1977 is not available. However, in addition to the above reasons, it is



-7-
also possible that concern for timely delivery of export orders might have
led to switching of priorities in fabrication and delivery of Project
equipment.3/
G.   Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.09      The Bacau Enterprise is satisfied with Stamicarbon and
Coppee-Rust for the assistance provided by them during Project
implementation. The enterpr-ise was apparently not fully satisfied with the
cooperation received from the licensor during the construction phase of the
phosphogypsum board plant. However, the Bank does not have the details to
evaluate the Bacau view.
H.   Capital Costs, Financing and Disbursements
3.10      The appraisal capital cost estimate, excluding provision for
import duties (which were waived by GOR subsequent to Project zero date),
and interest during construction was about US$178.4 million equivalent.
The actual capital cost of US$180.9 million equivalent was only 1.4 percent
higher. However, variations in specific individual cost items have been
more substantial: (i) a total reduction in construction costs of US$22.7
million, comprising of lower expenditures in erection (US$11.2 million),
and civil works (US$11.5 million); and (ii) a total increase in other costs
of US$43.2 million, comprising of engineering (US$1.3 million), equipment
(US$25.2 million), training (US$0.4 million) preoperating and commissioning
(US$2.2 million), spare parts (US$0.5 million), related investments ($0.5
million), working capital (US$6.3 million), and phosphogypsum plant (US$6.8
million). The cost increases have used up fully the contingency provision
of US$18.0 million to meet primarily, higher costs of equipment, and the
phosphogypsum plant. The estimated and final Project costs are compared in
Annex 2(a) (USS terms), and Annex 2(b) (Lei terms).
3.11      The local costs expressed in Lei terms (Annex 2(b)) have remained
about the same as the corresponding items of the SAR estimates. The actual
civil works and erection cost reductions compensated to a large extent the
increase in Lei expenditures for equipment, especially to cover the cost of
earlier envisaged foreign supplies transferred to local supplies. On the
other hand, foreign supplies costs (in Lei terms) were higher than
appraisal estimates, even with the reduced scope of supplies.
3.12      The actual Project capital cost is close to appraisal estimates
in spite of considerable implementation delays (about 40 months delay in
Urea unit and about 12-15 months in the other units). This is due to the
Romanian practice of fixed-price contracting, especially for domestic
supplies and services, where the net cost overruns are largely absorbed by
supply or service contractors, foreign trade enterprises, or administrative
ministries. Thus the cost overruns get scattered among various accounts
as: (i) costs absorbed by equipment suppliers, construction trusts and

beneficiary to permit actions mentioned would have reduced
implementation delays.

other government agencies; and (ii) penalty payments between the
contracting parties under the 'Law of Contracts". While under the Romanian
system the costs imputable to the Project and actually paid for by the
Project entity correspond to the actual financial Project capital costs,4/
the Project economic costs tend to be understated (see also para 6.05).
3.13      The total Project financing was estimated at the appraisal, at
US$200.8 million, including US$87.0 million in foreign exchange. Bank loan
financed US$60 million of the foreign exchange required and the balance
US$27 million of foreign exchange and US$113.8 million of local funding was
to be provided by Romanian State Funds. The actual Project financing
totalled US$189.3 million, including US$67.7 million In foreign exchange.
Besides Bank loan disbursement of US$60 million, the balance of US$7.7
million in foreign exchange and the local currency expenditures of US$121.6
million equivalent have been provided from State funds.
3.14      The Bank loan was expected to be fully disbursed by the end of
1977, but due to delays in Project implementation only 64.3% of the loan
amount was actually disbursed up to end-1977 and the balance was disbursed
over the next 3 years, till end-1980. The estimated and actual Bank loan
disbursements are presented at Annex 3.
I.  Bank Loan Utilization
3.15      The table below summarizes the appraisal-estimated and actual
category-wise allocation of the Bank loan. The unallocated component of
the Bank loan (US$11.7 million) has been used mostly for imported equipment
and materials due to their higher costs (para 3.11).

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A.   Commissioning and Production Buildup
4.01      The intermediate plants--sulfuric acid (2 trains), phosphoric
acid, and ammonia--were commissioned in December 1977/August 1978,
4/  Takes into account Borrowers comments to the effect that no additional
financial costs have been actually incurred by the Project beyond those
in the final Project cost estimate table (Annexes 2a and 2b).



-.9-
September 1978 and April 1979, respectively.  These plants have operated at
close to, or in excess of their respective design capacities in short
spells of time, but their sustained operation and capacity utilization, on
yearly basis continues to be low at about 60-80% (Annex 4) largely due to
asynchronous commissioning of the various units. Relatively ninor
operational problems in the initial years of operation, such as corrosion,
breakdown of solids handling systems and size reduction equipment, rotating
equipment failures and equipment fouling also affected production. Low
capacity utilization of the intermediate plants in 1980 and 1981 was
primarily due to: (i) delay in commissionrng of the Urea unit (which was
commissioned only in April 1981); and (ii) low capacity utilization of the
DAP unit, which in turn is partly due to operational problems and, what is
more likely, due to the much slower growth in domestic demand for DAP
(Annex 5). Although not expressly stated in the Romanian draft report, low
domestic demand for fertilizers and inadequate foreign exchange allocation
for import of rock phosphate and sulfur, could have contributed to low
capacity utilization. However, the production units have been competently
operated with a very well trained operational and maintenance crew.
B.   Market Growth
4.02      The Bank's appraisal forecast estimate of domestic fertilizers
demand was based on end-use analysis accounting for land availability,
crops and cropping patterns, crop production goals, response to
fertilization, and other related agronomic aspects. The forecast also
took into account the official Romanian demand estimates, as well as the
Bank-comnissioned market study prepared by Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA). Basically, the Romanian estimates assumed higher fertilizer
application rates relative to crop output increase, and also were based on
significant fertilizer application for natural hay and pasture lands. On
the other hand, the TVA estimates expected higher crop response to
fertilizer application, with some improvements in intrcduction of
high-yielding hybrids and in farm management practices. The Bank's
forecast, primarily used the more conservative TVA methodology but assumed
a somewhat higher agriculture sector growth rate (5.5% p.a.) compared to
5.0% p.a. used in the TVA studies, in view of Romania's high priority to
the agriculture. On the supply side, the Bank's estimates took into
account the likely commissioning dates of the fertilizer plants under
construction, production build-up, and levels of operation. No
difficulties were envisaged in increasing fertilizer exports (by about 70%
over the 1973 levels) up to 1980, which then would decline as domestic
demand increased.
4.03      The table at Annex 5 summarizes the Bank's projection of supply,
demand, and exports, as well as the actuals achieved.  Actual production,
domestic consumption, and exports levels have been consistently lower than
estimates, except for phosphates exports which were higher than estimates
in 1979, 1980, and 1981. The reasons for decreased domestic consumption
are not clearly known, nor the consequent economic impact of such lower
fertilizer applieation on agricultural productivity. A separate impact
study could possibly provide valuable pointers to the cost of trade-offs
and assist in planning for future fertilizer capacity. On the other hand,
exports also declined due to depressed international market. The large
supply shortfalls reflect delays ir commissioning of the Urea unit.

C.   Environmental Aspects
4.04      Fluorine recovery unit and double contact-double absorption
technology for sulfuric acid plant were Included in the project scope to
minimize pollutton risks. The deslgns have been based on 300 ppm sulfur
oxides emissions and 2 kg/hour fluorides emission. Actual atmospheric
emission levels, as well as liquid effluents contaminants levels are
reported to be below the prescribed limits.
V. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCES
A.   Economic Performance
5.01     The economic rate of return (ERR) on the Project in real termR is
estimated at 3.8%, which is significantly below the original 13.2X
estimated at appraisal. The lower rate of return reflects a combination of
two major factors: (i) the sharp real increases in energy costs,
particularly that of natural gas which forms the bulk of the production
costs, and (ii) the currently depressed market prices of fertilizers.
Implementation delays seem to have had very little impact on the ERR.
Assumptions and calculation of the ERR are detailed in Annex 6. In spite
of the significant drop in the Project's ERR, it is nevertheless
justifiable to continue operations of the facilities since the ERR is still
positive and future incremental benefits significantly exceed incremental
costs (para. 5.06).
5.02     Since appraisal, the economic costs of energy have gone up
considerably in real terms. Between 1978 and 1982, the cost of fuel oil,
f.o.b. Romania rose from US$71 to US$163 per metric ton in 1982 dollars.
Correspondingly, the opportunity cost of natural gas, based on calorific
equivalent of fuel oil, f.o.b. Romania, increased from US$67 to US$149 per
1,000 cubic meters in the same period. The 1982 real values are almost
three times as much as what were projected at the time of appraisal. The
SAR costed natural gas at US$55 per 1,000 cubic meters, and fuel nil at
US$60.7 per metric ton (both in 1982 dollars.) To give an idea of the
magnitude of the impact of energy price increases, it was estimated that if
the values of natural gas, fuel oil and power had remained at 1978 levels,
all else being equal, the ERR would have been 12.8%. The impact of the
energy price increase may thus be estimated at about 9%, (12.8% minus 3.8%)
of the ERR.
5.03     The currently depressed export market for fertilizers has also
contributed to the low ERR. According to recent studies by the World Bank,
current prices of urea and DAP are well below their normal realization
prices, i.e., efficient production costs plus capital charges of 10-15Z,
for a aaarginal producer. For example, in 1982 wnile the f.o.b. price of
urea was US$152 per metric ton, its realization price, at developed sites,
is estimated at about US$265-275. Similarly, in the same year while the
f.o.b. price of DAP was US$218 per metric ton, its realization price is
about US$320.



- 11 -
5.04     It Is interesting to compare the production costs of the present
projoct against the estimates f3r economically efficient producers
elsewhere. For convenience in calculation, we shall simply look at the
costs of raw materials. The following table shows a comparison between the
costs projected for 1984 of raw materials per ton of output for the
Project, net of values of excess intermediate products at 90Z capacity
utilization vis-a-vis the corresponding estimates for efficient producers.
Comparison of Raw Material Cost
(in 1982 US$ per ton of output)
Product                  Project             Efficient Producers
Urea                        139                    96-150
DAP                        203                    155-163
The above table shows by comparison that economically while the Project is
an average performer in urea production it is a high-cost producer of DAP.
This is because DAP production under the project is based on more expensive
imported sulfur and imported phosphate rock. However, it should be noted
that the Project's cost of raw materials for DAP is probably overstated as
it does not take the value of the byproducts phosphogypsum boards into
account.  Otherwise, the cost could be reduced by a certain amount
depending on the "true" economic value of this byproduct. (In the economic
analysis, we assumed value of about US$15 million a year as given by the
Romanians.  As phosphogypsum is not a widely traded commodity in the
international market, it is difficult to determine its true economic
value).
5.05     Implementation delays appear to have had little impact on the
Project's economic rate of return. To approximate this impact, we assumed
that the project had been commissioned in 1978 as was originally scheduled
instead of 1982 when its last component was actually commissioned. Using
the same disbursement schedule, the same capacity build-up rate, the same
distribution of working capital, the same project life span, but updated
cost and revenue data, we calculated an ERR of 4.0%, which is not
significantly different from the actual estimate of 3.8%, indicating that
delays had very little adverse impact on the Project. It should be noted
however that this calculation is probably understated as it does not take
into account the possible but unreported increase in capital costs that msy
have been absorbed by the contractor and equipment supplier under the
Romanian system of fixed price contracts.
5.06     Although the Project shows a low ERR, nevertheless it is
justifiable to continue its operations. As the yearly cost and benefit
streams in Annex 6 indicate, from 1983 on when the Project goes into full
production (75% capacity utilization in 1983, and 90% thereafter), marginal
revenue exceeds marginal cost throughout the project life. To put it in
another way, if one arbitrarily treats 90% of the Project cost as "sunk",
allowing 10% as recoverable costs, the project would yield an ERR of 18%,
which is sufficiently high to justify its continued operations.



- 12 -
5.07     In conclusion, the above findings indicate that the Project is not
as economic as when it was conceived, for the following reasons: (i) the
high opportunity cost of natural gas on the one hand, and to a lesser
extent, the currently depressed fertilizer market on the other; (ii) the
high degree of export orientation of the prolect which reduces the economic
value of its products by twice the transportation cost from the clearing
markets; and (iii) the fact that phosphate fertilizer production was based
on imported sulfur and rock which are now more expensive due to higher
freight rates. However, the Project is not alone in experiencing this
problem since many other projects of its kind elsewhere in the world have
also been adversely affected in the same way. In the light of this and
other similar experiences, one may generally draw two malor conclusions.
First, given the currently depressed price of urea, unless the opportunity
cost of natural gas or other feedstocks is low (say below US$3 per million
BUT at developed sites), it is probably not advisable to build an
export-oriented urea plant. Second, production of DAP is not economical
based on imported phosphate rock and sulphur, but could be justified on the
basis of imported phosphoric acid.
B. Financial Performance
5.08     The Project has a financial rate of return (FRR) of 6.4% compared
with 6.5% estimated at appraisal. The slightly higher FRR now estimated,
in spite of the implementation delays reflects basically the pricing
arrangements for domestically marketed fertilizers, which are closely
linked to production costs. Annex 7 presents the total cost and total
benefit streams of the present analysis, which are strictly based on the
financial data end assumptions given in the Romanian draft completion
reports of 1982 and 1983.
5.09     Summaries of the historical balance sheets for 1976-1981 and the
income statements for 1978-1983 are presented in Annex 8. Projected income
statements from 1984-1992 are identical to that of 1983 and are therefore
not shown here. No attempt is made to calculate financial ratios as they
have little meaning in the context of the centrally-planned economy of
Romania. For full details on the Romanian accounting system, please refer
to the SAR, May 21, 1974.
VI. LESSONS LEARNT
6.01      The Bacau Fertilizer Project was identified and implemented as
one of Bank's first operations in Romania--a country with salient features
of project formulation and justification, implementation methods,
accounting, and financial reporting methods which were different from
arrangements familiar to the Bank at that time. The features of such a
system and their broad, possible impact on the success of the Project were
considered in the appraisal report. However, in retrospect, experience
gained through the Project indicates the need for, and possibilities of
improving some of the Romanian methods and techniques of project
implementation and related decision-making.

6.02      There are two broad areas in which improvements could be useful:
(i) project management, and (ii) cost reporting.
Project Management
6.03      Under the Romanian system, the project enterprise is responsible
and fully accountable for carrying out project implementation. The system
of contracting consists of packaging distinct functional responsibilities
(engineering, procurement of foreign and local supplies, and site
construction) and awarding them to specialized agencies in the country.
Depending upon the project location and type of the project, the selection
of such agencies is automatically fixed. The enterprise's responsibilities
include signing of respective contracts with the agencies, coordination of
project activities, training of personnel, commissioning and operation of
the plant. The enterprise convenes frequent, periodic coordination
meetings with concerned agencies to facilitate smooth implementation.
Periodic coordination meetings are also held at the administrative ninistry
level. Through a legal system of penalties for non-conformance to
contractual terms, the contracting agencies are encouraged to fulfill tieir
contractual obligations. In practice, the individual agencies, many of
which fall under the administrative control of ministries other than the
ministry controlling the project, are not always directly answerable to the
enterprise, but attempt to carry out their work schedule (whose work
priorities and scheduling, can apparently be changed by authorities in
their respective administrative ministries) according to the contract
terms. Direct intervention in and monitoring of the agencies' work by the
enterprise appear to be only nominally effective. As a result, the
coordination role of the enterprise is basically restricted to resolving
relatively minor problems in cooperation with the concerned contracting
agencies, highlighting major problems (changes in work scope, reord3ring
supplies, rescheduling of construction, etc.), and leaving it to the
Central or the administrative ministry to resolve. In short, the system
does not provide sufficient autonomy and authority to the enterprise,
consistent with the responsibilities demanded of it. It should however be
recognized that changes to the existing system cannot be brought about
easily as many of the shortcomings in the project management system cited
above are deeply embedded in existing legislative and administrative
arrangements. We expect to strengthen the ongoing dialog with the Romanian
authorities on the subject.
6.04      Within the overall system of contracting, one could foresee the
possibilities of improved working arrangements and a more effective role of
the project enterprise. This could be achieved primarily by: (i) creating
a more effective project management organization within the enterprise;
(ii) making the contract agencies directly answerable to the enterprise
authorities on matters concerning work scope change and detailed time
schedule; and (iii) providing adequate facilities and financial powers to
the agencies, as well as the enterprise,to adopt whatever method is
economically justified under the given circumstances, such as, to reorder
and airfreight delayed consignments.5/

Costs Reporting
6.05      Under the present system of awarding fixed price contracts, cost
overruns (unless supplementary finances are requested from, and granted by
the State Council) are absorbed by the contracting agencies (through
institutional and personal penrlties) and not recorded in the enterprise's
books. While the costs of overruns absorbed by contractor agencies are not
material for computing the project'. financial capital costs, the true
economic cost of the project remains unknown since no agency or procedures
presently exist to capture all such overruns in one central record. This
serious shortcoming can be rectified, through an improved accounting
system, which will then facilitate an evaluation of the true costs and
benefits of the project.6/
Economic Viability of Fertilizer Production
6.06     During the period 1980-83, the depressed agricultural commodities
prices, and practically static fertilizers consumption levels with
consequent very low levels of production capacity utilization, have driven
down fertilizer prices to levels not commensurate with energy and input
prices. Besides, the continued high interest rates combined with the
strong dollar have also had the impact of depressing the international
fertilizer prices to levels approaching cash costs of production. The
Project facility, commissioned as it was in the midst of the unusually
prolonged recession, has been hit by the synergistic effects of the factors
mentioned above. This negative impact will continue during the initial 3-5
crucial years of the Project life, before the prices recover to normal
levels. It must be noted that, except for the implementation delay (whose
impact on ERR is not very significant), the sharp reduction in Project ERR
relative to that at appraisal has been due to the unprecedented set of
structural changes in the fertilizer industry and circumstances external to
the Project. Nor could the changed scenario have been anticipated at the
time of appraisal. Export-oriented projects have suffered most since the
economic value of the output is penalized by an amount equal to twice the
transportation cost from the clearing market. Therefore, the economic
viabilit- of export-oriented fertilizer projects which are to be
commissioned in the next, say, 3 to 5 years is likely to be marginal,
especially if such projects are based on imported sulfur and phosphate
rock. This is because the economic value of the outputs for exports is not
commensurate with the high cost of raw materials and energy.
Situation-specific factors will need to be evaluated very carefully for new
projects justification. The Bacau Fertilizer Project viability, as
reassessed in this report, highlights the risks of installing new
fertilizer production capacities aimed at the export markets in the present
international situation. The Bank, therefore, takes this situation into
account and proceeds with caution in its assessment of new export-oriented
fertilizer projects for possible participation.

changes aribing from project modification, Annex 10.

ROMANIA - BACAU FERTILIZER PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
I.   Capital Cost, Disbursement Schedule and Capacity Build-up
1.        The project economic capital cost has been assumed as that
provided by the Investment Bank, net of duties and taxes. For lack of
better informatlon, the schedule of disbursements for all funds has been
assumed to parallel that for the Bank funds. Capacity build up has been
taken as given by the Investment Bank. The material balance for the
intermediate products (ammonia and sulfuric acid) was reconstructed from
the product yields given by the Investment Bank and all excess products
were assumed to have been sold. The technical problems initially
encountered with the urea and DAP plants seem to be solved now and the
plants have been assumed to run at 75% production capacity in 1983 and 90%
thereafter. The project urea plant is assumed to have an economic life of
12 years. While they started production about 2 years earlier, the other
plants (ammonia, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and DAP) are assumed to run
until the end of the urea plant economic life. This assumption is
considered reasonable in view of the yearly US$4.6 million assumed for
project maintenance.  10% of the project investment cost has been assumed
as scrap value at the end of the project life.
II. Material Balance, Production Costs and Working Capital
2.        Material Balance.  At full capacity the project material balance
has been assumed as follows (various catalysts and chemicals inputs, as
well as various chemical outputs are not shown here but have been
considered when calculating the project cash flow).
Raw Materials                                Output
Gas                 456,900 103 m3/yr.       Urea             420,000 tons/yr.
Phosphate Rock      347,800      tons/yr.   DAP               208,125 tons/yr.
Sulfur              138,000      tons/yr.   Ammonia            14,700 tons/yr.
Fuel Oil             81,180      tons/yr.   Sulfuric Acid    92,000 ton/yr.
Power               143,100      MWH/yr.
3.        Raw Materials Costs.  Since Romania exports fuel oil to Western
Europe and is expected to continue to do so in the future, the opportunity
value of gas has been taken as the calorific equivalent of export fuel
oil. In line with the product Bank crude ratio projections, fuel oil value
cif Rotterdam has been assumed at 75Z of crude oil value (per ton), and
transport from Romania has been assumed at US$5 per ton. Crude oil priced
have been taken as per Bank forecasts. Phosphate rock vrices have been
taken as per Bank forecasts with a US$14 per ton sea transport cost from
Morocco to Romania and a US$7 per ton inland transport to Bacau. Sulfur
prices are based on Bank forecast of Vancouver sulfur prices, plus a 5%

premium which Polish sulfur traditionally enjoys due to its location, plus
a US$10 per ton transport from Poland to Bacau. The economic value of
electricity has been derived from fuel oil value. The economic cost of the
catalysts and other chemical inputs has been assumed at the financial cost
indicated by the Investment Bank.

4.        Fixed Costs.  The project fixed production costs have been
derived from the financial production costs indicated by the Investment
Bank by deducting labor taxes. Maintenance in particular is reported at
US$4.6 million per year, adequate for a plant of this type.
5.        Working Capital.  The project economic working capital has been
assumed at 2 months of revenues (receivables) and a month of variable
production casts for the exported output (finished product inventory). Raw
material inventory has been assumed at the cost of one month of imported
raw material, like accounts payables.
III. Revenues
6.        For traded commodities, the economic values of the project
outputs have been based on Bank forecasts. For non-traded commodities they
have been assumed to equal the financial values indicated by the Investment
Bank in their project completion report.
7.        As indicated in Annex 5, Romania is an important exporter of urea
(68% of its 1980 urea production was exported). The project's urea value
f.o.b. at Romanian port has been assumed to equal the prices projected by



-23 -
ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 4
the Bank for Western Europe urea export. A US$7 per ton transport cost
from Bacau has then been deducted to obtain the Project's urea's ex-factory
economic value.
8.         Although Romania also exportn phosphate fertilizers (34% of its
1980 P205 production was exported), these exports are mostly in the form of
!IPK and TSP, with little DAP exported (cnly 12,000 tons in 1979 and 34,000
tons in 1980, none in 1981). It has thun been assumed that the project DAP
output is locally consumed, and :he economic value of DAP production has
been derived from Bank projectionr Eot US Gulf f.o.b. values, by adding a
US$30 per ton sea transport cost and a US$7 per ton inland transport cost.
Long term DAP price projections have been adjusted to reflect sulfur price
forecasts.

9.         Ammonia economic value has been assumed at 90% of urea price.
The value of sulfuric acid has been assumed at its sulfur content plus 15%
for processing cost recovery. The sales of these two excess by-products
are small (totalling US$6.0 million per annum or about 4% total sales).
The economic value of the other by-products has been assumed to equal the
financial value indicated by the Investment Bank.

II.PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Appraisal,Loan Appzroval.Effectiveness
2.ol.      The Project was identified by  a mission of the World
Bank in April 1963 and in September-November the same year. The
scope was adjusted on IBRD's suggestion to better meet the domestic
agriculture demand and the export requirements by changing the
profile from NPK complex fertilizer (Nitrophoshate technology) into
urea/DAP.
The Appraisal Report was completed in March 1974.The
Bankts Executive Directors approved a loan of USS 6o million on
June 1974. The Loan Agreement between the World Bank and the
Investment Bank was signed on June 1974 and was effective in
November 1974.
B. ProJect Scope and location
2.02.      The site of the Project was originally in Tecuci.
Subsequently,after the Project scope was modified to better use the
labor from that area the project was located in Bacau. The Project
is designed to utilize domestic natural gaz supplied through the
national pipeline network in the manufacture of urea, and DAP as well
as imported phosphate rock and sulphur for the production of DAP.
The main objective of the Project was to satisfy both domestic
consumtion and export requirements.
C. Project Objectives and escription
2.o3.      The Project consists of the construction of a fertilizer
plant with a capecity of 42c,ooo mtric tons per year(TPY) ofurea
and 2o8,ooo TPY of DAP (diammoniu phosphate) with a total nutrient
equivalent of 225,ooo TPY of nitrogen and loo,ooo TPY of P205

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.ol      The Appraisal Report's estimatmes had in view the
completion of technological tests and project commissionLing by the
end of the fourth Quarter of 1977 and operuLtion ait Tull capacity
up to 1979.
3.o2.      Units commissioning terms as compared to the texms from
the time of appraisal are as follows

The estimated and actual schedule of project
implementation by main plants ia shown in Annexes 2 and IiL
Me delays occured duri.ng project implementation
compared with the estimates were of lo months at DAP and sulfuric
acid plants; over 18 months at ammonis -ad phosphoric acid units;
and over 2 years at urea plant.

3.o4.      The delays occured during project implementation were
mainly caused by thc following factors :
- Project location Was changed from Tecuci to Baclu.This
modification was made little before the date when the
construction-erection works were foreseen to start up
causing a delay of 12 months ( estimated -November 1973,
actual - end of 1974);
- The Project scope was adjusted by changing the profile
from NPK complex fertilizer into urea/DAP.Due to this
modification there were necessary to elaborate additional
studies,to redesign some facilities (DAP and phosphoric
acid plant) including new designs for equipment,techno-
logical solution and construction-erection works.
Facilities redesigning caused delays in works start-up
(about 6 months for phosphoric acid plant) and in
contracting equipment and materials with domestic and
foreign suppliers. Following the changing of location
and project's profile,tota' delays in project emecution
were of about 18 months.
- The unfulfilment of project implementation in due time
was also caused by the delays occured in equipment
contracting and delivery by foreign and domestic
supplier8.The license for urea plant was contracted with
a delay of 12 months.As regards the delivery of the



31 -
equipment by externLl suppliers delayc mainly occured at
steam boilers CTE and heat recuperators froLL sulfuric acid
plant t about 12 months),control and measuring instruaentr
from aumionia unit. ( ubout 12 muonths) and others. Delays
ulso occured on the delivery of locally manufactured
equipcent as high pres3ure equipment for urea plant (about
2o months) scutter ( about 15 months) and others. Also,
during testing and runnirg in period perL of equipmeut waa
defective ( Co2 turbocompressor,pump.s Ior phosphoric acid
plant) heut exchangers for phosphoric acid plant.
The earthquake or Yarch,1977 caused important delayE in
project implementation when  wlthin the efforbt to eliminbte
the damage of the earthquake ,p;,rt of the lubor force was
involved in the rehabilitation of affected enterprises. To
support the implementation of the reconstruction works,the
production capacity of some enterprises was developed to
provide additional quantities of equipment for machine
building and construction-related industries. It was
estimated that the earthquake caused a delay of over
6 months.
B. Project Management
3.o5.    fae responsability for the Project execution was divided
between the Ministry of Chemical Industry (development Denartment)
and the Project's sponsor Bacau Chemical Fertilizer Combine and
other organizations namely : Engineering and Design Institute -
uiJJPIC (formerly IPROCHIM); Construction-Srection Trusts -mainly
.dcaL Industrial Construction Trust,specialized unit unde. the
kUnistry of Industrial Construction; procurement enterpri'. s -
Industrialexportimport Fbreign Trade Enterprise (formerly ROMCHDF.)-
specialized foreign trade enterprise uader the Ministry of Machine
- uilding industry,as well as the equipment and machines' suppliers
enterprise under the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry
of Machine Building Industry - each one in its field of activity
based on contracts with the Project sponsor. CIC Baciu was respon-
sible for the direct coordination of project execution as well as
for the activity of the other concerned bodies.



- 32 -
3.06     CIC Bacau was responoible for techno-economic documentation with
the research-design institute, contracting the construction-erection works
with the spccialized units, contracting the equipment and instalations
aelivery with the local suppliers, concluding the import contracts with the
specialized foreign trade enterprise in order to procure the imported and
locally manufactures equipment (which were procured through ICBs),
advising, completing and improving the documentation and delivering it in
due time to the construction trusts, supervising the execution of the works
ac4ording to the techno-economic documentation and their quality following
up the delivery of the equipment by suppliers, on the contractual terms,
delivering the equipment to the construction trusts for their erection,
taking part in technological tests and starting up the installation and
training.
3.07     IITPIC (formerly IPROCHIM) acted as engineering contractor
utilizing both license agreements with reputed international firms from
Holland, UK and USA and its own technology. In a large part the project
was similar to other projects already constricted in Romania, and utilized
substantial local equipment.
Responsabilities for project execution have been delegated to
several different agencies but CIC Bacau had overall responsability for the
coordination of the project execution and of the project related activities
of the other agencies involved. IPROCHIM was responsible for licensing,
detailed engineering (based upon a licensor's process design package) and
provision of technical advice to CIC Baca'i in equipment supply,
procurement, erection and commissioning of the fertilizer plent.
3.08     Civil works, erection of the plant and a substantial portion of
the equipmenit supply was undertaken by other Romanian enterprises.
C.   Employment and Training
3.09     CIC Bacau employs at present a staff of 2.340 including operative,
maintenance and administrative personnel of which 2.160 workers. This
number is less than 2.400 given in the Appraisal Report.  As any chemical
fertilizer plant the project itself is not labor intensive with only 12
jobs per US$1 million of capital invested. The appraisal report estimate
was 15 jobs per U!S$1 million of capital invested.
3.10     Based on a training program, supervised by Fertilizer Central
Craiova, CIC Bacau management formed from the very beginning of the project
a number of workers team using various professional training systems, both
in Romania - in various chemical fertilizer plants - and abroad. The
training program was carried out in coordination with its licensor
engineering companies and equipment suppliers. About US$1 million was paid r
for the project budget for training expenses, amount which was achieved
135%. The Project management has been particularly active in assuring
sitable conditions for the train;,g of the operating personnel. Part of the
required operating personnel was recruited from the Craiova Central staff.



- 33 -
During the implementation period of the Project in the period 1976-1981 the
number of employees who received training in Romania was 736, of which 411
had received training while working at the enterprise and 325 were
graduates from vocational schools. During 1978-1981, 10 specialists (6
engineers, 1 foreman and 3 workers) received training abroad. The
responsibility for the training of the required personnel was assumed by
the Ministry of Chemical Industry the Fertilizer Central and CIC Bacau.
Personnel training takes place: within the existing enterprises having
similar make-up, the worker being included in the production process; in
the industrial high-schools; in vocational schools, depending on the labor
force requirements for each skill.  In order to improve the vocational
education of the workers in all fields of activity in respect of the
economic development requirements, there are organized forms of vocational
education mainly as: on the Job training under the supervision of the
direct manager; organized courses within tVe plant, in other plant and in
specialized centers for personnel training; probation periods within the
plant or in other plants etc.
3.11     The Project generated about 2,340 permanent jobs.  Furthermore,
740 workers were trained as: chemical operators, machine and equipment
mechanics, machine operators for belts, packaging and compressor
operators. The Project also contributed to the creation of jobs in
agricultural and transport field. When underway the Project required about
8,600 workers/year. Investment cost, on worker is about US$81,000 and on
direct labour about US$88,000 higher than that specialized in the Appraisal
Report.
D.   Performance of the Consultants
3.12     During the Project implementation, specialists from "Copper Rust'
who represented "Stamicarbon" Company were present on the site, together
with experts from the main equipment suppliers giving up-to-date
information on the technology and the equipment being used. At the peak of
the implementation period (1976-1980) a'lout 280 experts were on the site,
their number gradually decreasing afte. .echnological tests completion and
commissioning. At the same time, 'besides the technical assistance provided
during erection and tests stages the suppliers from Deval-Clark (USA),
Chemetics (Canada), Copper Rust, Stamicarbon and Sche (FRG), also provided
training of the opertion staff. Besides the above technical assistance CIC
Bacau management did not require other forms of consulting; the role of the
consultants being to introduce the special technology (process, equipment)
of each respective package during project implementation.
E.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.13     Procurement took place under the general coordination of CIC Bacau
with the responsibility for technical aspects being assumed by IITPIC
(formerly IPROCHIM). Industrial export import (formerly ROMCHIM) - a
special export-import agency under the Ministry of Chemical Industry - was
in charge of the procedures followed for imports acquired through ICBs and
other methods consistent with the Bank's guidelines. The equipment
supplied internationally was subject to a prequalification procedure based
on advertising plus the process licensors' knowledge of potential equipment



- 34 -
suppliers. Three or five foreign companies were prequalified for each of
the sixty-nine equipment packages, amounting to UD$923 million and bid
soliciting, evaluation and awards were conducted according to Bank
guidelines. Romanian suppliers were prequalified for 7 packages amounting
to US$11,3 million. Local suppliers won all packages for which they
competed.
3.14     The final distribution of disbursed funds from the loan were 70%
for imported equipment, 19% for locally manufactured equipment and 13% for
IBRD Loan's interest rate.
3.15     Out of the required equipment and erection materials, about 45%
was financed from domestic resources. In order to procure these materials
and equipment, CIC Bacau concluded contracts with manufacturing enterprises
under the Machine Building Ministry and Chemical Industry Ministry. During
the period of procurement besides the delivery delays (see para. 3.03)
there were delays in carrying out the technological tests for commissioning
the phosphogypsum installation due to inconveniences created by some
foreign companies adopting a tough position as concerns extension of
technical assistance (repeated requests for increasing erection, fees, not
sending the specialists on the site, etc.) accordingly delaying performance
of technological tests and commissioning of the phosphogypsum installation.
3.16     IPROCHIM (IITPIC) was also responsible for engineering and
preparation of feasibility reports.
3.17     Bacau Industrial Construction Trust was responsible for
construction-erection works based on the contract concluded with CIC Bacau,
the beneficiary. Some special constructionl-erection works (Insulator,
equipment erection, etc.) were carried out by specialized construction
erection units (Trustul de Montaj Utilaj Chimic Bucuresti, Trustul de
lucrari Speciale Bucuresti) based on the contracts concluded with Bacau
Industrial Construction Trust. The responsibility of the execution in time
and of good quality of all the works of the Project rested to Industrial
Construction Trust Bacau.
F.   Capital Cost, Financing Plan and Disbursements
A)   Capital Cost
3.18     Total Capital Cost for the Project was Lei 3,538 million (US$189,3
million). This amount is within that considered at the time of appraisal
(Lei 4,015 million - US$200,8 million). The actual project cost in foreign
currency amounted to US$67,7 million, while those in local currency Lei
121,6 million dollars equivalent, which represent 77,8% and 106.9%
respectively of the initial estimates. At the same time, project costs in
local currency includes an indirect foreign exchange cost, taking into
account foreign exchange cost related to indirect imports. Such costs, are
included in several components of the Project's local cost, respectively
equipment, stainless steel, spare parts, constructions, components
including indirect and consisting of iron ore, energy (for producing the
metal and cement - coke and fuel oil) and other imported components
required for their production.



- 35 -
If the total cost of the Project was within the level estimated at
the time of appraisal, for some items there were recorded expenses overruns
as compared to the Appraisal Report estimates.
Following the delays occured in the Project implementation and
commissioning of the installations, cost overruns were recorded to:
expenditure for design and technical assistance (410.5%), training
(+34.8%); start-up expenditures (+68%), interest rate (+8.6Z) and the
phosgypsum plant (+115%).
Also, following the prices increase and the delays in the project
execution cost overruns were recorded to: equipment (+43.1%), spare parts
(+23.3%), working capital (+36.5%).
But as compared to the level estimated in the Appraisal Report
savings were recorded to erection expenditures (-60%) and constructions
(-35%).
Lei 137 million (US$11,2 million) erection savings could be
explained by including in the project cost some materials and equipment
under the heading "Erection" (control and measuring instruments for CET,
control and measuring instruments of technological equipment for urea
plant, sulfuric acid and ammonia plants, some erection materials as: steel
tubs, elbows, manometers etc.), expenditure which were included under the
heading "Equipment" for achievements.
The above mentioned saving is higher in foreign exchange costs
than in local currency costs due to the change in the conversion rate which
was Lei 20/US$1 at the time of appraisal, Lei 18/US$l on March, 1978 and
Lei 15/US$1 on January 1, 1980.
Lei 262 million (US$11,5 million) savings were recorded in local
currency cost of civil works which had been determined by changing the
design of the storage for bulk products and DAP hall, initially foreseen to
be foreseen to be executed monolith, subsequently being adopted the
solution of using prefab construction materials. The constructor in
collaboration with CIC Bacau and ITTPIC made also other modifications by
using chiper construction materials and reducing their quantity, etc.
At the same time, the estimated local currency costs were
overestimated, since at the time of appraisal it was foreseen a price
increase of 14%, the actual figure being of about 4%.
b)   Financing Plan
3.19     The comparison of the financing plan between appraisal estimates
and the current situation is shown below:

of which:
Local funds (Centrala Funds)                             140,8            121,6
IBRD Funds                                                60,0            60,0
Other External Funds                                          -             7,7
The funds provided by Craiova Fertilizer Central represented 64.2%
of the total financing required; project costs in foreign currency
represented 31,7% out of IBRD funds and 4.1% respectively out of other
external funds.
As was established at appraisal the Bank financed all foreign
expenditures except for working capital (US$8,2 million), foreign equipment
already purchased and financed (US$6,1 million) and US$12,7 million of
imported stainless steel.
Other external funds which consist of credits from Romanian Bank
for Foreign Trade were used for purchasing equipment for ammonia plant
(compressors, turbines). The remaining funds were provided in the form of
equity contributions through allocations form the Central.
c)   Disbursements
3.20     Initially, the closing date of the Bank loan was December 31,
1978. As a result of the delays in Project implementation the Bank agreed
that the closing date be extended until September 30, 1980, at which date
the had been fully disbursed.
3.21     The Schedule of loan disbursements is as follows:

- 37 -
Out of the unallocated amount of US$11,7 million, US$10,1 million
were used to supplement imports as a result of the increase in prices for
equipment and facilities on the world market.
Development of loan disbursement is shown in Annex 4. Up to now,
the borrower reimbursed US$17,8 million (29.7%) in accordance with the
provisions and dates of the Loan Agreement.
IV. PROJECT OPERATION
A.   Development of Production
4.01     The production of DAP and urea plants as main components of the

Development of production for all units is shown in Annex 5.
B.   Nitrous and Phosphate Fertilizer Market
4.02      Annual development of fertilizer demand and supply confirms that
the provisions made at the time of appraisal were realistic - so far as
supply is concerned - and conservative - so far as demand is concerned -
(on the domestic and export market) on the whole fertilizer market. As
shown in Annex 7 an annual increase of 12.2% of estimated output
corresponded to an actual increase of 11.2%. Actual domestic and export
demand, however, registered a substantial increase as compared to the



- 38 -
estimated one:  an average annutal growth rate of 14% compared to 12%
forecasL in 1974.
AR regnrds the development of domestic and export demand, 1t was
recorded an average rate of t1% for thie domesttc demnnd IIa compared to 26%
estimated at the ttme of appraisnl and over 22Z for exports as compared to
11% estimated at appraisal.
4.03      Close characteristics in comparison with the development of
estimated and actual supply and demand as well as with the overall chemical
fertilizer are to be also found within the development by types of
ferttilizer, nitrous nnd phosphnte fertilizer respectively (Annexes 7n and
7b).
In 1980, as compared to the year 1974, nctual production of
nitrous fertilizer increased 2 times, domestic consumption increased 1.3
times and exports increased 3 times. In the Rame period phosphnte
fertilizer output increased 2 times and exports 17 times and domestic
consumption increased 2 times.
4.04      The development of domestic and export market confirmed the
estimates of the Appraisal Report as regards the existence of large
possibilities to meet fertilizer demand, this tendency being generated by
specific conditions of agriculture in Romania, such as land availability,
cropping pattern, crop production goals, soil conditions and availability
of irrigation, investment and other agricultural inputs.
En accordance with the 1981-1985 Five Year Plan provisions, the
prospects for fertilizer sales are favorable, the market ts easy to be
supplied for the capacities recently commissioned including CIC Bacau.
4.05      As concerns Romanian exports (Annexes 7-7c) of nitrous
fertilizer, amounting to 1.4 million tons in 1980, the estimate of the
Appraisal Report was confirmed, regarding the possibility that Romania
becomes one of the largest world exporters of these types of fertilizers
(holding a market share of about 1/7 in the world trade for this type of
products).
The export of nitrous and phosphatic fertilizer increased 3.3 times due to
the favourable international conditions of the period 1979-1980.
For nitrous fertilizer exports, urea held during 1973-1980
leading position, its share in Romanian total fertilizer exports ranged
between 58%-49%.
As it is shown in Annex 7c, although the production doubled
during only a 5 year period its share in total exports diminished
proportionally: 58% in 1975 and 49% in 1980 the export supply being
completed by a range of products.
DAP exports are still in the earlier stage, their share in total
phosphate fertilizer being of 15% in 19%. Their export prospects are,
however, most optimistic, the quantity exported in 1980 was tripled as
compared to the previous year.

V.   ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
5.OL      Due to the noxious emissions (raw materials and/or process
wastes, sulphur oxides, fluorides and gypsum, ammonia and urea) the project
required great care for elimination or, at least, diminishing of chemical
pollution by process discharges. To this end, the designer established
maximum emission levels of 80 kg/hour for sulfur oxides (corresponding to
99.8X sulfur recovery), and 2.kg/hour for fluorides. Water is recirculated
for re-use and is treated before discharging from the plant. Gypsum (about
500,000 TPY), a solid waste from phosphoric acid manufacture is converted
into gypsum wallboard or blocks (about 120,000 TPY) the remainder being
dried and used as agricultural soil conditioner. As a result of the
critical purity levels of boards, blocks and gypsum used in the cement
industry, the design criteria of phosphoric acid technology is nore
critical. IITPIC had to observe severe design norms for emission levels,
as well as product impurities. Concerned with the further reduction of
these levels, by applying adequate design technologies, IITPIC has designed
technically and economically efficient plants with high protection against
pollution for example using double catalysis and absorption technology in
the sulfuric acid plant. The fluoride recovery unit made it possible
to minimize the fluoride emission level from the phosphoric acid
plant thus maintaining air and water pollution at acceptable levels.
5.02      To comply with the environmental pollution control demand
the original design provided 7% of the project cost for pollution
control equipment. So far about 12,5 million (7% of the project
cost have been spent on filters, waste water treatment plants
and other pollution control featuren.
VI.  TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
6.01      CIC Bacau Project contributed to the technology transer
in Romania by applying new process conceptions from import. This
technology trarsferwas facilitated by the participation in project
implementation of various specialists from well-known international
firms giving up-to-date information on the technology and the equipment
being used, providing training of the operating staff on the site and abroad.
As a consequence of the effort to manufacture some imported equipment in
the country in order to diminish or eliminate imports and meet domestic and
export demand by using domestic engineering and equipment manufacturing
capabilities, CIC Bacau produced equipment such as:  phosphoric acid pumps,
grates for phosphogypsum filter, rotors from the aluminium fluoride plant,
polypropylene filtering cloth, spare parts for compressors and turbine, sulfur
filter, sulfur filtering mass 500 m3 sulphuric acid pumps, etc. High capacity
conveyance means have also been locally manufacture.
Being directly involved in the implementation of the Project,
Romanian equpment suppliers succeeded to achieve remarkable technical per-
formances manufacturing for the first time in Romania equipment of high
technical complexity and accuracy such as: carbamate condesor, reactor,
stripper and scrubber, etc., the experience gained on this occasion as well
as the material basis used being, in prospect, positive premises for export
offers. Welding and finishing works have been highly appreciated by the
licensors. At present, Romanian equipment suppliers are already participating
with their suppliers (technology aid plant) to fertilizer projects in other
countries. Furthermore, as a consequence of the wide experience acquired,



- 40 -
the Romanian personnel is in a position to offer consulting services for
design and technical assistance on site for erection, tests running and
commissioning of exported plants.

Annex 6. T|he unfulfilment of the benefit *b the level estimatdo in
the Appraisal isport had been caused by the delayed ooumissioning
