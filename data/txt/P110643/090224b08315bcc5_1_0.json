Programmatic\n            Electricity Sector Development Project and Second and Third\n            Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project were as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank can maximize its development\n            impact by concentrating its strategic engagement including\n            its lending and advisory support in sectors with track\n            records of success. A well-designed programmatic DPL can be\n            a key instrument in the Bank's long-term engagement.\n            The DPL instrument can leverage the Bank\u2019s strengths on\n            technical advice, convening power, and credibility to help\n            support sector reforms that can have substantial impacts.\n            Prior actions should focus selectively on those reforms that\n            are critical to achieving project objectives but are\n            difficult to undertake because of political or institutional\n            resistance. Prior actions should also ensure that they are\n            additional to what will occur in the absence of the DPL\n            operation. DPLs can achieve good outcomes when they serve as\n            the culmination of a process of engagement, as in the\n            electricity sector in Turkey. A comprehensive yet well\n            integrated set of market reforms can provide credible\n            signals and incentives to private investors. Changing laws\n            and regulations may not have much impact on environmental\n            outcomes when environmental management agencies are weak and\n            lack implementation and enforcement capacity. A Bank DPL may\n            have little additional impact if the design does not fully\n            incorporate the existing political and institutional motivations."}, "docdt": "2015-09-25T01:20:00Z"}
