The objectives of DPL 2 policy areas\n            are to: (a) strengthen budget management, (b) create a more\n            efficient civil service, (c) reduce the role of the state in\n            commercial areas of the economy, (d) improve public\n            corporate governance, and (e) remove administrative barriers\n            to doing business. The reform of the business climate for\n            the private sector takes a more prominent role in the DPL 2,\n            as the government embarks on second generation reforms that\n            include licensing reforms, investment climate reforms, and\n            reform of work permit procedures."}, "docdt": "2010-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
