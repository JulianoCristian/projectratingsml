                         Comprehensiveness of information included in budget
                          documentation improves (from D in 2008 to C or better in 2011 in

Risks and Risk   The implementation of the proposed reform program faces the
Mitigation       following possible risks: (a) external shocks including those
                 associated with a global economic downturn, tourism related shocks
                 such as terrorism, volcanic ash disruptions of air travel, and the impact
                 of a (potential) fall in demand from the eurozone on tourism receipts;
                 (b) unplanned         emergency expenditures from capital under-
                 investments derail the fiscal program; (c) piracy attacks may force
                 international fishing vessels to abandon or reduce fishing operations,
                 reducing fishing license revenues and economic activity; (d) reduced
                 momentum and or ownership of the policy reforms in the run up to
                 2011 elections, resulting in implementation slippages; (e) fiduciary
                 risks include limited capacity of the Central Bank, weaknesses in
                 public financial management systems including relatively weak
                 capacity in accounting, and the moderate capacity of the external and
                 internal audit offices, (f) capacity constraints may stall design or
                 implementation of reforms, and (g) natural disasters, including
                 tsunamis, cyclones and rising sea levels due to climate change. The
                 Government has taken the following mitigation measures respectively:
                 (a) introduced policies to improve the business climate with a view to
                 leveling the playing field across sectors and across foreign and
                 domestic investors, in order to develop the private sector and diversify
                 the economy, (b) attempted to bring about improved management
                 practices at the Public Utilities Corporation through a management
                 contract with an international utility firm, and budgeting US$10
                 million as a development grant in 2010, (c) the coast guard has
                 worked with US and French assistance to protect territorial waters,
                 and established a special forces unit, (d) demonstrated clear
                 Presidential commitment to the reforms during the Cabinet reshuffle
                 which placed Minister of Finance as Vice President, (e) implemented
                 an action plan to address the fiduciary risks identified in the IMF
                 safeguards report; (f) sought technical assistance for capacity building
                 from development partners and allocated additional resources for
                 training and education and is reforming the work permit procedures to
                 facilitate hiring of expatriate skills where local shortages exist; and (g)
                 the government is developing a natural disaster risk assessment and
                 risk mitigation and emergency preparedness strategy.

    INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                   PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
           PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN


                                  I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      A second development policy loan (DPL 2) is proposed for Seychelles to support
the economic reform strategy of the Government. The proposed operation involves a
single tranche of 6.6 million (US$9 million equivalent). While a programmatic
development policy operation and a stand-alone operation were both considered, the DPL 2 is
designed as a stand-alone operation, consistent with the approach in the Bank's Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) 2010­12. The objective of the proposed operation is to assist the
government to improve public sector effectiveness and to improve the business climate. The
DPL 2 supports the continued progress and consolidation of reforms started in 2009, which
were supported by the First DPL approved by the Board in November 2009. This could
create the foundation for programmatic development policy loan support in the future, should
this become part of the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy to follow the ISN. The
Borrower has established a good track record and the economic reform agenda has advanced
considerably over the last 12 months. The DPL 2 supports a second generation of reforms to
improve public sector effectiveness and improve the business climate. Seychelles has also
improved considerably its creditworthiness and, while remaining vulnerable to shocks, has
also brought its debt to GDP ratios down to sustainable levels. The two DPL operations in
the ISN (each of US$9 million) are within the Bank's creditworthiness exposure limit.

2.      Sound macroeconomic policies are in place and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program (approved in December 2009) is on
track. Macroeconomic stability has been achieved through decisive implementation in
2008­09 of an economic adjustment program. Critically, the government moved to float the
rupee in November 2008. The currency market is now fully functioning, with regular
transactions taking place in the newly created inter-bank foreign exchange market. The
parallel foreign exchange market has disappeared. The government also consolidated fiscal
policy in 2008 and 2009, and implemented sound monetary policy aimed at maintaining
inflation in the low single digits, in line with major trading partners' inflation. Following the
successful completion in November 2008 of a two-year Stand-by Arrangement, the IMF
approved in December 2009 a three-year program under the EFF. The Government has met,
and even exceeded, the performance targets of the program. It is also on track to achieve
structural benchmarks that focus on: (a) improving public financial management (PFM), (b)
reforming the tax system, (c) redefining the role and raising the performance of public
enterprises, and (d) bolstering the financial system. The May 2010 first review of the EFF
concluded that the macroeconomic performance under the program has been good, and that
the economy has shown remarkable resilience to the domestic debt crisis in 2008 and the
global financial crisis in 2009. The macroeconomic framework is robust, as shown by low
and stable inflation rates since March 2009, a stable exchange rate, growing international
reserves, an improved debt sustainability position, and good fiscal performance in 2010.

3.      The economic outlook is positive, with rates of real GDP growth expected to be 4
percent in 2010 and 5 percent in 2011. However, the economy remains vulnerable to
external shocks, due to its deep integration with the global economy. The Seychelles
economy is predominantly based on tourism (25 percent of GDP). Of the tourist arrivals,
seventy-five percent originate in Europe. However, despite the weak recovery in Europe,
tourist arrivals have grown steadily since the second half of 2009. As of August 2010, tourist
arrivals were 13 percent above the same period in 2009. The government's strategy to
improve the business climate aims to encourage not only more foreign direct investment (a
strategy relied upon heavily prior to the adjustment in 20081), but to also make it more
attractive for domestic entrepreneurs to invest in hotels, guest houses and tourism-related
services. While scope for diversification is limited by the small size of the island-economy,
the government has successfully implemented a tourism marketing strategy aimed at
attracting visitors from non-European countries (especially Asia and Africa), and promoting
the smaller and less expensive hotels. Heavy discounting by the 4 and 5 star hotels also
helped to raise occupancy rates. The construction sector (accounting for 5 percent of GDP)
has also grown, with three large resorts under construction in 2009 (one opened in 2010, and
two additional resorts are due to open in 2011). The fisheries sector represents a potential
source of economic growth, although the sector also faces risks from climate change, over-
fishing, and piracy.

                                    II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

4.      The Republic of Seychelles is a remote, upper-middle income island-state with an
estimated population of 87,298 (2009). Per capita income is high, at around US$9,028
(2009). The Seychelles comprises 115 tropical islands spread over 1.37 million square
kilometers in the Indian Ocean. Ten of the islands are inhabited. Around 90 percent of the
population lives on the largest island, Mahé, where the capital, Victoria, is located. The
limited land, capital, and human resources restrict the country's ability to benefit from
economies of scale in production and economic diversification. External trade accounts for
150 percent of GDP, and the Seychelles relies on imports for oil, food, almost all raw
materials, products, and specialized services. The country is thus highly vulnerable to global
economic shocks and terms-of-trade shocks. The overall size of the economy is small (GDP
was US$790 million in 2009). It is pre-dominantly service based, with tourism accounting
for 25 percent of GDP, 25­30 percent of employment and 70 percent of foreign exchange
earnings; and financial and professional services making up 22.5 percent of GDP. The
Seychelles enjoys an exclusive economic zone of almost 1.4 million square kilometers in one
of the world's major tuna fishing grounds. However, the lack of backward linkages in the
local economy means that direct and indirect tuna fishing and processing activities combined
account for only 5.5 percent of GDP, about 7 percent of jobs and around 35 percent of goods
exports. The manufacturing sector, which includes the tuna cannery and small food and
beverage enterprises, comprises 8 percent of GDP. The construction sector contributes 5
percent of GDP. Agriculture and artisanal fisheries sectors are small at less than 3 percent of
GDP combined. The business climate has been characterized by cumbersome regulation, and
the Seychelles is ranked 111 out of 183 countries in the International Finance Corporation
(IFC)/World Bank's Doing Business 2010 (from 90 out of 178 countries in 2008). The main
macroeconomic indicators are shown in Table 1.

5.      Until 2008, the government pursued a state-led economic model of self-
sufficiency and direct intervention in manufacturing, distribution, trade and other
economic activities through parastatals. External aid which had been used to finance
expansionary government spending began to dry up in the 1990s, and the government turned
to less concessionary financing and ultimately short-term commercial borrowing to finance
an aggressive investment program, further expanding the reach of the state. The government
relied on extensive and opaque regulations, widespread and discretionary control on trade,
prices, and foreign exchange to manage wide fiscal and current account deficits. Fiscal
deficits were at the heart of the economic problems that surfaced in 2008, and averaged 16
percent of GDP between 1996 and 2002. The public debt to GDP burden rose rapidly (and
averaged 180 percent of GDP during 2000­05). An attempt to reduce the fiscal deficit during
2003­05 was successful but short-lived, relying on short-term (capital) expenditure cuts and
revenue raising measures. Expenditures rose soon thereafter in the run up to the presidential
and parliamentary elections in 2006 and 2007, resulting in a construction boom and economic
growth. In 2008 rising global commodity prices precipitated a debt crisis. The informal
market in foreign currency traded rupees at double the official rate. Scarce foreign exchange
reserves were virtually depleted, and ultimately in mid-2008 debt service payments were
missed, prompting the government to seek assistance from the IMF for an adjustment
program.

6.       The Seychelles has better quality-of-life indicators than many small island states,
and some are comparable to European levels (see Table 2). Seychelles was ranked 57 out
of 182 countries on the United Nation's 2009 Human Development Index (the second highest
of any African country), and has met the target for most of the eight Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The state provides free pre-primary, primary, secondary, and
vocational educational services and subsidizes attendance at university, including at overseas
institutions. The primary net enrollment rate is 99 percent, while the secondary net
enrollment rate is 94 percent. While slightly more boys than girls are enrolled in primary
school, gender parity is reached at secondary level. Additionally, the state provides free
access to health care; Seychelles has better health outcome indicators (such as life expectancy
and child mortality rates) than many other small island states. The country's life expectancy
is 73 years, equal to that of Mauritius. There is a cash transfer safety net, which was
introduced in 2009, to assist households falling below a minimum income. The government
also transfers grants to non-governmental agencies to provide social programs to assist
vulnerable groups.

7.      Since 1993 the Seychelles has been a multi-party democracy (in effect a two-
party system), holding free and fair elections every five years. This has resulted in
political stability. The constitution provides for freedom of association. The government
owns the daily newspaper, The Nation, and the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation. Other
newspapers are also in circulation and widespread use of the internet provides opportunities
for free expression. Concerns over government corruption have focused on the lack of
transparency in the privatization process during the 1990s and the allocation of government-
owned land. Transparency International's corruption perceptions index in 2009 ranked
Seychelles 54 out of 180 countries, up slightly from its 2007 ranking of 57.

Recent Economic Developments

8.       Following the debt default in 2008, the government adhered to a macroeconomic
stabilization program, restructured 88 percent of its eligible debt. The economy has now
emerged from a period of debt distress. Preliminary findings from the IMF's Debt
Sustainability Analysis indicate debt sustainability is within reach, although the outlook
remains vulnerable to shocks. The catalyst for the debt crisis was provided by the external
shocks in 2008, as global commodity prices increased rapidly, leading to depleted stocks of
foreign exchange. As a result the government was not able to comply with its external debt
service payments and Standard and Poor's downgraded Seychelles credit rating from B to
"selective default" in July 2008. The government quickly moved to tackle the underlying
causes of the macroeconomic crisis, and liberalized the exchange rate in November 2008 (the
first pillar of the economic reform program), abandoning an overvalued fixed dollar exchange
rate and foreign exchange controls. Subsequently, the government sought assistance and
financial support from the IMF, the World Bank, and other development partners to help the
country transition from the previous unsustainable economic model to a sustainable
development strategy, with a large up-front fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to
address the fiscal problems which also contributed to the debt distress. In addition to the
IMF, the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the European
Commission (EC) have also supported the economic reform program. The international
community combined, provided in 2009 funding of 21.9 million in balance of payments and
budget support.

9.      An impressive fiscal consolidation effort has been successful. Initially through
analytical work, and subsequently through the first Development Policy Loan, the World
Bank provided assistance for fiscal consolidation (the second pillar of the economic reform
program). Through the World Bank's 2009 Public Expenditure Review (PER), the Bank
provided technical advice on reducing the role of the public sector in the economy, improving
efficiency of public spending, and concentrating public resources on providing core public
goods and a means-tested cash-based safety net. Historically, the government had been
playing the role of employer of last resort and provided public services, literally from cradle
to grave. The government played a dominant role in the economy through extensive price
controls and regulations, and participated directly in manufacturing, distribution, trade, and
other economic activities through parastatals. Since 2009, reforms have been underway to
concentrate public spending on delivery of basic services, to reduce the role of the state in the
economy and promote private sector investment, and encourage improved management of
public enterprises. The Bank has extended technical assistance to help improve the
environment for the private sector and to modernize the public sector.

10.     The decisive implementation of the macro stabilization program successfully
stabilized the economy in 2009, and the macroeconomic framework is robust. The
stabilization is evidenced by the low and stable inflation rate since 2009. While consumer
prices rose by 60 percent immediately after the liberalization of foreign exchange (November
2008), prudent monetary policy brought inflation back to single digits by the end of the first
quarter of 2009, where it has since remained. Short-term interest rates on government
securities have also declined sharply from about 30 percent at the start of the year to below 5
percent by the end of 2009. The external current account deficit narrowed during 2009,
reflecting lower imports, better than expected service income, and higher grants. As a result,
gross reserves have steadily increased from near depleted levels at the end of 2008 to US$224
million or 2.3 months of imports by June 2010 (see Table 1). The government has a two-year
record of being on track with fiscal policy and monetary policy targets, consistent with a
robust macroeconomic framework, as shown by the low and stable inflation rate, falling
interest rates, positive economic growth performance since mid-2009, and maintenance of
fiscal balance 2010.

11.      The economy has successfully weathered the double shocks of domestic economic
reforms and the global financial crisis and economic growth recovered quickly in the
second half of 2009. Contrary to pessimistic projections (at the end of 2008, real GDP had
been estimated to fall by 10 percent in 2009), real GDP growth for 2009 was a positive 0.7
percent of GDP, fueled by a rebound in tourist arrivals during in the second half of the year
(see Figure 1). The government, through the Seychelles Tourism Board adopted a new
marketing strategy to attract tourists to Seychelles, and in particular to the smaller and
locally-owned hotels. Tourism arrivals revived in the second half of the year, and by end
2009, tourism arrivals were down by only 1 percent compared with the previous year. They
have continued to grow during the first half of 2010. While yields from the tourism sector
are still lower than in 2008, the strategy successfully helped to steer the economy through a
domestic transition and external economic shock. Much of the rebound in tourism is due to
increased arrivals from Africa and Asia, which were less affected by the global economic
slowdown than Europe. While the fishing sector has been adversely affected by the rise of
piracy attacks and threats in the Indian Ocean over the past couple of years, the government
took mitigating measures to strengthen the coast guard and work with international partners
to improve their ability to defend against piracy attacks.

12.    The strong fiscal adjustment resulted in an impressive primary surplus of 14.8
percent of GDP in 2009, and the surplus has been sustained during the first half of 2010.
The government's fiscal reform program aimed to improve the credibility of the budget
through better control of expenditures and improved PFM, by establishing binding ceilings
and limiting intra-year rises in spending. The government program also strengthened revenue
management by broadening and simplifying the tax regime. Parliament enacted several laws
to improve PFM, including the Public Debt Management Act, the Public Officers Ethics Act,
and the Public Procurement Act. A treasury single account was also introduced to better
control better the execution of the budget. Budget execution rates have considerably
improved as a result. The government also introduced structural reforms to address the root
causes of the fiscal crisis. These included a series of functional reviews across government
and the downsizing of the civil service in 2009, which resulted in a 15 percent reduction in
the workforce (largely at lower grades) and a decline in the overall wage bill from 10.2
percent of GDP in 2007 to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2009.2 Secondly, the government took the
decision to reduce universal subsidies to public entities, which had previously been used to
maintain low prices for staple food items, utilities, and transportation. In place of universal
subsidies, the government introduced a targeted safety net, aimed at ensuring that low-
income households have access to sufficient resources to sustain a minimum living standard.

13.      The fiscal framework is appropriate, facilitating a reduction in public debt and
gradually increasing capital expenditures in the medium term. The rebound in the
economy has buoyed tax revenues in the first half of 2010. As a result, together with tight
expenditure controls, the fiscal performance in the first half of 2010 resulted in a better-than
expected fiscal surplus. Revenue projections for 2010 were revised upwards by SR 124
million or 1.1 percent of GDP, and the primary balance target for 2010 was raised by SR 62
million to 7.4 percent of GDP. The government will allow capital spending under the
contingency fund to increase in the second half of the year, but will save approximately half
of the additional revenue to mitigate potential risks. The main risks currently facing the
fiscal framework stem from an underinvestment in recent years in physical infrastructure by

    Through early retirements, voluntary departures, and a hiring freeze.

                                                                            7
the Public Utilities Corporation. The financial performance of parastatals is coming under
greater scrutiny since the Public Enterprise Monitoring Act was introduced at the end of
2009, which should improve the government's ability to manage fiscal risks arising from the
sector.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

14.     There is a robust macroeconomic and fiscal framework in place and the
conditions for development policy lending exist. The Bank's view is based on the good
macroeconomic performance during the first half of 2010, and is consistent with the most
recent IMF review (May 2010) which confirmed that the IMF program is on track and fiscal
performance is so far exceeding expectations. The significant progress made with the debt
restructuring provides comfort that the outstanding debt stock can be serviced over the
medium term and that the period of debt distress is over. Additionally, the economic revival
since mid-2009 has continued into 2010 with a rebound in tourist arrivals and length of stay.

15.     Economic growth is expected to rebound to 4 percent in 2010 and 5 percent in
2011, up from 0.7 percent in 2009. Those official projections, consistent with the IMF and
Bank forecasts, are based on the revival of the tourism sector due to the opening of three
large, high-end hotels in 2010 and 2011 and improved global economic prospects (earnings
from the sector are estimated to grow by 8 percent during 2010). The threats to the fishing
sector should be mitigated to some extent through increased capacity of the Seychelles coast
guard and the presence of the U.S. defense forces in the region as well as new regional
counter-piracy initiatives being implemented under the leadership of the European
Commission.3 In the medium-term, economic prospects for domestic business are also
improving now that foreign exchange has become freely available. The complementary
reforms in the government's structural reform agenda, which will simplify the red tape
associated with starting and running a business in Seychelles, will further enhance the
prospects for private sector-led growth. Those relatively good prospects remain highly
vulnerable to external shocks, and the impact of the euro crisis 2010 on tourism and
international trade flows has still to be estimated.

    A counter-piracy symposium was held in the Seychelles during July 14­15, 2010. The United Kingdom is
heading the international "contact group on piracy off the coast of Somalia," which is examining the regional
needs for capacity building in counter-piracy.

                               Box 1: Debt Service Payments under Restructuring
The debt restructuring program over the last 18 months has dramatically changed the debt stock and
debt service outlook for the Seychelles Restructuring agreements have resulted not only in the
cancellation of approximately US$313 million in principal, accrued interest, and other charges, but
have introduced a repayment schedule with long maturities; spreading debt service payments out over
the medium term (see Figure 2). External debt service is projected to gradually rise under the
restructuring agreements and peak in 2017 at approximately 2.5 percent of GDP, before falling to near
less than 1 percent of GDP from 2027.

16.     Improved creditworthiness--Fitch Ratings assigned a single-B rating with a
positive outlook in March 2010--contributes to encouraging macroeconomic prospects.
Public debt stocks declined from 128.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2009 to approximately
82.4 percent of GDP by the end of July 2010 and external debt stocks declined from 82.8
percent of GDP to 53.8 percent of GDP over the same period. Improved credit worthiness
has been achieved as a result of the debt restructuring agreements reached with public and
private creditors over the past two years (see Table 1 and Box 1). Following the Seychelles's
commitment to an IMF Stand-By Arrangement, Paris Club creditors granted exceptional debt
treatment to Seychelles under the Evian approach in April 2009, reducing the debt stock by
45 percent in nominal terms in two tranches in July 2009 and July 2010. The remainder of
the Paris Club debt has been rescheduled over 18 years with a 5-year grace period. Several
non Paris Club bilateral deals have also been concluded. Bilateral agreements have been
concluded with India, China, Kuwait and Algeria. An agreement has already been reached
with Exim Bank of Malaysia for a debt write off of 45 percent which is around US$5.6
million. Libya in February 2010 also agreed to restructure its loan by writing off an amount
of US$3 million and rescheduling the remaining balance of US$4 million. On June 8, 2010,
India also announced it will write off 45 percent of Seychelles' debt and reschedule the rest
over a 20-year period with the interest rate halved. In February 2010, the country's
commercial debt exchange offer closed successfully with a 50 percent debt cancellation
through the restructuring of claims with a face value of US$320 million, including the
US$230 million eurobond, and the 55 million amortizing notes and commercial bank loans
held by three banks. This commercial debt exchange was supported by a US$10 million

                                                           9
policy-based guarantee from the AfDB and an agreement with Barclays Bank. As of end July
2010, debt outstanding to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) is US$8.3 million, or 1.8 percent of the total.

17.     The as yet un-restructured debt now amounts to only 15 percent of GDP. Only
one bilateral and one commercial creditor have not yet indicated agreement to restructure
debt along comparable Paris Club terms. The non Paris Club creditor debt and commercial
bank debt not yet restructured totals US$149 million as of February 2010. The government
continues to negotiate with these creditors and hopes to secure a further total debt
cancellation of 45 percent. If this is achieved, debt stocks will fall by another US$67 million.

18.      Preliminary findings from the IMF's debt sustainability analysis, which is still
under discussion with the authorities, indicate that debt sustainability is now within
reach, but the outlook remains vulnerable to shocks. Both the external debt and public
debt profiles are projected to decrease to sustainable levels. The external debt service
projections will remain vulnerable, in particular to exchange rate changes or current account
shocks, and the total public debt sustainability is also vulnerable to changes in the interest
rate, fiscal outturn and GDP growth.

III.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

19.    The reforms undertaken to improve public sector effectiveness and the business
climate have been successful, and demonstrate a strong track record and commitment
by the government of Seychelles. The key reform program actions implemented since
November 2008 are:

       Liberalization of the exchange rate regime from November 1, 2008 eliminating all
       restrictions, and floating the rupee.
       Improved fiscal policy and control of public expenditures leading to a primary surplus
       of 14.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2010.
       Reform of the monetary policy framework to focus on liquidity management based on
       indirect instruments.
       Introduction of new public procurement legislation and practices based on
       international best practice.
       The reduction of the state in the economy through privatization of commercial units.
       Improved corporate governance and oversight of the public enterprise sector.
       A revised tax regime eliminating tax incentive differentials in certain economic
       sectors, and introducing a new business tax and new personal income tax.
       Removal of cumbersome licensing requirements and prior-approvals for investments.

20.    The government has maintained its commitment to the economic reform
program as articulated in the Letter of Development Policy for DPL 1 and the IMF's
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) document. The government
is developing a medium-term development strategy to update Vision 2017 (which was
launched in 2007). For now, the reform program guiding economic policy is described in the
MEFP and Letter of Development Policy for DPL 2, and expressed in the 2010 budget
speech by the Minister of Finance (November 2009). High-level commitment to the
economic reform program is expressed in the president's state of the nation speech (February
2010) and the president's national day speech (June 2010). The government's objectives are

                                              10
to consolidate macroeconomic stability; complete debt restructuring and achieve external
sustainability, improve economic efficiency, and raise growth through the implementation of
a second generation of structural reforms. The economic policies will continue to pursue
fiscal policy in line with debt sustainability targets, using the primary fiscal surplus as the
fiscal policy anchor. Price stability will continue to be the main objective of monetary
policy. The government remains committed to the floating exchange rate policy.
Negotiations with external creditors will continue with the aim of normalizing relations and
concluding all debt restructuring.

21.    The government's priorities for second generation reforms are to:

       Continue implementation of reforms to improve the performance of the public
       administration, as committed to in the cabinet-approved Memorandum of Action on
       Public Sector Reform Policies.
       Improve PFM practices and implement a comprehensive medium-term PFM action
       plan.
       Complete the tax reforms with the introduction of a value added tax in January 2012.
       Complete negotiations to restructure public debt.
       Continue implementation of policy measures aimed at lowering the cost of doing
       business.
       Strengthen the governance arrangements and oversight of commercial public
       enterprises to reduce fiscal risks and ensure a level playing field with private
       commercial activities.

22.     The reforms to improve public sector effectiveness are part of a continuum
aimed at creating a business climate that is supportive of the private sector. The
dismantling of the Seychelles Marketing Board, elimination of the role of the public sector as
employer of last resort, and liberalization of exchange rates, can be seen as essential building
blocks of a comprehensive framework, under which the government is redefining the role of
the state to that of policy maker and facilitator of private sector activity. This role includes
that of an appropriate regulator, to help strengthen the institutional framework necessary for
the private sector to function. Towards this end, the current reforms include establishment of
a Fair Trading Commission to promote competition in the marketplace, and enactment of a
modern Licenses Act, and an Investment Act that will provide investor protection and
streamline investment approvals. All this will supplement the reform of the tax regime that
among other things will improve both the efficiency of the indirect tax system and external
competitiveness through the introduction of a value added tax in 2012, to replace the existing
goods and sales taxes. These reforms are part of a medium-term agenda to help the private
sector realize its potential as the engine of growth. Next steps in this agenda could include
the privatization of the partially state-owned bank, Nouvobanq; restructuring of the
government-owned national airline, Air Seychelles; modernization of companies' legislation;
the introduction of insolvency legislation to provide for orderly business exits; and measures
strengthen enforcement of commercial contracts. Such an agenda could also include steps to
introduce private sector participation in providing infrastructure services (such as electricity),
which could improve their performance and reduce their costs.

23.   Implementation of the Memorandum on Public Administration Reform and the
PFM Reform Action Plan 2009­2011 is continuing. This will ensure that gains made in
2009 are deepened in 2010 and over the medium term. The government reform program

                                               11
includes the implementation of two detailed action plans for public administration and PFM
reforms. There is clear government commitment to both the public administration and PFM
reforms as evidenced by the establishment of the two technical committees set up to
implement both of these, which meet regularly and report directly to the Vice President and
Minister for Finance whose portfolio includes both of these critical reform areas.

24.     The success of the government's reform program to date is to a large extent the
result of a well-designed and implemented communications strategy and a participatory
approach. To ensure that the public understood the gravity of the economic crisis and the
measures required to recover from it, the president and key government officials conducted a
series of meetings to explain to citizens the objectives of the reform program, its specific
design features, and its expected outcomes, and to address their concerns. Newspapers,
television, government websites, and widely distributed newsletters carried the messages.
The small size of the Seychelles allows for extensive consultations at reasonable cost. The
State House produces a monthly newsletter to provide details of the reforms underway. The
newsletter is distributed to all government offices and is posted on its website. In the state of
the nation addresses in February 2009 and 2010, the president discussed the status of the
ongoing reforms and unveiled the measures to be implemented during the coming months.
The Minister of Finance holds regular press conferences (starting in October 2008). The
head of the new Social Welfare Agency also gives regular interviews to explain how to
access welfare assistance. The communications' initiatives have been effective, as
demonstrated by the broad public support for the reform agenda.

25.     The World Bank and IMF have also participated in the communications efforts,
by presenting their analytical work in support of the government's program. In
particular, detailed presentations were made at the Development Partners Forum in May
2009, a PER dissemination event in July 2009, and an event in November 2009 marking the
first anniversary of the exchange rate liberalization. During these occasions, both the IMF
and World Bank staff presented their work at a meeting of key stakeholders, and held
meetings with the business community, parliamentarians, and representatives of the civil
society to learn the views of a broad cross section of society. A new parliamentary
committee (the Economic Reform Oversight Committee) was established with a view to
widen ownership of the reform program (although only the majority party chose to
participate). The business community has broadly supported the reforms aimed at improving
the investment climate. Civil society organizations have helped to implement social
programs with funding from the government and the EC. Impact evaluations of the programs
show that targeted grants programs for specific groups have been very successful at assisting
those affected by the reforms (people who left the public service) and other vulnerable groups
(such as commercial sex workers).

26.    Seychelles' reform strategy has been grounded on a large and upfront fiscal
adjustment, aimed at achieving a sustainable fiscal balance. Total revenues and grants
rose to an estimated 38.8 percent of GDP in 2009. They are expected to stabilize at 33
percent of GDP between 2010 and 2012. Total expenditures and net lending amounted to
about 33.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and are expected to be brought down to 31.3 percent of
GDP in 2011 and allowing for a gradual increase in capital spending, to increase to 32.3
percent of GDP in 2012. The debt default followed a history of an unsustainable fiscal policy
in support of a broad public sector role in development and a generous welfare state, as well
as an over-valued exchange rate. Fiscal tightening began in 2008, and resulted in a large

                                               12
adjustment of the primary balance from ­2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 14.8 percent of GDP
(including grants) in 2009. Over the medium-term, the fiscal adjustment will ease and
primary surpluses are projected to fall to more modest levels of 7.4 percent of GDP in 2009
and 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This is line with the debt sustainability projections, and will
allow for gradual resumption in capital investments over the medium term. The base case
fiscal scenario is given in Table 3 below, which shows the expenditure consolidation that
took place during 2009, as public administration reforms reduced the public sector wage bill.
Furthermore, the reform of the public enterprise sector and the elimination of subsidies
resulted in a fall in public sector transfers of 3 percent of GDP in 2008 and 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2009. The public wage bill is expected to stabilize in 2011, once the contracting out
of some public services is complete. This shift will result in a permanent increase in
spending on goods and services starting in 2010, but will potentially allow for efficiency
gains to be realized once the contracts are re-tendered in two year's time.

27.     Further reductions in public spending are anticipated as the debt restructuring
results in lower interest payments over the medium term, and public administration
reforms continues to improve the efficiency of public spending. To date, reductions in
public spending were achieved by eliminating direct and indirect subsidies and by
significantly lowering the real public sector wage bill by reducing the number of public
sector employees. The Bank's 2009 PER recommended measures to achieve this wage bill
target over the medium term, and in a way that would not undermine delivery of key social
services. The success of these reforms is evident: subsidies to state owned enterprises fell
from SR 239 million (2007) to SR 47.5 million (2009), the number of civil servants and
parastatals employees fell from 16,615 (April 2008) to 14,075 (April 2009),4 and the public
sector wage bill fell from 10.2 percent of GDP (2007) to 7.4 percent of GDP (2009).5

28.     The government has proceeded to improve the quality of public financial
management. A new Public Procurement Act was introduced in 2008 and competitive
practices have become standard in government procurement. The large budget execution
deviations caused by intra-year additional spending requests have fallen as a result of the
improved budget coverage, preparation of binding budget ceilings at the start of the budget
process, and in-year control over additional requests. The single treasury account has also
helped to improve cash management and all ministries' bank accounts have been closed. The
introduction of a treasury single account in late 2009 has improved the government's
capacity to monitor and control cash balances. A quarterly budget release system for current
expenditures and monthly release system for authorities has been introduced. A summary of
the public financial management issues and proposed actions and timing for implementation
is provided in Annex 6. There has been considerable progress in 2009 and 2010 with the
PFM reforms to (a) improve the comprehensiveness of the budget by incorporating off-
budget expenditures and to ensure consistent budget treatment of public entities and (b) to
improve the credibility of the budget by ensuring that macroeconomic indicators are used to
drive estimates of revenues and expenditures for the following year.

29.     A new unit (the fiscal analysis branch) in the Ministry of Finance is responsible
for the production of internally consistent projections of main macroeconomic
aggregates for budget preparation. The unit, which was created in 2009 in the Seychelles
Revenue Commission and transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 2010, has developed an
excel-based consistency framework which is being used to ensure that the budget is prepared
consistent with the macroeconomic (GDP data, balance of payments data), financial
(monetary data), and fiscal sectors outlook. Work is underway to strengthen the revenue
forecasting at detailed (individual tax payer) levels and to ensure that forecasts are consistent
with macroeconomic projections. For 2011 budget preparation, the model has been used to
drive the fiscal framework and preparation of the binding ministerial budget ceilings.
Starting with the 2011 Budget, the Ministry of Finance has also prepared a Budget Strategy
and Outlook Paper, 2011 (which was approved by cabinet) that provides a medium-term
budget framework which presents the government's fiscal and economic projections over a
three-year period. The Budget Strategy and Outlook Paper provides details, in particular of
the revenue projections that form the basis of the annual budget preparation. It is important
in that it provides to the Cabinet an early indication of the likely resource envelope for the
next annual budget cycle and a medium term perspective, arising from the detailed bottom-up
revenue projections and explains the overarching objective of the fiscal policy stance, in this
case debt sustainability. It also provides some indication of the broad priorities for
expenditures in the medium term context. The PFM action plan also includes plans to revise
the chart of accounts with IMF technical assistance.

30.     Work is proceeding with plans to develop a consistent and comprehensive view
of the public sector, and the 2011 budget will build on the 2010 improvements in the
budget coverage. The government has adopted the IMF's Government Finance Statistics
Manual for "general government." While in 2010 the Social Security Fund was brought on
budget, in 2011 the budget will incorporate the pension fund into the general government
accounts. Based on the general government classification, new accounts and monitoring
reports are being prepared and have started to be published.




                                               14
31.     The government has implemented a reform program to contract out ancillary
services. Experience in contracting out has shown mixed results. While the cost of
contracting cleaning services for ministries and departments has been high, this is mostly due
to temporary measures designed to mitigate the impact on staff, which will be phased out in
2011. School cleaning services, however, have attracted competition with 70 companies
competing for 23 lots for the contacts to be issued for the school year 2010/2011, allowing
government to obtain better prices and services. School meal and textbook services have also
been contracted out to previous in-house providers. While initially the reform has entailed
additional costs, it will over the medium term have a positive impact in two ways. First, it
will enhance the ability of the Seychelles public service to attract and retain qualified staff, as
wage increases for senior level staff in particular will be easier to accommodate. Second, the
state will continue to procure cooking, cleaning, and security services through competitive
bidding processes, thus stimulating competition in the emerging private sector. The cleaners'
cooperative, which has taken on most of the cleaners that went off payroll in 2010, has
started offering services to other companies, which should ensure its viability once the
temporary support from the government is phased out.

32.    The adoption and implementation of a new wage grid in 2010 has significantly
enhanced transparency and predictability of the wage bill. The grid as applied from
January 1, 2010, integrated allowances and supplements into base pay, promoting
transparency and fairness. By April 2010 all staff of core ministries and agencies had been
placed on the new grid, and the system became fully operational. Whereas there have been
some complaints about the process of migrating staff (in particular the allocation of steps),
these have been dealt with through a verification exercise, which was completed in June
2010. Staff on contracts (about 469 senior officials, including all principal secretaries) will
be placed on the new wage grid at the time contracts are renewed.

33.      Looking forward, the wage bill should start to stabilize and the introduction of
the new wage grid will be modified to demonstrate the far fewer numbers employed
(and therefore grades required) at the lower end of the grade structure. In this regard, a
process of evaluating the wage grid implementation was launched in July 2010. The
evaluation will assist with the further simplification of the wage grid, to reflect the
progressive contracting out of non-core functions in all state bodies. Through a functional
review process the government has committed to an improvement in the alignment of
responsibility and skills to remuneration to allow the public sector to retain the much needed
skills in the professional cadres.

34.      A review of the governance, administrative, and financial arrangements of the
broad range of public entities that exist in Seychelles was completed in April 2010, and a
a policy paper re-classifying all public bodies according to their main function
(regulatory, service-delivery, or policy-making) was adopted, taking effect in July 2010.
The policy paper, "Reclassification and Standardization of Budget Dependent Public Bodies"
was adopted by the cabinet on July 21, 2010. The paper defines three main categories of
institutions: policy making, regulation/inspection/licensing, and service delivery (sub-divided
in social services and economic services). It also defines new accountability and financing
mechanisms for regulatory and service delivery institutions. Service delivery institutions that
provide non-core services will henceforth be established as autonomous entities which
finance their operations from fees for services rather than from budget funding. The
government will provide some funding to fill a financing gap during a transition period. This

                                                15
arrangement will result in more transparent financial management and greater efficiency in
the use of public funds. The process of reviewing and revising the legal status of regulatory
and service delivery institutions is ongoing, and the new policy will be fully implemented as
part of the 2011 budget.6 Implementation has already been completed for several important
institutions, including the National Botanic Gardens Foundation, the Homes for the Elderly,
and The Nation newspaper.

35.     The introduction of the targeted safety net in 2009 has effectively ensured that
the country's most vulnerable households have adequate resources to achieve a
minimum standard of living. The number of beneficiaries has decreased in the last year,
and the government program intends to improve both the administration of the program and
compliance with its policies and procedures. The government is committed to improving the
efficiency of the entire social protection system, including the provision of statutory benefits
under the Social Security Act. With World Bank assistance the government is reviewing the
administrative, legal, and financial considerations of merging the Social Welfare Agency and
the Social Security Fund, the country's two principal social security institutions.

36.     Loans made in 2008 to the public enterprises were largely repaid in 2009, and
measures to improve oversight of the public enterprise sector were introduced at the
end of 2009. In 2008, the government made soft loans to the Seychelles Trading Company
prior to the privatization and sale of its commercial units in 2009, which were fully repaid in
2009. During the economic hardship of 2008 and first half of 2009, several of the larger
public enterprises also received soft loans from the government. One recipient, the
Seychelles Petroleum Company, received a loan of SR 650 million (approximately US$65
million) in 2008 to be repaid in two equal tranches in 2009 and 2010. Another was Air
Seychelles which received a SR 30 million line of credit in 2009.

37.     Improved oversight and governance of the public enterprise sector is expected to
continue to have fiscal benefits, both in terms of maintaining low transfers from the
central budget and from containing fiscal risks. The government's public enterprise
reform strategy aims to achieve greater efficiency, transparency, and accountability. Cabinet
has approved a strategic plan for the Public Enterprise Monitoring Division (PEMD) of the
Ministry of Finance. The work program aims to reinforce monitoring and control of public
enterprises by strengthening public corporate governance. The legal basis was approved by
the National Assembly in September 2009 when the Public Enterprise Monitoring and
Control Act was passed. Public entities listed in the Act are required to submit financial
statements to the PEMD, Minister of Finance, and their parent ministry. The Minister of
Finance is then responsible for tabling the reports before the National Assembly. Specific
reforms of several large public enterprises are also on the agenda. A strategic assessment of
Air Seychelles and its ancillary services has recently been completed and the
recommendations are due to be discussed at Cabinet level.

38.    The government program includes a commitment to improve public utility
infrastructure. In 2009, the management of the Public Utilities Corporation (PUC), which

6
     A high level remuneration committee has been established to ensure that the flexibility on wage setting in
category 2 organizations (dealing with regulatory, licensing and inspection functions) will be used in line with
effectiveness and efficiency principles. The committee will also track wage developments in subsidized
organizations. In particular, the committee will ensure that wage levels proposed for specialist professionals
engaged by regulatory agencies are set in line with market-related standards and are not excessive.

                                                       16
provides all water and electricity services, was placed in the hands of a private, international
firm under a management contract. The performance of the firm is under review to ensure
that service delivery improves and that the backlog of necessary maintenance and investment
is reduced. The estimated investment requirements are SR 2 billion (about US$170 million)
over three years. A review of the tariff structure and cross subsidization policies will be
required, since the PUC currently has limited financial capacity to finance the required
investments. Most of the capital expenditure contingency in the 2010 budget is being
earmarked for these investment needs. The management contract itself does not clearly state
the indicators which will be monitored to assess performance. The lack of clarity has been
cause for friction between the contractor and the executive oversight exercised through the
Ministry of Finance, which in turn has impeded the tariff review, given the political
sensitivity of raising tariffs.

39.     Reducing the state's role in commercial activities advanced in the late 1990s and
again in 2008, with the privatization of the commercial units of the former Seychelles
Marketing Board in 2008 and 2009. Since then, the government's reform agenda for the
public enterprise sector has focused on improving the governance and oversight of the large
commercial enterprises and parastatals, as discussed at paragraph 36. In 2010, the
government leased the assets of L'Union Estate to a private operator with a management
contract to run the commercial assets of L'Union Estate. The L'Union Estate is a cultural
heritage enterprise running commercial activities (a farm, tourism chalets, and access to
beaches) on the island of La Digue. The government is also reviewing its ownership role in
the financial sector. The government has requested advice from the IFC on restructuring
plans for the majority state-owned bank, Nouvobanq. The IFC is planning a mission to the
Seychelles in October 2010 to discuss the options with the government. The government is
receiving assistance from the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative
to develop a strategy for the Development Bank of Seychelles and the government-owned
Housing Finance Corporation.

40.     Despite a relatively unfriendly business environment, several foreign firms have
made substantial investments in the tourism sector. The Tourism (Incentives) Act, 2005
and Agriculture and Fisheries (Incentives) Act, 2005 offered a package of tax incentives to
investors. Investors were also entitled to receive incentives awarded under the previous
Investment Promotion Act, 1991. While this strategy to attract new investments in selected
sectors has attracted resources for capital investments and created jobs in the private sector,
this has also come at some cost in terms of foregone tax revenues and created an unlevel
playing field for businesses outside the favored sectors. Furthermore, constraints on the
domestic private sector, through the previously limited availability of foreign exchange and
burdensome regulations, have limited the backward linkages from tourism and fisheries that
would bring about a more broad-based economic growth, with a greater diversity of investor
and employee opportunities.

41.    Liberalization of the exchange rate regime in 2008 dramatically improved the
business climate in the Seychelles. Committed to removing the unnecessary barriers to
private sector activity, the government established the High-Level Committee on Doing
Business in August 2010, chaired by the vice president. The government has made progress
in reducing the administrative barriers to private sector activity, starting with the overhaul of
the 2005 Investment Code. The 2005 Investment Code established the Seychelles Investment
Bureau as the institution in charge of investment promotion, advocacy and investor relations,

                                               17
and investment approvals. The code required a detailed and unlegislated approvals process,
which was found to be time-consuming, expensive, opaque, discretionary, uncertain,
politicized, and largely unnecessary.7 Furthermore, foreign investors were restricted from
entering into areas deemed strategic unless given specific cabinet approval, and were
prohibited from operating in several commercial areas. A memorandum on the Seychelles
Investment Board was approved by the cabinet on September 1, 2010, repealing the code and
thereby eliminating all restricted areas and requirements for investment approvals.

42.     The Licenses Act is also currently being modernized as part of the reform
agenda to improve the business climate. The current regime, managed by the Seychelles
Licensing Authority (SLA) under the Licenses Act 2005, focuses on controls, with virtually
every business activity and premise in the Seychelles requiring a license before beginning
operation. The act specifies separate groups of activities, classified under three schedules,
covering over 180 commercial activities, six types of premises, and five types of vehicles and
vessels. The SLA was also found to undertake a high number of annual inspections (over
20,000 in 2007) to ensure compliance with licensing provisions. This, apart from being a
deterrent for investors, is inefficient, drawing staff resources away from better targeted
inspection focused on threats to the public interest. This approach to business licensing has
been revoked. The new Licenses Act 2010 modernizes the approach and provides the core
principles upon which licensing is based, namely the need to safeguard public safety, health,
and the environment. The act was approved by cabinet on August 4, 2010 and was enacted
by the National Assembly on September 14, 2010.

43.     To promote competition in the marketplace and reduce restrictive business
practices, the Office of Fair Trade has been established under the 2009 Fair Trading
Commission Act to administer regulations specified under a parallel 2009 Fair Trade
Competition Act. The Fair Trading Commission has the mandate to promote competition
policy in the economy, with powers to carry out investigations into the use of restrictive,
collusive, or anti-competitive business practices, and to impose financial penalties, when
appropriate. The new act defines restrictive business practices--including abuse of dominant
position, mergers and price fixing--and specifies procedures for investigation of complaints
and appeal to a tribunal. The office has recently started operating and is currently preparing a
strategic plan for dealing with the various cases of restrictive practices that have already been
brought before the chief executive officer, who reports directly to a commission and has a
degree of freedom from executive and political interference.

44.    Labor market regulations are also being revised to reduce the administrative
requirements for employing expatriate workers and to harmonize the work permit fees
across economic sectors. The system of charging differential fees (for employees hired
outside of a quota system) has been revoked with the Immigration (Amendment) Regulations
2010. The procedure for granting work permits (called gainful occupational permits) for
expatriate employees had been characterized by the non-transparent decision-making, and
lengthy and cumbersome procedures (including for health certificates and other
prerequisites). This has resulted in high transactions cost and uncertainty for employers. To
ensure that employers are able to employ qualified workers, without adversely affecting
employment opportunities for Seychellois, the government is undertaking a review of the

criteria. On September 1, 2010 the cabinet approved the establishment of a multi agency
team, which is tasked with revising the procedures and criteria for issuing the work permits.

45.     The Republic of Seychelles will continue to implement a large tax reform agenda,
targeting almost all the components of the tax system. Reflecting the government's
objective of promoting foreign exchange-earning sectors, preferential treatment (under
incentive acts) was provided to some economic sectors, such that the effective tax rates for
tourism, fisheries, and agriculture were well below the general corporate tax rate, creating a
heavy tax burden on enterprises in other sectors. Licensed accommodation, island resort
hotels, restaurants, casino operators, tour operators, tour guides, and water sport operators
paid only 15 percent on their taxable income, while the first SR 250,000 of taxable income
was tax free (as provided for in the Tourism Incentive Act of 2008, which increased the
threshold from SR 48,000). The farming and fisheries sectors enjoyed the same privileges
under the Agriculture and Fisheries Incentives Act, paying 15 percent as business tax and 0
percent on their first SR 240,000 of taxable income. The tax reforms introduced in the last 12
months and planned for the next 18 months, are intended to improve the business
environment by creating a more level playing field for businesses, improving compliance,
and broadening the tax base.8 A revised Business Tax Act came into effect on January 1,
2010, updating the previous act of 2007 to broaden the base and improve self compliance.
The modifications included: (a) reducing the marginal business tax rate from 40 to 33
percent, (b) abolishing the minimum threshold for companies (compared to the situation at
the end of 2009 where the first SR 250,000 of taxable income was tax free), and (c) reducing
the threshold for sole traders and partnerships from SR 250,000 to SR 150,000. Tax
incentives under the Tourism (Incentive) Act, the Agriculture and Fisheries (Incentive) Act
and the Investment Promotion Act were eliminated with the introduction of the new tax code,
although some fisheries and agricultural exporters pay only 10 percent business tax.
Companies with existing concession agreements were to be gradually brought into the new
tax system.

46.     In July 2010 a new personal income tax (PIT) was introduced which replaced the
social security contributions previously levied on employers and employees. The base of
this new taxation is domestically-sourced wages and salaries for nationals and resident
expatriates, which aims to replace social security contributions, to broaden the income tax
base, and treat businesses in various economic sectors more equally. The tourism, fisheries,
and agriculture sectors benefited from preferential treatment with respect to social security
contributions (under their respective incentives acts, businesses in these sectors had employer
contributions for local workers discounted to 10 percent from 20 percent, and paid no
contribution for foreign employees). The Income and Non-Monetary benefits Tax Act, 2010
came into effect on July 5, 2010. The tax will be levied initially on wages and salaries at
18.75 percent (and 10 percent in the tourism, agriculture, and fisheries sectors to previously
untaxed workers), and then harmonized across all sectors at a rate of 15 percent in January
2011. With the planned reduction to 15 percent in January 2011, corporate and personal
income tax rates will be aligned. In the medium term, the PIT would be levied on rental,
non-monetary and fringe benefits, interest, and dividend income.

8
     Many of Seychelles' multilateral development partners--including the African Development bank (through
the Interim Strategy Note 2009­2010), the IMF (through the third review under the stand-by arrangement), the
World Bank (through the current DPL) and the EC (through the technical assistance it will provide for the
implementation of the value added tax)--have emphasized the importance of the tax policy review for
economic growth.

                                                    19
47.      A value added tax (VAT) is proposed starting in January 2012. The current
general goods and services tax (GST) has been administratively burdensome, and has resulted
in a cascading effect of tax-upon-tax, having the effect of raising the effective tax rate and
increasing the cost of doing business.9 The gradual harmonization of the GST rates, to 12
percent in November 2010 and to 15 percent in November 2012, will prepare for the
introduction of VAT. The introduction of the VAT will eliminate the cascading effect of
taxation on businesses. To prepare for its introduction, the government has requested
technical assistance from the EC and the IMF. The goal is to improve both the efficiency of
the indirect tax system and external competitiveness. The GST reform will not only target
the rates but also the GST base, expanding it to cover a broader range of services and
reducing the cascading effects through the levying of the GST either on imports or on sales.
A new Excise Tax Act and trade tax schedule has been introduced, aiming to meet the
international customs tax commitments through the revision of import taxation rates. While
all the efforts are intended to bring Seychelles's indirect taxation in line with the international
standards, the high rates levied on some commodities help to protect local producers from
possible competition, and therefore do not match with the international standards. These
kinds of measures can have negative impact on several economic sectors as well as on the
investment environment, since the lack of competition keeps local prices higher than would
otherwise be the case. The government intends to document the medium-term policy
objectives for the tax reforms in a policy document which it plans to submit to cabinet.

48.     The government has commenced plans to join the World Trading Organization.
In preparation the government has reduced customs duties from an average applied import
duty of 28.3 percent in 2005 to 8.95 percent in 2007. The customs clearance procedures were
modernized and ASYCUDA++ software has been introduced. In March 2010 the cabinet
approved the customs reform and implementation plan (an EFF structural benchmark). The
government is also on track to implement the COMESA common external tariff by 2013.

    IV.        BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

Link to ISN

49.    The proposed DPL 2 supports the implementation of policy reforms that are
crucial to the success of the Bank's Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The ISN articulates the
World Bank's program for Seychelles from 2009 to 2011, and proposes two development
policy operations during fiscal years 2009­2011, the first and second DPLs. The objective of
the ISN, discussed by the Board on November 5, 2009, is to support the government's
macroeconomic stabilization program in the short run and to initiate the structural reforms
required for private sector led growth. The proposed DPL 2, with its emphasis on deepening
the stabilization reforms and on unlocking business potential, is therefore essential to
achieving the objectives of the ISN.

50.     DPL 2 supports the continued high-level policy dialogue on priority reform
issues, thus creating the foundation for a longer-term World Bank engagement, such as
a Country Partnership Strategy. Such a strategy, due to be prepared in 2011, will continue
to support the government's economic reform and development agenda.

                                                      20
Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

51.    The World Bank has been working very closely with the IMF since 2008. A Joint
Management Action Plan guides the collaboration of the Bank and the IMF teams, and seeks
to prevent duplication of efforts. The Bank has been participating in IMF missions, and close
cooperation exists at all levels of the two institutions.

52.     The Bank is continuing collaboration with the EC and the AfDB. Coordination
among development partners faces challenges because most agencies do not have a
representative based in Seychelles (the World Bank included). To improve coordination, the
development partner teams are collaborating on mission timings to maximum overlap in the
field. Like the Bank, both the EC and AfDB have been strengthening their engagement with
the government in support of the economic reform program over the past two years. There is
complementarity between the IMF, World Bank, EC and AfDB and the programs are
essentially all supporting the macroeconomic stabilization, PFM and private sector
development. The EC has supported the Republic of Seychelles with a budget support
operation through a grant from the European Development Fund. A first tranche of 8
million was disbursed in 2009. A request for disbursement of the 2010 (fixed and variable)
tranche has been made. The AfDB approved its first general budget support operation in
Seychelles, the 15 million economic governance reform program loan, signed into effect on
August 25, 2009. The program's purpose is to promote macroeconomic stability and
sustainable growth in order to rebalance the economy, by improving economic and financial
governance. Its operational objectives are to strengthen PFM and enhance private sector
development, which complements the approach taken in DPL 2. The first tranche of the loan,
amounting to 7.5 million, was disbursed in November 2009. The second and final tranche is
due in 2010 pending revision of the Investment Code. A policy-based guarantee of US$10
million in support of the debt restructuring, was also approved in December 2009.

53.      Seychelles has a relatively small number of bilateral donors. The only European
Union member states with a diplomatic presence in the Seychelles are France and the United
Kingdom. The French government cooperates in the environmental, educational, and cultural
fields, and provides long-term technical assistance, particularly in the fisheries sector. China
has a number of capacity-building programs. A fisheries agreement with China was signed in
June 2006. India has had longstanding technical and financial cooperation with the
Seychelles, and the Seychelles has a number of scholarships and exchanges with Indian
universities. Through the Pan African Network System, India is establishing a satellite
terminal station to facilitate telemedicine. Cuba and Nigeria have bilateral cooperation
agreements, and Australia and Japan provided assistance in the context of the 2004 tsunami.
There has been an increase in Australian technical assistance provided in the last few months
in support of the economic reform program. The Seychelles signed a regional cooperation
agreement with Réunion Island (France) that will allow sharing of a wide range of technical
expertise in areas such as health, training, environment, and natural disaster management.
Umeå University in Sweden has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Seychelles
to enable students, teachers, and in-service personnel from the Seychelles to benefit from
studies and training in Sweden. Furthermore, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, and Spain
have been providing scholarships to Seychelles citizens. Other donors are involved in grants
and soft loans in housing finance.

Relationship to Other Bank Operations

                                              21
54.     The proposed DPL 2 takes forward several of the policy objectives of DPL 1--a
single tranche operation (US$9 million)--approved by the Board in November 2009.10
The policy objectives of DPL 1 were to strengthen budget management, improve governance
and accountability through procurement reforms, create a more efficient civil service,
establish a well-targeted social safety net and reduce the role of the state in the economy.
Many of these policy objectives are taken forward in the second DPL, which supports the
next phase of reforms to strengthen budget management, to improve the efficiency of the
civil service, and to improve governance in the public sector, specifically corporate
governance and oversight of the public enterprise sector. The reform of the business climate
for the private sector takes a more prominent role in the DPL 2, as the government embarks
on second generation reforms that include licensing reforms, investment climate reforms, and
reform of work permit procedures. DPL 2 also continues to monitor progress with the DPL 1
policy objective to roll back the state role in commercial activities, but recognizes that this is
not the focus of the government's reform program in 2010 which is focused on improving
corporate governance (rather than privatization).

55.     Although the overall Bank program in Seychelles is small, several activities
funded under trust funds and through fee based services are assisting the government
with design and implementation of its reform program. The first is a statistical capacity
building project with funding from the Statistics Capacity Building Trust Fund that is helping
the National Statistics Bureau to develop capacity to produce reliable economic data series
including tourism satellite accounts, and update the labor market data series. The second is a
public administration reform project funded under the Institutional Development Fund. This
is aimed at helping the government implement public administration reform program, as
approved by cabinet as a prior action in the first DPL. The third is technical assistance with
funding from a fee-for-services agreement signed in June 2010, which is providing assistance
for public enterprise reform, social security reform, and health reform. The first output, a
study aimed at providing advice on a potential merger of the Social Welfare Agency and the
Social Security Fund, was delivered to the government in June 2010 providing advice on how
to affect the proposed merger, and which functions should be taken outside of the new
agency. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the government in the fisheries
sector, including the construction of an economic and financial model to support more
informed fishing licensing and natural resource management policies.




10
     The World Bank had not had an active engagement with the Seychelles since 2002, when the country went
into suspension status because of payment arrears to the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). The country cleared all its payment arrears by October 2006.

                                                    22
Lessons Learned

56.     The following lessons learned are as documented in the draft Implementation
Completion and Results report for DPL 1, which rated the development outcome to be
satisfactory, the risks to the development outcome to be negligible, the Bank's
performance to be satisfactory and the Borrower's performance to be highly
satisfactory.

57.     The far-reaching reform changes in Seychelles would not have been possible
without government's skillfully-designed communications strategy and efforts to keep
the people informed of the need for reforms and the results. As noted earlier, a well-
designed and methodically implemented communications strategy built public support for
reform in Seychelles. DPL2 will continue to support the government's efforts to make the
reforms as transparent as possible, including through the consultations with NGOs, the
private sector, and parliamentary committees.

58.     The government has offered training and job placement services to people
leaving the civil service, both directly and indirectly through provision of grants to
NGOs in exchange for services. These policies have reduced public resistance to the
reforms, and have also facilitated the successful placement of public sector workers in jobs in
the private sector. The DPL2 supports the government's ongoing efforts to promote private
sector investment and growth, which will result in further creation of jobs. The Bank has
also undertaken an analysis of the country's active labor market policies and provided
suggestions for improving their effectiveness, as part of its forthcoming second PER.

59.     Having in place a social welfare system that protects the truly needy is essential
to facilitate a reduction of the role of the state in the economy. The DPL 1 supported the
government's efforts to operate a targeted safety to ensure that the truly deserving are able to
meet their basic needs. Through the fee-based technical assistance project, the Bank has
continued to support the government further in its aims to ensure that there are no errors of
exclusion/inclusion and that the safety net is administered efficiently. Under this project the
Bank is providing advice on the merger of the Social Welfare Agency and the Social Security
Fund to lower administrative costs and provide better services to clients.

60.     Establishing a good system for monitoring and evaluation helped to keep
implementation of reforms on track. DPL 1 and 2 both contain a well-articulated
monitoring and evaluation framework to track program implementation progress and results.
The data generated has facilitated preparation of the Implementation and Completion and
Results Report for DPL 1, as required within six months of the Loan's closing date. DPL 2
has used the same approach as articulated in the policy matrix in Annex 2. Further to this,
DPL 2 has articulated a medium-term results framework, which will additionally allow the
full impact of the reforms to be evaluated beyond the next 12 months.

61.     Providing technical assistance for design and implementation of the reform
program is critical to success in an environment of mixed capacity. Seychelles's small
population makes it impossible to have expertise in the wide variety of areas now required to
operate a modern economy. To supplement local expertise, the Bank is providing technical
assistance in a variety of areas, including fiscal management, public administration

                                              23
functioning, design and operation of a social safety net, tax policy and administration,
development of a macroeconomic framework, restructuring options for specific state owned
enterprises, and capacity building for the Public Enterprise Monitoring Division. Other
development partners (EC, IMF, AfDB) are also supplementing financial support with
technical assistance in tax reform and tax administration, public financial management, and
statistics development.

62.     Creating effective partnerships with the IMF, EC and AfDB increases the
likelihood of success. The Bank and the IMF consulted closely on the design and
implementation of the Fund-supported EFF and of the Bank-supported DPL operations to
ensure the consistency and quality of their dialogue on macroeconomic and fiscal issues.
Moreover, the Bank team worked closely with the IMF team to ensure that the programs of
each reflected their comparative advantages. The Bank team has also consulted regularly
with the AfDB and the EC to ensure that all are working together in support of the
government's reform program.

Analytical Underpinnings

63.     The Bank has undertaken core analytical work to underpin the policy areas
supported by DPL 2, and drawn upon the work of development partners to strengthen the
knowledge base.      Annex 7 provides a detailed summary of the analytical work and
recommendations that have provided the underpinnings for the DPL 1 and 2 prior actions.
Recognizing that both fiscal policy and PFM practices would need further reform to sustain
the macroeconomic stability, the design of the government reform program has been
informed by the analytical work of several development partners and the World Bank's 2009
Public Expenditure Review (Report No. 49273-SC). The EC-funded report "Public Financial
Management Performance" (2008), and the IMF's reports, the "A Strategy for Strengthening
Budget Management," (2008), and the "Further Steps Towards Sound Fiscal Management"
(2009) also contributed to the analysis of reforms required to strengthen PFM. The Bank's
analytical work in PER 1 has provided detailed recommendations on the public financial
management and public administration reforms that were implemented under DPL 1 and
DPL 2.

64.    Analytical work on the business climate was first undertaken in 2004 by the
World Bank Group's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS). This is well
documented in the FIAS report, A Review of the Policy, Regulatory and Administrative
Environment for Investment. This work was further developed in the unpublished World
Bank's Development Policy Review, 2005. The Bank produced an update to the
administrative barriers report in 2009 which has guided policy dialogue with the authorities.

65.    The Public Expenditure Review, 2010 (PER 2) has provided technical advice on
how to improve governance of the public enterprise sector and has strengthened the
basis for dialogue on public enterprise reform. The PER series has also led to the
development of a fee-based technical assistance project to further guide the implementation
of public enterprise reforms, as well as reform of the social security system and the health
sector. The chapter on labor market reforms has revealed the weaknesses in the country's
data on unemployment. These weaknesses must urgently be addressed under the statistics
capacity building project. However, despite the dearth of reliable data, the chapter also
showed that unemployment in Seychelles is largely a problem of a small group of structurally

                                             24
unemployed, in other words, individuals who do not have the skills to fill the available
vacancies, and who require support in basic skills such as numeracy and literacy and how to
perform in an interview.

          V.     THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (DPL2)

Operation Description

66.     The proposed DPL is a one-time single-tranche operation (US$9 million
equivalent) in support of the implementation of the second phase of the Seychelles
government's comprehensive structural reform program. This operation is conceived as
a one-time operation, based on passage and implementation of reforms to improve public
sector effectiveness and to improve the business climate. In line with good practice, the
DPL contains only six prior actions. It is a single-tranche operation, since the ISN period
does not extend beyond 2011. All available financial resources within the ISN envelope have
been programmed for DPL 1 and DPL 2. With a new Country Partnership Strategy, a
programmatic DPL series may be considered. While stand alone, this operation and policy
dialogue has been managed in a programmatic way. Therefore, DPL 2 supports a deepening
of the reform program presented in DPL 1. The policy matrix presented in Annex 2 provides
the expected medium-term outcomes of the government's reform program.

67.     This DPL follows the completion of the first DPL which achieved its development
objective of helping to establish a stable macroeconomic environment and a sustainable
fiscal framework. The Implementation Completion and Results Report found that the key
performance indicators of DPL 1 were met or exceeded. Specifically, the primary balance
rose from a deficit in 2007 of -2.0 percent of GDP to a surplus in 2009 of 14.8 percent
including grants, the National Tender Board was established and is fully functioning, staff of
the public administration fell by 15 percent, the public sector wage bill fell in relation to
GDP, the Social Welfare Agency was established and is fully functioning in all 25 districts of
the Seychelles, and overall subsidies of the government to former Seychelles Marketing
Board fell to zero in 2009.

68.     The objective of the DPL 2 is to assist the Republic of Seychelles to improve
public sector effectiveness and to improve the business environment. These are integral
to ensuring sustainable private sector development and broad-based growth in Seychelles.
The specific measures which have been as prior actions are presented Table 4, and are
presented with the outcomes in the policy matrix in Annex 2. The objectives of DPL 2 policy
areas are to: (a) strengthen budget management, (b) create a more efficient civil service, (c)
reduce the role of the state in commercial areas of the economy, (d) improve public corporate
governance and (e) remove administrative barriers to doing business.

                   introduce new, streamlined procedures to obtain
                   gainful occupational permits (work permits for
                   expatriate workers).

                   regulations to harmonize the fees for gainful
                   occupational permits across all commercial

                     Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The proposed operation is based on the government's aspirations to resolve the unsustainable
macroeconomic imbalances of the 1990s and create an environment for a private sector led economy.
Moreover, the president's consultation campaign being carried out throughout the country
demonstrates clear commitment to the reforms. The successful implementation of the IMF-supported
Stand-By Arrangement and government commitment to a follow-on program under the EFF is further
evidence of commitment to the reform agenda.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The DPL program is summarized in an agreed policy matrix in annex 2. The matrix contains both
policy actions and indicators of expected outcomes. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for
monitoring progress with the agreed reform program and for coordinating the actions of the other
agencies and ministries involved. The Bank consults regularly with other development partners in the
Seychelles to ensure that aid is as effective as possible.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The accountability framework is based on the Bank's 2008 Public Expenditure Review, a report by
IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department on budget management, the IMF's staff reports related to the Stand-
By Arrangement, and the central bank's safeguards assessment. The accountability framework has
also been influenced by the 2008 PEFA assessment.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed DPL operation contains only six agreed prior actions and six policy benchmarks. All
are focused on achieving critical improvements in fiscal management and policy and the business
climate.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support
Progress reviews of the policy actions in specific areas and of the operation as a whole are held
regularly with government officials from ministries and agencies participating in the project. These
reviews allow the Bank to update the matrix on the basis of actual and expected performance and to
communicate to the government what is essential to enable the approval of the operation. As a one-
off single-tranche operation, there will be a review of performance presented in the Implementation
Completion and Results Report. Monitoring indicators and outcomes were discussed and agreed with
the government and draw on the government's own monitoring and evaluation efforts.

69.     Continuing the gains made with public financial management, the government
have adopted a PFM action plan based on diagnostic work of the IMF, EC, and the
World Bank. The links between the policy reforms supported by the DPL and the PFM
action plan are summarized in Annex 6. The prior action for the DPL 2 is the approval by the
cabinet of the Budget Strategy and Outlook Paper, 2011, which provides a medium-term
budget framework consistent with the macroeconomic forecasts. The paper shows the
revenue forecasts, projections of the macroeconomic indicators, and the principal expenditure
focus for the coming annual budget. The paper strengthens the credibility of the annual
budget by ensuring that the expenditure framework is consistent with the macroeconomic
framework.       The other PFM reform benchmark involves the preparation of general
government accounts for 2011 classification, which is now comprehensive of social security
and pension spending.


                                                28
70.     The government introduced a policy for classifying the broader public sector
institutions according to their core function and budget dependency in July 2010. The
new classification has been fully applied to all public entities in the 2011 budget, ensuring
that there is a consistent budgetary treatment of such agencies and that the application of
public sector human resource rules and guidelines (including public sector pay policies) are
consistent across budget dependent agencies. This is a prior action for DPL 2.

71.     The government has continued to implement public administration reforms,
based on the Public Administration Reform Memorandum adopted in August 2009. Initially
limited to core ministries, the contracting out process has in 2010 been expanded to cover all
budget dependent institutions. The government has also implemented an ambitious program
to contract out all non-core public functions (school cleaning, and others). The program was
completed in July 2010 for all ministries and for key agencies, including in the health service,
where reforms had previously been slow.

72.    The government has fully applied a new and simplified wage grid which is a DPL
2 prior action. The new wage grid provides for 20 grades and 15 in-grade salary steps.
Importantly, with the introduction of the wage grid a complex allowances system that was
used to supplement low monthly salaries has been eliminated, ensuring a significant
improvement in transparency and fiscal management. While a considerable improvement on
the previous system of an official wage grid that bore little resemblance to actual take-home
pay, the new grid is still overly complex. The next steps are to further simplify and
consolidate the bottom grades of the wage grid, a process which began in September 2010.

73.     The government is strengthening oversight of public enterprises to improve their
accountability and performance. The National Assembly approved in September 2009 the
Public Enterprise Monitoring Act, which established the Public Enterprise Monitoring
Division (PEMD) in the Ministry of Finance. The government has appointed a new team of
staff and in September 2010 a new head of division to implement the Act. The prior action
for DPL 2 is the establishment of the PEMD and appointment of staff to oversee the
implementation of the Act. The PEMD has ensured that nine of the public enterprises
required to do so under the Act have submitted their annual financial reports to the Ministry
of Finance. The Minister of Finance has in turn presented the financial reports to the
National Assembly. The PEMD has already been successful at introducing new corporate
governance guidelines for public enterprises approved by the cabinet. It has also developed a
training course--which is being run by the Seychelles Institute of Management--to improve
the effectiveness of boards of directors. Looking to the future, the successful operation of the
PEMD will be indicated by the issuance of monthly reports to the Minister of Finance on the
performance of public enterprises.

74.     The government took steps to further withdraw the state from commercial
activities. In 2010, the government leased the assets of L'Union Estate to a private operator
with a management contract to run the commercial assets of L'Union Estate. The L'Union
Estate is a cultural heritage enterprise running commercial activities (a farm, tourism chalets,
and access to beaches) on the island of La Digue.

75.    The government has embarked on several reforms to reduce the administrative
barriers to doing business in Seychelles. The Licenses Act, 2010 was enacted in September
September 2010 and this is the prior action for DPL 2. The new Licenses Act, 2010 sets out

                                              29
transparent procedures for the issuance and renewal of all licenses. Most professional
activities under schedule 1 of the Act will require simple registration. Oversight standards
will be maintained by relevant professional bodies, and by technical ministries and their
agencies (for example the environmental health unit of the Ministry of Health).
Requirements for licensing in particular economic sectors are therefore to be handled directly
by the relevant authority (for example, in the fishing sector, this is the Seychelles Fishing
Authority). Under the new Act, the Seychelles Licensing Authority will issue licenses for 27
activities, rather than the 180 economic activities under the previous Act.11 The new
legislation adopts a "silence is consent" principle, which makes licensing automatic if
applications are received but not reviewed within the predetermined time period. The new
regime will also include an appeals procedure to provide fair and adequate recourse to
applicants in the event of any adverse decisions. The Act clarifies that the licensing regime
will not be used to either encourage competition-- as this is the mandate of the Office of Fair
Trade-- or specifically to generate revenue (this objective is being addressed through tax
policies governed by the Seychelles Revenue Commission).

76.     The Cabinet approved a revised Investment Bill, 2010 which provides the
framework for the promotion, regulation, and protection of investors and investments.
Cabinet approved the repeal of the 2005 Investment Code and the revised Investment Bill on
September 1, 2010. The revised bill allows for the establishment of the Seychelles
Investment Board to facilitate and promote investments. By repealing the 2005 code, the
government has eliminated activities defined as "strategic," "restricted," or "sensitive" areas
for foreigners. The board will no longer have any role in any prior approval process. The
revised bill focuses on the provision of protection to investors, clarifying policies for the
repatriation of profits, strengthening protection of property rights, and establishing dispute
settlement mechanisms.

77.     The government is reforming the work permit system to improve the timeliness
and transparency of the process and harmonize the fee structure. As a first step towards
this, an immigration decree was issued in January, 2010 (decree S.I.7, 2010), eliminating the
differential fee for permits issued outside of company quotas, and harmonizing all fees at the
lower rate of SR 700 per month (previously SR 2,000 per month). Cabinet has approved the
regulation of the government's multi agency team, comprising representatives of the Ministry
of Investment, Ministry of Employment, and the Trade Department of the Ministry of
Finance, and tasked it with revising the approval procedures and criteria for the allocation of
work permits to ensure consistency and transparency and to provide performance standards
for approval time.

                            VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

Poverty and Social Impacts

78.    Growth in private sector employment has offset the fall in jobs in the public
sector, and government sponsored job retraining and placement programs have
successfully helped former public sector employees obtain jobs in the private sector.
Public sector employment has dropped from 30 percent of total employment in 2003 to 21
percent of employment in 2009. Some 2,700 employees left the public sector (government

11
     The transfer of responsibility for issuance and monitoring of major sector licenses includes fishing,
telecoms, and livestock.

                                                       30
and parastatals combined) during 2009. However, at the same time, an additional 3,280 jobs
were created in the private sector. The Department of Employment tracked those job seekers
who left the public sector on the voluntary departure scheme and found that all but a handful
of former staff had either found alternative employment or were self employed; very few
were registered job seekers. Most of the registered job seekers (an estimated 2,302) appear to
be persons with lower levels of education and a lack of work experience that registered in
order to become eligible for social welfare payments. The unemployment rate is estimated to
have remained low, at around 4 percent in 2009. Furthermore, an estimated 10,800 expatriate
labor permits were granted in 2009, with only 150 in the government and parastatal sectors
combined (down from 190 in 2008), which indicates that labor demand in the private sector
is high and overall exceeds the local labor supply.

79.     The total number of welfare claimants has been declining since the middle of
2009. The Social Welfare Agency provides cash grants to low-income households. The size
of the grant is calculated to cover the basic needs, including food, shelter, and utilities
(electricity and water).12 Although a total of SR 100 million was budgeted for the Social
Welfare Agency's program in 2009, actual expenditures amounted to only SR 37 million.
The total number of eligible claimants peaked at 3,500 households in August and started to
fall from September 2009. Claimants are typically unemployed young women with a low
level of education looking for supplementary household income. The Bank through the
Public Expenditure Review 2 has provided advice for improving the design of active labor
market policies to help the relatively small pool of structurally unemployed to move off of
welfare into employment. The government has also provided grants to civil society
organizations to help the employed develop new skills and find jobs. Impact evaluations of
these programs found that 100 percent of people enrolled found new employment within two
months of graduating.

80.    Average real monthly earnings are now back to pre-crisis levels. The real wage
fell during 2008, as a result of the period of high inflation and price shocks from the
exchange rate devaluation, but has since recovered in line with the economic recovery in
2009 and 2010. Government employees have suffered a deeper drop in average real monthly
wages than employees of parastatals or private firms, but have also been increasing since the
beginning of 2009.

81.     While inflation has fallen to near zero, prices for some goods and services are
likely to rise, due to the elimination of universal subsidies. In particular, prices for public
transportation, electricity, and water may rise. The poor will be hardest hit by increases in
the price of public transportation, since they are more likely to use the service. Tariffs for
electricity and water will remain affordable for poor households as a policy choice. Their use
will be cross-subsidized by large (especially, industrial) users.




12
  Tariffs for electricity and water follow a rising block tariff scheme to ensure that the majority of domestic
consumers are able to afford a basic minimum supply for household use.

                                                        31
Environmental Aspects

82.     The conclusion of an environmental screening of the proposed reforms,
undertaken as per the requirements of OP 8.60, is that the reforms are not likely to be
significant from an environmental point of view. Details of the analysis of the
environmental aspects for each reform area follow.

      Strengthening budget management. Improving budget management is expected to
      lead to more efficient use of public resources, which may indirectly generate
      environmental benefits by encouraging the adoption of modern technologies which
      use resources more efficiently than those they replace.

      Creating a more efficient civil service and public administration. The operation will
      support implementation of public sector reforms aimed at creating a more efficient
      and effective public service. This may have a beneficial impact on the environment,
      because the reforms will result in targeting resources on core government functions,
      including environmental protection. Thus, the Memorandum of Action on Public
      Administration and Public Sector Reform Policies provides for increasing the number
      and quality of staff in the key areas of environmental impact assessment, inspections,
      environment engineering, and conservation.

      Improving public enterprise corporate governance. The operation seeks to enhance
      the transparency, efficiency, and accountability of public enterprises. This is
      expected to result in lower subsidies to public enterprises such as the electricity and
      water utilities, which will in turn force the utilities to raise prices to reflect costs of
      services and to operate more efficiently. Lower demand and greater efficiency in
      provision of electricity and water will result in lower green house gas emissions and
      less pressure on Seychelles's aquifers, among other environmental benefits.

      Reducing the role of the state in commercial areas of the economy. The operation
      supports the restructuring of the L'Union Estate, and has leased its commercial
      operations to the private sector. The estate--a national heritage site on the island of
      La Digue, which generates income through gate fees, sale of agricultural products,
      and rental of holiday chalets--will increase the income that the government receives
      from the estate, but will have no impact on the environment as no changes in
      operations are envisaged.

      Improving the business climate for domestic and international firms. Reducing the
      time required to obtain or renew a license and eliminating the need for prior approval
      from the Seychelles Investment Board for investment will facilitate business entry and
      growth. This will result in uncertain environmental impacts, depending on the sectors
      that attract new investment, and the availability and cost-effectiveness of new
      technology. The reforms may be positive for the environment if they attract
      businesses from the informal to the formal sector, since formal businesses are more
      likely to comply with environmental regulations. However, the provision in the new
      licensing law that a license be automatically issued within 14 days of application, if it
      has not been rejected, could result in a small number of licenses being issued without
      review by the authorities responsible for environmental protection or environmental

                                              32
       health. However, businesses will still be subject to inspections prior to and during
       operations, which will mitigate the risks.

83.    Awareness of environmental issues and institutional capacity to address them are well
developed in Seychelles. Seychelles's prosperity depends on the sustainable management of
its natural resources, specifically its beaches, reefs, indigenous forests, and bird and sea life.
The islands are home to globally important biodiversity, including 12 species of endemic
birds, 11 species of amphibians, the Aldabra tortoise, hawksbill, and green sea turtles, and
many species of plants. The numbers of many of the endemics have been decimated by the
clearing of indigenous forests for copra and vanilla plantations during the 1900s.
Recognizing the threat, the government and private individuals have taken steps to reverse
the degradation. Seychelles adopted the Environmental Protection Act 1994 and its
amendments of 1996. These specify the economic activities that are subject to full
environmental impact assessments prior to start of construction. Other major pieces of
environmental legislation are the Wild Animals and Birds Protection Act 1991, and the
Forest Reserves Act 1991. Seychelles has prepared two detailed environmental management
plans, the most recent covering 2001­2010. It is finalizing preparation of its third plan.
These provide the vision and guiding principles for sustainably managing the environment
and name the key projects that will permit achievement of the vision. The country is an
active party to several United Nations conventions, including the Framework Convention on
Climate Change (1992), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (1977), and the Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD (signed 1992).

84.    Capacity in Seychelles to manage environmental issues is comparatively advanced. The
Department of Environment, Natural Resources and Transport is the agency responsible for
environmental policy making and for monitoring the impact of development projects on the
environment. The department is managing over 50 projects (including several financed by the
Global Environment Fund), which is a large number for a small island state. The department
manages these with a staff of about 130, working on issues such as invasive species, risk and
disaster preparedness, and climate change. The Department has recently been through the
functional review process, and the staff capacity is considered adequate to manage the
activities of the Department. The country is involved in several international waters projects
involving the countries of the Western Indian Ocean and coastal Africa, including the Bank-
managed Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and Coastal and Marine
Contamination Prevention Project. It often takes the lead in such projects, due to its
relatively strong capacity.

Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

85.    Executing agency. The Ministry of Finance is the executing agency. Other line
agencies and decentralized institutions will support the ministry. The Ministry of Finance
and the Bank have agreed to monitor outcomes in the program supported by the DPL through
the Implementation Completion and Results Report for this loan and through the ISN
Completion Report to be carried out as part of the preparations for a new Country Partnership
Strategy (programmed for delivery in fiscal 2012). The Ministry of Finance is responsible
for not only implementing the operation but also for monitoring progress during
implementation and evaluating results upon completion. The government will be collecting
the appropriate data necessary to assess implementation progress. Reviews by the Ministry
of Finance and the Bank team will aim to identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the
reform program; to identify possible assistance needs to sustain the forward momentum
                                               33
toward the government's planned medium-term outcomes, and to address possible downside
risks.

86.     Monitoring and evaluation. Bank staff will regularly monitor implementation of the
policy reform program laid out in Table 4 and Annex 2. Country capacity for monitoring is
being strengthened through a grant from the Bank-managed Statistical Capacity Building
Trust Fund and a public administration reform project financed under an Institutional
Development Fund grant. An Implementation Completion and Results Report will be issued
within six months following the closing date of the operation.

Fiduciary Aspects

87.     The government is strengthening its fiduciary management. The Bank prepared a
PER in 2008, which recommended measures to improve core public financial management.
The EC in the same year led a PEFA assessment. The PEFA assessment found that budget
credibility was weak in terms of aggregate expenditure outcome compared to budget (scoring
a D).      On comprehensiveness and transparency, the budget performs poorly on
comprehensiveness (scoring a D), but well on the extent of underreported operations (scoring
an A). The government is working to address deficiencies. In particular it has increased
budget comprehensiveness by ensuring that extra-budgetary funds such as the social security
fund and the pension fund are included in the budget. The aggregate outturn to budget rate
improved in 2008 as a result of closer monitoring. During 2009 and 2010, the use of
quarterly reports to monitor and manage outturns reduced the deviation between the original
appropriated budget and aggregate actual expenditures.

88.      The IMF has prepared a safeguards report and considered the adequacy of
central bank's financial management practices. Available analysis identifies weaknesses
in the central bank's control environment. The report found a number of deficiencies
pointing to risks in the central bank's safeguards framework. The government has already
taken remedial measures with respect to some of the issues raised by the IMF and the
government is still in process of implementing measures to address the weaknesses. These
measures included signing a new contract with external auditors in 2008 and bringing
accounts in compliance with international accounting standards. The Ministry of Finance
and the Central Bank of Seychelles in December 2008 signed a memorandum of
understanding to strengthen and formalize the terms and conditions under which the central
bank transacts on behalf of the government. The government is in the process of
implementing measures to deal with the rest of the deficiencies identified in the IMF
safeguards assessment report. The new Central Bank of Seychelles Act was approved by the
National Assembly on April 28, 2009 and came into effect in early May. The new Financial
Institutions (Amendment) Act, 2008 and related regulations was introduced in 2009 and 2010
have strengthened the legal framework for the financial sector. Seychelles also enacted a
modern procurement law in December 2008, which was a structural benchmark under the
IMF Stand-By program.

Disbursement and Auditing

89.   The Bank would make the single loan disbursement to a Designated Account in
the Central Bank of Seychelles denominated in euros. The central bank will credit the
Seychelles rupee equivalent to the Ministry of Finance Treasury Single Account. The

                                            34
credit will follow the bank's disbursement procedures for development policy. The Treasury
Single Account centralizes government revenues for financing of public spending; upon its
deposit the DPL disbursement will become available to finance budgeted expenditures. The
central bank will not impose any charges or commission on the government for these
transactions. The conversion from euros to Seychelles rupees will be based on the prevailing
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the treasury account. The
government, through the Ministry of Finance, will: (a) provide written confirmation to the
bank within 30 days that an account equivalent to the credit proceeds from the Bank has been
credited to the treasury account along with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (b)
provide evidence that the Seychelles rupee equivalent of the credit proceeds was recorded as
financing the government budget; and (c) ensure that the Seychelles rupee equivalent of the
credit proceeds are subject to effective controls sufficient to ensure us for eligible, budgeted
public expenditures only as per the loan agreement.

Additional Fiduciary Requirements

90.     Upon the World Bank's request, the Borrower shall have the Deposit Account
audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the World Bank, in accordance with
consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Bank. Given the available
fiduciary analysis identifies weaknesses in the borrower's central bank control environment
and budget management system an additional fiduciary requirement has been agreed. The
Borrower will furnish to the World Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than
four months after the date of the Bank's request for such audit, a certified copy of the report
of such audit, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.

Risks and Risk Mitigation

91.     The implementation of the proposed reform program faces the following possible
risks: (a) continued global economic recession causing external shocks such as low tourism
arrivals and/or revenues; (b) unplanned emergency expenditure priorities emerging from the
decline in capital investment in recent years; (c) increased piracy attacks in Seychelles waters
reduces tourism and fishing activities; (d) reduced ownership in the run up to 2011 elections
and policy slippage; (e) fiduciary risks, (f) slippage on policy reforms, and (g) lack of
capacity to lead and implement the reform program.

To program development objectives
a)   External shocks including those          The government has introduced policies to       Moderate
     associated with a global economic        improve the business climate with a view to
     slowdown, tourism-related shocks         leveling the playing field across sectors and
     such as terrorism, volcanic ash          across foreign and domestic investors, in
     disruptions of air travel, and the       order to develop the private sector and
     impact of a further (potential)          diversify the economy. This will help to
     collapse in demand from the              mitigate to some extent Seychelles external
     eurozone on tourism                      vulnerability especially to economic
                                              outturn in Europe. Within the tourism
                                              sector, the government has adopted a new
                                              marketing strategy to diversify tourist
                                              arrivals and not just concentrate on the
                                              high-end European, market.

Mr. Robert Zoellick

-----------------


Dear Mr. Zoellick,

1.     On behalf of the Government of Seychelles, I hereby write to request the approval for
the Second Development Policy Loan to the Republic of Seychelles. This second
development policy loan will support Seychelles in its ongoing reform process especially
given that the reforms are more structural in nature and to also assist in sustaining our
achievements so far.

1.      Our reforms up to now have achieved broad based support. As we forge ahead with
the program, we continue to carefully consult with our partners in civil society, the
opposition, and business in order to ensure that the people have a sound understanding of the
rationale of the structural reforms and their benefits. This domestic consensus has been
bolstered by the international community, which has long played an important role in our
country. In July this year, the Paris Club group of creditors provided the second 45% debt
cancellation and the as yet un-restructured debt of our country amounts to only 15 percent of
GDP. Seychelles has also successfully implemented the Stand By Arrangement moved on
from an SBA to an EFF a borrowing program of SDR 19.8 million with the International
Monetary Fund,

                        I. SEYCHELLES REFORM PROGRAM

                                        I.1 Overview

2.    Since Seychelles embarked on the Macro Economic Reform Programme supported by
the IMF in 2008 considerable progress have been made. Having successfully implemented
the SBA we have moved to an EFF in December 2009.

3.      We have seen drastic improvements in key economic indicators which include a
stable exchange rate and lower interest rate. Inflation is at an all time low and the country's
foreign exchange reserves have improved significantly. We have also achieved budgetary
surplus and there has been a comprehensive re-scheduling of external debt, improved
sovereign rating and modernization of the tax system.

                      II. MAIN ELEMENTS OF POLICY REFORMS

4.     In keeping with our efforts to sustain the achievements of the economic reform
program so far the following set of fundamental reforms have been introduced.

       Public Finance Management

       Public Sector Reforms

       Public Enterprise Reform.

       Business Climate Improvement

II. 1 Fiscal Policy

5.      Strong fiscal adjustment has been and is central to the achievement of debt
sustainability and sound public finances. In 2009 our primary surplus was 14.8 percent of
GDP--well over the program target of 13.4 percent. These objectives have been achieved
through a combination of expenditure restraint, public financial management and public
sector reform. For 2010 as per the budget target we were aiming for a primary surplus of 7
percent of GDP but this has now been revised to 7.4 percent of GDP.

6.     We launched a fundamental medium term reform of the tax system with the 2010
budget with the objective of having a simple, fair and equitable system beneficial to all
investors' thus promoting growth and improving self-compliance. The reforms introduced are
broadly revenue neutral over the medium term. The following revenue measures have been
introduced as per the schedule below.

II. 2 Public Financial Management Reforms

Strengthening the public financial management framework and the budgetary process
remains one of our key objectives and the PFM reform action plan 2009-2011 continues to be
the guiding principle for ongoing reforms as we make considerable progress. Late 2009 the
Treasury Single Account was introduced representing a major step towards efficient
management and control of Government's cash resources. It has also act as a deterrent in
instances when cash resources are left idle for extended periods in numerous individual bank
accounts of spending agencies to the benefits of the banks while the Government goes on
borrowing to finance its expenditure programmes in other areas. It has also reduced the need
to borrow to meet operational expenses and thus minimizing the cost of borrowing. The
opportunity cost of cash resources has been maximized ­ This will minimize the interval
between the time when cash is received and the time it is available for carrying out
government's expenditure programmes. TSA has also contributed towards improved
reporting. Reports are now more complete and timelier, showing not only budget execution
but also transactions with cash.
                                                       40
The budget processes have been further strengthened through the introduction of a medium
term budgeting framework which presents the government's fiscal and economic projections
over a three year horizon. The budget strategy document approved by the Cabinet of
Ministers form the basis of the 2011 budget preparation process, setting out the fiscal context
and establishing the government's priorities. The new budget presentation will also ensure
greater transparency and assist with forecasting. The establishment of a dedicated branch in
the Ministry of Finance has further enhanced our macro-economic and revenue forecasting
capacity.

II. 3 Public Sector Reforms

7.     Our main objective in this area still remains the transformation of the role of the State
to one of provider of efficient public administration and public goods and services. . The
implementation of the strategic plan to modernize our public administration which was
endorsed by cabinet in August 2009 still remains on track. The Government has implemented
a program of contracting out of all non-core services which it previously carried out.

The Government has undertaken work to do a comprehensive salary and post grading
structure review involving a new job evaluation plan of the public sector. A large part of this
work has been completed and Government adopted and implemented a new wage grid in
January. This has significantly enhanced transparency and predictability of the wage bill.
The grid as applied from January 1, 2010, greatly improved the system of extensive
allowances.

While an improvement, the wage grid is still too complex for a small public service like that
of the Seychelles. The Government has committed to review the wage grid in late 2010
aimed at simplifying it. Technical assistance is being provided under a grant from the World
Bank's Institutional Development Fund. A simplification of the grid will make the system
more transparent and manageable. Government is committed to the adoption and
implementation of the new simplified wage grid in January 2011.

II. 4 Public Enterprise Reforms

The government remains committed to the pursuit of its public enterprise reform strategy
aimed at achieving greater efficiency, accountability and transparency. The Cabinet gave its
approval to the detailed work plan of the Public Enterprise Monitoring Division (PEMD) of
the Ministry of Finance. Late 2009 the National Assembly approved the legal framework- the
Public Enterprise Monitoring and Control Act. The Act sets out reporting arrangements and
uniform governance rules for public enterprises. In the quest to improve the efficiency of
government services and instill institutional discipline as a cornerstone to good governance,
the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the Seychelles Institute of Management has
developed a directors training course for all persons appointed as a Directors of a
Commercial the Public Enterprises.

The Public Enterprise Monitoring Division has finalized strategic assessments for the largest
public entities and we also commissioned a strategic assessment of Air Seychelles and its
ancillary services and the aviation consultant provided his findings to the Government in
August. The PEMD has also been successful in its application to the FIRST Trust fund to
carry out strategic assessments of the Housing Finance Cooperation, Development Bank of
Seychelles and the Concessionary Credit Agency.

The IFC has also responded positively to the Governments request for their expertise to assist
with the review of the possible privatization of the two publicly owned deposit taking
institutions Seychelles Savings Bank and Nouvobanq.

II. 5 Social Sector Reforms

The social safety net measures are successfully achieving its objective of delivering targeted
income support. Since the middle of 2009 there has been a noticeable decrease in the total
number of welfare claimants and we are convinced that this will decline further with
continued economic growth and improved labour market policies.




                                                       43
In recognizing the success of the social welfare assistance the government is conscious that
there is the need to fine tune the targeting of our social safety net, including establishing a
relationship to the minimum wage that preserves work incentives over time.

The government has expanded its training program for the unemployed and for those who
exited the public service to minimize the period of employment. In addition to the training
programs the government has also provided grants to NGOs for social programs to address
employment issues. These social programs have proven to be highly successful as impact
evaluations have shown that 100 percent of people enrolled in these programs found new
employment within two months of graduating.

II. 6 Private Sector Development

The government is committed to the improvement of the business environment in line with its
policy of being a facilitator rather than a provider. An improved business environment will
allow the private sector to greater benefit from the first generation of reforms as it will allow
them to benefit from the opportunities emanating from the market oriented economy. Steps
are being taken to ensure the necessary legal framework is in place to further facilitate private
sector development.
On the 14th September the Parliament unanimously approved the revised Licenses Act which
provides for a less cumbersome system for the issuance of licenses. The Investment Code
has also been revised and the Seychelles Investment Bill has already been approved by the
Cabinet of Ministers and is currently in the process of being submitted to Parliament for
consideration.


In the view of promoting competition and reducing constricting business practices an Office
of Fair Trading has been set up following the enactment of the Fair Trading Commission Act
late 2009. The commission is mandated with the promotion of competition policy in the
economy. In addition it has powers to carry out investigations in into the use of restrictive,
collusive business practices. The office is currently in the process of preparing a strategic
plan for dealing with the various cases of restrictive practices that have already been brought
before the CEO.

Conclusion

As the above indicate, the government of the Republic of Seychelles is strongly committed to
undertaking necessary reforms actions to promote economic growth and modernize our
country. In this context, the support of The World Bank through approval of the
Development Policy Loan would be important to successful implementation of the
government's continued reform and debt sustainability agenda.

_
Macroeconomic performance of Seychelles under the Extended Financing Facility (EFF) has
been favorable and the reforms continue to be pursued with a high degree of ownership and
broad public support. The liberalization of the exchange regime, a strong fiscal adjustment,
and prudent monetary policies, initiated under the predecessor Stand-by Arrangement (SBA),
have contributed to restoring macroeconomic stability. Program implementation has been
exemplary and the external debt restructuring is close to completion, which is crucial for
reestablishing a sustainable public debt outlook and supporting economic recovery.

Recent Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook

Economic developments and prospects are positive. Economic activity appears to be
strengthening further, notably in tourism (Seychelles's main export sector), as evidenced by
increasing arrivals and earnings. The authorities' GDP projections of 4-5 percent in 2010-12
are well within reach. Monthly inflation has returned to positive territory in recent months,
but the rate remains below 1 percent on a year to date basis as of August 2010. The exchange
rate has stabilized in real effective terms since January 2010.

Economic policies

The authorities continue to implement sound fiscal and monetary policies. At end-June,
government revenue exceeded projections by 1.6 percent of GDP as a result of strong
provisional corporate tax assessments, sustained demand for petroleum products and higher
than expected dividends from public enterprises. At the same time, delays in the disbursement
of grant financing kept expenditures below budget parameters and led to a primary surplus of
6.3 percent of GDP at mid-year, well above the program target of 4 percent. Monetary
aggregates remain in line with the program targets and interest rates on three-month
government securities declined from about 3.6 percent at the start of the year to 1.8 percent in
June.

Program Implementation

The Executive Board approved a three year Extended Fund Facility with Seychelles effective
December 23, 2009. Three tranches were disbursed, the latest on October 6, 2010, following
completion of a financing assurances review. The program is on track. All quantitative
performance criteria at end-June 2010 were met. The structural reform agenda under the
program continues to be implemented broadly as scheduled, including the revision of the
business tax and sales tax legislation and the introduction of personal income tax, and the
strengthening of public financial and central bank management. All structural benchmarks
through end-August 2010 were observed.

Progress in Debt Restructuring

The authorities have reached debt restructuring agreements with most external creditors.
Following the completion of the first review under the EFF, Paris Club creditors agreed in
July 2010 that the conditions were met for the entry into force of the second phase of debt
reduction under the 2009 agreement with Seychelles. Some formal bilateral agreements
remain to be signed. Following the successful commercial debt exchange in February 2010,
understandings have been reached with most commercial and non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors on restructuring terms comparable to those of the Paris Club agreement, and the
authorities continue to discuss in good faith with the remaining creditors. To date, the
authorities have reached agreements with external creditors covering around 88 percent of the
debt eligible for restructuring.
