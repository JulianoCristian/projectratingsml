              Republic of Seychelles: Second Development Policy Loan

                           SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                          Meeting of the Executive Directors
                                 November 23, 2010



The Executive Directors approved a Development Policy loan (DPL 2 Report No. 57109-
SC, dated October 26, 2010) to the Republic of Seychelles in the amount of 6.6 million
(US$9 million equivalent), on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President's
Memorandum (R2010-0264, dated October 26, 2010). Speakers noted that this second
DPL is in line with the ISN and builds on lessons learned from the first DPL. Executive
Directors commended the Bank for its close collaboration with the IMF, but urged greater
efforts by the Bank to coordinate with other donors. Directors further noted the external
economic risks to the project, but expressed support for the objectives and policy areas of
the project that will continue to support the Seychelles' economic transformation.
Specifically, Executive Directors expressed their strong support for reforms to make the
public sector more effective and to improve the business climate for the much required
private-sector led economic growth.
