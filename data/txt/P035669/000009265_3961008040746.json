"The objectives of the Second Social Fund\n            Project are to alleviate poverty and support community\n            development through partnership with nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs) and beneficiary communities. This will\n            be done using the successful approach of the ongoing Food\n            Security and Nutrition Project (SECALINE), and no change in\n            emphasis is expected. The project will provide supplemental\n            financing to the \"Fonds d'intervention pour le\n            developpement\" (FID), a non-profit association that\n            finances construction and rehabilitation of basic\n            infrastructure, income generating activities and private\n            sector support programs. FID has been funded by the SECALINE\n            project but, with the expansion of FID to all of Madagascar\n            and the faster than expected pace of execution, the\n            resources available to FID under the ongoing project are\n            expected to be committed by early 1996. During the project\n            period it is estimated that FID will help to: 1) create\n            about 5 million person-days of temporary employment on\n            infrastructure projects; 2) develop health and education\n            facilities; 3) develop 1,000 kilometers of farm-to-market\n            roads; d) provide protection for 16,000 hectares threatened\n            by soil erosion; e) develop 30,000 hectares of arable land;\n            f) finance 1,200 contracts with micro and small enterprises\n            as well as another 200 with artisans and skilled daily\n            workers; and g) create approximately 2,700 permanent jobs."}, "docdt": "1995-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
