The project will supply school facilities in\n            under supplied areas. It will increase rural primary\n            education participation by improving the accessibility of\n            textbooks and educational materials, and by supporting\n            community initiatives to encourage families to send children\n            to school. Quality improvements such as curriculum\n            development, improved teacher selection, improved multigrade\n            teaching, and the introduction of health education in\n            primary schools will also be implemented. Further to this,\n            the project will strengthen school mapping services and\n            improve efficiency in the utilization of resources."}, "docdt": "1989-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
