The project comprises the\n            construction of about 1,000 km of single circuit\n            transmission lines, 16 new substations and the extension of\n            8 existing substations with a total transformer capacity of\n            about 10,000 MVA, 3 switching stations, and 9 dispatch\n            centers (1 federal, 6 republican, and Kosovo). The project\n            includes studies of management, tariffs, and system\n            development. The 380-kV system coupled with adequate\n            dispatch facilities is designed to allow for greater\n            reliability, flexibility, and economy in supplying power\n            throughout the country. The second phase (1977-82) of the\n            380-kV system is an extension and refinement of the basic\n            power grid established under the first phase or first Power\n            Transmission Project in 1972."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
