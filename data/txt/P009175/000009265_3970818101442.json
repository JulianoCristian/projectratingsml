Despite periodic\n            strained situations between the Bank and the Union of\n            Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL), particularly in\n            the earlier years of the Project, the project has resulted\n            in the Bank having a much clearer understanding of the\n            philosophy and constraints of the Yugoslav social economic\n            system and organization as it applies to the electricity\n            power sector. The main lessons to be learned from the\n            Project are: (a) that the constraints of available internal\n            finance, foreign exchange and absorptive capacity of the\n            sector and a sharp slowing of the economy would, in a\n            project such as this, significantly reduce load growth and\n            necessitate drastic curtailment of expansion programs; (b)\n            that successful administration of loans to the power sector\n            of Yugoslavia is constrained because of the fragmented\n            nature of the Sector; and (c) that a real commitment on the\n            part of the borrowers and the Government to the objectives\n            of the Project is critical for its success, as demonstrated\n            by the lack of beneficial results from the work of the\n            financial management consultants."}, "docdt": "1984-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
