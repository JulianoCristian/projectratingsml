unaccounted-for water. The\n            project would consist of the following: extension of three\n            existing plants and construction of a new water treatment\n            plant; installation of trunk water mains and booster\n            stations; renewal of operational equipment; purchase of\n            self-propelled water barges to supply ships in the Port of\n            Alexandria; procurement of trucks and operational vehicles,\n            and water meters; management and engineering consultants and training."}, "docdt": "1977-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
