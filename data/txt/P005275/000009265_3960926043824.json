Power Project is part of the\n            Jordan Electricity Authority's (JEA) high priority\n            1988-95 investment program for the development of\n            Jordan's power subsector and includes:  (i) the\n            expansion of the existing sea-water-cooled steam power plant\n            at Aqaba by the addition of 2x130-MW units initially firing\n            heavy fuel oil and with the boilers and power station layout\n            suitable for future coal firing.  It further involves (ii)\n            upgrading the substations at Aqaba and Amman-South to 400\n            kV; and (iii) the consulting services associated with (i)\n            and (ii).  The  project will help meet Jordan's future\n            power demand at least cost to the economy and will help the\n            Government to potentially reduce the country's\n            dependence on imported oil by introducing the possibility of\n            substituting oil with coal in Jordan's future power\n            generation should coal prove more economical.  It will also\n            help improve the quality of power supply services and\n            continue institution-building efforts to further develop JEA\n            as a technically efficient entity."}, "docdt": "1987-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
