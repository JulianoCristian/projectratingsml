The Government decided to\n            postpone the implementation of the proposed Aqaba power\n            station extension and on April 13, 1988, the Government\n            requested the Bank to withdraw the loan. Four important\n            lessons were learned during processing of the project. (a)\n            The first lesson learned was that information on subsectors\n            that has an impact on the project should be updated at\n            regular intervals. (b) The second lesson learned was that\n            even though good quality power system planning was\n            undertaken consistent with best practice at the time,\n            changes that occurred in oil and coal prices, electricity\n            demand, and fuel availability (natural gas) indicate that\n            more formal analysis of risks and their impact on project\n            design might have led to better investment decisions. (c)\n            The third lesson learned was that it is essential to\n            address, well in advance, transnational environmental issues\n            in case a polluting source, such as a power station, is\n            close to the border of the country. (d) The fourth lesson\n            learned was that it is important to maintain continuity, at\n            least for one year, of the appraisal team, especially, the\n            task manager, for follow-up actions after the approval of\n            the project by the Board."}, "docdt": "1996-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
