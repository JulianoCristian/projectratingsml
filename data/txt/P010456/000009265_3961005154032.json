investment and maintenance credit to\n            strengthen implementation of Pakistan's Social Action\n            Program (SAP). SAP is the name given to Pakistan's\n            overall effort to improve basic social services over the\n            five year period 1993/94-1997/98. The Social Action Program\n            Project will reinforce existing social sector programs and\n            projects, whether or not aid-financed, by focusing on a few\n            core problems that impede implementation throughout the\n            social sectors. It will help finance the first three years\n            (1993/94-1995/96) of the Program. For planning and\n            monitoring, the SAP is divided into constituent\n            sub-programs. The main ones include twelve that cover three\n            basic social services -- primary education, primary health\n            care, and rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) -- in\n            each of Pakistan's four provinces, plus the national\n            population program. Others cover selected federally managed\n            health and education programs and basic services in areas\n            directly administered by the Federal Government. It intends\n            to provide US$10 million to help promote community\n            involvement and innovation in basic service delivery."}, "docdt": "1994-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
