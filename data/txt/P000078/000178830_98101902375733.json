objectives of the proposed project\n            are to address the most urgent water and sanitation needs of\n            Cotonou, Benin's largest city and economic center, and\n            through studies, to help define and implement long-range\n            sector objectives and strategies. The proposed studies would\n            include preparation of master plans for water supply and\n            sanitation, and for urban development; review of existing\n            tariff and accounting systems with recommendations for\n            improvement; training program for staff of the principal\n            project implementing agency; and detailed design and bidding\n            documents for a first stage construction program to be\n            carried out under a possible future project. The priority\n            works provided for would include development of four\n            additional wells to increase Cotonou's water production\n            capacity, and the extension of the water distribution system\n            to low-income areas; improvement of drainage in some urban\n            areas which are subject to frequent floodings; and\n            strengthening of solid waste collection and sanitation services."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
