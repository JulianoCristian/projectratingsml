PREFACE
This Project Completion Report reviews the Bura Irrigation
Settlement Project for Which an IDA Credit of US$6.0 million and an IBED
Loan of US$34.0 million was approved in June 1977. The original closing
date of June 30, 1984 was extended to June 30, 1986. The final
disbursements for the Credit and the Loan were made in January 1984 and
April 1987 respectively and US$5.1 million of the Loan was cancelled.
This report was prepared by a Bank mission that visited Kenya In
February 1988.  It is based on field visits to project areas and
discussions with Government and other appropriate staff in Kenya. The
report has benefited from a thorough mid-term evaluation exercise
undertaken jointly by GOK and donors in late 1984 (report dated January
1985). It has also been guided by 'A Review of the World Bank's Experience
in Kenya, 1963 to 1986", "Managing Agricultural Development in Africa", a
study undertaken as part of a larger sank-sponsored stock-taking, and other
studies. 1/
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and Cofinanciers on November 1,
1989, for comments by December 19, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENY
BURA IRRIGATION SETTLENENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 722-KEILOAN 1449-KE)
EVALUATION SUMNARY
Introduction
1.       Irrigation is one of the few means for expanding the area of
cultivable land in Kenya. About 40 percent of the country's irrigable area
lies in the Tana river basin, perhaps one-third of that, In the lower basin.
Since World War II Kenya's rapid population growth has put increasing
pressures on the land and created more landlesuness. Under such conditions
development of the lower Tana basin for irrigated agriculture was an almost
inevitable consideration.
Obiectives
2.       The objectives of the Bura Irrigation Project were to settle about
5,150 landless families on an irrigated area of 6,700 ha net, create
employment, and contribute to foreign exchange earnings by producing cotton
and food (maize). Through technical assistance and training, the project
was also expected to develop Kenya's capacity to nanage future major
irrigation projects.
Implementat4an Experience
3.       The project failed to achieve its objectives.  The objectives of
creating jobs achieved to less than 40 percent and at a cost of about
US$42,000 per ha or US$55,000 per settler. The economic rate of return is
negative; annual operating and maintenance costs exceed benefits. Even
with net farm income of about 40 percent of appraisal estimates in real
terms, annual Government subsidies amount to about K Sh 17,000 (US$1,000)
per settler. The project continues to suffer from an unreliable supply of
irrigation water and delayed cultivation, and many buildings are threatened
by foundation problems.
4.       The reasons for this outcome include the followings
(a)    Low yield.  The Kenya Soil Survey regards the presently
cultivated soils as only marginally suitable for
irrigation. Yields have averaged about 70 percent (cotton)
and 40 percent (maize) of appraisal estimates. Lack of
water for irrigation and delayed planting have contributed
to poor performance.
(b)    Declining international prices.  The prices of cotton and
maize in the world market in 1987 were 60 percent and 47
percent of those prevailing at appraisal ten years earlier
(in constant dollars).



(v)
(c)    High costs.  Some elements of the project (notably
utilities and structures on the main canal) were designed
to serve future expansion. Appraisal estimates were
outdated within months. Subsequent design changes and
rapid inflation contributed to a major escalation of costs.
(d)    Financial constraints.  Increased costs had to be borne by
GOK, so it became necessary to reduce the scope of the
project. The diversion weir was dropped and a temporary
pumping capacity was made permanent. In retrospect this
was a very damaging decision. For lack of water, the area
cultivated was reduced from 6700 to 2500 ha although
irrigation works, land clearing and levelling had been
completed for the whole area. Utilities and staff houses
built to serve a much larger project are now underutilized
and in some cases unused.
(e)    Managerial difficulties.   Design changes were made without
due consideration to economic and financial viability.
operational decisions had to be referred to the National
Irrigation Board (NIB) management in Nairobi, which was not
familiar with the problems and did not have the necessary
capacity or sense of urgency to solve them quickly.
Maintenance and operation of the pumping station and
agricultural machinery became particularly problematic.
Consultants were not employed to manage the irrigation
works and agricultural operations (except briefly).
Financial management was weakened by late and insufficient
budgetary releases and payments from CLSMB. Responsibility
was not properly transferred from the NIB to the Ministry
of Agriculture.
(f)    Lack of Financial Viability.  Cost recovery from
beneficiaries cover only a fraction of O&M costs.
5.     A number of these issues were noted in the appraisal process (soils,
high costs per settler, lack of financial viability, managerial
constraints) but did not cause any real alarms to be sounded. The
replicability of settlement at USS 18,000 per settler and the ability of
the Kenyan economy to absorb heavy recurring subsidies should have caused
more concern (one cofinancier, CDC, withdrew over the latter issue).
6.    Cost escalations (65Z) by mid-79 had eroded the economic viability of
the project and the Bank asked the Government to consider whether to
proceed with implementation (no major coutracts had been awarded). GOK
replied in the affirmative and the Bank concluded it had no legal basis to
press the issue.
7. A joint mid-term review outlined ways to ameliorate the situation and
some progress was made but the basic problems were unresolved when the
project closed in June 1987. Sustaining the project will require
continuing drain on the budget unless remedial actions are taken. Those
that should be considered are: (a)construction of a low cost gravity
intake; (b) the subsequent expansion of the irrigated area; (c)



(vi)
introduction of higher value crops; (d) commercial farming in the new area;
(e) more secure tenure for settlers; (f) managerial autonomy; (g) the
rationalizing and recouping of costsa and (h) larger tenant landholdings.
Sustainability
8.   The current situation is not really sustinable.  The management
arrangements are unwieldy, government costs are high in relation to output,
and the water supply remains vulnerable to mechanical breakdown.
Findinzs and Lessona
9.    There was a lack of technical knowledge at the time of appraisal
about the project area. This led to inappropriate technical design of
housing and other project buildings, the erroneous estimates of soil
fertility and yields, and the underestimation of project costs. If, as is
normal Bank practice, loan approval had been delayed until detailed project
preparation had been completed, that is, until final designs were
available, the Bank would have become aware that, because of cost
escalation, the project was no longer economically viable. Alternatively,
if the project had been implemented as a succession of small, feasible
investments,.better adapted to local implementation capabilitie3, there
might have emerged a sustainable irrigation system together with the kind of
knowledge the Bank only now has about soil fertility and its load bearing
properties.  MtiMaLely, the GoveKawent, the Saa and othei cofi-nauiere
(except one which withdrew) ended up financing an oversized and doomed
construction project which will require permanent budget subsidies unless
some of its components are made financially sustainable. This experience
is a reminder of the relevance of Bank pol$.ies on project readiness; of
the need for thorough and reliable technical knowledge before carrying out
economic and financial appraisal; or alternatively, of the usefulness of
starting agricultural projects as a small pilot phase befere their
replication. The recently approved Kenya Rural Services Project, for
instance, follows this approach.

BURA IRRIGATION SETTMEMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 722-UE.LOAN 1449-KE)
I. Background
1.01     The Kenxa highlands are fully exploitedi future growth there must
come through intensificttion. The prospects for tainfed crop production in
the arid and semi-arid areas that constitute 80 percent of the land area
are marginal. Irrigation is one of the few means for expanding
cultivation. About 40 percent of Kenya's irrigable area lies in the Tana
river basin, perhaps one-third of that in the lower basin. Since World War
II Kenya's rapid population growth has put increasing pressure oa the land
and created more landlessness. Under such conditions development of the
lower Tana basin for irrigated agriculture was an almost inevitable
consideration.
1.02     The objectives of the Bura Irrigation Project were to settle the
landless, create employment, and contribute to foreign exchange earnings by
producing cotton and food (maize). Through technical assistance and
training, the project was also expected to develop Kenya's capacity to
manage future major irrigation projects. The experience at the 850 hectare
(ha) Hola irrigation scheme established 40 kilometers (km) south of Bura in
1956-57 served as a model for the Bura project. The yields at Bola (2700
kg of seed cotton per ha) were encouraging, although its small size
prevented full cost recovery.
1.03     The bura project is situated just south of the equator on the west
bank of the Tana, 200 km north of the river's mouth. An alluvial terrace
with an even slope toward the river, the area is connected to Garissa (75
ki) and Garsen (150 km) by a road that is often impassable during the rainy
season. Rainfall is low (about 400 mm), bimodal and erratic. Temperatures
are high, with little seasonal variation. The river supports a narrow
strip of forest and small-scale flood-irrigated crop production. The area
is sparsely populated by Orma pastoral nomads, with one person per square
kilometer and a carrying capacity of about one livestock unit per 25 ha.
The soils -- chiefly sandy clay loam and heavy cracking clays -- occur in a
complex scattered pattern. Fairly shallow topsoils overlie saline-
alkaline subsoils. Their suitability for irrigation has been a major bone
of contention. The Tana river is a year round source of irrigation.
During low season, flow depends on release from a series of reservoirs for
hydroelectric generation but until recently were considered capable of
sustaining a larger area of irrigation. In 1987 however, for a period of
two months the river fell to a level that could barely sustain the Bura
pumping. The management now regards the impounding of water necessary.
This problem requires further study.
1.04     As part of the first phase in a larger development effort, the
project was designed to develop about 6700 ha of irrigated land for the
settlemtat of 5,150 landless families from all parts of Kenya. Plans were
to fund the construction of a diversion structure on the Tana river, plus a
temporary pumping facility, a 46 km supply canal, a 19 km main canal, water
distribution and drainzge systems, and land clearing and levelling to allow



-2
irrigation in long furrows. Under the original project design a principal
town and 23 villages were to be built for the settlers along with
educational, social and administrative facilities and the physical
infrastructure (roads, water, electricity) to support an estimated
population of 65,000. The project was to provide for research, extension,
mechanized cultivation, inputs, marketing and processing (ginning), forest
plantations an4 the protection of wildlife and existing riverine forest as
well as consulting services and feasibility studies for future irrigation
development in the Region. The total cost was estimated at US$98.4 million
with an ERR of 13 percent. Net farmer income was estimated at K Sh 7000
(US$840) after deducting land and water charges of K Sh 2800. These
charges were limited by the farmers' ability to pay and did not allow the
government full cost recovery.
1.05     The original sources of finance for the project were to be:
(a) IBRD (US$34 million) and IDA (US$6 million) for irrigation
works, buildings, afforestation, ginnery, NIB operation and
maintenance, stage II feasibility study and training;
(b)   EDF (US$12 million) for irrigation works and buildings;
Cc)   Netherlands (US$8.8 million) for roads and airfields, village
infrastructure and some machinery;
sd)   ODM (US$8.5 million) for consultancy services, vehicles and
equipment and public health; and
[e)   CDC (US$8.5 million) for agricultural management, incremental
inputs and farm development.
The rest (US$20.6 million) was to be financed by the Government of Kenya.
CDC soon withdrew from the scheme but additional assistance was negotiated
from PINNIDA (US$2 million) for afforeatation, Japan for agricultural
equipment and WFP for food to support settlers during an initial period.
1.06     The National Irrigation Board (NIB) was established in 1966 to
take responsibility for the planning, construction, settlement and
management of national irrigation schemes. At the time of appraisal it was
a semi-autonomous body responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and
guided by a board that included the Directors of Agriculture and Water
Development, the permanent secretaries of Economic Planning and the
Treasury, the Chairman of the Water Resources Authority and provincial
representatives. The Board appointed the General Manager. Each scheme was
headed by a scheme manager who was guided by an advisory comittee
appointed by the Board. By 1974 the Board managed five schemes comprising
8500 ha and 4600 settlers. NIB's performance at appraisal was considered
uneven; among the deficiencies noted were the absence of technical
expertise, the organization's small size, frequent changes in management,
the severe inadequacy of maintenance of agricultural equipment, and NIB's
reluctance to coordinate with other ministries and the provincial
administration. The difficulties imposed by the proposed Bura project were
also noted. Its large size (equal to the sum of all existing projects),
problematic soils, environmental problems (including serious health
hazards) afforestation, wildlife conservation and complex cofinancing



-3-
arrangements created challenges of a kind not previously encountered. In
view of its national mandate NIB was nevertheless entrusted with the
implementation of the Bura Project provided that its
(a)  appoint additional staff, including the project coordinator;
(b) employ consultants to complete the design, supervise
construction and assist in the coordination of
implementation; and
(c) employ a firm (expected to be CDC) to manage settlement and
agricultural production and train Kenyan staff for not less
than six years.
1.07     Project implementation occurred during a time when Kenya was
experiencing severe budgerary and balance of payments problems. GOK would
probably have had difficulty financing its original share (20 percent) of
project cost during this period and was soon to face much higher demands on
domestic resources.
II. Proiect Formulation
2.01     The genesis of the project is analyzed in Chapter I of the Mid-
Term Evaluation Report. That analysis will not be repeated here. Instead
we will focus on some of the key design features that have affected the
outcome of the project.
2.C      Soils.  At appraisal there was a great deal of controversy about
soil suitability and the consultants' criteria for classification. Because
of the prevailing sodic subsoils, no soils could be regarded as highly
suitable (Class I). The appraisal limited the project to 4500 ha of
suitable soils (Class II) and 2200 ha of shallow soils (Class III). If the
experience of these shallow soils was satisfactory, a second phase would be
contemplated for the area (about 6000 ha) left out of the first project.
It may be too early to evaluate the decision to proceed on a reduced scale.
Cotton yields (2100 kg of seed cotton per ha) have been lower than
appraisal estimates (3000 kg) but this has been partly because of
managerial problems that resulted in irregular irrigation and delayed
planting. Most of the better soils have yet to be brought into
cultivation. )saize yields, which have not been systematically sampled but
appear to be considerably below appraisal estimate (1700 vs 3700 kg/ha),
have suffered even more from lack of water and possibly from intolerance of
the sodic subsoils. Improved (hybrid) varieties have been introduced but
perform badly under water stLess. Some irrigation difficulties have been
reported on the shallow soils. As levelling became difficult, frrigation
had to be done on a steeper slope than was assumed in appraisal estimates.
This, plus the limited infiltration on shallow soils, has made irrigation
in long furrows inefficient on much of the land. More systematic
evaluation may be justified but available evidence does not support the
optimistic assumptions about yield made at appraisal. (See Annex 3).
2.03     Economies of scale.  The consultant responsible for preparation
claimed that only a large-scale project could justify the high costs of
river diversion, canal constrLetion and other infrastructure. The



appraisal team accepted this position and saw the project as the first
phase of a larger development program on both the west and the east bank.
Evidence to support such expansion plans was however weak and soon
evaporated. Embracing the concept of a large-scale project prevented a
clear focus on the minimum needs of the project at hand. Alternative
intake arrangements could have been explored and development of the
infrastructure scaled down and modified. Planning for a larger project
!uurdened the project with excessive structures and made it necessary to
postpone the gravity intake structure (to allow further feasibility
studies) and introduce a temporary pumping capacity. This pumping
arrangement was later made permanent in an effort to cut down investment
costs and has become the source of the difficulties in providing a reliable
water supply.
2.04     State of engineering.  In view of the reduced scale of the project
accepted by the World Bank, NIB commissioned consultants to review the
original preparation report. After assurance from the consultants that SAR
cost estimates were accurate, the Bank did not await the outcome of this
effort and the appraisal report was issued two months ahead of the
consultants' Project Planning Report (PPR). The PPR showed an increase in
investment costs of 22Z. The project was already seriously underfinanced
only months after the appraisal report was issued.
2.05     Cost per settler.  The cost per settler at appraisal was estimated
at US$18,000. Within months this increased to US$22,000 and ultimately
became about US 35,000. Although the project was not financially viable
(the present value of future subsidies has been estimated at US$18 million,
or US$3,500 per settler), the appraisal report contains no discussion of
the replicability of the approach or the pros and cons of alternative means
of creating employment. Nor does it refer to similar undertakings in other
countries (e.g. Sudan - Rahad) supported by the Bank at the same time which
show considerably lower cost per hectare. (See Annex 2).
2.06     ManaRement.  Considering the misgivings expressed about NIB, ways
should have been explored to give the project more autonomy within NIB
during construction and later, as was done for the Rahad project in Sudan.
2.07     Afforestation.  This component appears seriously underdesigned in
the appraisal report. Water requirements and costs, the management of
block plantations, the sale of produce and cost recovery were treated only
superficially.
III. Project Implementation
3.01     Chapter II of the Mid-Term Evaluation Report provides detailed
analysis of project implementation through 1984. Some of the main
conclusions and recommendations of that report are highlighted belcw.
A. Implementation Through 1984
3.02     Design modifications.  The final design reports issued by the
consultants early in 1979 featured significant changes to the engineering
proposals that had been the basis for the appraisal and the Project
Planning Report (para. 2.03). The consultants concluded that a weir would



- 5 -
have been satisfactory for diversion of vater to the vest bank but since
the east bank was also to be developed (in the future) a more expennive
barrage was now necessary. This and other physical changes caused costs to
escalate. Total cost estimates were now 65 percent above those contained
in the appraisal report.   The revised designs were said to have the
advantage of lowering maintenonce costs. However, it was later discovered
that the consultants had excluded certain costs. The economic rate of
return had in fact declined to no more than 4 percent and the project W3s
no longer economically viable. Donor concern about the situation resulted
in a letter to the Kenya Government asking whether the project should be
continued. COX indicated its continued interest and its intention to
solicit supplementary finance, and the Bank did not feel it had a legal
basis to press the point. The earlier CDC withdrawal over the lack of
financial viability had already created a financing gap. Donors could have
insisted on going back to the original designs, or a total revision of the
project concept, but this approach was rejected because of the delays it
would entail.   Instead attempts were made to reduce project costs by
postponing river diversion works, reducing the forestry component to 600 ha
and curtailing the staff housing and internal roads programs. Also,
additional potential donors were identified and by mid-1982 agreements were
negotiated with OPEC, Kuwait and FINNIDA. The OPEC and Kuwaiti assistance
did not materialize.
3.03     Financial crisis.  Project construction started in mid-1979 -- two
years late -- and by 1982 was three years behind schedule. Kenya in this
period was experiencing a rate of inflation much higher than the 8 percent
that had been assumed in calculating the price contingencies at appraisal.
The changing estimates of cost per ha are illustrated below:
Costs per ha
Current     1986 Constant
g Sh             g Sh
1975     Preparation report (14,560 ha)          23,850          87,768
1977     Appraisal report (6,700 ha)            114,300         323,469
1977     Project planning report (6,700 ha)    139,700          395,351
1979     Final design stage (6,400 ha)          239,400         564,984
1982     Progress report (6,400 ha)             330,000         475,200
1983     Curtailed area (3,900 ha)              385,000         500,500
1987     Curtailed area (2,500 ha)              472,000         472,000
The additional cost caused by design changes, delays and rapid inflation
and the withdrawal of CDC had to be borne by GOK whose share of total
investment increased from 20 percent at appraisal to about 50 percent in
1982. An inter-ministerial committee was appointed to review the situation
and calculated an ERR of 1 percent. It was decided to reduce the irrigated
area to 3900 ha, and to cancel the barrage, the ginnery and the 132 kv
transmission line. Total project cost after these reductions was estimated
at K Sh 1504 million in 1983 prices, (the appraisal estimate had been K Sh
766 million including contingencies) and the GOX share was reduced to 40
percent. The Bank under its Special Action Program increased its
disbursement percentages retroactively to ease the financial crisis.
Nevertheless, GOK would have great difficulty meeting its obligations which
caused further delays in implementation, inadequate maintenance, and
ultimately further curtailment of the project in 1985. In 1983-1984 and
1984-1985 Bura expenditures amounted to 20-25 percent of Kenya's total
public investment in agriculture.



3.04     Technical execution.  Despite L delayed start, execution of the
main civil engineering works was prompt, which allowed the first
agricultural activities to begin in 1981. Progress is illustrated in the
table below:
No. of         --Cultivated area (ha)-- ----Yields (kg/ha)----
Year     Settlers        Cotton    Maize (est.)   Cotton   Maize (est.)

1984      1,843           2,050      1,100         2,200       1700

1987      2,139 a/        2,454      1,000         2,250       1700
a/ Some settlers have more than two plots but many have only one (0.625
ha).
The performance of the pump unit has been generally poor.  Lack of trained
operators and spare parts plus poor maintenance have caused frequent
breakdowns and water supply failures. The unit was originally meant as a
temporary measure pending construction of a gravity intake structure. The
cancellation of this structure and the bad experience with the pumping
station have been matters of serious concern for the entire life of the
project. The cost of pumping in 1984 prices was K Sh 1500 ha for fuel
alone.11 Technical constraints include problems with furrow irrigation (see
para. 2.02), the difficulty of maintaining and operating agricultural
machinery in remote areas and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
systems.
3.05     Settler income and cost recovery.  In the period between the
appraisal (1977) and the mid-term review (1984), cotton prices (in real
terms) deteriorated and maize prices improved slightly. Using rather high
estimates of cotton yields (2500 kglha), the mid-term review estimated the
net cash income of the settlers at only K Sh 7400 or in real terms 55
percent of the appraisal estimate. Prom this, a NIB land and water charge
(including cultivation cost) of K Sh 3000 per settler had then been
deducted. The actual NIB costs for operation and maintenance were estimated
at K Sh 7500 per settler. The annual subsidy for operation and maintenance
of the project (excluding interest on invested capital) in 1984 thus
amounted to K Sh 8 million (US$500,000). Actual farm income varied
considerably and some settler families experienced tremendous difficulties.
Delays of up to four months in payments for cotton delivered contributed to
their hardship.
1/    The total cost of pumping in 1987 was estimated at K Sh
3200 per ha; half of that was fuel costs.



- 7 -
3.06     Health.  At appraisal it was recognized-that malaria infection and
general health conditions at Bura made it necessary to install a well-
functioning health service before settlement. The health center was
finished in 1981, but lack of equipment and financial constraints prevented
its opening until mid-1983.   In 1982, some 150-200 persons are believed to
have died of malaria. Even after the commissioning of the health center
the situation remained unsatisfactory. The two health subcenters and the
village health posts were dropped from the project and inadequate transport
and lack of drugs prevented an effective outreach program. Programs put in
place by the Catholic Mission and WFP offered some relief. Apart from
malaria, the main health problems encountered in 1984 were malnutrition and
diarrheal diseases. Many of the safeguards originally planned to counter
schistosomiasis had not been implemented but the snail vector was not yet
established in the canals.
3.07     Environmental problems.  Three major concerns were expressed in
the mid-term evaluation report. (1) After the initial clearing of land,
the main source of wood had been the riverine forest. The delay in
establishing irrigated forest plantation for poles and fuel wood could mean
prolonged reliance on and a threat to the riverine forest. (2) The long
supply canal could mean that wildlife was cut off from the river. The
vatering pools that had originally been planned were not functional. The
consequences had not been fully analyzed. (3) Pest control in cotton
production involved eight aerial sprayings which could become a health
hazard. The report suggested a switch to tractor spraying and research on
integrated pest control.
3.08     Settlement issues.  There were few reports of friction among
settlers from different tribes and areas and between settlers and existing
residents. Desertion was high in 1982 (25 percent). It had decreased
subsequently, but many settlers were reported to have left behind, or sent
away, their families. The original intention in project design was to help
settlers build their own houses, at an estimated cost to the project of K
Sh 4000. This required careful timing of arrivals that did not occur. The
first 1,428 houses were instead built by NIB on force account at an average
cost of K Sh 26,000 but the quality was poor and in 1982 the project
decided to use a contractor instead. Some 455 houses needed
rehabilitation. This was entrusted to the contractor. The cost of these
houses after rehabilitation was K Sh 43,000. Subsequently 762 houses were
constructed at a cost of K Sh 26,700 per houwe. By the time Government
decided to limit the scope of the project to 3900 ha (and 23,000 people
instead of 65,000) construction contracts for irrigation works, water
supply and sewerage had been awarded and most of the work completed. In
the initial design, villages were to share public standpipes (12 houses per
standpipe). This design had been modified to provide water to each house
at considerably higher cost. Because of water shortages and financial
constraints (O&M cost at half capacity was estimated at K Sh 1.5-2u) the
water system was not put in use and the project continued up to 1986 to
rely on the temporary facilities provided for the construction phase. No
consideration had been given to cost recovery in 1984. Settlers operated
their holdings as tenants on an annual lease and had little influence on
their farming operations. Since houses belonged to the project, settlers
had generally not provided adequate maintenance.



- 8 -
3.09     Management.  NIB was not sufficiently strengthened to take on the
new tasks. The technical and particularly the accounting department should
have been reinforced. The General Manager was overburdened so there were
long delays in decision making. In a 1981 study, the Directorate of
Personnel Management, suggested appointing two assistant general managers.
However, by the end of 1984, seven years after project signing, NIB's
organizational structure was largely unchanged and the weaknesses
identified at appraisal and in 1981 remained and were reinforced by the
financial crisis. Late and inadequate releases of funds from the Treasury
created severe cash flow problems. The project design also relied on a
high degree of interagency cooperation, which failed to materialize.
Completed infrastructure was not taken over by the appropriate institutions
and insufficient funds were budgeted for operations. The interministerial
committee was a constructive force, but resolution of these problems
required a higher level steering committee.
3.10     To help the NIB manage the irrigation system and agricultural
operations, the Development Credit Agreement (Section 3.02) called for use
of an experienced management firm for not less than six years, starting
January 1979. Such a firm was in fact employed for only about six months
in 1982-83. This breach of covenants, which was due to disagreement on the
role of the consultants, contributed to operational delays and failures and
poor maintenance of civil works and equipment. Lack of managerial
delegation was another problem. Almost all procurement decisions, even for
day-to-day supplies, had to be referred to Nairobi, where the NIB had
neither the staff nor the sense of urgency to attend to so many requests
for spare parts, farm inputs, fuel, casual labor and the like. NIB had
some degree of autonomy but was poorly managed.   It was not provided with
the technical and managerial assistance originally envisaged.
Consequently, it lacked the capacity to review consultant proposals and
monitor the economic and financial viability of the project; also, it had
little Influence on the decisions of other ministries and agencies.
B. The Mid-Term Review
3.11     The basic options for future operations identified in the mid-term
evaluation are outlined in the following table. There was no zero
investment option as the pumping station was in urgent need of
rehabilitation. Thus option 1 represents the minimum investment
requirement. The donors agreed to pursue this option for the immediate
rehabilitation of the scheme while at the same time investigating the
feasibility of option 4b through studies of gravity intake, commercial
farming and cotton pricing.

Notes:
1)     The subsidy calculation assumes a target net farm income of
K.Sh 10,000 (incl. subsistence crops) per settler. The subsidy
is based on the prevailing market price for seed cotton. The
mission also proposed a 20 percent price increase, in which
case the NPV of Government subsidy would decrease to K Sh 183
million and 166 million for options 1 and 4b respectively.
2)     The subsidy and ERR were calculated after deduction of receipts
from import duties and other taxes estimated at 15 percent of
costs.
3)     Project risks refer mainly to security of water supply.
3.12     On the basis of the recommendations in the mid-term evaluation
report the donors took the following positions in 1985:
A.      Ineffective management has become the overriding problem
at Bura. Unless management can be improved immediately, the
cofinanciers see little future for the scheme and no
justification for further investments. Ineffective management
affects all works and maintenance at Bura as well as
agricultural and pump station operations. Every action needs
approval from NIB Headquarters, with priorities set in Nairobi.
Although this is a time of crisis management there is no evident
sense of urgency about the purchase of spares, clearance of the
management agreement, the processing of documents, or reaction
to the many issues raised in the mid-term evaluation report.

They proposeds
-   that management assistance be provided without delay.  The
World Bank is prepared to provide financing until the EDF
financing becomes effective. The contract should provide for
effective management responaibility for the management team,
including consultant staff. The consultants would provide the
head of the management team; and
-   that a steering committee of senior officials be established,
as recommended in the mid-term evaluation report.
B.        Persistent interruptions in the water supply have
severely limited yields. The water supply for irrigation has to
be assured.
They proposed;
-   that work begin immediately on rehabilitation of the pump
station (estimated cost K Sh 10 million);
- that NIB contract with a reputable firm to manage the pump
station for two years;
-   that NIB carry out a program to ensure pump station operation
and management (e.g., renting extra pumps, spares, housing,
and a workshop); and
-   that no expansion of pumping capacity be undertaken at
present.
C.       The scheme was short of funds and had little
financialautonomy. Scheme management was dependent on the NIB for
all but trivial money decisions. The Cotton Board had not yet
paid farmers for cotton delivered in August 1984 s0 farmers were
not interested in clearing Sheir fields and producing cotton in
1985.
They proposed:
-   that the Cotton Board be instructed to pay farmers and NIB the
K Sh 26.5 million due for the 1984 crop;
-   that the NIB, on behalf of farmers, negotiate a contract on
commercial terms with the Cotton Board, or seek alternative
marketing arrangements for 1985 and after;
-   that Government issue an advance of up to K Sh 20 million to
form a working capital fund for the scheme; and
-   that the NIB implement at Bura the decentralized accounting
system proposed by Coopers and Lybrand.



- 11 -
D.       The scheme will require heavy Government subsidies
throughout its life (over K Sh 20 million a year).
They proposed:
-   a review of the price of Bura cotton.  The true economic value
of Bura cotton is at least R Sh 1 per kg higher than the
present price of K Sh 4.80 per kg. If this price wnre paid it
would bring the scheme closer to break-even;
-   a review of how to maximize benefits from the present
developed area by leasing currently unused areas to commercial
farmers;
-   a review of savings possibilities (on both capital and
recurent costs)J
-   setting up groups to review these questions and report by
April 30, 1985. Donors were prepared to participate in these
groups. These reports were to be revieved by Government and
cofinanciers and decisions made by May 31, 1985, (including
discussions about increases in the cotton price); and
-   that Government immediately release the proposed NIB financial
controller from his other duties.
E.       Unless all of the above points are resolved, the future
of the scheme is bleak. The cofinanciers are prepared to finance
investments necessary to maintain the scheme and carry out the
above, provided that Government agrees and that NIB can perform
adequately.
They proposed:
-   that no further settlement for smallholder cultivation take
place under the present project;
-   that only investments necessary to bring into cultivation the
area irrigable with present pumping capacity be undertaken
now;
-   that NIB performance be carefully monitored against a detailed
action program, with regular three-monthly reviews; and
-   that, subject to certain conditions, including the review of
NIB perfo..mance, cofinanciers would make the amendments to
legal agreements needed to complete the above program.
3.13     GOK agreed in February 1985 to a time bound action program to
pursue these points. After some delays NIB started implementing the
program. Then in April 1985 it postponed further implementation pending
final decisions on a GOK initiative to transfer management responsibilities
from NIB to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (HALD).
In a letter to the Bank dated July 2, 1985, the Finance Secretary outlined



- 12 -
the following terms:
(a)    The project would be consolidated at 2500 ha;
(b)    The 5000-ha option would be further investigated.  Terms of
reference for a study of gravity supply were being drawn up.
Proposals for long-term financial viability would be
communicated to the Bank by the end of 1985;
(c)    The management unit within MALD would report to a Steering
Conittee and be constituted as a separate legal entity. It
would have great autonomy within an approved work program and
budget and would have its own Bank account, on which an
advance of K Sh 20 million would be deposited. A 3-year
management contract with MEDICO was signed on June 28, 1985;
(d)    Arrangements for improved pump station operations were in
hand. Bids for the spare pumping unit would be sought with a
view to have it operating by the end of March 1986;
te)    Arrangements to assure timely payment of cotton would be
negotiated with CLSMB;
Cf)   The water works and health facilities would be funded and
handed over to the appropriate ministries; and
tg)    The closing date would be extended to June 30, 1986;
arrangements for funding of NEDECO and cancellation of US$3
million were requested.
Corresponding amendments to the loan and credit agreements were
communicated by the Bank on July 29 and signed by GOK in December 1985.
3.14.    The Bank's sentiments at this stage were illustrated by its
statement in connection with the Fall 1985 project implementation reviews
OThe major objective now is to establish an effective organization
and management system which can operate the large investment
already established years in the right direction. The risk for
failure is high due to the essentially poor project concept.
However, given the high sunk costs, the negligible additional
investment required, and the dependency of 20,000 people now
living on the scheme, the only acceptable option is to provide
limited assistance to keep the project running on an increasingly
efficient basisg.
C. Pro1ect Completion
3.15     In December 1985 a supervision mission reviewing progress against
the July 2 letter from the Finance Secretary Cpara. 3.13) noted that:
(a)    The setting up of a new management unit within MALD was far
from complete. The opening balance, legal and financial
status, organization and degree of autonomy remained unclear.
Key staff were not appointed, the advance payment of working
capital had not been made, and no budget and work program had
been prepared. However, the steering committee had started
functioning and the three-person NEDECO team was in place.



- 13 -
(b)      Pump station functioning remained highly erratic.  No
measures for preventive maintenance had been takent
procurement of spare parts was delayed and backup pumping
capacity would not be in operation by March 31, 1986. The
mission recommended that irrigation should continue to be
restricted to 2500 ha.
tc)     Delays in payment for cotton had worsened.
(d)     Some progress was noted in the handing over and funding of
the operation of water works and health facilities.
(e)     Terms of reference for the gravity intake study had been
finalized but bids had not yet been invited. The mission
recommended investigating a commercial nucleus estate
approach to management of the scheme and using the 3000 ha
that are prepared for irrigation but now remain fallow.
The mission recommended and the Bank agreed to extend the closing date to
June 30, 1986.
3.16     President Moi, who visited the project in January 1986, called it
a failure. He considered the maize crop extremely poor and the pumping of
water to be very wasteful. The president expressed concern about farmers
not being paid for the cotton, was shocked by the squalid condition of the
settler houses and said he would appoint an independent team to disentangle
the mess, restructure the project and manage it from the site. In the wake
of the president's visit, a new management committee was appointed, headed
by the provincial commissioner of the Coast Province. A new general
manager reporting to the Office of the President was also appointed and
stationed at Bura.
3.17     The observations of the December mission and the subsequent
upheavals led the Bank to address a letter to the Chief Secretary in which
for the short term it was suggested 'that Government explore options for
creating an institutional structure which, within work programs and budgets
agreed with its board, would have maximum authority for decision taking -
on hiring and firing, on procurement and on financial management. Plans
for establishing such a structure were well advanced under previous
management and it is recommended that a rapid review and decision be taken
on these plans." For the longer term the Bank recomended that the
Government review alternative management structures (e.g., a nucleus estate
with outgrowers) that could provide services for the whole scheme,
including water distribution. In a pointed response on April 2, the Chief
Secretary expressed his confidence in the new management team and did not
address the autonomy question. Subsequent discussions focussed on
supervision of ongoing contracts and the completion of disbursements by
March 1967, with little emphasis on the managerial structure and
sustainability.
3.18     A limited supervision mission in May 1986 noted that the project
status had improved slightly since December 1985 thanks to an active
management committee and the presence of a quite effective general manager
resident at Bura. However, the project was still grossly understaffed and
transfers from the Treasury had fallen far short of needs. Difficulties
with pumping persisted and resulted in limited (2500 ha) and delayed



- 14 -
plantings and insufficient watering. Water supplies were uncertain for the
forestry plantations that were about to start. The gravity intake study
that ODM would finance had not yet been launched. The mission expressed
concern about the health situation and the lack of transport. Delayed
audits were a recurring theme in all supervision reports.
3.19     The last Bank input was a one-day supervision mission in November
1986. The missiou noted that the management committee had been
instrumental in mobLlizing support from different institutions but had been
hampered by frequent changes of chairman. Organization and personnel of
the management unit were still under review and progress was still hampered
by an acute shortage of upper and middle level managers. Procurement was
slow as decisions were still made outside of the management unit. Finance
was no longer a constraint but accounting was still rudimentary, with no
prospect of an audit. Pumping remained erratic and no progress on the
gravity intake study had been noted. The maize crop had been scaled down
to 500 ha (from 1250 ha). Efforts to establish forestry plantations for
fuel wood continued to be frustrated by a water shortage. Lack of
transport and drugs frustrate the health program and the water works had
not been taken over by the Ministry of Water Development (MOWD) as
promised.
D. Position in early 1988
3.20     In February 1988, when the PCR mission visited Bura, the project
had 2,139 settlers. A few settlers were reported to have more than two
plots (a plot = 0.625 ha) but many had only one plot. Project design calls
for two plots per settler which, if implemented, would mean 1963 settlers
cultivating the 2454 ha of cotton that were planted in 1987. Project
management is trying to rectify the settler situation, The yield of cotton
reached a record level of 2250 kglha. Information about area and yield of
the maize crop continues to be inadequate. An estimated 1,000 ha were
planted. No crop sampling had been carried out in 1986 or 1987 but the
yield was expected to be below average (average having been 1,700 kglha).
The main constraints are water supply and timely cultivation. Cotton crops
got 5 to 6 waterings instead of the optimum 7 and the maize crop got only 2
to 3 waterings instead of the 6 planned. A tractor shortage (only 12 to 13
are operational) hampers timely land preparation. Damage to crops by
wildlife and livestock is reported. Some settlers seem to have acquired
livestock, and given the availability of water and such services as schools
and health care, the local pastoral population has increased which may
result in both overgrazing and crop damage. The small vegetable plots
would benefit from more attention from the extension staff.
3.21     A farmer with the prescribed two plots plus a small vegetable area
would derive an income of about K Sh 8000 after having paid for project
services and hired labor. Land and water including cultivation charges
remain unchanged at K Sh 3000 per settler; fertilizers and spraying cost
amounted to about K Sh 4425. Settlers also get housing and treated
drinking water. By comparison, a casual laborer earns about K Sh 7200
annually. The problems of late payment for cotton appear to have been
resolved. The farmers now receive an advance at the time of picking, and
then an intermediate and final payment.



- 15 -
3.22     The water works were commissioned in 1986 and treated water is
being delivered to all the villages. Wastage is a problem because the
settlers tend to let the water flow freely to trees and vegetables around
the house. Electricity and sewer systems for the project center are also
operating. The project is now fully integrated into the MOA, is expected
to operate within the civil service, and lists 515 posts. There is still
an acute shortage of accounting staff. The NIB audit for 1984-1985 was
completed in October 1987; the accounts for later years remain unaudited.
Eventually the responsibility for operation and maintenance of the water
works and buildings are expected to be handed over to the Ministry of Water
and the Ministry of Works, respectively.
3.23     The health center still reports some difficulties vith transport
and occasionally drugs but the Catholic mission is still operating and the
health situation appears to have stabilized. Malaria is still a major
problem and a few cases of bilharzia are treated monthly. Cases of
malnutrition are rare. The FINNIDA-supported forestry component is taking
off. Some 103 ha of irrigL id and 176 ha of rainfed plantations have been
established and are expected to reach 600 ha in 1988. Amenity trees in the
villages have been promoted with the help of village nurseries. The
outcome on rainfed plantations is still uncertain but appears promising.
Attempts are being made to establish plantat4ons by using the water in the
drains. A policy for managing the plantations and disposing of fuel wood
still needs to be established. Forestry staff do not report any major
damage to the riverine natural forest. The elimination of flooding through
regulation of the Tana River upstream of Bura is probably the largest
threat to the forest. The water level at the Bura intake is now seasonally
very low. The watering ponds for wildlife are not operational but
livestock and wildlife both appear to use the main canal as a source of
water. Aerial spraying of cotton is still standard practice.
E. Economic Viability
3.24     It was difficult to determine project cost because the handover
from NIB to MOA was inadequate and many of the personnel involved at
earlier stages had left. If the project is defined as having ended in June
1987, total project cost including operating and maintenance expenditures
(K Sh 152 million) amounts to K Sh 1.2 billion or US$105 million. This is
lower than the K Sh 1.5 billion estimated in the mid- terr evaluation
report because contractors were not allowed to continue beyond the agreed
upon completion date.  Thus some of the irrigation rcrks, road construction
and village water supplies in the extension area were cancelled.
3.25     At the present level of operation (2500 ha) the project is
yielding a negative rate of retur'.. Annual operating costs (about K Sh 53
million in 1987-88) exceed benefits (about K Sh 33 million) and are likely
to continue doing so at reduced levels even if there is enough irrigation
water and yields of both cotton and maize are improved to 2500 kglha.
International prices for cotton and maize have deteriorated; in 1987 they
were only 62 and 47 percent, respectively, of prices that prevailed at
appraisal.



- 16 -
F. Sustainability
3.26    At rfduced operating levels, the Bura Project is plagued by
enormous overhead for staff and facilities. The annual cost of operating
the project, less cost recovered from farmers, leaves about K Sh 34 million
to be covered by Government (i.e., K Sh 17,000 or US$1,000 per settler).
Some rationalization cf costs and increased cost recovery may be possible
but a major increase in charges to farmers must await improved water
availability and yields. On the positive side, two new pumps ere being
installed which should allow a more reliable supply of water, the
irrigation network is being maintained with the help of mIP supplies,
settlers appe:ar to be more rooted, and there are few signs of tribal
conflict. However, many buildings suffer from deteriorating foundations,
which are costly to repair. Many settler houses have collapsed and others
are threatened as farmers do not feel responsible for maintaining tk.em.
Spare parts for most equipment is costly and not readily available, so
equipment may need to be replaced early. Salinity does not appear to be a
major problem but its effects on yields may be compounded by the effects of
water shortages and difficulties in cultivation. The project still enjoys
such privileges as a separate savings account, the carry over of balances
from one year to another, retention of revenue earned and relaxed
procurement rules. Incomplete integration of the Bura project into the MOA
could threaten the efficient operation of the project.
IV. Possible Remedies
4.01     The mid-term review listed a number of remedial options (para.
3.11). The unreliability and cost of pumping make gravity intake a
requisite for rehabilitation. Terms of reference for a low cost gravity
intake study were prepared in 1985 but the study was never commissioned.
The reasons for the recent low levels of the river Tana at certain times of
the year need further analysis. If its flow cannot be remedied by
improving the operation of upstream reservoirs, some impounding of water
should be considered. Secondly, the area under cultivation should be
expanded to 5,400-6,000 ha to make the project more financially viable.
Such expansion is possible in the area south of Bura, where irrigation
works were constructed, land was cleared and levelled, village sites were
prepared, drinking water provided and staff houses constructed. The
project engineer estimates that rehabilitation of these facilities will
cost about K Sh AO million. Recent reviews also reveal that the Pumwani
and Hasabubu commands (see Annex 3) are more suitable to irrigation than
the areas presently under cultivation.
4.02    Awarding the settlers more security of tenure (freehold for house
site and vegetable plot and a long-term lease on agricultural land) should
help resolve maintenance problems and improve farming. Proposals to
improve the legal status of settlers have been submitted to Government.
Given the high costs of operating and maintaining the scheme, it might pay
to wimport" maize for the settlers and grow higher value crops, such as oil
crops, citrus, or bananas. Such an option should be considered.
4.03     Basing area expansion on commercial farming rather than settlement
would result in more rapid development, higher yields and less cost to the
Government. One suggestion is to turn the whole scheme in its expanded



- 17 -
form over to a ccmmercial entity to be operated as a nucleus estate with
the present settlers as outgrowers. Such an arrangement would be ideal if
the financial viability can be restored to attract private enterprise.
Increasing the area allocated to each settler may over time improve cost
recovery.
4.04     There is an acute need to introduce more commercial principles,
more attention to cost efficiency and cost recovery, and more freedom in
staffing, procurement and financial matters. It is clear that a scheme of
this size and complexity cannot be operated by a unit within MOA or any
other Ministry. If privatization is not possible, then a public
corporation or a joint venture must be contemplated.
4.05     Considering previous investments as sunk costs, the mid-term
review team found that some of these options might offer a reasonable rate
of return. However, some of its assumptions about yield and operating
costs have not proved true; the reduced flow of the Tans River may
necessitate costly remedies; and with the passage of time unused facilities
have deteriorated further, more project buildings have developed serious
foundation problems, and some equipmenL will have to be replaced (para.
3.26). Thorough feasibility studies - economic as well as financial -
should be done on a range of options.
4.06     Apart from requiring that additional investments produce a
satisfactory economic rate of return, any rehabilitation program should
also substantially reduce recurring Government subsidies. If further study
confirms that this cannot be achieved, one option would be to close down
the scheme. A study of future options should include consideration of the
implications of such a decision.
V. Principal Conclusions
5.01     The risks of the Bura irrigation and settlement project were well
known at the time of appraisal. A Bank-issued paper on the settlement of
agricu tural lands2/ was drafted at the same time as _he appraisal report.
Some of the conclusions in this study were:
(a) Government-assisted settlement of new lands can contribut.-
substantially to a rural development program, important
objectives of which are accelerated growth of agricultural
output and creation of jobs. But this requires a larger
settlement program than most countries undertake. Such a
program must be replicable and therefore have low unit costs.
(b) The Bank's involvement in future settlement activity is
likely to be small in relation to total investment needs.
Bank-assisted projects, which should be viewed as prototypes
to develop approaches, can be justified only if costs per
beneficiary are relatively low.
2/  World Bank Report No. 1670, June 1977.



- 18 -
tc) Major common problems are inadequate management, staffing and
organization, overambitious physical targets, underestimates
of development costs and difficulties with cost recovery.
As the MADIA study points out (para. 1.08), the dangers of this type of
project in the Tana basin had already been described in 1973:
OThere is a sharp danger in the lower Tana of irreversible
commitment which given the he-ivy risks that normally attend
organized irrigation might ... (be) on a scale which would be a
national disaster. In general the larger the project is, the
higher the cost, the larger the number of people involved and the
more publicity it receives. The danger is that if the major Tana
irrigation project were implemented with heavy inve investment in
a barrage, irrigation works, and the esta"lishment of settlers
settlers, it would be extremely difficult to disband. The risks
are not simply that such a project would fail but that it will
remain a permanent millstone weighing down the national
economy.... n
5.02     The following questions will be addressed in this section:
(a)   Should the project have been given a green light before it
is technically ready?
(b)   Should the project have been stopped in 1979?
(c)   Were the mid-course adjustments well conceived?
5.03     Proiect Readiness.  There was a lack of technical knowledge at the
time of appraisal about the project area. This led to inappropriate
technical design of housing and other project buildings, the erroneous
estimates of soil fertility andyields, and the underestimation of project
costs. If, as is normal Bank practice, loan approval had been delayed
until detailed project perparation had been completed, that is, until final
designs were available, the Bank wtould have become aware that, because of
cost escalation, the project was no longer economically viable.
Alternatively, if the project had been implemented as a succession of
small, feasible investment, better adapted to local implementation
capabilities, there might have merged a sustainable irrigation system
together with the kind of knowledge the Bank only now has about soil
fertility and its load bearing properties. Ultimately, the Government, the
Bank and other cofinanciers (except one which withdrew) ended up financing
an oversized and doomed construction project which will require permanent
budget subsidies unless some of its components are made financially
sustainable. This experienca is a reminder of the relevance of bank
policies on project readiness; of the need for thorough and reliable
technical knowledge before carrying out economic and financial appraisal;
or alternatively, of the usefulness of starting agricultural projects as a
small pilot phase before their replication. The recently approved Kenya
Rural Services Project, for instance, follows this approach.
5.04     The 1979 Review.  During the 1979 review,  Bank staff had
3/ Chambers and Moris (eds.) Mwea: An irrigated settlement in Kenya.
Munich, 1973



- 19 _
considered the option of cancelling the loanlcredit. However, the
Government wanted to continue with the project, and the Bank does not have
the legal basis to force cancellation on grounds that the project is
uneconomic. Proposals to insert a clause in legal documents empowering the
Bank to do so have been discussed at the Bank's Board several times and
rejected.   Another option was to redesign the project.  However, the
revisions made at this stage were marginal. They did not question the
basic design or make the project more economically viable.
5.05     Midcourse corrections.  Three aspects of implementation in
particular compounded the effect of the design flaws. Firat, GOK failed
(except briefly) to employ a management firm to manage operation of the
irrigation system and agricultural services (para 3.10). Upon
recommendation of the mid-term review, the Government moved cautiously to
implement greater autonomy in staffing, procurement and financial
management, the appointment of a management firm (NEDECO), and the
reconstitution of a more powerful steering committee. However, progress
was set back by the changes in management responsibility in 1985 and again
in 1986.
5.06     The second major decision, made Li  1982, was to base the future
supply of water not temporarily but permanently on pumping.  This led to a
reduction of the cultivated area, delay of the forestry component,
disruptions of water supply and a reduction in yields. That decision was
made in response to a financial crisis, without sufficient attention to the
long-term consequences. The high cost of pumped water has reduced the
scheme's financial viability.
5.07     The third factor was to have been the decision to put the initial
settlers on the worst rather than the best soils. The water shortage
prevented subsequent exploitation of the better soils. The extent to which
farming can be sustained in parts of the Chewele command is questionable.
VI. The Future Role of Irrigation
6.01     The Bura project did not contribute to the objective, expressed at
appraisal, of developing Kenya's capacity to manage future major irrigation
projects. On the contrary, the experience discredited development of
irrigation as a tool to achieve agricultural growth and employment. The
Bank's Agricultural Sector report of 1986 4 states, under the heading of
irrigation (para. 69)s
"Under present conditions, we believe that further
development of rainfed agriculture in the high-potential
areas offers considerable relative advantages in terms of
the economical use of financial, technical and
administrative resources. Yields in some of these areas can
be significantly increased with strategic investments in
improved agricultural services and key policy changes. This
option is far less expensive than a major irrigation
development program, a critical factor given Kenya's scarce
financial resources; it is also less management intensive,
another important criterion. This strategy would assist in
4/    Report NO. 4629-KE of January 7, 1986



- 20 -
developing agricultural services to support irrigated
schemes in the medium and longer terms; lack of services,
incentives, and research at present will significantly
reduce the potential benefits from investment in irrigated
agriculture. In the medium and longer terms, however, Kenya
will need to explore the options for developing irrigation.
Because of the significant costs and technical assistance
associated with large-scale schemes, and the disappointing
record of these projects to date in Kenya, we recommend the
following course of action, in order of priority.
(a)   define a clear strategy for irrigation development, taking
account of current financial and administrative constraints,
and the costs and benefits of irrigation versus other means
of intensifying production;
(b)   assemble available information on water availability and
water management, and classify potential irrigation areas as
to their economic value:
(c)   improve institutional coordination and clarify institutional
responsibilities for irrigation;
(d)   address key problems of existing schemes to develop them
into self-sustaining operations, while closing uneconomic
schemes;
(e)   organize and implement manpower training programs; and
(f)   cautiously pursue new projects, with a focus on less costly
small-scale irrigation and drainage schemes.'
6.02     Rapid population growth and the associated problems of
unemployment and landlessness that prompted the Bura project have an even
higher profile today and necessitate a continued review of the prospects
for opening new land through irrigation and settlement and for finding more
cost-effective and managerially efficient implementation strategies. This
chapter discusses the irrigation potential and options for exploiting it,
the objectives and constraints that must guide the establishment of
investment priorities in the agricultural sector (rainfed and irrigated)
and the issues that need to be addressed in defining an irrigation
strategy.
6.03     A recent study of  options and investment priorities in irrigation
development' S in Kenya gives the following estimates of existing potential
and irrigation.

Existing irrigation is underestimated as it does not include all private
development. Estimates of potential are based mainly on figures for water
availability which have been translated into area on the basis of certain
assumptions about irrigation efficiency and about cropping patterns and
irrigation intensity in different zones. In areas such as the middle and
lower Tana the availability of suitable land may be more of a constraining
factor than availability of water, so the total potential would be smaller.
On the other hand, the possibilities for lift irrigation from Lake Victoria
may be underestimated. The prospects for using ground water for irrigation
are considered very limited in this and earlier studies. Moreover it will
not be economically feasible to exploit the full potential (see para.
6.05).
6.04     Analysis of ongoing and planned projects to exploit this potential
produced a list of 299 items. Among planned projects there was enough
technical and other information to estimate and compare costs and benefits
for 59 of the projects (using the same prices, updating cost estimates and
to some extent homogenizing yields and cropping patterns by major agro-
ecological zones).
6.05     Estimated performance on these projects was measured against
Government objectives of economic growth (expressed as NPV and IRR)
employment generation (in man-years) and food security (in calories) and
against their demands on scarce resources (development funds) and
managerial capacity. The analysis showed that:
11 projects have an IRn above 20S
24 projects have an IRn between 10 and 202
15 projects have an IRR between 0 and 102 and
9 projects have a negative IRR.
Nine projects are consistently among the 15 top projects whatever weights
are attached to the above objectives and resource constraints. Eight of
these projects are small (below 600 ha) and one is large (above 7000 ha).
GOK would review the data on which the study is based before deciding on
investment priorities.
6.06     Based on the Bura experience, an irrigation strategy should
address the following issues:
(a)    The role of the private sector in irrigation.  The private
sector has been more successful than the public sector.
How can small and/or large-scale private investment be
promoted?
(b)    Financial viability.  Should one of the criteria for public



- 22 -
investment be that a project generate enough returns to
provide farmers with an adequate income and to cover at
least operating and maintenance costs? This would ensure
sustainability.
(c)    High costs of irrigation and settlement.  Can designs and
policies be modified to lower cost? What is the
international experience?
(d)    Institutional fragmentation.  The present division of
responsbilities may not allow the definition of
implementation of an effective irrigation strategy and may
not be cost-effective.
(e)    Management.  The Bura experience clearly points to the need
for more local autonomy in implementation. Can this be
achieved within a public corporation or through other
means?
(f)    CapacityZ  According to the task force on irrigation
development, the present capacity allows the addition of
only 400 ha of irrigated land annually in the public
sector. How can this capacity be enhanced? What is the
role of training and technical assistance? How can
managerial expertise and experience be acquired?

PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION
I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
A. Cost Escalation
1.01     The SAR was completed early in 1977 at which time the cost
estimates were based on prices and exchange rates prevailing in January
1977. Project construction started two and a half years later, in mid-
1979. Then and in the years following actual costs rose substantially
above the SAR estimates due to domestic inflation, escalating international
prices, the declining value of the Kenya shilling in relation to the U.S.
dollar, and changes in designs. Some of these factors are reflected in the
table below:
Annual Domestic     Exchange    Cumulative         Cumulative

1.02      The Project PlAnning Report (PPR) that was issued within months
of the SAR entailed a 22Z cost Increase. When final designs emerged in
April 1979 the total cost of the project had increased 652 in real terms.
As a consequence of these and subsequent cost increases, the scope of the
project was reduced several times in the following years. In the end,
total project cost in KSh was about 442 above appraisal estimates.
Physically about 701 of what was planned at appraisal was achieved.
However, many of the constructed facilities remain unused.
II. THE ROLE OF CONSULTANTS
2.01     ILACO had been involved in conducting studies and making
recommendations about possible irrigation schemes on the Lower Tana Basin
since 1967. The Bura Irrigation Project materialized from their 1973
studies.
2.02     In their 1973 report on Bura, ILACO wrote that extended irrigation
of 14,000 ha at Bura was feasible only if water was secured through a weir
and developed over a period of 11 years, which could be reduced to 7 years
through super powered project implementation. When Bura Irrigation Project



-25-                           Annex 1
Page 2 of 19
was prepared, ILACO was engaged to do the detailed designs for irrigation
networks and project roads as well as tender documents for international
competitive bidding (ICB). ILACO's near-complete desipns and reports were
used to compute data and project costs in the appraisal report.  However,
NIB employed a UK-based firm, Sir M. Macdonald and Partners (HMP)'w as
project consultants for project implementation. Besides being responsible
for engineering and procurement services, NMP's Terms of Reference included
reviewing nLACO's design and preparing feasibility studies for Tana River
East Bank Development.
2.03     In engineering assignments, different consultants approach the
tasks in different ways. In reviewing ILACO's designs, MMP made
significant changes in river works and canal hydraulic structures, thus
invalidating the original design concepts and cost estimates. Both MM4 and
the World Bank agreed that ILACO's weir design for the west bank was
technically sound.  Because HMP was given a chance to review ILACO's
designs and the possibility of extending the project to the east bank, it
appears they had a mandate to alter the original river works design from
weir to barrage, a change of substantial significance. Unlike the World
Bank and other donors, ILACO, or the Government, MMP felt that the success
of Bura West Irrigation was linked to development of the east bank.
2.04     A reliable and inexpensive-to-maintain source of irrigation water
was the foundation of the Bura Irrigation Project; development of the west
bank was, according to the SAR, not dependent on development of the east
bank; and the east bank development was not scheduled for the foreseeable
future so it is still not clear why the consultants ignored the idea of a
simpler-than-barrage gravity offtake for the west bank. The consultants
focused intently on construction of a barrage to serve east and west banks
and gave the Government no option of a simpler-than-barrage gravity off
take.
2.05     In 1978 1M redesigned and prepared bidding documents for a
barrage instead of the relatively cheaper weir for the west bank provided
for in the appraisal report. They also modified hydraulic structures
alongside other engineering items. The high cost of the barrage that
appeared in MMP's report of 1979 alarmed the Government; hence its
postponement of the river works and their cancellation in 1983.
2.06     The consultants were prompt in implementing the project, the major
part of which was engineering works and procurement of plant and equipment.
By August 1980, the following major construction contracts were let (costs
in K Sh million):
1/    It appears that because funding for consulting services was provided
by 0DM (UK), consultants had to be selected from the UK. Hence, the
replacement of lLACO by M0P.

2.07     Because of the thinness of NIB's management capabilities in
engineering, procurement and finance, project implementation was left
entire'l in the hands of MMP.
2.08     By 1983, even with the reliability of water sources uncertain,
most contracts for infrastructure were complete or nearing completion to
cover the project's 6,700 ha irrigation area, a tenant population of 5,000
families and an overall population of 64,000 people at Bura. Because of
the promptness of awarding contracts, phased development and/or cheaper
designs were not considered.
2.09     The consultants followed the physical assumptions in the Appraisal
Report, and to a large extent the designs in the PPR, but it appears they
did not propose or institute any measures to control the overall budget.
2.10     Promptness of implementation to some extent appears to have
fuelled cost esCalation becauset
(i)   So many reasonably sized oackages were awarded on the basis
of orders variation that contract figures for contracts 5
and 6 rose considerably. Variation orders not subject to
competition may result in higher prices;
(ii)  Water and power utilities were over designed and water
systems for tenant villages over expanded;
(iii) The construction mode for tenant houses was changed from
"tenant builds own house' to construction by force account
or contract, which resulted in higher costs. In the SAR, K
Sh 20 million was allocated for 5,150 houses. In fact, K Sh
75.50 million was spent to build 2,190 houses;
(iv)  Soil and environmental investigations appear to have been
done in a hurry. As a result, designs do not seem to have
taken into account soil problems in relation to foundations,
the environmental effect of insects and bats on buildings,
durability and recurrent maintenance costs;
(v)   No efforts seem to have been made to control costs.
III. PROCUREMENT
3.01     During project implementation, all procurement for engineering,
plant and equipment was in the hands of NMP. Except for delayed contracts
that were being carried out by National Youth Service (NYS), no substantial
delays emanated from private contractors.
3.02     The average cost of tenant houses was ultimately K Sh 34,500.
According to the Appraisal Report, tenant houses were expected to be
constructed by the tenants with materials lent by the Bura Management. The
K Sh 4,000 per tenant house allowed in the SAR was far too little and there



-28-                             Annex I
Page 5 of 19
were land tenure issues to be sorted out in order to allocate plots to
tenants on an ownerloccupier basis, it was not prudent for both NIB and the
consultants to decide to build tenant houses by contract, to the extent
that each house cost about K Sh 31,000. This contributed to the escalation
of project costs. Government should have sorted out the land tenure issue
and the K Sh 4,000 per tenant house should have been reviewed.
3.03     The actual position of construction of tenant houses was as
followst

Worst of all, of the 2,190 houses that were built, 202 have
collapsed and according to visual estimates about 502 of the rest are
expected to collapse within the next two years.
3.04     Bura was expected to have been managed by a strong management
team. This team was supposed to be in place in 1978 but was appointed only
late inr 1982, during which period the first settlers had arrived and had a
first crop. The team was constituted of consultants, NEDECO, who for
reasons not clear left by mid-1983. After NEDECO, a weak internally formed
management team existed at NIB headquarters. Neither this internal team
nor NEDECO were given authority to procure and pay suppliers directly.
Procurement was over centralized in Nairobi at NIB headquarters. As a
result, supplies of essential items and services required in the field were
often delayed. Field officers continued to operate under difficult
conditions, particularly as they could not react appropriately to crisis
situations. Problems started surfacing substantially when Bura Management
began taking over such infrastructure facilities as the irrigation network,
buildings, and utilities at which time the field officers had few
personnel, a minimal budget and no authority to procure items to keep the



29 -Annex I
Page 6 of 19
facilities functional. Because of this weak NIB management, all major
contractors presented large claims arising from delayed payments and
extended contracts. By 1985 these claims amounted to K Sh 240 million out
of which Governament opted to settle K Sh 25 million. Some of the
contractors have lodged disputes vith Government for unpaid claims.
IV'. PRESENT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMKTS
4.01     Bura Hanagement is not autonomous; the General Manager reports
directly to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).
For all practical purposes, the management functions like any other MOA
Department. Currently a Bura Management Committee headed by the Coast
Provincial Commissioner plays only an advisory role; it has no executive
powers like a Board of Management of a parastatal organization.
4.02     Except for urgent cases, the General Manager of Bura Project
follows prescribed COX procurement procedures. Because of a staff
shortage, the Manager does not have a supplies department. The management
staff is still thin in supplies and accountancy. The General Manager, his
Deputy, the Head of Engineering and the Accountant comprise a committee
that deals with all matters of procurement and supplies.
4.*03    Depending on the item to be procured and the urgency within which
a decision is required, the General Manager decides whether to refer it to
the Tana River District Tender Board, Ministerial Tender Board (MOA) and/or
the Central Tender Board. For very urgently required items, the General
Manager occasionally refers the matter to the Bura Management Committee.
Although the Commuittee does not have the authority to approve award of
contracts, it is understood that they approve procurement of urgently
required items, which is an arrangement reached between the present General
Manager and the Dura Management Committee (on which the MOA is heavily
represented).
4.04     Procurement of minor items and urgently required items does not
pose a problem to Bura Management because the Management operates its own
account. It has authority to write checks and make payments independent of
the District Commissionerl's Paymaster and MOA Headquarters. Bura,
Management is therefore not subjected to the bureaucratic delays usually
encountered when payments have to go through DC's office or MOA
Headquarters.   However, the accounts of Bura Management are audited by the
Auditor General, like any other G0K Department. It is understood that
Government intends to bring Bura accounts in line with other service
Departments of MOA, which will, due to foreseeable payment delays prevalent
in service Ministries, bring Bura. Management considerable difficulties in
terms of procurement and supplies.

B. PHYSICAL ACHIEVEENTS
4.05     The physical facilities of Bura Irrigation Project fall into three
major categoriess
(1)   Irrigation networks
(2)   Buildings, serwtces (utilities) and other infrastructure
(3)   Plant and equipment
IRRIGATION NETWORKS
5.01     Generally, apart from the river works (weir or barrage);
substantial irrigation works have been carried out on all the commands to
cover 6,700 ha of cultivable land .except for secondary canals and land
preparation for about 1,750 ha, iaost of which covers Masabubu Command), and
600 ha of afforestation. The supply, main and branch canals, associated
roads and all hydraulic structures are completed. An irrigation network is
outstanding for ouly 1,660 ha.
5.02     Bush clearing was done for 6,450 ha.  Of 5,040 ha readied for
irrigation, only 2,500 ha is now in use, which leaves 2,540 ha standing
unused. Because of the long period that this readied land has remained
unused and unattended, the irrigation network and land preparation has
deteriorated enough to require rehabilitation work before it can be used
for agriculture. The Plroject Engineering Section estimates that this
rehabilitation will cost roughly K Sh 40 million. Cultivable areas are
present'.y distributed as follows:
(i)    Land uneer cultivation                       2,500 ha
(ii)    Land reddied for cultivation but not used  2,540 ha
(iii)   Land requiring fresh preparation for
cultivation and installation of irrigation
network                                     1,750 ha
Total           6,700 ha
(iv)    Land readied for afforestation                600 ha
(v)    Land requiring fres1. preparation for
afforestation                               3,300 ha
Total           3,900 ha
5.03     The main features of the present irrigation works compared with
the SAR estimate are summarized below:

REDUCTION OF IRRIGATION WORKS
6.01     In 1S79, because of likely cost escalations, the Government
decided to postpone river works and reduce the forestry component from
3,900 ha to 600 ha in order to cut down on overall project costs. In terms
of SAR estimates, these items would reduce the cost by K Sh 59.1 million
for river works and K Sh 10 million for irrigation networks. By 1979 the
estimated cost of these two items was abont K Sh 83 million, which figure
progressively rose to about K Sh 350 million for river works. The cost
escalation reflected in 1979 designs made the project economically
unviable. One donor withdrew its contribution of K Sh 71 million, which
GOK had to bear, together with additional costs arising out of design
modification and inflation.
6.02     In 1982, GOK signed an agreement with the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development for river works. By that time, project costs were
projected to be about 50? above the Appraisal Report. An Interministerial
Committee was formed in 1982 to advise on how to reduce costs. In their
1983 report, they recommended a project area of 3,900 ha and cancellation
of barrage, thus leaving the temporary pumping station as a permanent
source of water.
6.03     In 1983, because of the project's rising costs, the Government
decided to exclude from the project's irrigation works among other items,
the river works (barrage) and restrict the development of 3,900 ha. by
cancelling the river works, GOK lost Kuwait funding. At that stage most of
the contracts for irrigation works to cover 6,700 ha had been let, so only
about K Sh 30 million was saved by way of omissions from ongoing contracts.
These omissions were on irrigation network and land preparation for 1,750

Page 9 of 19
ha, and on project roads. These reductions were possible only because the
contractors for the works were not able to complete their works by the
agreed upon contract completion dates (November 1982 for project roads and
July 1983 for irrigation networks and land preparation).
PRESENT SITUATION OF IRRIGATION WORKS
7.01     River Works.  Government has not yet made a decision about
construction of a weir or barrage. A study has yet to be done to establish
the type, actual position, cost, and benefits of the river works to be
constructed. Government has drawn up Terms of Reference for the study and
is exploring possibilities for getting a donor to fund the river works. A
figure of K Sh 330 million has been included in the Forward Budget for Bura
river works (gravity offtake).
7.02     Pumping Station.  The present pumping station, commissioned in
1982, was expected to last up to 1985. It has four inclined pumps, two
small ones (expected to deliver 1.075 cm/sec each) and two big ones
(expected to deliver 2.10 cm/sec each). These pumps are expected to
delver 6.35 cm/sec when all four are working but because of their age and
occasional change of static head when the level of river water falls, these
pump sets rarely deliver more than 40? of installed capacity. Although the
operators and mechanics are now housed at the pump station and have on site
a store for immediately required and fast moving spare parts, there is
continuing difficulty maintaining these pump sets because of (1) lack and
untimely delivery of spare parts; (2) frequent breakdowns; and (3) too few
mechanics. Frequent breakdowns have caused water supply failures which
have in return caused reduction of yields. Two more pumps are being
Installed with a total capacity of 5.4 cm/sec. These are expected to be in
operation by April 1988. Once the two pump sets are in place,
theoretically irrigation could expand to 3,900 ha. In reality it will
remain at 2,500 ha becauset
(a)     the inlet channel from which the pumps are drawing water
may not have enough water to pass through all the pumps;
(b)     the old pumps can be maintained only as stand-bys and
cannot be relied on as sources of water; and
(c)     except when the river level is low, the pumps are expected
to reliably supply adequate irrigation water for 2,500 ha
and 600 ha forestry at all times.
7.03     There is a growing fear that because of the high silt content in
Tana River water, and because the Tana River water level is increasingly
likely to be lower than critical levels required for the pumps to operate
efficiently, the water output from these pumps may also in future not be a
reliable source for meeting the full water requirements for irrigation
purposes.
7.04     Fuel accounts for the largest share of operating costs at the
pumping station - about K Sh 80/per 1,000 cubic meters at the pump station
compared with R Sh 160/per 1,000 cubic meters of overall operating cost for



-  33 -                               Annex 1
Page 10 of 19
the station. Due to water losses on supply, main and branch canals, the
cost of fuel alone is about R Sh 100lper 1,000 cubic meters at the
irrigation field. The total operating budget of the pump station is about
K Sh 8 million a year.  This works out to about K Sh 3,200/per ha a year,
half of which is for the cost of fuel.
7.05     Irrigation Canals.  The silting basin is adequately maintained.
It is desilted twice a month during rainy seasons and once a month during
dry seasons. A dredger, a dragline and a dozer are normally used for this
purpose.
7.06     Except for the 10 km of main canal that were desilted last year
(May-November 1987), the supply and main canals have not been attended to
since they were built. The canal banks are eroded in some areas. Because
of the poor design of feeder pipes to animal watering holes, the pipes are
blocked and the holes are empty,L4   Because of the unavailability of water
in the watering holes and the distances between them, and because nomads
find it easier and more comfortable to graze near the canal and Bura
itself, animals drop to the canal for their water requirements, thus
causing further deterioration of canal banks and silting of the canal beds.
this is a problem that Bura Management will have to live with because it is
difficult to police 46 km of open canal in bushland.
7.07     Except for the unit feeders, all irrigation canals are designed so
that they require desilting and the banks need reinstatement every five
years. Farmers are supposed to clean the unit feeders continuously
themselves except in case of major damage. Last year farmers were
encouraged to clean the feeders with the help of the World Food Program
(WFP). Regular maintenance of the canals is restricted to removing weeds
and greasing gate structures.
1/       The Bank supervision mission of March 1985 summarized the position
of watering holes as follows:
"This mission reviewed the current status of the ponds constructed
to provide drinking water for wildlife and livestock west of the
main canal. Of all the wildlife-related subjects in recent Bura
history, the drinking ponds probably have received the mosm
attention. Present evidence makes it seem clear that the ponds
were flawed both in concept and design. They were unnecessary and
a waste of money because both wildlife and livestock easily and
perhaps even preferentially drink at the nearby main canal. Their
design was doomed because silt blocks the underground feeder pipe
from the canal, and perhaps most fatally because of the location
of the pipe outlet at the bottom of a pond where it is certain to
get blocked with silt from the sides of the pond. No further
effort and not a cent more should be spent on the drinking ponds.
They probably cannot be made to work properly, and they are not
necessary anyway."

Page 11 of 19
7.08     Since all of the canals were completed by or before 1983, they are
due for five-year maintenance. So far with the help of WP the management
has desilted all Airrigation networks (branch block and minor canals, and
unit block and main drains) for the irrigated area of 2,500 ha. This was
done in 1987, and took 12 months. Work on the main and supply canals was
started in May 1987. It took 6 months to do 10 km using 2 machines, at
which rate it was realized it would take another 24 months to complete work
on the remaining 30 km. This was done with the two excavators that are
also normally used for clearing blocked drains and/or irrigation canals.
The two machines were breaking often and constantly required spare parts.
To save these machines for emergency work in the irrigation areas, it was
decided that maintenance of the main and supply canal and night storage
reservoirs (which require special machines) should be subcontracted to
private contractors. MOA has been asked to make funds available for this
work. The supply and main canals appear to function, but unless the
maintenance work of desilting and reinstating banks is done within the next
two years, serious irrigation water problems may occur.
BUILDINGS
8.01     Data about the constructions for Bura are summarized in the table
below. The total appraisal estimate for buildings was K Sh 132 million.
The actual cost is estimated to be about K Sh 400 million to complete about
80Z of the appraisal estimates.

TENANT HOUSING
9.01     The design of tenant houses was based on typical mud-and-mangrove
poles as practiced in coastal Kenya. Important components in this form of
construction are strong poles and protection of walls from rain water.
Where walls have to be plastered, adequate quantities of coral or stone or
pebbles are required. Hud disintegrates when wet, so mud walls must be
protected from rain water so that it does not fall off the walls. These
standards were not followed in most tenant houses at Bura. Thin poles were
used, pebbles were inadequately used (and most altogether omitted in
villages 1-4 built by BBF). Roof structures are weak and eaves do not
offer walls adequate rain water protection. Consequently the surface
cement/sand mortar layer is liable to peel off the walls. In some cases
roofs have been blown off by wind, because trussing has not been strong
enough. Every rainy season, walls get wet aud some fall off; tenants try
to remud but as these houses do not strictly belong to them, they are not
keen on repairing them. Houses with weak poles collapse when walls become
wet and heavy. Of the 2,179 houses that were built, 343 houses have
already collapsed, and their debris has been moved off-site.
9.02     Mud houses can last for more than 20 years if the roofs are
maintained and the walls protected from water and repaired whenever damage
appears. This maintenance is achievable only where the owner is the
occupier. In Bura, houses have not yet been transferred to tenants and it
is still unclear when this will be done. Many houses are dilapidated.
Unless the ownership issue is resolved, because Bura Management no longer
carries out regular maintenance on the houses, significant losses will
continue. In 2-3 years, an estimated 50? of the houses will be lost. The
situation is as follows:
No. of Houses in

SANITATION IN THE TENANT VILLAGES
10.01    At least every one or two houses are provided with a pit latrine.
When it rains, the latrines get filled with water and the contents spill
off the surface ground of the villages. Efforts have been made to lift



- 36 -                           Annex 1
Page 13 of 19
latrine hut floors above ground level with timber but this is not
satisfactory. The basic technology of constructing pit latrines in black
cotton or alluvial silt soils was not used. Tenants are therefore exposed
to a health hazard, particularly when it rains.
10.02    Most of the latrines have been lost by being blown off by the
wind, being filled up and not replaced, or by being filled up by rain water
and soil. It is estimated that only about 301 of the originally erected
1,000 pit latrines are still in place. Again, maintenance and rebuilding
of the latrines depend on tenant ownership of plots.
JUNIOR STAFF HOUSES
11.01    Junior staff houses (types F and G), are built of mud and mangrove
poles. They have thick walls and concrete slabs and appear more solidly
built than the tenant houses.. However, they are subject to serious cracks
and in one or two sections of walls have collapsed. Because of the thick
concrete floor slabs (which are not provided in tenant houses), these
building are affected by the heaving effects of black cotton soil, wind and
the seepage of rain water into the walls. Maintenance problems are
frequent, expensive and in some cases totally impossible. Termite attack
was not noticed as a problem. How many of these houses will remain intact
for use, and how long, will depend on how frequently and long maintenance
is carried out, expensive as it may be.
SENIOR STAFF HOUSES
12.01    There are two kinds of senior staff houses:
(a) Timber prefabricated houses with raised timber floors
standing on timber posts. Many defects were noticed in these
houses. Most of these houses (about 10 in number) are about
to complete their economic life.
(b) Concrete block houses. These houses ought to be solid and
permanent. Surprisingly, many of them have developed cracks
due to structural failure. Even with frequent repairs and
maintenance by the Bura Building team, three houses are
already deemed too risky to live in and have been vacated.
Even the General Manager's house, which was erected at a cost
of K Sh 1 million, is not habitable. The GM lives in one of
the smaller houses.
It appears that the builders decided to protect foundations
from surface or rain water by use of peripheral concrete
paving or aprons and sloping grounds away from the houses.
In each of the affected houses, broken paving has allowed
water to pass into the houses' foundation. The effect of
rain water under foundations and concrete floor beds in Bura
soils (reinforced or not reinforced) can be disastrous. Most
houses have developed bad cracks, floors have heaved up,
doors and windows have jammed, and so forth.

Page 14 of 19
12.02    As with the junior houses, maintenance is frequent and expensive,
yet is not solving the problem. No attempt was made to estimate the cost
of permanent remedial measures. A Bank supervision mission reviewed this
pathetic situation in May 1986 and agreed with Bura Management that HOW
supervisory staff (who were in charge of technical supervision of contracts
12A, 21 and 16IA) would prepare a program for rehabilitating these
buildings. The Bank was prepared to consider financing such rehabilitation
in order to keep the enormous investment from vanishing. By the time the
project closed, no such program had been presented to the Bank for
consideration. One thing is cleart unless something is done, most houses
will be useless in about five years.
12.03    Contracts were let and implemented for all villages.  Some
villages have staff houses that are unoccupied because the cropping areas
have not been extended that far. These are as followst
Villaae       Type F Houses    Type E Houses       Other Structure

6.  22123              6               2             Elevated water tank
12.04    Except for Type E houses in Village 16117, all of these unoccupied
buildings appear to be in a good state of repair. Most likely this is
partly because they are unoccupied and partly because they appear to be in
areas where soils are better or firmer.

EFFECT OF RATS
13.01    Bura has a lot of bats, and senior staff houses with flat ceilings
were not designed to be batproof. As a result most houses have a lot of
bats near the ceilings. Removing the bats has proved difficult unless
major construction modifications were made. These bats have made houses
smelly, noisy and generally uncomfortable. The droppings collect in the
ceilings, their urine flood and rot the ceilings. Ceilings on three houses
have collapsed, the only benefit of which was a pick-up load of manure.
The problem is by no means simple to resolve.
BUILDING STRUCTURES
14.01    Bura Club Center and Swimming Pool.  This complex generally looks
well looked after. It consists of a swimming pool, main club house (hall,
kitchen, store, ablution block) and 14 cottages.
14.02    Administration Offices for Bura Management.  These are three
blocks of two floors each. The buildings do not show any structural
failure or major defects. They are in fairly good repair.
14.03    Mechanical Carpentry Wo-kshops.  These are generally intact.
14.04    Collection Centers (N  8). A collection center (one large store
and a block of three offices) is where cotton is collected from farmers,
settlement and extension officers meet farmers and payments to farmers are
made. These buildings are all intact. Their massive structures appear to
be overdesigned. Three of them are not in use as they are in areas of
unoccupied villages.
14.05    Police Station.  The houses for police (No 30) and police station
are built the same way as the staff houses, types A-E. The problems are
similar. On the day this report was compiled, two walls of the police
station were dangerously cracked, so about 302 of the station was
unoccupied. Major rehabilitation is required. Otherwise the station will
be fully evacuated within an estimated two years.
14.06    Health Center.  The health center looks intact.  Available
information indicates that two years ago the center showed serious cracks
on floors, walls and external aprons. They were repaired then and no
further problems have surfaced. If the aprons fail again and no immediate
repairs are done, the cracks will also appear again.
14.07    Other Buildings.  The Nanighi pump station, offices for the
engineering section, the research station, and administrative offices are
all prefabricated timber houses that were taken over from contractors and
consultants. These buildings seem to have completed their economic life
and cannot be expected to last much longer.
14.08    Schools.  There are six primary schools and one day high school.
Three primary schools were completed in 1983; the other three and the high
school opened this year. The latter three primary schools and the high
school are relatively new, built of concrete block walls and galvanized

sheet roofs, and show no defects. The older three primary schools are
constructed of mud and mangrove post walls, plastered with cementisand
mortar on both sides. All schools appear well maintained. The management
of the schools has been successfully passed on to the Ministry of Education
and the schools are therefore being run and maintained by the
Parents/Teachers Associations (PTAs). The PTA has plans to extend and
build new schools. They also intend to erect boardinlg facilities for the
high school. In other words, Bura Management no longer needs to construct
and/or maintain schools. If the other villages are opened up, it looks as
if PTAs will be formed and will, through 'harambeel, build and manage
schools to cater for their children.
14.09    Building Maintenance.  Building maintenance is still in the hands
of Bura Management. The Ministry of Works' long-awaited takeover of this
function has not yet taken place and there are no indications when it will.
The maintenance staff at Burs is very slim; it does not normally engage in
maintenance of such Government buildings as that of police and the GOK
administrative buildings. The annual amount allocated for this work is K
Sh 2.40 million which is about 102 of what is needed to keep the buildings
in a good state of repair. But even if the budget of K Sh 20 million were
made available, the present staff and equipment would not be able to handle
the work. As a result, many buildings are in bad shape. The maintenance
staff consists of:
Foremen                 3 (supervisors)
Masons                  13 (9 are casual)
Carpenters              12 (8 are casual)
Clerks (store)         3
Painters               5 (all casual)
unskilled Laborers      15 (all casual)
14.10    This team requires more and better qualified supervisory staff and
more tradesmen.
14.11    Cost CSomparison.  Swahili-type construction on the Coast normally
seems cheap because the sticks, straw, mud, and pebbles are all within easy
reach of the owner-builder at practically no cost. Such construction at
Bura is not cheap because all materials (except mud) have to be bought and
transported to Bura and contractors have to be employed to do the actual
construction work. Buildings with thin concrete block walls and those with
mud-mangrove walls cost about the same. This was demonstrated by
contractors but not pursued by the consultants. Permanent tenant houses,
primary schools and junior staff houses that required minimal maintenance
probably could have been built at the same cost, If not for less. There
was no vigorous cost plan, so this fact did not surface.
UTILITIES
15.01    Commercial Center.  The area generally referred to as *Manyatta'
is developing into an active commercial center. It has well constructed
permanent structures as well as temporary structures of all forms, an open
air market, religious buildings and primary school and seems to be growing
fairly fast. Bura ManAgement need not worry about developing a commercial
center.

Page 17 of 19
15.02    Post Office/Telephone Station.  No post office building exists but
it is understood the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KP&TC)
has been allocated a plot to develop this building. A telephone repeater
station has been constructed by KP&TC and is in operation.
15.03    Water Treatment Works, Water Distribution and Sewage.  This
complex was designed to serve 67,000 people in 23 tenant villages, a rural
center and the commercial center. The current population of Bura is about
20,000. This complex, which was built at a cost of K Sh 120.40 million, is
operating at less than 302 capacity. Although Bura's current water
requirements are more than the output from the Water Treatment Works, the
plant is operated at reduced capacity an average 3 hours a day, to reduce
overall operating costs and because the staff is slim. The current budget
for operating the plant is K Sh 3.40 million, which at full capacity could
be well over K Sh 10 million. No recovery measures for consumed water are
in place. The long-awaited takeover of the plant by the Ministry of Water
Development (MOWD) has not occurred.
15.04    Treated water had been distributed to all the villages, the rural
center and the manyatta. The villages were supplied with a tap for each
house as opposed to one common tap for every 12 houses as in the SAR. The
villagers use this water to irrigate trees and vegetable gardens (no other
sources of water exist) so some of it goes to waste. Consideration should
have been given to running a raw water canal through each village for
watering gardens and trees. To reduce excessive use of water, management
supplies water to the villages 2-4 hours per day. Other ways to reduce
waste must be explored. One option may be to sell water at selected
outlets.
15.05    The distribution system was extended to all villages, even
unoccupied villages 11-23. In villages 11-18, standpipes and wash slabs
for each tenant house (to be erected later) stand like crosses in a
graveyard. The water to unoccupied villages has been cut off and the
system will have to be rehabilitated before it can be put to use. No
attempt was made to estimate the cost of such rehabilitation. It will
depend on the extent of damage at the time of rehabilitation.
15.06    The sewage (which serves only the rural center) is a pumped
system; the treatment works consist of oxidation ponds. Effluent is
discharged into the adjacent laga. The management and maintenance of this
system is done together with treated water supply. One thing that is not
yet in place is periodic checking of the effluent to ensure that raw sewage
is not discharged into the laga. This should be taken up by the Ministry
of Health.
15.07    Power Supply. The power supply has been centralized.  It is not
yet complete but it is expected that all its four gensets will be completed
b; the end of March 1988. The plant consists of four gensets, two of 250
KVA each and two of 130 KVA each. The plant, which can produce one
megawatt, looks overdesigned because at present daily consumption is about
150 kilowatts. No recovery measures have been instituted, so a lot of
power is wasted. Even when the power is extended to manyatta, and the
water treatment plant works to capacity, there will still be idle capacity.



41 -                            Annex I
Page 18 of 19
The management is exploring (1) the possibility of selling and handling the
power supply over to Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPL) and (2) the
possibility of transferring it to MOW, which would maintain it and
institute recovery of costs from the consumers. At present Bura Management
(which uses the vote from MOA), is giving power and vater free to staff,
police, the health center and administration, thus subsidizing the parties
who operate in Bura under different GOK votes. The current budget for
operating the power supply was not ascertainable because it falls under
several categories, including but not restricted to staff emoluments, the
purchase of supplies like diesel, and plant maintenance. The power system
has only two attendants to maintain it.

16.02    Shortfalls in equipment (is is estimated that plant and equipment
should be increased about 202) make it difficult to keep agricultural
operations and the irrigation network in optimum wovking order. The last
column of the above table indicates the number of each piece of equipment

that needs to be procured. A number of items like the Isuzu trucks (5),
the mobile workshop (1) and the Kubota tractors (12) are the only ones of
their type in Kenya, so local service backup and spare parts are not
available. It is therefore becoming difficult and expensive to keep them
in operation. These items will probably not be maintainable for more than
another two years. It costs the management about K Sh 5 million to
maintain the present complement of equipment. A mobile crane and workshop
tools, worth about K Sh 1 million, are needed ivmediately.
CONCLUSIONS AND hECOMMENDATIONS
17.01    Land tenure changes that will allow tenants to own their plots are
needed. Owner-occupants are more likely to maintain their houses and
compounds and to plant trees around their plots. This will relieve
management of maintenance costs, encourage tenants to maintain their houses
and avoid further losses, and enable tenants without houses to build their
own houses, thus increasing the stock of tenant houses.
17.02    The structural failure of staff houses and the police station is
worsening, a problem which in time is likely to affect also the health
center, clubhouse and other buildings. To protect the heavy investment in
these facilities, major rehabilitation work is needed.
17.03    It is understood that the service ministries are to take over the
maintenance of buildings (MOW); power, treated water, and sewage (IOWD);
and roads and the airfield (MOTC). If this happens it will reduce the
operating budget of Bura Management, and improve the likelihood of cost
recovery from consumers.1i However, if the service ministries are
underfinanced, maintenance and utilities may not be run optimally, to the
detriment of the project. The implications of such a handover should be
carefully thought through, and it should be done only if it will work.
1/ It does not appear possible to recover 1002 of the cost; particularly
for water supplied to tenants.

Coparison with the Sudan - Rahad Project
The Bura project shares many characteristics with the Sudan-Rahad
Project. loth projects were implemented in the seventies and early
eighties (Rahad about four years ahead of Bura) during times of great
national economic crisis. Both promote irrigation and settlement under
arid conditions with cotton as the main cash crop. The project
descriptions feature the same componentss river diversion, main canals,
irrigation and drainage works, levelling and furrow irrigation, processing
and storage facilities, settlement with necessary infrastructure (e.g.,
roads, water, electricity, health, and education) and agricultural services
(research, mechanized cultivation, extension). Some characteristics at
project completion are summarized belows
Bura        Rahad
Area irrigated (ha)                   2,500        105,000
Cropping intensity (2)                  125             83
Number of settlers                    1,923         14,000

ERR (Z)                                Neg              20
A more detailed analysis of the reasons for such differing performance
could provide useful insights for future project design.

Land Suitability
The soil conditions and the irrigation suitability in the Lower
Tana Region is the subject of a recent dissertation submitted by the
Director of the Kenya Soil Survey 11. The soil characteristics are
stuunrized on the enclosed map. The land suitability evaluation is the
assessment of the suitability of land for specific kinds of uses. Six
types of uses are assessed for cotton, maize, rice, sugarcane, cowpeas and
groundauts. Each mapping unit (see legend) is rated on the basis of such
essential characteristics ass
capacity for water retention
absence of salinity
absence of sodicity
availability of oxygen for root growth
conditions for germination (seed bed)
availabity of nutrients
availability of foothold for roots
workability (ease of tillage)
drainage ability
ease of land clearing
freedom for layout of field plans
The response of each crop to these characteristics is used to determine the
land suitability for growing this crop. The following suitability classes
were useds
Sl   Highly suitable
82   Moderately suitable
SS   Marginally suitablo
NS1 Provisionally not suitable for sustained production.
Limitations may be surmountable with the development
of new technology.
NS2 Permanently not suitable
The results are given in the following table.
