PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Urban Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation project for Niger were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that the Project clearly\n            demonstrates that the institutional environment is key for a\n            Project aimed at supporting decentralization. Clear\n            commitment from the Government should be a prerequisite for\n            a support in this field. The difficult political situation\n            in Niger during Project preparation and, in particular, the\n            cancellation of the decentralization laws and the local\n            elections in 1996, should have been sufficient reasons to\n            design a more realistic institutional component. The Project\n            confirms that it is very difficult to deal with all cities\n            in the country at the same time. The delegation of contract\n            management and the reliance on the private sector\n            (consultants and Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs)) are\n            powerful and successful ways for municipalities to implement\n            their development and infrastructure programs.\n            Identification, planning and programming should not be left\n            under the responsibility of an Agetip Agency, as the\n            rationale for this is out of the core business of the Agency\n            and is likely to make decision making more difficult and\n            create strain between the Agency and the municipalities and\n            other beneficiaries. Municipalities need a minimum in-house\n            capacity in order to be able to benefit from the simple\n            management toolkit prepared through the Project (urban\n            audits, municipal audits, community consultations). The\n            requirement for counterpart funding from the municipalities,\n            as set up during Project preparation (up to 15%) was not\n            realistic and not at par with the economic and financial\n            situation prevailing in the country. Adequate training for\n            consultants (studies and supervision) and SMEs is needed to\n            ensure a satisfactory quality for the works ordered by the\n            municipalities. In addition to the training program\n            implemented by Public Works Executing Agency for Niger\n            (NIGETIP) itself, a strong external partner was needed to\n            ensure a sufficient impact of the sessions."}, "docdt": "2003-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
