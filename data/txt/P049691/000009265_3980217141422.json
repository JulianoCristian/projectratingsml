This project could aggravate\n            this problem by producing the following major negative\n            impacts: 1) increased waterborne diseases associated with\n            the use of pond water; 2) detriments to the giraffe herd,\n            particularly habitat destruction and accidents; 3) disturbed\n            forest biotopes caused by opening quarries; 4) water\n            erosion; 5) silting from erosion of hill-slope quarries and\n            rock outcrops; 6) deforestation caused by overexploitation\n            and increased firewood consumption; 7) pollution due to\n            dust, exhaust gas emissions, and gasoline, gas-oil, and oil\n            vapors; and 8) vehicle noise nuisance. Offsetting measures\n            include 1) controlling felling of protected trees and\n            protecting sensitive habitats; 2) protecting the giraffe and\n            rehabilitating its habitats; 3) combating wind and water\n            erosion; 4) limiting vehicle speeds; 5) rehabilitating\n            quarries, borrow pits, and watersheds to provide water for\n            fauna and agriculture; and 6) conducting population training\n            and awareness-arousing programs. Other recommendations will\n            be made on drainage and run off water management; soil\n            conservation measures such as preventing the high speed flow\n            of run off water and improving ground protection by\n            planting/replanting trees; establishing vegetation as soil\n            and replacing damaged vegetation cover; avoiding locations\n            for dumping sand in areas of sand encroachment; and\n            identifying sites for seasonal water collection."}, "docdt": "1997-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
