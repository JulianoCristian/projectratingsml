                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To support the sustainable provision of electricity services and associated social and economic benefits in selected rural sites in Nicaragua, and strengthen the
                         GOvernment's institutional capacity to implement its national rural electrification strategy. This would be accomplished by (i) supporting the Government in the
                         design and implementation of its national rural electrification strategy; (ii) implementing innovative public/private off-grid electricity delivery mechanisms in
                         several pilot sites for later replication on a national scales; and (iii) demonstrating in the pilot areas the potential of targeted rural microfinance and business
                         development servicces (BDS) to significantly enhance the development impact of rural electrification.

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Project.s global environmental objective is to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions through the reduction of policy, information, financing and
                         institutional capacity barriers that currently hinder renewable energy technology (RET) dissemination and market development in Nicaragua (GEF Operational

                         Program No. 6). In support of this objective, the Project will engage the private sector in commercially sustainable activities that reduce long-term
                         implementation costs and offer a strong potential for nationwide replication in Nicaragua and other Central American countries.
