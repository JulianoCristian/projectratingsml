"The project consists of the construction\n            of transmission lines and facilities to interconnect the\n            electrical power systems of the South and Southeastern\n            Regions of Brazil and to provide the first phase of a 500 kV\n            transmission system in the South. It includes the\n            installation of about 700 single circuit km of 500 kV lines,\n            construction of 1,500 MVA of substation capacity, expansion\n            of a 230 kV substation, telecommunications equipment and a\n            computerized system operating center. The project also\n            includes a high level training program in Brazil and abroad\n            benefitting the sector as a whole."}, "docdt": "1976-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
