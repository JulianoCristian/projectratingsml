product upgrading and manufacture of\n            precision machines; improvements in quality and quantity of\n            inputs; increase in manufacturing efficiency; expansion of\n            design and engineering capabilities; and improvements in\n            management systems. To this end, the project consists of\n            four major components. They include (a) the rehabilitation\n            and modernization of 18 plants and 2 research institutes\n            owned by the two beneficiaries; (b) the import of\n            appropriate technology; (c) the establishment of a modern\n            management structure and system; and (d) the development and\n            implementation of a comprehensive training program. In\n            addition to other project-related benefits, the Project will\n            have a demonstration effect on other provincial machine tool\n            manufacturers as well as capital goods manufacturing industries."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
