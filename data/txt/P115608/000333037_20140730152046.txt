I.         Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

Mexico is one of the first developing countries to commit to a voluntary carbon reduction
target to address the challenge posed by climate change. The country has pledged to
halve GHG emissions by 2050, based on 2002 levels, and plans to put in place a domestic
cap-and-trade system by 2012.             The establishment of Mexico’s federal
emissions-reduction programs was supported by an IBRD Climate Change DPL in 20081.
These programs foresee far reaching reforms in the sectors that weigh most heavily in the
country’s carbon footprint, such as transport and energy which account for 18 percent2
and 27 percent of GHG emissions respectively.

The Bank has been engaged in a dialogue on Climate Change with Mexico since the
mid-1990s. The current Bank program in the country comprises about 25 climate-related
activities financed by IBRD loans, GEF grants, carbon finance emission reductions
purchase agreements (ERPAs), and other financial instruments. In addition, the Bank
and Mexico completed substantial analytical work in FY09 to define and cost a

    Of total GHG emissions by the transport, urban transport accounts for a significant share (National
    Climate Change Strategy, 2004).
low-carbon growth scenario for the country, which examined the energy and urban
transport sectors.

As anticipated in the Country Partnership Strategy, this DPL constitutes the next step in
the Bank’s support for Mexico’s adoption of effective policies to combat climate change
and follows-up more specifically on the 2008 Climate Change DPL. The present
operation underpins significant reforms in the regulatory, institutional, financial and
monitoring frameworks for the Urban Transport and Energy Sectors, which will serve as
key elements of a lower-carbon growth path. Support for these policies is provided in the
context of a comprehensive sector dialogue between the Bank and the Government of
Mexico in Urban Transport and Energy policy. The Government has defined its strategy
for emission reductions in its Special Plan for Climate Change (PECC) which is
currently in public consultations. The sectoral emphasis of the DPL—on urban
transportation, renewable energy and energy efficiency—is consistent with the PECC's
priorities.

To achieve emissions reductions in transport, Mexico has created the National Mass
Transit Program (PROTRAM) with the assistance of the World Bank and a National
Urban Transport Transformation Program (UTTP), which supports sustainable urban
transport interventions that fall outside of PROTRAM’s purview. The GoM will use
PROTRAM and the UTTP to steer development toward a lower-carbon growth path.
With regard to Energy, emissions reductions will be achieved through the adoption of a
legal and regulatory framework for the development and use of energy from renewable
sources and the implementation of an ambitious energy efficiency program. Together
with other support provided by the IFIs, this DPL will also contribute to alleviating some
of the impacts of the ongoing international financial crisis on Mexico’s public finances.

II.    Proposed objective(s)

The establishment of regulatory, institutional, financial and monitoring frameworks for a
low-carbon evolution of the energy and urban transport sectors.

III.   Preliminary Description

Mexico has emerged as a global leader in the climate change arena and has moved
quickly to establish a policy framework that could significantly reduce its carbon
footprint in the years to come. However, the success of this program is dependent upon
the further evolution of regulations, institutions, financing mechanisms and monitoring
and evaluation capacity. A national program will detail how emission targets will be
pursued in each contributing sector and set intermediary GHG emission reduction
objectives.

       Transport – The Urban Transport actions under this operation support the
       development of the institutions, policies and incentives needed to consolidate and
       modernize the Urban Transport Systems of Mexico. These reforms will make
       Urban Transport more efficient and effective, reducing automobile use and
       decreasing urban congestion to lower the sector’s carbon footprint.
             Energy – The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Laws supported under
             this operation provide the regulatory framework to put in place new incentive
             structures for the use of renewable technologies in electricity generation and
             obtain efficiency gains through the avoidance of costs and emissions by lowering
             electricity demand. Success of these initiatives rests on the adequacy of the legal
             framework, the effectiveness of the incentives aimed at public and private
             stakeholders as well as end consumers, a sound implementation program, the
             availability of financing mechanisms for such initiatives, and adequate capacity to
             implement and monitor the policy.

   By supporting the Government’s policy commitment to regulatory, institutional and
   financial resources as well as monitoring and evaluation capacity, the proposed DPL
   strengthens Mexico’s objective of launching the urban transport and energy sectors on a
   low-carbon growth path.

   As a single tranche operation, the DPL acknowledges the important steps already taken
   by the GoM to develop Urban Transport and Energy policies that combat climate change
   and reduce GHG and other emissions.
