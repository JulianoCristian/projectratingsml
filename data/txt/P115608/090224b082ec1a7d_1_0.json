The IBRD loan supported\n            steps to promote long-term sustainable development in these\n            sectors, such as the publication of regulations to promote\n            the use of renewable energy and the sustainable use of\n            energy. Another policy action was the establishment of a\n            fund to facilitate the reduction of emissions in energy\n            consumption by replacement of incandescent light bulbs with\n            compact fluorescent light bulbs, and replacing inefficient\n            appliances. In transport, another policy action was the\n            creation of the National Infrastructure Fund (FONADIN) and\n            the Federal Support Program for Mass Transit (PROTRAM). All\n            mass transit projects supported by PROTRAM have climate\n            change considerations and have emission baselines."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T01:10:00Z"}
