of the Framework for Green\n            Growth Development Policy Loan Program is to support the\n            Government of Mexico's program to further develop the\n            regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for low\n            emissions evolution of the transport and energy sectors. To\n            address the challenges posed by climate change, Mexico has\n            publicly committed to reducing its Greenhouse Gas (GHG)\n            emissions. The country has ratified the United Nations\n            Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the\n            Kyoto protocol, and is one of the first developing countries\n            to commit to a specific carbon reduction target through the\n            use of clean and efficient technologies. As part of its\n            voluntary commitment to GHG emission reductions, Mexico also\n            plans a domestic cap-and-trade system by 2012 to abate\n            emissions from point sources. At the January 2009 meeting of\n            the world economic forum in Davos, President Calderon\n            restated the Government's target to halve GHG emissions\n            by 2050 depending on financial international cooperation and\n            on international agreements on mitigation. This commitment\n            has been hailed by the UNFCCC general secretariat as an\n            example of a long-term vision for sustainable development.\n            Moreover, in August 2009, the Government of Mexico formally\n            committed itself to a detailed plan for emission reductions\n            embedded in the special program for climate change (Programa\n            Especial de Cambio Climhtico, or PECC) that provides an\n            accounting of emissions by sector creates a framework for\n            monitoring improvements and establishes a blueprint for\n            emission reduction initiatives, sector by sector. As a\n            result of its leadership in this area, Mexico has been\n            ranked fourth in the world in the independent climate\n            performance index, which assesses country performance based\n            on: per capita GHG emission trends in the energy, transport,\n            residential and industrial sectors; absolute energy-related\n            GHG emissions; and climate policy."}, "docdt": "2009-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
