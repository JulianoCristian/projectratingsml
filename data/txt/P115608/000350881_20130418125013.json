satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned include: extensive dialogue on the\n            prior actions and the desired objectives leads to solid\n            programs. The dialogue contributed in part to help the\n            Mexican government to enact the Programa Especial de Cambio\n            Clim\u00e1tico (PECC). Long-standing, comprehensive sector\n            dialogue contributed to the ability to deliver immediate\n            support. A one-tranche development policy loan (DPL) is an\n            adequate instrument to support a country\u0092s sustainable\n            growth in the face of short-term financial pressures. A DPL\n            can pave the way for many other Bank-financed operations,\n            and in turn, those operations enrich the dialogue to develop\n            the DPL. Technical support from the Bank is a key to\n            reducing risk for the government and helping to advance\n            objectives. Inter-institutional coordination is one key to\n            enabling a successful program. Permanent dialogue with the\n            client helped to identify technical assistance (TA)\n            requirements during the implementation of regulations and\n            policy framework."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
