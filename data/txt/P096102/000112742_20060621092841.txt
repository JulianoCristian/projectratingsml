                            THE REPUBLICOF MADAGASCAR

                   THIRD POVERTYREDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                     CREDIT SUMMARY



Borrower:      The Republic o fMadagascar

Amount:        SDR26.9million (US$40 millionequivalent) credit

Terms:         StandardIDA terms: 40-year maturity

Description:   Inline with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series of single
               tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided in the form o f budget
               support, is envisaged to support implementation of two of the three main axes of the
               PRSP: governance andproviding human and material security.

               PRSC 3 support to the strategic axis o f governance aims at consolidating and
               deepening reforms commenced with PRSC 1 and PRSC 2. This includes assistanceto
               the Government in continuing to implement its 2005 Priority Action Plan for public
               expenditure management reforms, and developing and implementingits 2006 Priority
               Action Plan. These reforms include improving the alignment o fthe 2006 budgetto the
               priorities of the PRSP, the reform o f the Treasury, the installation of a transitional
               integrated financial management system, taking steps to make the new procurement
               code operational, and the preparation o f draft budget execution laws (Projet de loi de
               rkglement).      Following the operationalization o f the Anti-Corruption Agency
               (BIANCO), PRSC 3 deepens support for the Government's anti-corruption agenda. It
               also supportsthe implementation o f a reform program for customs.

               PRSC 3 consolidates support to the strategic axis o f providing human and material
               security, by supporting the Government's Education for All Agenda and improving
               service delivery in nutrition, health and rural water supply. A very large increase in
               primary school enrolments has been supported by key policy reforms which have
               included a continued increase inthe share o f the education budget, continued measures
               to decrease education costs for poor households starting with the school year
               2002/2003 (suppression o f school fees, provision o f learning materials to all primary
               students), actions to increase access for students (through school construction, salary
               compensation for teachers paid by parents, teacher recruitment) and reinforcement o f
               management capacity at central and decentralized levels. PRSC 3 continues to support
               policy and institutional reform in the nutrition sector, following the establishment o f
               the National Council for Nutrition and the establishment of its secretariat (Office
               National de Nutrition). In rural water, PRSC 3 supports the implementation o f the
               water and sanitation strategy for all. In health, following the national policy on health
               and the development o f a Medium Term Expenditure Framework, the PRSC supports
               improvements in sector budgetingand fmancing as well as improved access and quality
               o f service delivery. An IDA-supported Technical Assistance Credit (Good Governance
               and Institutional Development), approved in November 2003, is assisting the

               government in putting in place the systems to strengthen budget management, and
               finance technical assistance and capacity buildingneeds.

               The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2003), the Country
               Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2003), and the 2005 Public Expenditure
               Review (PER) provide the analyticalunderpinningsfor the public sector reform agenda
               o f the PRSC series. Updatedanalysis for the Educationfor All underpinsthe education
               reforms. A Health Sector Note has provided the foundations for the health policy
               reforms.

Benefits:      The proposed operation is the thirdPRSC inthe series and will continue to contribute
               to Madagascar reaching its development goals. The reforms supported will strengthen
               the institutional infrastructure neededto improve the public sector's capacity to carry
               out its role more effectively. Improved delivery o f public services is essential if the
               Government is to reach its goals for poverty reductionand improve the quality of life in
               Madagascar. In addition, strengthened monitoring and evaluation will lead to an
               enhanced accountability and results focus.

Risks:         The implementationof this operation continues to be exposed to risks, many of which
               were already identified in previous PRSC operations. The main risks include: (i)
               vulnerability to external shocks, particularly cyclones and changes in global
               commodity prices, such as oil and rice; (ii)   political issues, particularly in an election
               year, present a risk; (iii)maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, which is
               critical to the successful implementationo fthe PRSC and is a core area o f focus of the
               future poverty reduction strategy; (iv) the implementation of public finance reforms
               poses challenges and risks negatively impacting service delivery (v) capacity
               constraints also present significant risks to the effective implementation of the poverty
               reduction strategy.

               The Government and Bank are undertaking several measuresto mitigate risk.The Bank
               has finalized a Risk Management and Social Protection Review to assess risk
               prevention and mitigation strategies, and has modified procedures for its Community
               Development Project to rapidly respond to emergencies. On political issues the Bank
               continues to focus on transparency and anti-corruption, with the PRSC and the
               Governance and Institutional Development Project beingthe main instruments.On the
               macroeconomic environment and overall governance, the Bank is continuingto support
               reforms in the areas of public financial management and capacity building through
               ongoing investment operations, the PRSC series and the Governance and Institutional
               Development project, its AAA programs and W B I capacity buildingsupport. The Bank
               will also continue to- coordinate its support in these areas with the IMF in the
               framework o f the new PRGF program. On capacity constraints, the donor community
               has intensified efforts at coordinating assistance programs, harmonizing disbursements
               and procurement procedures and developingcommon programmatic approaches around
               the PRSP. The donor community is also increasing its level oftechnicalassistance and
               support for capacity building.

Estimated
Disbursement:  SDR 26.9 million (US$40 million equivalent) will be disbursed in a single tranche
               following effectiveness.

                                         I.INTRODUCTION



1.       This Program Document proposes a third Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for
Madagascarfor US$40 million. This operation follows the first two PRSC operations approved by the
Board on July 20, 2004, and July 12, 2005. It continues the implementationof the three-year policy and
institutional reform agendaas first laid out inthe PRSC 1policy matrix. This operationis consistent with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to support the implementation of the Government's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The objective of Madagascar's PRSP is to promote rapid and
sustainable developmentto reduce poverty by half inten years. To attainthis objective, the PRSP lays
out three key axes: (i)improving governance; (ii)promoting broad based growth; and (iii)providing
humanandmaterial security. A cross-cuttingpillar ofmonitoring and evaluationunderpinsthe strategy.

2.       The PRSC program for the first three PRSCs focuses explicitly on the strategic axes of
governanceand humandevelopment, and includes specific policy actionsin these areas. The PRSC
does not include any specific policy actions on the other PRSPpillar of broad-basedgrowth. While there
is a policy dialogue in these areas as part of the PRSC, the Bank support for growth is through its
significant  portfolio of ongoing investment projects in infrastructure, environment, mining, rural
development, the Integrated Growth Poles project and a new Irrigation and Watershed project being
presentedat the Board inFY07.

3.       The implementationof the programsupported under the first two operations (PRSC 1and
PRSC 2) is satisfactory and the indicative triggers for PRSC 3 have been fulfilled. The program
document reviews the progress made in implementing the poverty reduction strategy, with particular
emphasis on the areas of focus of PRSC support (governance and human development). The reform
program supported under PRSC 3 continues to assist the consolidation of reforms first commenced with
PRSC 1 in fighting corruption, improving public expenditure management and customs, and in
implementingthe Educationfor All and nutrition programs. Inaddition, reformsto expandaccess to safe
drinking water, improve healthoutcomes andprovide protection from shocks have also advanced.

4.       In 2005 Madagascar continued to make satisfactory progress in implementing its poverty
reduction strategy, despite another difficult year marked by exogenous shocks. Madagascar has
continuedto maintain its focus on implementing its poverty reduction strategy, with good results evident
particularly in the implementationof the roads program, Education for All, nutrition and health reforms.
However, addingto an alreadydifficult 2004 with two devastatingcyclones, in2005 Madagascarsuffered
from the increase of world petroleum prices and the financial crisis of the electric parastatalJIRAMA
which has had a disruptive effect on economic activity as production was negatively affected by the
ensuingpower cuts and subsequent tariff increases. The Governmenthas respondedto this situation and
has put in place a recovery plan for JIRAMA that is now being implemented. Inflation has slowed
considerablyto 11.4 percent in2005 from a rate of 27 percent in2004 and the price of rice has started to

decline since March 2005 and has now stabilized. Measures to enhance exchange rate stability and secure
an adequate level o f internationalreserves were also successful inensuringgreater stability ofthe market-
determinedexchangerate

5.      GDP growth in 2005 is estimated to be at 4.6 percent compared to the 5.3 percent recorded
in 2004. The main sources of growth for 2005 have beenthe agricultural sector, particularly with higher
rice production, tourism and public investment programs. Growth projections forecast an average growth
rate of over 5 percent over the 2007-2010 period. After having reached the Heavily Indebted Poor
Country (HIPC) Initiative Completion Point in October 2004, Madagascar will now benefit from the G8
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), with significant debt relief and improved prospects to
maintain sustainable debt levels in the medium term. Madagascar is also a recipient of the US
Millennium ChallengeAccount (was the first country to become eligible).

6.      Movingforward, the Government of Madagascar is in the processof elaboratingits second-
generation poverty reduction strategy (called the MadagascarAction Plan MAP) which will be
                                                                                   -
completed over the course of this year. The Bank's new CAS for FY07-11 is currently under
preparation and will serve as the Bank's program of support to the implementation of the MAP. It is
expectedthat the CAS will be presented to the Board in January 2007 and that it will includethe proper
mix of instrumentsbetween investmentand budget support. Inparticular, the CAS will outline the focus
of the future PRSC series which will be the core element ofthe Bank's financial supportto the MAP.

7.      A fourth PRSC that will be fully aligned with the first three PRSCs is proposedfor July
                          -                                                         -
2007. The PRSC 4 will bridge the time-lag betweenfinalizing the MAP and the CAS and designingthe
future PRSC series. It will ensure continued annual PRSC financing to Madagascar's poverty reduction
efforts and will be fully harmonizedwith other donors' annualsupport.


                       11. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS
                                A. MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

8.      The macro-economic environment in 2005 was marked by several shocks, including an
increase in world petroleum prices and a financial crisis at the electric parastatal, JIRAMA, which
disrupted economic activity through power cuts and subsequent tariff increases. These shocks caused a
reduction in the economic growth projections for 2005 to 4.6 percent. Growth came largely through
improved performance in agriculture, especially higher rice production, higher tourism receipts, and
continued public investments. Growth in the textile sector stagnated with the phasing out of the Most
Favored Nation Status agreement (MFN). The textile sector is in a consolidation phase, with some
closures, and some re-positioning to continue to benefit from low labor costs. Tourism arrivals in 2005
were 21 percent higher than in 2004. Growth in 2006 is projectedto be under 5 percent, with slower
agricultural growth than in2005, due to the rain shortfalls inthe early part of the year which are likely to
impact the rice harvest.

9.      Despitesignificant inflationary pressures,inflationmoderated to 11.4 percent at year end in
2005 from a high of 27 percentat year end in 2004 linked to a tight monetary policy. Rice prices,
which rose sharply from late 2004 through February 2005, started declining after March 2005 and have
stabilized at around 900-1000 Ariary/kilo for local rice. Higher producer prices which gave a positive
incentiveto farmers have contributedto higherlocal production andclear signals by Governmentto leave
the rice market to the private sector have ensured that adequate rice imports were available inthe market
during the lean season. The Government also reducedthe import taxes on rice to zero inJuly 2005. As
noted above, world petroleum prices increased dramatically, further exacerbating inflationary pressures.


                                                     2

The Government's monetq policy was tight, with broadmoney increasingby only 2.8 percentyear-on-
year in December 2005 and yields on Treasury bills increased from 17.4 percent at year end in 2004 to
18.6 percent in 2005. Year-on year inflation at end-April 2006 has declined further to 10.4 percent.
Overall, higher than expected oil prices in 2006, are expected to result in inflation of around 11 percent
for the year 2006 (at year end).

10.     The measures adopted to ensure exchange rate stability and competitiveness,and secure an
adequate level of international reserves were broadly successful with the market-determined
exchange rate exhibiting greater stability in 2005. Foreign reserves also increased to 2.9 months of
imports by year end in 2005 up from 2.8 months a year earlier. The guidelines adopted by the Central
Bank for intervention in the foreign exchange market with the aim of directing Central Bank (BCM)
interventionsto achieving its foreign assets objectives and at dampening sharp swings that would create
uncertainty were broadly followed. The BCM has also received further technical assistance in exchange
rate management from the IMF in early 2006. The continuous inter-bank foreign exchange market with
an electronic trading system is functioning well, providing increased information to the operators and
contributing to reducingthe volatility of the exchange rate.

11.     The electricity parastatal's (JIRAMA) structural and financial difficulties had a negative
impact on growth in 2005, but a recovery plan is now being implemented. JIRAMA presented this
financial recovery plan inJanuary 2006 and receiveddonor support for its implementation.As part of the
plan, JIRAMA has implementedtwo tariff increases for electricity of 30 percent and 35 percent in July
and November 2005 respectively to bring tariffs more in line with production costs. Further tariff
increases of 10 percent for electricity were implemented in April 2006. Measures to improve the
efficiency of JIRAMA are also under implementation, as are measuresto reduce the dependenceon diesel
generated electricity. JIRAMA is currently operating under a management contract which is due to
terminate in April 2007. The Government has committed to a longer-term public-private partnership
solution inthe form of an affirmage for JIRAMA after the current managementcontract is completed.

12.      However, significant revenueshortfalls in customsand tax collections, linkedto weaknesses
in administration, have led to a decline in the share of tax revenues in GDP from 10.9 percent in
2004 to 10.1 percent in 2005. The persistent problems in revenue mobilization have hampered the
Government's ability to implement its ambitious poverty reduction strategy, with mid-year expenditure
cuts implemented to maintain overall fiscal discipline. In 2005, year-end expenditure overruns also
highlighted problems of expenditure management, and the Government is currently undertaking an audit
of the expenditure commitment process, which will form the basis for improvementsto the system (see
Section N A for a detailed discussion of the public expenditure reform program). The Government is
implementing a customs reform program (see Section N, D for the details of the status of the reform
program).

13.      Overall, the macroeconomic situation remains fragile, especially as revenue mobilization
remains weak. This is due to long term structural problems which the Government is committed to
tackling, and the PRSC is supporting reforms to strengthen fiscal management. Given that achieving
results is linked to deep institutional reforms, the reform program requires sustained engagement and
support. The IMF has concluded discussionson a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement with the Government, and the new program is expectedto be presented to the IMF Board in
July 2006.

  14.     Despite adverse external shocks, growth has remained at respectable levels after the 2002
  crisis and is expectedto remainat over five percentin the medium term. After a sharp decline of 13
  percent in2002, growth rebounded to 9.8 percent in 2003, was 5.3 percent in2004 and is projected at 4.6
  percent in 2005. The macroeconomic projections forecast an average growth rate o f around 5.6 percent
  over the mediumterm (2007-2010).

  15.     The main sources of growth include tourism, mining, constructionand, most importantfor
  the poor, improvedgrowth prospects in agriculture. The EPZ sector is not expected to grow due to
  the impact ofthe expiration ofthe MFA. Tourism and relatedactivities are expectedto continue to grow
  further given the planned private investmentinhotels and the increasing number of tourists. Inmining,
  the recently approved ilmenite miningproject financed by Rio Tinto inthe Fort Dauphin region is under
  implementation.

  16.     Agriculture is projected to sustain the good performanceinitiatedin 2003 in the medium-
  term, with an annual growth rate of over 3 percent. Agriculture grew by about 4.5 percent in2005.
  The increase in producer prices in rice in 2004 provided incentives for producers which contributed to
  increased rice production. Growth in 2006 is projected to be slower, due to rain shortfalls, which has
  affected agricultural production. Overall, the implementation of the irrigation and roads program is
  designedto relax the constraints facing rural producers and continue to leadto improved growth prospects
  inthe sector, with reduced vulnerability to natural shocks. Thus, the improvedperformance is expected
  to be sustainedover the mediumterm with the emphasis on rural development inthe Government's vision
  "Madagascar Naturellement" (see Box 1) and with investments under the proposed IDA Irrigation and
  Watershed Management project and the Millennium Challenge Account program.

  17.     Investment levels needed to generate this growth are expected to average just under 23
  percent of GDP and this is expected to be driven mainly by an increase in private investment.

Private investment in2005 was over 12 percent, compared to an average of 8.1 per cent of GDP between
1997 and 2001. Private investment is expected to average 12.4 percent of GDP over the 2007-11period.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is increasingand reached 1.9 percentof GDP in2005, and is projectedto
increase to over 3 percent of GDP in2010. Investment intourism and mining and the investmentrelated
to the implementationof the management contractsininfrastructure(airports, ports, electricity and water)
will give impetusto an increase inFDI.

18.       Exportsare projected to grow at over 6 percent per year over the forecast period. In2005,
with the expiration of the Multi-Fibre Agreement, textile exports were almost of the same value as in
2004, and the value of vanilla exports was significantly lower due to the collapse of world vanilla prices.
But tourism exports are expected to be higher. In the medium term, export growth is likely to come
throughtourism, miningand a more diverse range of agricultural products.

19.       In the medium term, the balance of payments is projected to improve with the level of
internationalreserves reaching the equivalent of 3.1 months of GNFS imports in 2011 higher than
the 2004 levelof 2.8 months.Along with an improvementof the capital and financial account due to the
net increase in FDI, the current account balance deficit, including grants, is projectedto decrease steadily
from 10.8 percent of GDP in2005 to 10.1 percent of GDP in2011.

20.       Government expenditures are expectedto average over 21 percentof GDP over the forecast
period,with capitalexpenditures averaging over 10 percent of GDP versus 7.4 percent of GDP for
the 1997-2001 period. Government expenditures on capital reflect the significant investments inroads,
in irrigation and the planned investments under the Bank's IntegratedGrowth Poles Project on energy,
water and sanitation investment in Nosy Be as well as additional infrastructure around the EPZ and
information communicationandtechnology (ICT) parkso fAntananarivo.

21.       Overall, foreign assistance, includingassistance under the enhanced HIPC and the MDRI,
plays an importantrole in macro management and povertyreductionin Madagascar.The financing
requirements shown in Table 3 are met through significant donor assistance, in the form of project and
budget financing, and improved revenuemobilization. The Government is committed to implementinga
program to increase tax revenues to support its development objectives and revenue mobilization is
expected to reach 13.4 percent of GDP in 2011 up from 10.1 percent of GDP in2005. To this effect, the
Government is implementingan ambitious customs reform program, which is finally beginning to show
results (see section IV D).

22.      Madagascar attained the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in
October 2004, and is subsequently benefiting from debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI).Madagascar's Net Present Value (NPV) of externaldebt at end-2004, after assuming
full delivery of HIPC debt relief, was projected at about 186 percent of exports at the time of HIPC
completion point'. Most Paris Club creditors have also granted bilateral debt relief beyond HIPC that
together with the recently approved MDRI would further reduce the ratio to about 75 percent by end-
2006.

23.      An assessment of Madagascar's riskof debt distresswill be presented inthe upcomingjoint
IMFDDA DSA under the LIC framework. Although work on the DSA is still ongoing the main
analytical features are presentedbelow.
0    Under the baseline scenario, Madagascar's external debt indicators remain well below the
     thresholds throughout the projectionperi0d.3'~The debt indicators drop sharply (by 50 percent)
     in2006 as result of the MDRI.After the initial decreasedueto the delivery ofMDRI, the debt burden
     indicators exhibit a hump reflecting relatively high new borrowing (albeit in concessionalterms) to
     finance needed investment expenditures. Given the highly concessional nature of the existing debt
     and new borrowing; the debt service ratio is well below the threshold level throughout the period but
     has a slightly rising trenddueto the accumulationofnew borrowing.
0    External debt indicators could deterioratewith inappropriatepolicies, and/or if confronted by
     adverse shocks Debt burden indicators deteriorate under most stress tests, but cross the indicative
     thresholds (although declining gradually towards the end ofthe period) only under the "most extreme
     stress tests''.

24.      In conclusion,the debt situation seems sustainable but would be importantlyinfluenced by
policies. Given the macroeconomic framework, the debt situation in Madagascar appears sustainable.
However there is need for good implementation of policies and also a need for careful monitoring of
borrowing policies and export performance. Given the forward looking nature of sustainability, the stress
tests point to the debt becoming vulnerable to shocks to GDP and particularly to exports. The latter i s
critical given the risks to Madagascar's exports. The termination of the ATC and AGOA renders exports
highly vulnerable given the concentration of exports in textiles and clothing. The baseline projections
assume that structural weakness inthis sector will be somewhat offset by a positive response to the large
depreciation which has taken place in 2004 and from the increased exports expected from mining.
Additional borrowing or borrowing at anything other than nonconcessionalrates could impose a burden
for future debt servicepayments which would come due should exports weaken further.

 Madagascar is rated as a mediumperformer with regard to its policies and institutions according to the Bank's
Country and Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index. As a mediumperformer, the indicative thresholds
relevant for Madagascar are: (i) 150 percent for Net Present Value (NPV) o f debt-to-exports, (ii) percent for the
                                                                                                  40

thresholds are (i)20 percent o f exports and (ii)

           111. MADAGASCAR'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

                                          A. POVERTY INMADAGASCAR

26.     Between1970and 2001, per capitaincomein Madagascar declined from US$409to US$257,
and as a consequence poverty increased, especially during the 1980s. The long economic decline
impacted adversely on people's quality o f life as demonstratedby the low levels o f many social indicators
and access to basic utilities. With the resumption of sustained growth duringthe period 1997-2001, there
was some progress in poverty reduction, but it was limited to urban areas. The results of the 2004/5
household survey have recently been released and this section presents the updated poverty profile based
on this survey as well as trends inindicators wherever possible.

27.     In 2004, the overallincidenceof povertystands at 72.1 percent, significantly lower than the
2002 crisis highof over 80 percent, but still higher than the 2001 poverty rate of 69.7 percent. The
preliminary analysis from the 2005 household survey shows a continuation o f this trend, with the overall
poverty rate declining to 68.7 percent. In2004, the intensity of poverty, which is sensitive to the distance
o fthe poor from the poverty line, has declined from its 2001 level o f 39.8 percent to 34.8 percent in2004.
The distribution o f income has also improved with the Gini coefficient declining from 0.468 to 0.385,
with the declines mirrored inbothurbanandrural areas.

28.     Poverty in Madagascar remains predominantly rural with 77 percent of the rural
population being poor in 2004, the same levelas in2001, compared to 54 percent in urbanareas in
2004 higher than the 2001 levels of 44 percent. The preliminary 2005 household survey shows that
rural poverty incidence is decreasing with a rate in rural areas o f 73.5 percent and urban poverty
decreasing to 52 percent. This might be the result o f many factors: greater emphasis on rural
development, the accelerated implementation of the roads program, and the higher rice prices which gave
incentives to rural farmers. Another potential factor is that the nature o f the economic shocks (strong
depreciation, high international oil and rice prices) in 200415 which affected the richer segments of
society more adversely.

29.      Education outcomes have improved between 2001 and 2004, with the percentage of the
population 6 years and older without any education declining from 48 percent to 35 percent.
Literacy rates remain different across urban and rural areas. While one in two individuals 15 years and
older in rural areas is literate, about four in five in urban areas are literate. With the implementation o f
the Government's Educationfor All program, which included the abolition of school fees, recruitment of
teachers inrural areas, re-construction o f school establishments, payment o f FRAMteachers' salaries and
distribution o f materials and supplies, there has been a dramatic increase in enrolments, with primary net
enrolment rates increasing by 20 percentage points between 2001 and 2004. While the expansion in
education has beenpro-poor, there remains a small difference inenrolment rates across quintiles, with the
net primary enrolment rate for the poorest quintile at about 81 percent, in contrast to the richest quintile
where the net primary enrolment rate is 91 percent. The differences are sharper at the secondary level,
with the net lower secondary enrolment rate varying between 7 percent for the poorest quintile to 41
percent for the richest quintile. There are limited gender differences in enrolment rates, and also in
promotion, repetitionand drop-out rates.

30.     The overallincidenceof illness in2004 was 11percent,with fever and suspected malariabeing
the most frequent causes of illness accounting for over 4 in 10 cases, and diarrhea being a distant second
accounting for 12 percent of all cases. About 4 in 10people who are illvisit a health facility to seek care.
Among those who do not seek care, halfdo not since the illness is not severe, but over one infour do not
seek health care for financial reasons, and one inten because the facility is too far, the latter reasonbeing
particularly important in rural areas. Over 4 in 10 people visit a Centre de SantB de Base 2 (CSBZ), and
another 12 percent visit a CSB1, and about 2 in 10 visit a private doctor. The cost of consultation
averages 1,080 Ariary per visit, with the cost at CSB2 only 200 Ariary. Inaddition, the cost of medicines
averages 5,200 Ariary per visit, with the CSB2 costing 3,600 Ariary per visit.

31.     Immunization coverage improved sharply between 2001 and 2004, with complete
vaccination ratesimprovingfrom 36 percent in2001 to 63.4 percent in 2004, basedon the household
survey. Immunization rates show that 63.4 percent of children between the ages o f 12 and 23 months
have a complete set of vaccinations in 2004, ranging from 62.4 percent in rural areas, to 61.5 percent in
the secondary urban centers, and 75 percent in big urban centers. But, there is wide divergence across
provinces, with three provinces of Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa and Toamasina having rates well over 70
percent for complete immunizations, but Antisranana having a very low rate of only 31 percent, and
Toliara and Mahajangaranging around 45 percent.

32.     The rate of prenatalconsultation stands at 80 percent overall, rangingfrom 78.6 percent in
ruralareas to 91 percentin bigurbancenters.The variation across provinces remains, with Mahajanga
having the lowest rate (62 percent), and Toamasina the highest rate (88.6 percent). Over 6 in 10 people
aged 15 years and older have knowledge o f family planning, with knowledge among 15-20 year olds the
lowest (48 percent). Knowledge of family planning is significantly lower inrural areas (only 57 percent)
compared to those living in big urban centers (88.4 percent). Almost 7 in 10 people aged 15 and older
believe that family planning is useful, and there is no difference in this perception across urban or rural
areas. Despite the belief in its utility, only 15 percent o f this age group use family planning, and the rate
is lowest among 15-20 year olds (4.3 percent). The rate of utilization is particularly low in rural areas
(only 13 percent) incontrast to bigger urbancenters (25 percent).

33.     About one in three households had access to safe drinking water in 2004, and the
differences remainvery sharp across urbanand ruralareas. The source of lightingvaries across poor
and rich households. Electricity is usedby about 14 percent o f the population, with almost no one inthe
lowest quintile usingelectricity and about 45 percent o f the richest with access to electricity. Incontrast,
the major source of lighting is kerosene, with 4 in 5 people usingit. Almost all of the poor use this as
their source of lighting. Wood collected by households is the primary source ofcooking fuel, with almost
96 percent o f the poor utilizingthis. Incontrast the richest quintile is likely to use charcoal (46 percent)
and collect (42 percent) or purchase (10 percent) wood. There is very limiteduse o f gas or other fuels for
cooking.

34.     Households in Madagascarare vulnerable to a range of shocks (natural and economic). In
2004, almost all households (98.5 percent) faced at least one shock. Among the households that faced a
shock, about 4 in 10 faced a climatic shock (mainly cyclone or flooding) and an equal number faced
economic shocks (inflation primarily). Insecurity and health shocks affect 1 in 20 of the population.
Rural households were more affected by climatic/environmental shocks, while urban households faced a
higher incidence of economic shocks. In the face of these shocks, households responded by working
more (adopted by 2 in 5 households), reducing food consumption (1 in 5), or doing nothing (1 in 5
households). Interms of the time taken to recover from the shock, only 6 percent had recovered a month
after the shock, over a third (38.4 percent) had recovered between 1 and 12 months after the shock, and
over half(55 percent) had still not recovered to their initial levels of welfare at the time o f data collection,
indicatingthat shocks often have longer term effects.

                                             IMPLEMENTATION


35.     The main objective of the Government's PRSP is to promote rapid and sustainable
development to reduce poverty by half in ten years. To attain this objective, the PRSP has three
strategic axes (i) governance; (ii)
                   good                    broad-based growth; and (iii)human and material security. A
cross-cutting axis o f monitoring and evaluation underpins the strategy. In the area o f governance, the
main elements o f the PRSP include the fight against corruption, improved public expenditure
management, respecting democracy, establishing an equitable justice system, and implementing
decentralization.   The Government's strategy for broad-based growth is geared toward maintaining
macroeconomic stability and achieving high annual growth through facilitating private sector
development, accelerating the roads program, rural development, fostering public-private partnerships
and greater opening up o fthe economy. Underthe strategic axis ofhuman and material security, the main
objective is to enhance human capacity and strengthen individual assets, through education, health and
nutrition. The PRSP views the commune as the main local service provider and the anchor for all
interventionsinthis domain.

36.
incorporate the longer term vision (to 2019,Madagascar Naturellement, which foresees a transition from
        The Government of Madagascarupdated its PRSP in mid-2005. The PRSP was updated to

a subsistence economy to a market economy, to realize its potential through optimal use o f its resources,
while respecting the environment.       The vision puts an enhanced emphasis on rural areas, through
improved productivity, increasedvalue added, improved infrastructure, technology and partnerships.

37.     In 2005, implementationof the PRSP continued to be satisfactory. The Government prepares
its PRSP Progress Reports (PRSP-PR) on a calendar year basis to correspond to the budget cycle, with a
mid-year report on implementation in July to inform the budget preparation for the following year. The
2005 Annual PRSP Progress Report has been prepared in April 2006 and provides a comprehensive
overview o f the results achieved, an analysis of the results, lessons learnt and challenges faced in
implementing the poverty reduction strategy paper. This report provides an update on the poverty
situation in Madagascar (with details on the decrease in poverty from 72.1% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2005)
and summarizes that - on balance - positive progress has been achieved in the 15 PRSP priority
programs.

38.      The 2005 PRSP-PR concludes that there have been significant results achieved in human
and physical capital. This is evidenced by the continued positive trend in human development
indicators, e.g. the net enrollment rate remains at over 90 percent inthe 2005/06 school year. The report
also provides details on the improvements in infrastructure, particularly the rehabilitation o f the road
network, as well as progress on rural development. Section IV of this document provides further details
of achievementsand outstanding challenges.

39.     Nevertheless,the PRSP-PR also emphasizes that implementationof the strategy faces many
constraints which have hampered progress. These constraints include weak progress on pro-poor
growth with the relatively well-off parts o f the population mainly benefiting from the economic growth
achieved. There has also been insufficient progress on governance reforms and limited private sector
contribution to the country's development. The Government i s taking steps to address these constraints
through renewing its focus on the governance agenda and stepping up efforts at private sector
development such as focusing on improving the investment climate

40.     The Government is in the process of formulating its second-generation poverty-reduction
strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), a five-year plan to produce a quantum leap in the

development process by mobilizing the Malagasy people and the international partners, to ignite rapid
growth, reduce poverty and ensure that the country develops inresponse to the challenges o f globalization
and inaccordance with the national vision -Madagascar Naturellement (see Box 1).

41.      The Joint StaffAdvisory Note on the 2005 PRSP-PR, to be distributedto the BoardinJuly
2006, attests the good progress made in the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and
identifies key prioritiesto be addressedby the Governmentinformulatingthe new MAP. The main
recommendations are: (i)identification and elaboration of the key structural and binding constraints to
shared growth; (ii)alternative macroeconomic scenarios within a realistic medium-term framework
consistent with the analysis o f sources o f growth and (iii)        inclusion o f a policy reform matrix which
outlines the sequencing and prioritization o f the key policy and institutional reforms to achieve the MAP
results.

                            Box 1Madagascar's DevelopmentVision and Strategy
                                           TheMadagascarAction Plan
The Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) 2012 is the Government's new vision that sets out a "roadmap" for
development. The purposeof the MAP is to produce a quantum leap inthe development process by having a five
year planthat will mobilize the Malagasypeople and the country's internationalpartnersto ignite rapid growth, thus
leadingto the reduction of poverty. Its goal is also to ensurethat the country develops in responseto the challenges
of globalization and inaccordance with the national vision "Madagascar Naturellement" that was previously defined
by the PresidentinNovember 2004 (and is described below). Madagascar Naturellement is the long-term vision for
the country andthe MAP is the 5-year strategy that works towards achievingthis vision.

Madagascar Naturellement is the statement of the country's development vision in 2015 that was defined by
the Presidentof Madagascar in late-2004. It states that Madagascar will be a newly industrialized country with
maximized competitiveness by 2020. The core of growth will be derived from the country's unique natural
resources and from the transformation of its natural products. The vision aims to develop a diversified and rich
natural resource base (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and mining) that will contribute to the creation of products
with high value added such as essential oils, agri-business, pharmaceuticals, and miningproducts. A broader impact
of growth and a progressiveredistribution of its benefits will help reduce poverty substantially. Madagascar will be
known worldwide for the beauty of its rich and well-protected biodiversity and its environment will be cherished
and protected and used in a wise and responsibleway to enhance development. The Malagasy people, both in rural
and urban areas, will be healthy and well-educated, will be active participants inthe development process and will
be gainfully employed inagriculture, industry and the provision of services. Education and healthwill be accessible
to the populationand infrastructurewill be developedallowing for free movementof goods and people.

The MAP'S goals are ambitious targets that the Government is committed to achievingover the coming five
years. It is recognizedthat these targets are challenging but, at the same time, it is expected that results will be
delivered through the mobilization of the full array of the available resources (human, technical and financial),
combinedwith strong leadership, hard work, creativity and excellentcoordination. The MAP outlines eight specific
areas of focus; (i)good governance; (ii)educational transformation; (iii)health and family planning; (iv)
infrastructure; (v) rural development; (vi) the economy and the private sector; (vii) environment; and (viii) national
solidarity. There are quantifiable goals set out for each of these areas of focus to be achieved by 2012; these goals
will be further refined, costedand clearly linked to the MDGs.

The MAP is a direct follow-on from the PRSP and covers the five year period 2007-2011. The Government
believesthat it has effectively implementedthe initial PRSP and intendsnow for the MAP to supersede the PRSP as
the country's main developmentstrategy. The MAP will be finalized inOctober 2006 and presentedto Parliament
together with the 2007 budget.

La Politique Gknkrale de 1'Etat sets out the Government'sactions and desired results in 2006 that are critical
steps towards attainingthe objectives of the MAP and MadagascarNaturellement in2015. There are 3-5 results by
Ministry which form part ofthe results agreement betweenthe Presidentand his Cabinet.

                                THEIMPLEMENTATIONOFTHEPRSP


42.      The Bank's support to Madagascar, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy of
November 2003, supports the implementation of the PRSP, using ongoing and new investment
lending and budget support, analytical work, and the services of the broader Bank Group (IFC, MIGA,
and WBI). The FY05 program for Madagascar reflectedthe transition to programmatic lendingwith the
first single-tranche annual Poverty Reduction Support Credit approved in July 2004. This was followed
by the PRSC2, approved inJuly 2005. New investmentprojects in several sectors - supplementalcredits
for the Health Sector ($18 million) and for the Community Development Project ($50 million) were
approvedinFY05. InFY06, the IntegratedGrowth PolesProjectandthe second HIV/AIDS project were
approved. For FY07, in addition to the PRSC 3, a new Supplemental Credit for the Community
DevelopmentProject andan Energy Investmentproject are all plannedfor presentationto the Board at the
same time. An Irrigation and Watershed Management project will be presented to Board in September
2006.

43.      As noted inthe PRSC 1and PRSC2 ProgramDocuments,the CASalso outlines a program
of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) to underpin the Bank's policy dialogue and
programmaticlending. Furthermore, analytical and advisory work has been conducted or is planned
beyond what was envisioned in the CAS to respondto Government needs (see Table 5). This year, key
analytical reports completed include: the Investment Climate Assessment, the Financial Sector
Assessment Programand the land tenure review; which will underpin the reforms under the growth pillar
in subsequent PRSCs, as well as the Local Development Fund (FDL) feasibility study, led by the
Government, which will form the basis for the operational design o f the new Government institution for
local development. PRSC 3 continues to benefit from the integrative Development Policy Review on
Sustaining Growth for Enhanced Poverty Reduction (FY05) which outlines the growth strategy and
priorities for reform for Madagascar to achieve shared growth. The Public Expenditure Review (FY05),
which providesrecommendationsonthe public expenditurereform agenda and specific recommendations
for the transport, education and environment sectors, also helped underpin the key reforms for PRSC 2
and now PRSC 3. The findings of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY03) and
the Country ProcurementAssessment Review (CPAR, FY03), as notedbefore, have also been critical in
defining the reform programofthe Government.

44.      The Government remains committed to monitoring progress in implementing its public
expenditure reform program under the HIPC Public Expenditure Assessment and Action Plan.
Madagascar was also a pilot country for the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA),
which is a joint initiative of the World Bank, EU, IMF, DFID, France, Norway and Switzerland, to
develop a strengthened approach to public financial management. The PEFA approach includes a
country-led strategy on public financial management reforms, a coordinated program of assistance by
donors and a performance measurement fiamework.         Madagascar is just completing its first PEFA
assessment of the public financial management system which will be used as a baseline to measure
progress.     Furthermore several analytical activities recently completed or on-going, support the
Government inits efforts to completeits strategy for post-primary education. Inthe same vein, the health
sector dialogue benefits from an array o f analytical work including recently completed surveys (the
Demographic and Health Survey, and the Study of the efficiency and equity of health facilities Iand 11)
and the National HealthAccounts study.

        Box 2: LessonsLearned-Implementationof PRSC 1and PRSC 2

Overall Context:
Almost two years since the first PRSC was approved, there has beentangible progressinsome areas, while
others lag. The overall economiccontext inboth 2004 and 2005 continuedto complicate budgetmanagement
and implementation. Three key factors were dominant.
  First, both 2004 and 2005 were uncertain economic years. 2004 was markedby a sharp depreciationofthe
  exchange rateand two back-to-backcyclones, which ledto unforeseenexpendituresand sharp inflation. 2005
  was marked by high international oil prices, and a structuraland financial crisis inthe energyparastatal
  JIRAMA, which ledto unprogrammedbudgetaryoutlays.
   Second, the trend of signifcant revenue shortfalls in2004 continuedin2005 and into the first part of2006,
  impacting budget managementand the ability to deliver on the strategy, since expenditures adjustedto the
  reducedresourceenvelopes, with mid-year expenditure blockageslimiting sector ministries capacityto
  implement their programs.
  Third, the introduction of theprogram budgets complicated budget execution: The 2005 budget introduced
  program budgeting, a large-scalereform, without adequatepreparation, which complicated budgetexecution
  and stretchedlimited capacity.
Response:
  Sustained donor co-ordination among budget support donors. Thejoint donor mission launched in October
  2004 was followed by one in October 2005. Starting in 2006, two joint-donor missions are planned (in April
  and SeptembedOctober each year) and the first one was completed end-April 2006. The Partnership
  Agreement betweenthe Governmentand budget support donors was also signed by the African Development
  Bank (inaddition to the original signatures ofthe World Bank, EU and France, with the U S as participant but
  not signatory).
  Sustained co-ordination and harmonization especially inthe areas of public financial management, education,
  nutrition and health. In the education sector, two joint-donor missions a year monitor progress on the
  Education for All Agenda. In public financial management, ajoint-donor assessment of the public finance
  system -the public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment was recently completed        -
  underEU leadershipinApril/May 2006- and the report is being finalized. A joint donor round table on public
  financial management to discuss implementation issues and find real-time solutions for implementation
  problemsfor the priority action plan is being revitalized.
  Greater attention to capacity needs, especially in financial management and procurement, and longer term
  visionfor technical assistancefor priority ministries. In education, a two year technical assistance plan was
  prepared and is under implementation with the Ministry of Education, with financing from the PGDI, to
  provide assistanceinbudget formulation, execution and policy advice. A similar plan is under preparationfor
  nutrition and health.
  SimpliJication and greater preparation for the 2006 budget: The presentation of the 2006 budget was
  simplified, and more attention was paid to training responsible ministry staff upfront to facilitate budget
  execution in2006.
  Monitoring budget execution: The integrated financial management system is operational in Antananarivo
  and five principal provincial treasuries, covering about 80 percent of all expenditures. The Government is
  using this information and presenting this at 3 conferences each year to follow the execution of the
  Government's program.
Moving forward
  Greater attention toprioritizing reforms and monitoring and learning in real time: The Ministryof Finance's
  reform agenda is wide-ranging, and the challenge remains greater prioritization and staying the course on
  implementing the reform program. While fine-tuning and adjusting is a critical element of a successfil
  program this needs to be balanced with the need to have stable procedures (changes each year complicate
  implementation).
a Continue to support key ministries, extending capacityhraining to de-concentrated levels in key sector
  ministries (education and health).

45.      At the time of the last CAS, it was expected that PRSC lending would account for a large
part of the IDA envelope for Madagascar each year. However, with the decrease in the IDA-15
allocation for Madagascar, the distribution of available financing betweenbudget support and investment
operations hadto be realigned within this allocation. Inaddition, the experience inthe implementationof
the first two PRSCs, describedin detail below, and the fragile macroeconomicenvironment also called
for a re-alignment between investment operations and budget support to assist Government in
implementing its PRSP. These considerations, along with the new available resources from the MDRI
have resultedina smaller financing amountfor PRSC 3 as compared to PRSC 1and 2.

46.      Movingforward, the Government of Madagascar is inthe processof elaboratingits second-
generationpoverty reduction strategy -the MAP- which will be completed over the course of this
year. The Bank's new CAS for FY07-11 is currently under preparation and will serve as the Bank's
program of support to the implementation of the MAP. It is expected that the CAS will be presented to
the Board in early 2007 and that it will include the proper mix of instruments between investment and
budget support. Inparticular, the CAS will outline the focus of the future PRSC series which will be one
of the key elementsofthe Bank's financial supportto the MAP.

47.      The MAP will outline the country's poverty reduction strategy for the next five years and
will identify prospects for scaled-up assistance should additionalfinancing become available. The
program in the new CAS will assist the Government in providing a suitable framework for absorbing
additional resources to support a possible scaling-up: the proposedprojects in the CAS will be identified
and preparedwith the intentthat they could be expanded should additionalresourcesfrom other donorsor
the private sector become available (catalytic approach). To this end, the CAS will maintain a concerted
focus on public expendituremanagement, institutional capacity buildingand sector-wideapproaches.

48.      A fourth PRSC that will be fully aligned with the first three PRSCs - is proposed for
                            -
2007. The PRSC 4 will bridge the time-lag betweenfinalizing the MAP and the CAS and designingthe
future PRSC series. It will ensure continued annual PRSC financing to Madagascar's poverty reduction
efforts andwill be fully harmonizedwith other donors' annual support.


           D. DONORCOLLABORATION INSUPPORTINGTHEIMPLEMENTATION

Cooperationwith the Multilateraland BilateralDonors

49.      The donors are collaborating to support Madagascar in implementing its development
vision, by providingfinancial and technical support in a coordinated way. A partnership agreement
(Cadre de Partenariat) was signedbetweenthe Governmentandthe key budget support donors -European
Union (EU), France (Agence Franqaisede DCveloppement, andthe FrenchCo-operation), andthe African
Development Bank- to provide a framework and to lay out procedures and modalities for a multi-donor
approach to budgetary support. This Budget Group initiated joint-donor missions in October 2004 to
review the implementation of the PRSP and supervise their respectivebudget support operations. This is
part of the overall effort to harmonizeassistance and reduce the transactions cost for the Government.A
follow-up joint donor mission was held in September-October2005 to review the Annual PRSP Progress
Report for calendar year 2004, and the draft budget for 2006. Starting with 2006, two joint-donor
missions are envisaged in April and September/October of each year, the first of which was recently
completedinlate-April2006.




                                                    15

50.      In the joint supervision missions, common areas of support with the EU's program of
budget support (Programmed'Appui BudgCtaire la RCductionde la PauvretC, PARP) includethe
public sector reform agenda, education and health. The public expenditure reform agenda support is
coordinated to support the Government's Priority Action Plan. The Government has convened meetings
periodically with the key donors to inform them of progress on implementation. Key reforms in public
financial management and fighting corruption are being supported by financing from IDA together with
technical assistance from the EU, GTZ and the French Cooperation. Donor coordination around
implementingcustoms reformshas also improved. Inhealth, the key donors are also coordinatingsupport
and are .moving towards using a sector-wide approach. In addition, HIV/AIDS, transport, water,
agricultural and environmental sector reforms and investment continue to be approached together with
other partners.

51.      The Ministry of Education(MENRS) has continued to lead the dialogue with donors in the
education sector. The FTIprocess with the EFA National plan has strengthened the Ministry further in
this role and has given a focus to the Donor Group. Regular donor meetings are organized and through
this, a deeper sharing of information on appraisal missions, TA and studies. Whilst there are diverse
support mechanisms, donors take a holistic approach and are concerned about the progress of the EFA
Planoverall as well as individual projects.

52.      Capacity constraints hamper Madagascar's ability to achieve its development objectives.
The donor community is supporting Madagascar in strengthening capacity, through a range o f
technical assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance the implementation of the PRSP.
The key donors involved in supporting the strategic pillar o f governance, include the World Bank,
European Union, UNDP, French Co-operation, the African Development Bank, GTZ, and USAID. A
number of donors are very active in supporting education (UNICEF, French Co-operation, AfDB, AFD,
Japan, USAID and World Bank). Donor coordination, to support capacity building efforts, is also being
enhanced through the round table for public expenditure management reforms, and through the Budget
Support Group.

Coordinationwith the IMF

53.      The Bank closely collaborates and coordinates activities with the IMF. The staff o f the two
institutions conduct regularjoint assessments o f the PRSP implementation and also work closely together
on (i)analysis and reforms in public financial management; (ii)other governance reforms, including
customs; (iii)support o fthe privatizationprogram; and (iv) trade.

54.      The IMF completed technical discussions for its new Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement with Madagascar in May 2006 and is expected to present the
program to their Board in July, at the same time of the Bank Board discussion of the proposed
PRSC 3. The Government has implemented measures to continue to adequately manage a fragile
macroeconomic environment and reached agreement with the IMF for a new program. The staff o f IDA
and IMF will continue to coordinate the content of the PRSC and PRGF to ensure that the instruments
complement one another. Ingeneral, the structural and social benchmarks will be covered by the PRSC,
while the PRGF will cover macroeconomic issues.

the first three PRSCs (see Figure l), based on discussions with the Government, the pace of the
                                         was
reform agenda, the existing knowledge base and analysis o f development issues, other donor programs,
and IDA resources. The objective o f the first three PRSCs (2004-2006) is to consolidate reforms
underway in the public sector, fight corruption, improve transparency and accountability, and improve
service delivery in education, health, water supply and nutrition. As outlined in the PRSC 1 Program
Document, a set o f clear, well-defined milestones, policy actions or indicators have been defined to
transition from PRSC 2 to PRSC 3.

Note: The striped blocks in the PRSC 1-PRSC3 rows indicatethat that it is an area of focus under the respectivePRSC.



56.      The PRSC program for the first three PRSCs focuses explicitly on the strategic axes of
governance and human development, and includesspecific policy actions in these areas. The PRSC
does not include any specific policy actions on the other PRSP pillar o f broad-based growth. While there
is a policy dialogue in these areas as part o f the PRSC, the Bank support for growth is through its
significant portfolio of ongoing investment projects in infrastructure, energy, environment, mining, rural
development, the Integrated Growth Poles project and a new Irrigation and Watershed project being
presented to the Board in FY07. Annex 4 summarizes the main elements o f the reform agenda and the
Bank's program inthe PRSP pillar o f broad-based growth (PRSP strategic axis 2). Table 6 outlines the
key policies for Growth under implementation and Bank portfolio supporting Government efforts. In
particular, the new operations in Energy and Watershed management will reinforce support to broad-

based growth assisting Government in restructuring the electricity parastatal JIRAMA and in improving
rice and agricultural prod~ctivity.~

57.      The implementationof the program supported under the first two operations (PRSC 1and
PRSC 2) is satisfactory and the indicativetriggers for PRSC 3 are broadly fulfilled. As specified in
Table 8 below, there is just one trigger in the area o f procurement where the original plan has not been
fully implemented and the final trigger has thus been revised. Delays still persist in the final
implementation of the new Procurement Code, although progress inthis regard has been notable. Inthe
area of public finance reform, the implementation o f the 2005 Priority Action Plan was satisfactory
overall; progress has been made in improving both budget preparation and execution. The EducationFor
All initiative continues to be implemented steadily with enrolment rates remaining high and well above
the original expectations. Government's focus on improving quality of service is also starting to show
positive results. Delays however still persist in school construction. The elaboration o f a post-primary
education strategy is also advancing and should be completed inthe next year. The institutional structure
for delivering nutrition services has been further strengthened and delivery has improved in the last
months. Government has also launched a new review o f the current institutional structure for nutrition to
assess ingreater detail its efficiency and identify additional improvements as needed. The Government is
making progress to transitiontowards programmatic support inthe health sector. Capacity at the Ministry
of Health for budget planning and execution is being strengthened. Work on the National Health
Accounts is now nearing completion and costing for the health MDGs, using a marginal bottlenecks
approach, is beingfurther refined. Plans are also inplace to elaborate a health services financing strategy
and to update the medium expenditure framework (MTEF) for the health sector, first prepared last year.
The rural water supply program is also progressing well as the Government has implemented all the
recommendations set out in the 2005 sector review. Annex 2 provides greater details on progress on all
the actions originally envisioned for PRSC 3.




  Other donors also supportgrowthenhancing measures with dedicatedoperations. Most notablythe EU, the largest
donor engaged inbudgetsupport after the World Bank, providesdedicatedfinancingto a largeroadprogramand

 58.     While overall program implementation is satisfactory there are areas where progress has
 been mixed. Reforms initiated in several areas need more time to consolidate than originally
 envisioned. As discussed below, inthe last twelve months advancements inanti-corruption andjudiciary
 reforms have been lingering. Similarly, customs reform is proceeding slower than expected. Moreover,
 while progress in public expenditure management is encouraging, significant challenges still persist,
 particularly inbudget preparation, and execution. Nevertheless it is important to note that the governance
 framework in Madagascar remains well above the Sub-Saharan average. Furthermore, the commitment
 shown and the actions taken by the new Government since 2002 are in stark contrast with the previous
 administration's hesitantpace o freforms inthis area.

 59.     The experience accumulated with the first two PRSCs is providing valuable lessons for the
 way forward.         Box 2 provides an overview o f the main lessons learned to date from PRSC
 implementation. As discussed in section I1above, the implementation o f the first two PRSCs took place
 duringyears o f unanticipated adverse macroeconomic shocks. The resulting pressures on the budget in
 both 2004 and 2005 had a clear adverse impact on the implementation o f the two operations as
 Government was faced with the management of difficult events. On the resources side, the revenue
 collection was below expectation and donor aid flows were delayed. The Government had to adjust
 through a curtailment of expenditures, including freeze of commitments in March 2005, a reduction in
 expenditures, and a shortened expenditure cycle. In addition to this overall budgetary constraint, limited
 capacity for budget execution within the sector ministries was manifest and contributed to the execution
 delays observed in most sectors. Budget execution was further complicated with the transition to the
 program budgets without adequate preparation or training o f ministry staff.

60.      As the Government made good progress in implementing the policy and institutional
program, reformstook in general longer to accomplishthan originallyanticipated. The mainreasons
include over-optimism at the design stage, insufficient prioritization of actions, and under-estimationof
the capacity constraints and implementationleadtimes. This was particularly true for measures aimed at
strengtheningthe procurement framework and the accountability and transparency of budget execution.
This situationhas been further exacerbated by the initial lack of understandingofthe PRSC instrumentin
sectors accustomed to investment projects. For example, starting with PRSC Ithe nutrition program
transitionedto budget support, but while to date it has resumed a good level of service delivery, it took
over two years to create a functioning institutional setting and reach an acceptable level of budget
implementation.

61.      Despite these shortcomings budget support remains central to Bank assistance in
Madagascar as it has nonetheless proved an effective instrument in fostering a much more concerted
focus on key issues such as public expendituremanagement and institutional capacity building. The next
CAS will clarify the areas of focus for the next series and will provide the new proposed mix of budget
supportandinvestmentoperationsto support the MAP.

62.      Basedon the data availableto date, the Government's strategy is deliveringresults. Despite
the challenges described, the Government is using its budget in line with its strategic priorities - roads
and education command large shares. These resources are being translated into results on the ground.
More children are in school today than ever before (over 90 percent), and a larger percentage are likely to
completeprimary school. With the implementationof the roads programinrural areas, the percentage of
the rural populationwith reliable access to transport has increasedfrom 46 percent in2003 to 57 percent
in 2005. The condition of the main road network has also improved; in 2004 and 2005, the Road
Maintenance Fund (RMF) contracted for the maintenance of 6,800km and 7,OOOkm respectively. Rice
productivity has increased from 2.3 tonshectare in 2003 to 2.4 tonshectare in 2004, and is now 2.57
tonshectare. This increase is however lower that originally planned6. Access to safe drinking water in
rural areas has also improved with an increase in access from 14 to 16 percent between2004 and 2005.
Immunization rates have remainedstable andmore women give birth inhealthcenters thanbefore. Infant
and child mortality rates have declined'significantly between 1997 and 2003/04, with the child mortality
rate declining from 163.9 to 94 per 1000over this period7.A recent evaluationofthe nutrition program, is
also showing a positive impact of such interventions. Table 8 reviews progress in achieving the key
development objectivesthat were establishedfor the PRSC series at the time of PRSC 1.

  At the time ofPRSC 1preparationthe available2003 figure for the average rice yield was 1.88 tonsha, which led
to set the target outcome for 2006 at 2.4. As the 2003 figure was subsequently revisedto 2.33, the increase in
productivity over time has therefore been lower than originally anticipated.
  Furtherwork i s howeverunder way to validate the actualscale ofimprovementsinchild mortality. While still
remarkable, data revision might leadto a lower improvement.

                                                 PRSC 4

63.     A fourthPRSC is envisaged which would bridge the time-gap betweenthe conclusion of the
first PRSC series (PRSCs 1,2 and 3) and delivery ofthe second PRSC three-year series, which itself
depends onthe finalizationof the MAP.The PRSC-4 will be aligned with the first PRSC series and will
thus continue to support the Government inthe areas o f Governance and Human and Material Security.
Inaddition, itwill proposea newpolicy reformmatrix andresultsframework for the next series aligned
with the MAP and consistent with the strategic support proposed in the new CAS. A number o f core
monitorable actions are proposed as indicative triggers (Table 9) which are aligned to the previous
triggers of the first three PRSCs. For the area o f improving governance they reaffirm Government
commitment for reform particularly in the areas where progress has recently been slower such as in
procurement, customs, decentralization, and anticorruption.         Under human and material security the
proposed triggers maintain the emphasis on ongoing reforms and, in the case o f health, accompany the
Government towards the envisaged SWAP approach for the sector. The Government has also completed
the update o f the PRSC policy and institutional reform matrix (see Annex 1) to identify the key actions
for the next twelve months in line with progress to date and consistent with the original objectives o f the
PRSC program.

64.      PRSC 3 will continue to support the first strategic axis of the PRSP, and consolidate
reforms initiated under PRSC 1,in public finance, anti-corruptionand strengtheningthe judiciary.
Assistance by the Bank will also focus on deepeningreforms in the areas of customs, decentralization,
and capacity building. The reform program is based on strong analytical underpinnings, inparticularthe
2005 PER and the budget notes for 2005 and 2006. The IDA-supported Governance and Institutional
Development Project (PGDI), which became effective in March 2004, is providing technical assistance
for the implementationofthese reforms.

                         A. PUBLICEXPENDITUREMANAGEMENT


65.      In 2005 Madagascar has immersed itselfin important budgetaryreforms by passing a new
budget law that introduced a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Program
Budgeting (PB) at the same time. The reforms aim to improve the macroeconomic stability of the
country and the effectiveness and efficiency of public resource use. Madagascar did make significant
gains in the process, but it also faced several challenges, particularly with regard to coordination and
sequencing of the many reforms that are going on in parallel. These reforms and their implementation
status are summarized in (Table 10) below. They constitute an ambitious and far-reaching reform
program that addresses existing problems and bottlenecks in all important areas of public expenditure
management.

66.    While overall implementationprogressof the reform program is encouraging a number of
key issues continue to pose significant challenges:

0   The fiscal framework (2005-2007) was hastily prepared - delays in the macro framework preparation
    resulted in unilateral cuts by the MEFB o f budget proposals submitted by sector ministries. The
    framework is also not fully aligned with the PRGF macro and fiscal framework. For example, the
    growth rate o f 64 percent for the 2006 budget projections and a drop o f the overall budget envelope
    by 22 percent in 2007 is not supported by a sustainable macroeconomic framework. The 2005
    framework overestimated revenues resulting in revenue shortfalls during the first semester which
    caused significant budget cuts inmid2005.


0   Overall budget execution inparticular o f non salary recurrent and capital expenditures was relatively
    high, reaching 93 percent for non salary recurrent expenditures and 105 percent for investment
    expenditures by the end o f 2005. PRSP priority sectors benefited only partially from the high
    execution rate (55 percent inhealth, 77 percent ineducation, 99 percent intransport). The execution
    rate of HIPC expenditure was 80 percent. Main reasons for the continuing execution problems are (i)
    cumbersome procedures for budget reallocations, (ii)          delays in the nominations o f key spending
    agents, and (iii)
                    revenue shortfalls in the first six months o f the fiscal year resultinginthe freezing o f
    expenditures. Government had to cut on average one fifth (about 22 percent) o f the available budget
    for non salary recurrent and investment expenditures but excluded priority sectors such as health,
    education, agriculture andjustice.

    Though applied in general, sector ministries faced substantial problems in applying the new program
    budget structure (e.g. line item budgets are often not consistent with the program activity they



                                                       26

    intended to support and the new nomenclature is complex resulting in wrong imputations and
    duplications o f codes). Training and capacity buildingneeds at the nationaland sub-national levels of
    government were initially seriously underestimated. The training program set up by the Government
    subsequently addressed some of the major execution problems but further significant investments in
    training and capacity buildingare requiredto fully conceptualize and institutionalizethe new program
    budget structure.


0   Reform coordination remained a key issue in 2005.           The difficulties by sector ministries in
    implementing the new program budget structure forced the MEFB into almost constant crisis
    management with little time for strategic reformmanagement.


0   Efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation yielded little results for the 2005 budget year. Lack of
    clarity regarding monitoring responsibilities among the executing agents (e.g. procedural manuals
    were not adequately distributed to the periphery) as well as a poor selection o f indicators (too
    numerous, often little reliable andwithout benchmarks) constrained the monitoring o f expenditures.

ReformProgram

67.      The Government's 2006 priority action plansustainsthe continuation of public expenditure
reforms by building on the successful implementationof two priority action plans launched since
2004. Followingthe difficulties inthe 2005 programbudget implementation, the 2006 priority actionplan
reflects more interventions neededto ensure a better implementationof the 2006 program budget and the
2007 program budget preparation. Compared to 2005, actions have expandedto include capacity building
and training of sector ministries, a strategic plan to address expenditure arrears and a more transparent
accounting system. The 2006 priority action plan aims to: (i)strengthen reform coordination and
implementation capacity, (ii)  improve the efficiency of budget preparation and execution, (iii)
                                                                                               strengthen
controls and reporting on budget execution, and (iv) improve performance of the fiscal and customs
administration. The 2006 plan also integrates several key recommendations of the PER such as the
development o f a budget framework paper, the improvement of the budget preparation calendar, the
preparation o f budget execution reports and the financial evaluation of state owned enterprises and
communities.

68.      Government's public finance reform agenda is mainly supported by the World Bank
Governanceand InstitutionalDevelopmentProgram(PGDI)and by severalother donors (e.g. IMF,
EU,AfDB, France, and the GTZ). The donor community also signeda partnership agreementto better
coordinate aid and missions. A first joint mission was conducted in October 2005. Following the
benchmarking o f Madagascar's public finance reform program by the Joint Secretariat on Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEFA -Secretariat) in 2005, a first (joint) review
of the PEFA-benchmarks is programmed for May 2006.

69.      The PRSC 3 builds on the reforms started under PRSC 1 and PRSC 2 and continues to
support the Government's public reform program in line with the implementation of the priority
action plan.Progressunder PRSC 3, is presentedbelow and summarized inTable 9 above:

                                                     27

0    Reform coordination in MEFB was further strengthened: the reform coordinator, nominated by the
     MEFB to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the public finance reform, received support
     through the recruitment of an international consultant by the MEFB. To harmonize the support to
     Government and to facilitate reform coordination the Government signed a partnership agreement
     with the donor community. The strategic coordination o f the multiple reforms, however, was
     negatively impactedby the problems arising withthe implementationo fthe programbudget.

(ii)     Enhancing Budget Formulation
0    The 2006 Loi des Finances continues to put emphasis on several key PRSP priority sectors
     (education, agriculture, justice and environment). The education sector takes the largest share of the
     budget (19.3 percent) but its envelope increased only marginally by 0.3 percent between 2005 and
     2006. The second important sector continues to be transport (18.2 percent o fthe total budget), though
     its budget envelope dropped slightly by 0.5 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Whereas the budget
     envelope o f most priority sectors increased in real terms, their share o f the budget, with the exception
     o f environment, declined (all together from 49.5 percent in 2005 to 44.3 percent in 2006), mainly at
     the benefit of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy. Some of the higher allocations of
     resources to both ministries can be attributed to the management o f the Millennium Challenge
     Account (MCA) andthe restructuringo f public electricity company JLRAMA.
0    To rectify problems encountered during the 2005 fiscal year of program budget under PRSC 11, the
     Government set up a task force to assist priority sectors in the preparation o f the 2006 and 2007
     budget. This task force streamlined the program budget for 2006 with a particular focus on a more
     simplified presentation and a better alignment of the program budget with the sector ministries'
     budget. The revised program budget was applied on a pilot-basis to three sector ministries
     (education, transport and public works, and water and sanitation) in their 2006 budget. In 2006, the
     task force intends to expand its assistanceto more sector ministries, particularly on budget execution
     inthe healthandagriculture sectors.
0    For the 2006 budget the MEFB applied a revisedpreparation schedule which aimed at improvingthe
     quality o f the submissions by the line ministries. First attempts were also undertaken to develop a
     budget framework paper with macro-economic projections and a definition of the expected spending
     envelope. It is also envisaged to further strengthen the quality o f the budget preparation process for
     the 2007 budgetpreparation.

(iii)     Strengtheningbudget execution
0    Followingthe increasing dissatisfaction by line ministries with the quality o f the training program for
     the new program budget structure (not customized to the specific needs of the ministries and too
     short), the Government beganto prepare training "support packages" including a pool of international
     consultants that are available for the specific needs of a sector ministry on budget execution and
     planning over a two year period. In 2005 the Ministry o f Education was the first to benefit by
     technical assistance provided by the pool o f consultants. A similar program is beingprepared for the
     health and the transport sectors. A technical team, nominated by MEFB, will assist line ministries to
     overcome budget implementationdifficulties.
0    The Treasury continues to implement the recommendations o f an independent audit conducted in
     2003. In2004/2005 treasury accounts were updated and the final accounts (comptes de gestion) for
     the year 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 have been submitted to the Auditor General. The accounts for
     2004 will be submitted by the end o f June 2006 and the accounts for 2005 in December 2006. The
     Treasury agents benefitedfrom significant training and capacity building(e.g management guidelines
     for the staff were distributedin2005) which contributed to improving its operational effectiveness.
0    In 2005, the integrated financial management system (IFMS) was deployed to six treasuries
     (Antananarivo, Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, and Toliary). Though there are
     some differences in the use of the system across various local and operational units (the fiscal,



                                                      28

    custom, budget and CDE administrationsandthe treasuries agencies), efforts are underwayto address
    the IFMS challenges with aparticularfocus on customs. The introduction ofthe systemhas improved
    timeliness and quality of information. In 2006, the IFMS introduction will be consolidated and
    extendedto other administrations. It is envisaged that by the end of 2006 the CentralBank, some key
    line ministries and big urban centers will be connected to the SIGFP. Additional attention will be
    given to (i) developing standardizedreportingformats for strategic and monitoring purposes and (ii)a
    substantial revision of budget execution procedures by the MEFB and their integration in the new
    system.
    Progress in applying the new ProcurementCode which was adoptedby Parliamentin2004 is mixed:
    (i)thedevelopmentofthestandardbiddingdocuments(SBDs),andoftheimplementingrulesand
    regulations has taken much longer than expected due to difficulties in finding suitable consultants.
    Eventually, drafts of the implementingrules and regulations were deliveredby the consultantAawyer
    in late 2005. A workshop to validate the texts and carry out sensitization training was held in
    Antsirabe in January 2006. Subsequently, draft standard bidding documents have been finalized
    taking into account comments by the Government. SBDs are automatically validated following the
    ratification of procurement rules and regulations by the Cabinet which took place in May 2006.
    Training and capacity building activities for the new procurement regulations are also under way.
    These activities focus on conceptualizingthe new regulatory framework; they intend to pave the way
    for the full application of the regulations. (ii)work on the institutional framework is ongoing. The
    decree establishing the new Procurement Oversight Institution known as A M P (Agence de
    RCgulation des MarchCs Publics) was issued in May 2005. Based on this decree the Government
    began the selection process of the key staff. This process took more time than expectedbecause the
    Government wanted to ensure that the most qualified people were recruited for the respective
    positions. The head and board of directors have been nominatedby the Cabinet in May 2006 along
    with the interim appointment by the minister of Finance of the other directors It is presently
    envisaged that the ARMP (including the Appeals System) is fully operational in June 2006. (iii)
    Activities are under way to strengthen capacity and quality of procurement in line ministries. Every
    ministry has its PRM (procurement responsible person) to whom all procurementmatters have been
    delegated in accordance with the provisions of the Code. Key ministries (education, health,
    agriculture, environment, transport) have put in place procurement management units. They are
    operational andwill be assessedafter a period of one year. The assessment will determine quality and
    level of performance. The establishmentof similar units inother ministries is planned.

(iv)     StrengtheningAccountability
    Progress with regard to the improvement of the internal and external control functions has been
    equally mixed:
0   A General Inspectorate for Finances(IGF) was established in 2004, as the principal controller of the
    Ministry ofFinance, inline with the recommendationso fthe CFAA. Problems indefining the role of
    the IGF vis-a-vis other internal control bodies, inparticularthe InspectionGBnkrale de 1'Etat (IGE),
    continue to delay the beginning of the work of the IGF. Inthe interim phase, the internal control
    function has been ensured by the IGE. In 2005, the Brigade du TrCsor, the internal control
    mechanismofthe Treasury, was transformedto a Directorateto be more independentand sufficiently
    autonomous vis-a-vis the other Treasury services. The Directorate was strengthened by recruiting
    additional staff, by specializedtraining to enhance their accountingcapacities, andby modernizing its
    operations.
0   The oversight function of Parliament has been further strengthened through capacity building and
    training of the Public FinanceCommittee.
0   The Auditor Generalhas cleared the backlog of accounts and examined draft budget execution laws
    ("projet de loi de rbglement") sent by MEFB for the years 1998 until 2003. The 1998 law has been
    examined by Parliament and the draft budget execution laws for 1999 until 2001 have beenvoted by



                                                    29

    Parliament. The Auditor General has also examined the draft budget execution laws for 2002 and
    2003, and these drafts will be submitted by the Government to Parliament during the first session of
    2006. Voting by Parliamentis expected before the end of June 2006. The draft budget execution law
    for 2004 will be sent by MEFB to the Auditor General inJune 2006. It is presently envisagedby the
    Auditor Generalto finalize the examination ofthe draft budget executionlaws for 2004 by September
    2006.

(v)     Results Focus: Introductionof basicperformance management under way.
0   The Government has continued to strengthen the results focus for all ministries and departments.
    Basedon an'evaluationofthe "Politique GCndrale de 1'Etat pour 2005" anew one-year actionplanfor
    2006 ("la Politique GCndrale de 1'Etat pour 2006") has been developed to improve results-focus and
    performance orientation of the administration. This plan is derived from a strategic framework that
    presently consistsof two documents, the PRSP andthe strategic vision for Madagascar ("Madagascar
    Naturellement"). It is envisaged to replace the PRSP with a new 5-year strategic framework that sets
    out the main focus areas for the development o f Madagascar (the MAP). Work has also continuedto
    integratethe differentactivities into a coherent results-basedmanagement framework. Under such a
    system policy-related information is systematically collected at all levels of Government,
    consolidated by a well-functioning mechanism at the Prime Minister's Office and scrutinized for
    potential follow-up.     The system should generate regular reports about the status of the
    implementation of the Government program, which should be sent to the Cabinet for discussionand
    strategic decision-making.

70.     The indicative triggers for the PRSC 3 for public expenditure management include the
satisfactory implementationof the priority action plan for 2005. The overall implementation is
satisfactory as the majorityof the intendedreforms are well underway. The implementation status
of the other public expendituretriggers are as follows:


0   Budgetfor 2006 allocatesadequate resourcesto PRSPpriority sectors. Fully accomplished.
0   Monthly accounts produced by the 15th of the following month in five provincial treasuries and the
    central treasury office where the transitional integrated financial management system (SIGFP) is
    operational. Fully accomplished as execution reports can be produced in real time in the treasuries
    where SIGFP is operational.
0   Implementing rules and regulations as well as Standard Bidding Documents issued. Procurement
    OversightInstitution, procurement entities inthe sector ministries andthe Appeal systemoperational.
    The activity is in progressand almost completed. Implementing rules and regulationssubmitted by
    MEFB for Cabinet approval and StandardBidding Documents(SBD) ready for MEFB adoption. The
    recruitmentfor the personnelfor the ProcurementOversightInstitution (including the Appeal system)
    is almost complete. The General Director and the board have already been nominated. For the other
    director positions, nominations have been made on an interim basis by the Minister of Finance.
    Procurement entities in line ministriesare operational. The final trigger for PRSC 3 has been revised
    accordingly.

ExpectedResults

71,     At the endof the PRSC 3, the expectedresults include:
0   An increase in the number of HIPC AAP benchmarks met from four in 2004 to ten in 2006. The
    HIPC benchmarksare now being replaced by PEFA indicators, therefore assessment of progress in
    2005 was abandoned. The preliminary PEFA report does however assess good progress in budget
    managementbetween2005 and2006.

Budget Formulation:
0  The budget is aligned to the strategic priorities of the PRSP including an increase in budgetary
   allocations to tangible poverty reduction programs. This activity is in progress. As the PRSP is
   beingreplaced by the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) the budget will be aligned with the objectives
   andprioritiesofthe MAP.
0  Budget preparationprocess adjustedto allow for better strategic decisionmakingand implicationof
   the sector ministries, and ensure greater consistency betweenrecurrent and investmentbudgets.This
   has been partially accomplished with a budget calendar which allows for more meaningful
   discussionsbetweenthe MEFBandsector ministries.
0  Preparationprocesses for the recurrent andthe investment budgets alignedand integratedto improve
   consistency o fthe budget. This is outstanding.
0  Budget execution rate increasedfrom 80 percent in 2003 to 90 percent in2006 On track to be Fully
   accomplished as the 2005 execution rate was 93 percent for non salary recurrent expenditures and
   105percentfor investmentexpenditures.

Budget Execution
0  The treasury provides accurate andtimely information.Partially accomplished for the six treasuries
   where the IFMISis fully operational; this representsroughly 80 percentof alltreasury operations.
0  Improvement of the treasury's operational efficiency.        Activity is ongoing based on the
   recommendationso fthe independent audit ofthe Treasury in2003.
0  Treasury produces monthly accounts by the 15thof the following month. Accomplished for the six
   treasuries where the LFMIS i s fully operational.
0  Treasury submits quarterly accounts no later than four weeks after the close of the previous month.
   Not yet accomplished as this requires a further improvement of the informationexchange between
   the capitalandthe periphery.
0  Treasury submits final accounts within the statutory timeframe to the Auditor General. Not yet
   accomplished.The submission is however envisagedwithinthe statutory timeframe.

Procurement
0  New ProcurementCode in line with internationalstandards. Fully accomplished.New Procurement
   Code passedby Parliament inJuly 2004. Applicationdecreesand SBDs are almost complete.
0  Institutionalframework put in place. In progress with establishment of ARMP and some sectoral
   procurementunits.
0  Adequate capacity to implement new procurement regulations exists. In progress, with
   commencementofthe capacitybuildingprogram.

StrengtheningAccountability
0  Internal and external control functions (IGF, Brigade du TrCsor, Auditeur General) significantly
   strengthened. In progress as the efficiency of the Brigade du TrCsor and the Auditor General has
   significantly improved. At the same time, role andfunctions of IGF/IGEremainunclear. Inaddition,
   the commitmentcontrol(CDE) remainsdysfunctional;an audit ofthe CDEis plannedfor 2006.

Accountability and transparency of budget execution
0  Monitoring of budget execution by the administration and the Cabinet has improved. Not yet

    backlog o f audited accounts.


                                    B. FIGHTINGCORRUPTION

72.     Progress in the fight against corruption has been mixed. The 2004 WBI governance
indicators continue to confirm that Madagascar is well above Sub-Saharan African average in all
examined areas and in particular in the control o f corruption, regulatory quality as well as voice and
accountability. At the same time, progress is slower than expected as confirmed by the Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index of 2005: Madagascar was ranked 97th out o f 158 countries (its
previous rankings were no. 82 out of 145 in 2004, no. 88 out o f 133 in 2003 and no. 98 out of 102 in
2002). It seems that the governancereforms initiatedby the Government needtime to consolidate despite
continuedhighexpectations by the citizenry and the development partners. The Government continues to
emphasize that corruption is one o f the main reasons for the lack o f progress in the socio-economic
development of the country. The key issues include:
0   Pervasive corruption in a number of sectors (Le. mining,judiciary, forestry) and public services (i.e.
    customs, medical services, traffic police), which severely affects overall efficiency and delivery of
    services.
0   Problems with conflict-of-interest o f public and elected officials.
0   The lack of ethical standards inthe public services with widespread non-application of formal rules
    andregulations by public servants.
0   Informal and/or corrupt behavior remains by-and-large unpunished.

ReformProgram

73.     Reforms started under PRSC 1 and 2 have been deepened and extended, with important
improvements in the public awareness about causes and incidence of corruption. The Anti-
corruption Commission (Conseil SupBrieur de Lutte Contre la corruption, CSLCC), which was
established in 2002 to raise awareness about corruption and co-ordinate all governance and anti-
corruption efforts, focused its activities in 2005 mainly on a public information campaign to address
corruption ingovernment services and on the preparation of the independent anti-corruption survey which
i s being implemented with support from WBI.          The preliminary results from this survey confirm
widespread corruption inthe above mentioned services but also indicate a somewhat declining interest in
corruption issues. This is mainly due to preoccupation with the economic situation which is considered by
the population the most important issue that should be addressed by Government. The survey also
indicates significant regional differences in the incidence o f corruption. It is envisaged to publish the
results of the survey widely (in June 2006) and to initiate a comprehensive debate about the findings of
the survey. InMarch2006, the mandateofthe Anti-Corruption Commission was enhancedto include the
development o f a national integrity framework; the Commission was transformed into the national
Integrity Committee (ComitB pour la Sauvegarde de l'IntBgrit8). The implementation o f the revised
regulations for the declaration o f assets by public and elected officials is progressing reasonably well. In
2005, the majority o f the administrative andjustice personnel submitted the requested declaration which
constitutes a major improvement over 2004. At the same time, the compliance rate remains weak insome
key areas (e.g. police, memberso f Parliament, mayors). The new law regulatingpolitical parties and their
financing that was submitted to Parliament in 2005 is stalled, mainly due to the unwillingness o f the
political establishment to restrict party financing in the run-up to the general elections. A decree to
regulate recruitment into the public sector was approved in 2005. A legal framework governing access to



                                                     32

information is being prepared. It is envisaged to develop an application decree specifying the rules and
regulations concerning conflict-of-interest issues in2006.

74.      The key instrument to fight corruption, the independent Anti-CorruptionAgency (Bureau
IndCpendant Anti-Corruption, BIANCO) became operational in October 2004. Since its inception
BIANCO has focused on three areas (i) examination o f corruption complaints (the office has received
                                          the
7492 complaints in 2005, the majority o f which deal with the police, the judiciary, land titling and
forestry. Based on the BIANCO investigations 214 people were arrested), (ii)          prevention, in particular
training and sensitization o f public servants o f the police, tax administration, health, education and land
titling services. In this context, BIANCO has also provided support to manage several recruitment
processes into the public sector; and (iii)further investigation. This includes the implementation o f
independent audits of public services (in2005, the audit for the land titling service as well as independent
procurement reviews for the transport program and for the education-for-all program were completed;
discussions are under way with the respective sectors to address the findings and recommendations o f the
audit reports). Additional audits are planned for 2006 for the forestry and miningsectors.

75.      Moving ahead, in 2006, the government intends to introduce the concept of labeling of
public services ("clean"/ "not clean"), to pilot citizens' report cards for suitable public services, to
address corruption inthejudiciary as well as to strengthen the activities inthe area o f `grand corruption'.

Expectedresults

76.      The main results at the end of PRSC 3, and their current status, include:
0    Adopt sectoral anti-corruption strategies and begin implementation- this activity is under way: a
     general anti-corruption strategy has been validated which includes the establishment o f an
     independent anti-corruption agency (BIANCO). Sectoral strategies have been developed to
     complement these activities.
0    The regulatory framework for the fight against corruption improved - this activity i s under way; a
     new anti-corruption and money laundering legislation has already been passed; next steps include
     regulations concerning conflict-of-interest and the financing o f political parties
0    Independent audits and evaluations have been commissioned to address corruption in targeted
     sectors/public services -this activity is underway.
0    An anti-corruption survey confirms a reduction o f corruption inMadagascar -this activity is under
     way. A baseline survey will be published shortly; it is envisaged to review the prevalence o f
     corruption every two years.


                                                C. JUSTICE

77.      While the Government continues to emphasize the importance of judicial reforms as a
criticalelement of its overall governancestrategy overall reform progress has beenextremelyslow.
Main reasons include a lack o f a consistent implementation strategy for legal andjudicial reforms as well
as lack o f funding to implement more comprehensive reforms. To support justice reforms the European
Union is preparing a 5-year program with an overall envelope o f EUR 25m. The main issues that would
need to be addressed inthejudiciary include:
0    Lack of credibility of the judiciary The credibility o f the judiciary has been seriously undermined
     by widespread corruption and inefficiencies. The new anti-corruption survey confirms that the
     judiciary is considered one o f the most corrupt services. The Government put under investigation a
     number ofmagistrates because o fcorruption charges; some o fthem have been sanctioned.
0    Low performanceof the judiciary: This is due to procedural and institutional inefficiencies as well
     as lack o f performance orientation o f the existing staff. This problem affects all areas o f the judiciary


                                                       33

    and has ledto a significant backlog o f cases, inparticular at the lower courts. A key reasonis the lack
    of service standards and evaluation methods to examine judicial work. In many areas the case load
    handled by magistrates and other personnel is not in line with international standards. In areas that
    require specialization such as commercialproceedingsnot enough trained magistrates are available to
    deal with existing cases.
0   Human rights concerns. There are also serious concerns about the conditions in the prisons and
    about the rights o f the accused. International organizations working in this area consider the prison
    conditions in Madagascar among the worst inthe world. It is presently estimated that about 14,000
    prisoners are awaiting trail and prosecution. The regulatory framework for temporary detention of
    people under criminal investigation is not in line with international human rights standards as it does
    not limit the time a prisoner can be held in detention. A new law with new standards for temporary
    detention is being prepared and is expectedto be approved by Parliament inlate 2006.

ReformProgram

78.     As noted in previous PRSC documents, the Governmenthas identifiedfive broad priority
areas which form the basis for its reform strategy: (i)         fight against corruption, (ii)expedition of
proceedings, (iii)reform o f business laws, (iv) rehabilitation o f court and prison infrastructure, and (v)
humanization of detention facilities. The reforms intend to further deepen previous reforms and to
consolidate the achievements, in particular in the areas of training, capacity building and codification of
texts and regulations. The needs of the private sector are a major consideration in the legal and judicial
reform strategy.

79.     The implementationof this strategy is severely hampered by budgetary constraints; after
2005 the year 2006 is the second year that has seen a net reduction of the (already low) recurrent
budget of the Ministry of Justice which raises concerns about feasibility and sustainability o f the
government strategy. The Government intendsto increase funding for thejudiciary inthe revised budget
law 2006 whichwill be presentedto Parliament inthe thirdquarter o fthe year 2006.

80.     PRSC 1 and 2 supported the development of the reform strategy which would form the
basis for the implementationof the reform program. The implementationof this strategy has seen
mixed resultsin2005/2006. To address deficiencies at the level o fthe commercial sections o fthe courts
a number o f magistrates were trained in commercial proceedings. The Ministry has also continued the
work to establish "model courts" inAntananarivo and Ambatolampy which would serve as a reference for
the reform o f other jurisdictions.  The program to reduce the existing backlog o f cases which was
successfully completed in the capital Antananarivo has been expanded to other jurisdictions o f the
country (Fianarantsoa, Tamatave, Antsiranana). Since the inception of this program more than 41,000
pending cases were processed. The extension of the program to three additional jurisdictions
(Ambatondrazaka, Farafangana, Toliary) is planned for 2006.

81.     The introduction of service standards, however, which is seen as a key instrument to
improve individual performanceand the performance of the jurisdiction has made little progress.
The service standards for the lower courts that were developed in 2005 are still awaiting validation.
Standards for the higher courts are still outstanding. Key problems include difficulties to conceptualize
service standards, resistance inthejudiciary as well as lack o f reliable statistical data which could serve as
the basis to systematically monitor and evaluate performance. It is presently envisaged to introduce the
new standards on a pilot basis in two jurisdictions (TPI Antananarivo, Ambatolampy) before June 2006.
In addition, the technical assistance provided to improve internal control of the Ministry of Justice has
yielded very little results. An area o f concern remains the fight against corruption in the judiciary: the
anti-corruption survey confirms the continued prevalence o f corruption; the disciplinary commission in



                                                     34

the Ministry o f Justice has not been able to effectively address this issue and to improve ethical standards
inthejudiciary. Efforts to revampthe commission (to make it more effective) appear to be stalled.

ExpectedResults:

82.     The expectedresults at the endofPRSC 3 andtheir current status include:
    Backlog o f pendingcourt decisions reduced-this activity is inprogress.The year 200415 has seen a
    net reduction o f the backlogo f cases of more than 41,000 inthe targeted courts. The program i s being
    expanded to otherjurisdictions.
    Significant increase of outputs inthejudicial systemwith the introduction of service standards -this
    activity is in progress. Pilot introduction of service standardsintwo lower courts is planned for June
    2006.
    Reduction o f corruption as confirmed by an independent anti-corruption survey - not accomplished
    yet. Anti-corruption survey confirms continued prevalence of corruption.
    Establish financial and administrative tribunals in the provinces - Fully accomplished. Tribunals
    exist inall six provinces since June 2005.


                                              D. CUSTOMS

83.     Despite some progress in 2005/2006 customs reforms is still lagging behind expectations.
Key problems include revenue generation -still significantly below projections- as well as the perception
that corruption has not yet been effectively iiddressed. In addition, service standards (i.e. time for the
clearance of shipments) are not systematically enforced.


ReformProgram

84.     There has been some progress in the functioning of customs since July 2005. A customs
strategy and action plan designed to improve revenue generation, introduce service standards and reduce
corruption, was adopted in June 2005. To monitor the implementation of the strategy a coordination
mechanism (cellule de suivi) was put in place in 2005. A long-term technical advisor from the World
Customs Union will be hired in 2006 to support the coordination of the reform program. The following
reforms have been undertaken: The tariff system was simplified with the merger of the customs and
import duty in the 2005 Loi des Finances. The customs regulations were modernized, including the
elimination o f the customs duties credit (crddit de droit); institutingmandatory payments o f the customs
duties through the banking system since April 2005; and abolishing the immunity of customs agents from
enquiries and prosecution. The customs administration is also expanding the coverage o f its automated
data processing system (SYDONIA) to improve operational efficiency. The new system has been
installed in all main customs offices, in particular in Tamatave and in Antananarivo. A roll-out to
additional customs offices is planned for 2006. Pre-shipment inspection continues to be done by the
private company SGS. A pre-shipment inspection report is now requiredfor customs clearance and a
system of valuation of imports based on the PSI company's (rather than customs) valuation has been in
put in place.      Government is also introducing a comprehensive customs management system
(TRADENET) which is expected to be operational in the main port Tamatave in September 2006.
According to statistics produced by the customs service the time for customs clearance of containers has
been reduced from an average o f 10 days in 2002 to 48 hours in 2004 in the main customs office in
Tamatave. To address corruption more effectively, the customs directorate is working closely with the
Anti-Corruption Agency (BIANCO) with activities focusing primarily on training, sensitization, as well
as applicationo f administrative sanctions (i.e. regular rotation o f customs agents). These measures have
had a positive impact in increased customs receipts and there has been a notable increase of satisfaction


                                                      35

among private sector operators. B U N C O is also involved in monitoring the recruitment process into the
customs administration. The agency is presently reviewing the asset declarations submittedby customs
officials. In 2005, 10 customs agents were suspended because o f fraud and corruption charges, an
additional 20 agents are under investigation. Under the Loi des Finance 2006, the Government has further
simplified the tariff structure, with three non-zero rates of 5, 10 and 20 percent, and an un-weighted
average rate of 13.6 percent. The Government is also addressing tax administration weaknesses and
efforts are ongoing to broaden the tax base. A major area of focus is currently on clearing its existing
arrears on VAT refunds and improvingthe system o fVAT refunds in2006 and beyond.

85.       At the same time, revenue generation by the customs directorate remains fragile. In 2005
customs was able to generate innominal terms 86.5 percent of the revenues projected inthe budget -this
performance is significantly better than in 2004 but still below expectations. The customs directorate
generated 86.2 percent of projected revenues in January 2006 and 91.2 percent in February 2006. Main
reasons include stagnating imports, the implications of the changes of the customs tariffs, and continuing
governance problems inthe customs directorate. To address existing problems the Government intendsto
further streamline customs operations as well as to intensify the collaborationwith the pre-shipment agent
and the port authorities. It is also envisaged to shift the authority to exemptions from the Minister of
Finance to the Cabinet.

86.       The implementationstatus ofthe trigger for the PRSC 3 is as follows:
0    Implementsatisfactorily the customs reform action plan, in particular consolidate the introduction of
     Sydonia  ++and   extend the system to the customs office inAntananarivo. Fully accomplished as the
     new system i s fully operational inTamatave and Antananarivo.

ExpectedResults:

87.       The expected results at the end ofPRSC 3 andtheir current status include:
0    Overall quality o f customs services improved, more revenue generated, and corruption reduced. Not
     accomplished yet as revenues are still weak and governance issues continue to negatively impact
     customs performance.


                                       E. DECENTRALIZATION

88.       In2005, the Governmentcontinuedto strengthenthe new regionswhichwere establishedin
2004 and have become (togetherwith the communes) the second operational levelbelow the central
government. The main functions o f the regions are to facilitate commune development and to represent
the central government. The legal framework for the regions also stipulates that the de-concentrated
services of the central government report to the regional chiefs. The implementation o f these regulations
is uneven with significant regional differences. Major problems include the relationship between line
ministries, their de-concentrated services, regions and communes as well as the lack o f resources at the
regionaland communal levels. In2005 most regions prepared Regional Development Plans.

89.       Public finances in Madagascar are heavily centralized with about 95% of revenues and
expenditures managed by central authorities.Financial capacities at the communal and regional levels
are constrained by insufficient and poorly targeted transfers and a regulatory framework that leaves the
collection o f most local revenues inthe hands o f inefficient deconcentrated state agents. Comparedto the
2005 budget, the increase o f allocation to the communes is small with an overall increase o f only 3.7%,
reaching 29 billionAriary. This modest increase is due to the fact that the Government also has to ensure
some transfers to the regions. However, a significant step has been made because the budget foresees for
the first time allocations (4bn Ar) to the new Local Development Fund (FDL) which is expected to be


                                                     36

operationalin late 2006. The Governmentconsiders the FDL as the principle instrumentto channel funds
to the sub-nationallevels. The main objective of the FDL is to integrate supportto the communes bothby
the Government and the donor community under a single mechanism and with harmonized procedural
and institutional arrangements. Inparallel the Government wants to strengthen the resources base at the
commune level, inparticular by improving revenue collection.

90.     The Governmentis addressingthe existingshortcomingsthrough four major interventions:
(i)preparinga local governmentfinance law (loi sur la fiscaliti) that would regulate sources and modality
of funding of regions and communes including the transfer system and formula; (ii)scaling up of pilot
experiences with decentralized tax collection; (iii)establishing the FDL to provide block-grants to
communes for local investments and capacity building and (iv) reinforcing communal capacities and
create synergies between communes by supporting the creation of inter-communal associations and
regional training andresource centers.     .

91.     The implementation status of the trigger for the PRSC3 is as follows:
0   Increase resource allocation to the communes. Fully accomplished. However, allocations to the
    communes increasedonly modestly inthe 2006 budget. Another key issue remainsthe actualtransfer
    which in2005 was significantly below the budgetary allocations.

ExpectedResults:

92.     The expectedresults at the end of PRSC 3 andtheir current status include:
0   Resource allocation to the communes increased by at least 20% - this activity has not been
    accomplished.
0   Capacity of the communes to deliver services strengthened. This activity is under way and is
    expectedto be supportedthroughthe FDLand the new local government finance law.


                           F. TRAININGANDCAPACITY BUILDING

93,     The implementation of the governance reform program continues to require substantial
investments in training and capacity building, in particular in the areas of public financial
management, planning, change management and monitoringand evaluation. In collaboration with
the World Bank, the Government is implementing an innovative capacity building and change
management strategy that consistsofthe following elements:


0   Cabinet retreats focus on better defining the overall vision and implementationstrategy. In
    2004, the first retreat took place with participants from all over the world who commented on the
    Government strategy, as well as shared experiences and best practice. The results from these events
    were used to refine the Government program. The second retreat focused on improving service
    delivery. A third retreat, held inMay 2005, was designedto foster cross-sectoralcollaborationwithin
    the government ministries, and included a focus on using a rapid results initiative to improve
    implementation (see below). Another retreat is planned for May 2006 and will focus on the
    implementationof the new Madagascar Action Plan.
0   Leadership training for the senior management level within government is aimed at
    strengthening consistency and cohesion of the core government leadership team (President,
    Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Ministers and Permanent Secretaries) as well as to strengthen
    their ability to manage and direct rapid change. Complementary leadership training has focused on
    enhancingthe capacity of the Regional Chiefs. In2006, additional training is programmedto assist
    senior government officials in implementing complex changes. This program will be directed by a




                                                    37

   change management team which is led by Prof. Dean Williams, a leadership expert from Harvard
   University.
   Additionalcapacity buildingactivities will target the middlemanagementinthe public sector to
   improve overall performance orientation and the link between political decision making and
   administrative implementation. The basis for the training will be the results framework developed by
   the Presidency (`Politique GBnBralede 1'Etat').
   To improve cross-sectoral collaborationand the focus on tangible results the Government has
   decided to extendthe applicationofthe "rapid results" approachto other areas, in particularin
   the health sector. A first exercise, launched in early 2005, focused on the production, importation
   and distribution of rice. Cross-sectoral teams were created who worked out `rapid results action
   plans'.  The results o f this work are encouraging as the methodology has proven effective to
   overcome the existing administrative bottlenecks and the lack of coordination within the Malagasy
   administration. As a consequence, the Government intends to apply this methodology in other high
   priority areas, inparticular inthe health sector. The government teams will continue to be supported
   by internationalexperts for the `rapid results' methodology.
   To better institutionalizethe significant changes in the area of public finance a comprehensive
   support package has beendeveloped to support the bigspendingministries. This packagehas been
   developed by a task force which was set up by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget
   (MEFB) in2005 to organize professional training for the public finance personnel at the central and
   deconcentrated levels o f Government. The package comprises initial training in the context of the
   introduction of public finance reforms, coaching and change management support to institutionalize
   the new rules into the existing business process as well as institutional development support to
   strengthen the capacity of the relevant directorates inthe line ministries. The Ministry o f Education
   has pilotedthis approach which is beingrolled out to other priority ministries (e.g. health, transport).
   In parallel the Government continues to strengthen quality and effectiveness of local training
   institutions, in particular in high priority areas such as development planning, public financial
   management and monitoring and evaluation. The two professional training institutions for the public
   sector (Centre National de Formation Administrative,             CNFA,     and Ecole Nationale de
   1'Administration Malgache, ENAM) have received substantive support to modernize their curricula
   and equipment as well as to improve quality and quantity of their trainers. The Government intendsto
   establish a NationalLeadership Institute to provide high-quality training for future senior managers in
   the public andthe private sectors. The Institute is expected to be operational inJune 2006.

ExpectedResults:

94.    The expectedresults at the endo fPRSC 3 andtheir current status include:
0  Effectiveness of the Government leadership team enhanced; consistency between political decision
   making and administrative implementation improved - this activity has been partially achieved;
   additional activities are planned for 2006 and2007.
0  Capacity incritical areas incore government services strengthened -training and capacity buildingis
   ongoing in the areas of public financial management, development planning, change management
   and monitoring and evaluation.
0  Capacity and quality o f local training institutions improved-this activity i s ongoing; it is anticipated
   that capacity and quality o fENAMand CNFA will be significantly strengthenedby the end of 2006.


               PROVIDINGHUMANAND MATERIAL SECURITY

95.    The three PRSCs will support the third strategic axis of the PRSP on human development
through a sequencedand gradual process. PRSC 1supported the implementation o fthe Government's

Education for All (EFA) program and improved service delivery in nutrition. PRSC 2 has deepened the
engagement by supporting policy and institutional reforms in health, rural water supply and social
protection. PRSC 3 continues to consolidate the reforms started under the previous two operations.


                                                     A. EDUCATION

96.      Basic education is an important priority of the Government and has recently received
additionalgrant financing from the multi-donor EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund. The PRSP commits the
government to allocating 25 percent o f the domestic budget to education. In 2003, the Government
prepared a Strategic Plan for the Reform and Development o f the Education Sector along with a detailed
plan o f action for Education for All (EFA), which covers the first nine grades of school (called
"Education Fondamentale"), with concrete proposals for achieving the target of universal completion of
the primary cycle (grades 1-5). Followinglocal donors' endorsementofthe updatedEFA National Action
Plan in April 2005, the Steering Committee of the EFA-Fast Track Initiative (FTI) secretariat agreed to
provide interim grants from the Catalytic Fundto bridgethe financing gaps for three years on a multiyear
additional fund for Madagascar (US$lO million for 2005, US$25 million for 2006 and US$25 million
2007). These additional grants are provided on the understanding that government will continue to
increase its budgetary allocations to through the EFA catalytic funds to primary education (using own
resources and aid from budgetary support programs/HIPC funds) and are not meant to substitutefor them.

97.      Primary completion rates have improved but an important proportionof children do not
complete yet the primary cycle. Since the suppression of school fees in2002, the Net Enrollment Rate
registered an increase of 16 points, shifting for 82% to 98% between 2002/2003 to 2004/20058. The
surge o fenrolments in2002-03 associatedwith this has now stabilized; new intakes into class 1 decreased
around 9% between 200415 and 2005/6. Efforts have beendeveloped in order to reduce the repetition rate
from 30% in 2002 to 19% in 2005 and positive impacts are expected on the student retention rate. The
Primary Completion Rate (PCR) improved significantly from about 30% in 2002 to 60% in 2005(which
means that 40% of children inprimary school do not yet complete the primary cycle).

98.      A major issue remains the poor quality of primary education and this will take concerted
action on a number of fronts over several years to show results. According to the results from the
PASEC test in2003/04 students registered lower scores incomparison to 1997/08, inparticular inFrench
and in general for grade 5. The decline in the repetition rate is largely the result of administrative
measures on the suppression o f repetitions in CP and in CM1. As a result of the huge increase in student
enrollment, despite the high number o f new teachers (about 2,000 per year) the pupil-teacher ratio
stagnates around 60. Although recruitments o f regular teachers are on track, redeployment and
recruitments in remote areas remain a challenge. As o f end October 2005, out o f the 7,500 FRAM
teachers' posts, only 5,800 have been trained and recruited. The provision o f school grants and student
learning materials are still facing some delays due to difficulties in budget execution; school budget as
well as school supplies are not deliveredtimely at the beginningo f the school year. The objective of one
textbook per student per subject is not yet met

99.        Concerns also persist on the shortfallin construction of additionalclassroomsfor primary
schools. The target of building2,000 classroomsper year is not yet met: Only 375 classrooms were built


* The2004 Household surveys (EPMs) showed an increase o f 14 points o f the NER for the same period; from 72% in2002/2003
to 86% in2004/2005. Differences between both sources are noted because MENRS' calculations are based on projections from
the 1993 population census, while EPMs figures are from direct calculation from household data. Nonetheless, the significant
increase o fthe NERduring the period is valid.




                                                           39

in 2004 and 885 in 2005. Long delays in classroom installation are the main reason for the shortfall;
against a target o f 1,400, only 823 have been completed. Moreover, quality issues have also been raised.
Delays inthe execution of some externally assistedprojects have also slowed down constructionactivity.
Apart from the shortfalls inphysical progress, concerns were raised inthe April 2006 joint donor review
of EFA implementation about the adequacy of financial management procedures to oversee such a large
construction program. The Ministry is however fully committed to address the situation and, under its
leadership, has proposed, to carry out a full financial andtechnical audit of its constructionprogram.

Reform Program

 100.    The Ministry has carried forward its reform program for primary education and begun
elaborating a strategy for post-primary education. A major achievement inmanagingthe program is
donor alignment around the EFA plan, the creation o f structures within the Ministry to provide leadership
to EFA implementation and manage the additional funds for EFA, the institutionalization of a process of
joint donor reviews conducted bi-annually and government leadership both for the plan and for donor
coordination. The World Bank has provided leadership for initiating and sustaining these processes,
including the supervision of the Catalytic Fund grant. The MENRS is initiating a process in order to
develop a strategy for post primary education and technical assistance is provided mainly by the World
Bank.

 101.     The April 2006 joint Government EFA review noted major progress on areas of concern
identified by the previous year's review. The review positively endorsed Government progress, further
confirming the mid-term review o f November 2005. Teaching conditions are improving with the
implementation o f the 2005'06 teachers recruitment plan, the increase of FRAM teacher remunerations
and the arrangements for a closer teacher-salary payment mechanism. On quality, many actions are
underway, namely the introduction o f bilingual textbooks, the launching o f a competitive grants program
to develop local initiatives, the introduction of innovative supports to teachers such as distance learning
and the creation of resources centers. Efforts have been made to rationalize the human resources
management and about 2,000 posts are being reutilized by the MENRS. Measures to improve the
education system management are being implemented as the creation of the regional directorates with
increased responsibilities for the implementation o f key activities faced delays duringthe year 2005. At
the central level better management is observed with the Steering committee and the Technical
Management Unit for the EFA, which work closely with the district level. Appropriate management tools
such as annual and comprehensive workplans are developed at all levels o f the education system and
better donor coordination is observed inpractical terms.

 102.    Looking forward the EFA Review identified areas where further efforts are needed: (i)
endorse the ministry proposal to undertake a financial and technical audit of the government financed
primary classroom construction program             (ii)produce an action plan to enhance national
classroodschool capacity and which would refer to the recommendations provided by the January 2005
construction study, that would be prior conditions to include construction expenditures in the 2006 and
2007 Madagascar additional grants from the FTIcatalytic fund, (iii) the progress made on solving
                                                                       pursue
the problem of "postes budg6taires", (iv) evaluate options regarding linguistic policy, (v) improve budget
preparation, presentation and reporting for 2006 and using effectively related budget management tools
(cash flow and procurement plans), (vi) agree with the MFB on a global waiver to commit more than 40
percent of the allocated amount for specific budget items and (vii) improve the training program
particularly for `in service' training for FRAMteachers. The FTIprocess has enabled the MENRS in its
role o f donors' coordinator. For the implementation o f the EFA Plan, the "Unit6 d'Appui Technique -
UAT" has been created inside the MENRS and it will managethe domestic and external additional funds
for the EFA plan.

103.     The status o fthe education trigger for the PRSC 3 is as follows:
e   The implementation of the EFA remains on track as assessed by the joint donor reviews of
    November 2005 and April 2006. The next review is scheduled for November 2006. The Trigger is
    fulfilled.

ExpectedResults

104.     As noted above, there has been significant increase in enrolments and quality is also
improving, but some of the other expected results have not yet been fully achieved. However, as
assessedby the April 2006joint Donor assessment, the expectedresults for the EFA plan, which underpin
those of this PRSC series, are likely to be achieved and Madagascar has already been granted additional
financing from the FTICatalytic Fundfor 2005,2006 and 2007.

                                              B.       NUTRITION

105.     Ongoing nutritioninterventions show that successfulreductionof malnutritionrates among
young children is possible in Madagascar. An impact-evaluation of the community-based nutrition
program, which is implemented in 62 districts, demonstrates a 10%-point reduction in underweight
malnutrition in the poorest areas of Madagascar where the program intervenes for at least two years.
Despite this reduction, national level malnutrition rates remain high and more is needed, especially to
reduce chronic malnutrition rates, or stunting. Decreasing stunting takes long-term commitment and
intensified attention towards pregnant women in order to reduce low birth weight.            Impressive
improvementshave beenmade concerningexclusive breastfeedingof children under six months (from 43
percent in 1997 to 67 percent in 2003/04 based on the DHS) and Vitamin A supplementation among
children under five (from 4 percentto 76 percent over the same period). However, iron-deficiency anemia
among young children remains very high, with more than two-thirds of children under the age of five
suffering from anemia. In addition, seasonal short-term hunger among school-aged children has been



                                                         41

highlightedas a major impedimentto learning. Deworming o f school-aged children and supplementation
with iron to the same age-group has been successfully carried out inthe last 5 years in Madagascar, but
again inthis area, more remains to be done.

106.    In recent years efforts are madeto improvethe quality of nutritionservices, the integration
of basic health services at the community-level, and to strengthen the referral system for severely
malnourished children, but more attention is required to address the remaining challenges          - iron
deficiency anemia among young children, seasonal hunger, systematic nutrition surveillance, the
nutritional status o f pregnant women and the collaboration with the health sector. Improving quality and
extension o f services to the national level is neededto attain the MDGfor nutrition in2015.

107.    The reversal of the negative trends and improvements in the nutrition situation in
Madagascar are the results of years of Government investment in community based nutrition
activities, improved quality of nutrition services, and more recently the strengthened capacity to
develop policies as well as increased attention to institutionalizationof nutrition and allocationof
budget for nutrition services. However, further progress is needed to consolidate capacity and
coordinate within the key-sectors, such as health and agriculture. The recently created National Nutrition
Office (ONN) should take on these extra efforts and should be encouragedto continue the use of existing
implementation capacity in Madagascar, particularly the executing unit SEECALINE, the former
implementing agency o f the community based nutrition programs. More work needs to be done to
consolidate the institutional set up of Nutrition, such as the further integration o f SEECALINE in the
ONN, guidelines on the collaboration with the other sectors and - most o f all - getting the National
NutritionCouncil operational, as it was officially createdtogether with the ONN, but is not functional yet,
while the final definition o f its role, responsibility and constitution has been postponed at several
occasions.

ReformProgram

108.     The Governmentis committed to continuing the reductionof malnutritionas evidenced by
the adoption of the first NationalNutrition Policy in April of 2004 under PRSC 1and the creation
of the NationalCouncilfor Malnutrition (CNN) and its secretariat, the Office Nationalde Nutrition
(ONN) in November 2004 to lead the implementationo f the Nutrition Policy and programs. A National
Nutrition Action Plan was developed and validated in March 2005 and is being implemented. The
Government o f Madagascar and Parliament also demonstrated a political commitment by approving
increased budget-allocations for nutrition programs in 2005. On the other hand, the Council is not
functional yet, while the 2005 budget for Nutritionwas only made available at the end o f the year, which
created major implementation issues. Furthermore, the 2006 budget has been severely reduced, which
may lead to significant problems not only with the implementation o f projected extension of the number
of nutrition sites inpoor districts, but also to maintainthe current school and community basedactivities.

109.     Locallevelsupport is strongly committed to maintainingthe nutritionprogramand there is
high demand for extension. Despite financial delays o f more than 8 months in2004 and 2005 the field
based activities o f the program continued to function due to a high local commitment (beneficiary-
communities, NGOs and local government). Maintaining current efforts and extending efforts to more
communities are crucial to ensure the attainment o f the MDG for nutrition. At present the 3600 sites
continue to function and an additional 1800 community sites would be functional by the end of 2006. All
sites will progressively adopt the new approach which decentralizes implementation responsibility to the
local government level with supervision o f quality still maintainedby the central level.

110.     The comprehensive school nutrition and health program is reaching almost 2 million
school-aged children in the program areas and will maintain current interventions. Projected


                                                      42

extensions have been cancelled due to budget cuts. Efforts to provide seasonal school-feedingprograms
to address the short-term hunger problem during the lean period in food-insecure areas continue. More
work is neededto developa comprehensiveSchoolHealth andNutrition Policy.

111.     The integrationof the implementingagency SEECALINE into the ONN and the pilotingof
the new approach (decentralized responsibility to local government) in 22 communes are both in
process. The ONN has integrated SEECALINE as its operational branch which is mandated with the
implementation of the community-nutrition program, but the process is not yet totally finalized. Many
institutional issues remain unclear while the whole set up needs further reflections and political
commitment in final decision making. For example, it remains to be clarified how SEECALINE staff
will be absorbed into the ONN structure once the projectwill close. Progress has also beenmade with the
preparationofthe pilot of the new approachofthe community-basednutrition program, the PNNC, in22
communes and 110 sites. The communes have been selected and awareness about the program is created,
the NGOs (first-line implementers) have been selected and contracted to start interventions when
financing will be made available (estimated aroundJuly 2006) inJuly 2006. Training manuals have been
developed and training of trainers and implementers is ongoing. The actual activities in the pilot sites
were delayed due to the lack of financing in early 2005. The pilot will be closely supervised and
evaluatedfor possiblefurther extension.

ExpectedResults

112.     The mainexpected resultsat the end ofPRSC3 and their currentstatus is:
0   The main overall outcome is a reduction in the child underweight rate of 20 percent between 2004
    and 2007, basedon the results of anthropometricsurveys (2004 & 2007/8). The available information
    suggests that there is progresstowards meetingthe objective.
0   In addition, the institutionalization of nutrition and the implementationof the National Community
    NutritionProgramwould lead to sustainedcommitment and investment innutrition for the longterm
    at the national, regional and commune level (integration of nutrition indicators in the Regional and
    CommuneDevelopmentPlans).

                                              C.        HEALTH

113.     The sector continues to make steady progress in improving access to and quality of
maternaland child healthservices. Despite changes inorganization andpersonnel within the M O H and
insufficient medical specialists and paramedical staff, the sector retains its focus on reform to improve
governance and service delivery, and to reduce the vulnerability of poor households to health risks.
Coverage of high impact interventions such as immunization, vitamin A supplementation and
impregnated bed-net distribution is expanding along with efforts to further improve the quality and access
to health care at primary and first level referral facilities and the promotion o f health insurance schemes
and solidarity mechanisms built around user fees and cost recovery for drugs. The number o f skilled
health workers posted in rural areas is also increasing albeit at a slower pace than expected, and the
associated approaches of community workers and social marketing is also having positive impacts
notably on the use o f modern contraceptive methods

114.     The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has remained stable since 1997 around 470
jeopardizing the likelihood that Madagascar will reach this MDG by 2015. While antenatal care has
increased to 80 percent and the presence of skilled staff at birth has increased from 47 percent to 54
percent, the full benefit o f skilled attendance at birth can only be realized if the referral system,
comprising all of the essential elements of access to the whole spectrum o f obstetric care including
emergency services, is fully functional. Some progress has been achieved under PRSC3 inaddressingthis
challenge through the setting up o f better communication networks between primary and first level
referral facilities using solar based VHF radios; the strengthening o f blood banks at district level,
provision of ambulances and obstetric care equipment and the rehabilitation and re-equipping of some
district and referral facilities. However, efforts for more systematic improvements inreferral services and
emergency obstetric care, particularly in rural areas, will be intensified. Moreover, deaths due to abortion
are likely to contribute significantly to the MMR(40 percent inrural areas, and approximately 52 percent
in Antananarivo alone), thus improved access to family planning would considerably improve maternal
healthinthe mediumterm.

115.     Madagascar had been making some headway on the control of malaria, tuberculosis and
leprosy; howeverthese efforts seem to have beenlosingsome ground due mainly to delays in access
to resources, and the deterioration of the existing surveillance system. Madagascar has secured
sizable resources for the control o f Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS treatment mainly through the
Global Fund grant facility. Recently however, delays in implementation have occurred due lengthy
processes in defining appropriate strategies (i.e. malaria) or delays in access to the funds available.
Nevertheless, social marketing o f highly subsidized permanently impregnated bed nets increased mother
and child prevention in the coastal regions. Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis improved with the
expansion of DOTS (directly observed therapy system) and increased drug availability nationwide.

 116.    With the prevalence rate of pregnant women testing positive for HIV at 0.93 percent
nationwide, the HIVIAIDS epidemic could be contained if major Governmentand donor efforts are
continued. While occurring later than in most of its neighbors in Africa, the Madagascar HN/AII)S
epidemic has increased. Highrates of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), together with risky sexual
behavior, represent major vulnerability factors for a quick spread o f the virus. In 2005 an estimated
 180,000 persons were living with HN. Since the establishment o f the ComitC National de Lutte contre le
Sida (CNLS) to implement the HIV/AIDS program, a SWAP approach has been put in place with the
main partners (World Bank, Global Fund, ADB, USAID, GtZ, UNICEF, UNAIDS, etc.) to implement
numerous activities (information, education, mass media communication, cinemobiles in villages,
distribution o f STItreatment kits, etc.). While knowledge o f HN/AIDS satisfactorily progressedbetween
 1997 and 2003/04 fiom 69 percent to 79 percent for women, and to 88 percent for men, behavior change
has lagged behindamong high-riskgroups inhot spot areas as well as among the general population. The

CNLS i s rightly reorienting its strategy to: (i)concentrate activities on behavioral change and inthe most
high risk zones; (ii)  strengthen mass and peer communication on STI, HIV testing, and reduction of
stigma; (iii)develop routine testing, and voluntary counseling; and (iv) strengthen public private
partnerships as a way to address the weakness o f public health services.

ReformProgram

117.     The M O H is continuing implement initiatives to prepare the sector for the transition to
programmaticlending.The first round ofthe National Health Accounts is completed and dissemination
will be done shortly. Several studies to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of public health service
provision have also been initiated. Inaddition to the activities completed inthe last few years, this work
will further strengthen the analytical background necessary for M O H to transition to programmatic
lending.

118.     Under the new sector policy, which was adopted in June 2005, emphasis is placed on the
need to re-orient health resourceallocations to underserved areas and improvepublic expenditure
management. Prevention and treatment of malaria and other major communicable diseases are also
among the key priorities. Moreover, the policy seeks to achieve closer integration and coordination of
health sector interventions with other activities that impact health status such as water and sanitation,
nutrition, transport, and rural development, and aims to expand the coverage of risk-coping strategies
such as mutual health insurance schemes and solidarity mechanisms. To implement the policy, the M O H
is planningto adopt a sector wide approach (SWAP) and has initiated the preparation of a comprehensive
sector development program (SDP). The process will require an increased leadership from MOH and
includes an assessment of the human resources and financial inputs required to sustain policy
implementation over the next five years, along with specific health improvement targets to be attained in
order for the country to achieve the health-related MDGs. The M O H expects to organize a review of the
SDP and its accompanying medium term expenditure framework (MTEF for 2007-2009) by June 2006,
and to finalize both documents soon afterward.

119.     To estimate the sector's investment needsover the next ten years, a processof analyticwork
was initiated using the Marginal Budgetingfor Bottlenecks (MBB) programmingtool. The analysis
has highlighted the importance o f adequate investment both in human resources development and in
infrastructure - especially referral facilities. The analysis is based on a dynamic path characterized by
various growth scenarios including linear increases in service delivery and/or frontloading for
infrastructure and equipment supply. Preliminary estimates from the modeling exercise indicate that
significant resources would be necessary to enable Madagascar to meet the health-related MDGs by the
target date of 2015. The planned expansion o f essential health services, including enhanced clinical
referral capabilities for neo-natal and obstetric care, would require additional resources over the short to
medium term to set the country on a dynamic path toward realizing the MDG. The first base scenario
calls for an increase of US$3.80 per capita and aims at progressing steadily towards the child mortality,
malnutrition, malaria and HIV MDG targets through increased use o f well known high impact health
interventions such as immunization, family planning, use o f impregnated bed-netsand social marketingof
health and sanitation products including oral re-hydration therapy. The other scenarios call for a tripling
to quadruplingo f spending on healthto support a significant expansion o f clinical services which will be
necessary to make progress on the maternal mortality MDGs.

120.     The MOH intends to organize a consultation around the SDP to ensure predictable and
sustained financing of the program. The IDA Health Sector Project will close on December 31,2006
and further Bank support to the health sector, in addition to the PRSC, is now being explored in the
context o fthe new CAS via other instrumentspossibly within a SWAP approach.



                                                     45

121.     Health system management at the local level is also improving although budget
management capacity remains a major challenge. The planning, programming and monitoring
functions of regional and district health management teams have been strengthened. All regions and
districts have adjusted their budgetingprocess to the new budgetlprogram format, and some have begun
to introduce performance-based planning using management tools and technical support from various
partners. The performance o f the district managementteams has started to improve as a result of technical
support and staff recruitment. All but a few o fthe districts are now able to formulate their three year plans
and develop annual work programs along clear norms and criteria. However, implementation of those
annual plans is still weak due to poor implementation capacity, insufficient resource flows to the regions
and districts and low capacity for procurement o f the large quantities o f commodities and equipment
needed to expand health services. Furthermore support from regional and communal administrative
authorities is still weak. This situation is in part due to substantial limitations at central level. For
instance, budget management functions remain weak and require increased efforts to strengthen the
administrative and managerial capacity of the health system. The M O H budget execution in 2005 has
remained deceptively low. The focus under this PRSC is on continuing efforts aimed at developing
capacity at central, regional and district levels and at devoting increased attention for more systemic
support and monitoringof budget distribution and implementation.

122.     Regardingimprovementsin health care services, progress has been moderate inthe key areas
o f hospital reform, defining and validating service standards and in finalizing the inventory of
maintenance systems and testing different options to set up a national maintenance system. On the other
hand, the pharmaceutical policy was reviewed as planned

123.      On hospital reform, while the quality of basic health care is acceptable, the health system
performs poorly at hospital level, limiting referral to urban areas and, only then, when it is not
further compounded by financial barriers. The quality o f services at hospital level is affected by the
lack of proper medical specialists, equipment, maintenance, proper drugs and consumables, etc.
However, the creation of the health regions has significantly modified the set up o f district health
facilities and reference hospitals. With support from WBI and in partnership with other donors, hospital
level services are being reviewed and should lead to a reorganization o f the referral system and a
transformation of the role and mandates o f district and regional hospitals for more effective and efficient
service delivery. The program o f creation of essential services particularly in surgery and emergency
medicine and the re-equipment and rehabilitation o f health facilities is progressing well and will continue.
However, the overall reform program for hospitals is somewhat delayed if compared with the initial
chronogram proposed for PRSC 2.

124.      On human resources reform, although limited, the appointment and redeployment o f general
practitioners and paramedical staff has contributed to improve the functioning of existing facilities. The
Ministry has prepared a training plan for human resourceswhich it expects to finalize shortly. The human
resource development plan and health infrastructure development plan currently under preparation,
including an assessment o f bio-medical equipment and maintenance requirements, will help assess
resource requirements and inform the development of a sustainable medium-term hospital expansion
program, andthe neededhumanresources redeployment.

125.      Adequate supply of drugs was restored with the reintroductionof cost recovery in January
2004 (after a period of free distribution during the 2002 crisis), and the 35 percent markup on
generic drugs is among the lowest in Africa. However, this low level o f mark-up does not leave much
room for additional resources to improve quality. While the Government has succeeded in maintaining
low drug prices through subsidies to compensate for the high devaluation during 2004, it will have to
carefully manage the restoration o f prices reflecting drugs' real cost in the near future. Moreover, a
substantial number of drugs and products (mainly the ones with the highest externalities) distributed in


                                                     46

the public as well as in the private sector are highly subsidizedg. Given that drugs and consumables are
cheap, free or highly subsidized at first contact level, health care is affordable for most o f the people at
the periphery, allowing for a relatively simple exemption system. Inaddition, special services have been
organized for the poor in several areas, including free nutritional rehabilitation services for severely
malnourishedchildrenandmothers in35 hospitalsnationwide(contracted out to NGOs).

126.    Cost-recovery was reinitiated at health center level, but with accompanying exemption
policy measures for the poor at this level. Despitethe documentedhigh prevalence of poverty among
the general population and the introduction of payment mechanisms to assist those who have been
identified as poor to have access to basic health services vonds d'iquite`), the small number of persons
who claim to be indigent indicates that there may be significant cultural barriers to identifying oneself
publicly as poor or indigent. Similar measures have been gradually introduced in hospitals, given the
impoverishing effects of hospitalization, where most surgical and other consumables are not available and
must be purchasedinprivateoutlets, endingup inunreasonablyexpensivebills.

127.    Madagascar's effortsto provide services to the poor focus on increasing the availability of
quality services and ensuring the financial accessibility of these services. The MOH commitment to
assess funding mechanisms for health centers and hospitals remains strong. The program of piloting
equity funds at regional and districts hospitalswhich is proceedingas plannedwill continue over the next
year. The organization of pilot mutual health insurance schemes is advancing a bit slower than planed
with only 12 out o f 20 districts having developed such a scheme. An evaluation of the results so far is
expected before the end of the year and the lessons learned will help with identifying a more realistic
schedule. The first roundof the nationalhealth accounts study completed in2005 should help improve the
data base on private andpublic expendituresand contribute to better budget allocations. Preparationofthe
2007-2009 MTEF is initiating andthe process of developingsustainablehealth care financing projections
is currently underway and will help determine the financing framework required for Madagascar to
achievethe MDGs.

128.    There is still a significant need to improve the monitoring and evaluation of the health
sector. The health information system is not fully functional and most importantly the data collectedare
not effectively usedto manage the services, monitor and evaluate policies or alert authorities of potential
epidemics.

129.    Overall, there has beensubstantialprogressonPRSC3 planedactions,althoughsome areas
remain weak, namely, budget execution and management, as well as the capacity of the MOH to
translate the overall policy into an operational plan that would be financially sustainable. In
addition to actions that address these issues the proposedactions for the next twelve months will continue
to focus on activities to increase access to health services by the poor, further reduce existing financial
barriers to access to basic services, and delivering preventive services to remote populations. Achieving
these goals requires an increase in the overall financial allocations to the health sector (both as a
percentage of the government budget and as additional donor funding), as well as a close monitoring of
how those resources are spent andthe results achieved

ExpectedResults:

130.    The main results expected at the end of PRSC3 and their current status include the
following:


 Vaccines, prenatalvitamins andmalariachemoprophylaxis, TB and leprosydrugs, malariatreatment for children;
plaguetreatment, STItreatmentkits, permanentlyimpregnatedbednets, contraceptives.

    Increased access to health services. The government has increased the number o f health facilities
    particularly in previously underserved areas; progress is still needed in improving quality at the
    hospitallevel


                                  D.         RURALWATER SUPPLY

131.     The provisionof drinking water services figures prominently in the PRSP as part of the
objective to promote Human Development in particular for the poor and is among the top five
priorities of the agenda in "Madagascar Naturellement". Access to improved water supply and better
sanitation accompanied by effective hygiene education are critical to reach the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals, because o f their complementary role in improving both health and productivity and providing
increasedopportunities for education and employment, especially for women and girls.

132.     Access rate to potable water in rural areas has increased from 13% to 16% between 2003
and 2005. In 2005, an additional 245,000 persons living in rural area gained access to potable water
against 220,500 in2004. Reaching the MDG, i.e. providing 52 percent of the rural population with access
to potable water by 2015, will require providing 6.6 million additional people with potable water, or about
660,000 people per year. That will necessitate increasing significantly the overall sector capacity through
improved activities planning, increased responsibility for service delivery at deconcentrated and
decentralized levels and increasedpublic expenditures efficiency and sector financing support.

ReformProgram

133.     The Government has continued to make significant progress in setting up the necessary
building blocks to move to programmatic approach and enhanced budget support for the rural
water sector. InJune 2005, the Government endorsed the national water supply and sanitation program
(PNAEPA) aimed at reaching the MDG for the water and sanitation sector. The Directorate of Water and
Sanitation (DEA) of the Ministry of Mine and Energy (MEM) has definitively adopted in 2005 the
program budget approach to plan and monitor all sector activities. A manual o f procedures for
implementingand managing water and sanitation projects was disseminated to all sector stakeholders in
order to standardize technical norms and practices all over the country. A water point computerized
database is in place at the DEA for measuring sector progress. The DEA has recruited 13 staff to
strengthen its central and deconcentrated capacity. Finally, annual water and sanitation review has been
institutionalized in 2005 to offer the opportunity to review through a participative approach sector
performance, past DEA program budget execution and address key sector issue and make
recommendation to remediate sector weaknesses. About one hundred people participated in such event,
from the government, donors' community, NGO's, private sector, mayors, and chef o f region. The first
one was organized inJune 2005 and the second one inApril 2006.

134.     Total budgetfor the DENMEMhas continuedto substantially increase over the past years,
but remains still insufficient to expect to reach the MDG's. Expenditures increased from US$10.6


                                                      48

million in 2004 to US$13 million in 2005, with domestic funding representing 45 % of the total 2005
budget o f the DEA: 87% of the budget was dedicatedto rural water, 11% to urban water and 2% to rural
sanitation. DEAMEM 2006 budget is estimated at US$ 19.5 million, representingan increase of 33 %,
which is coherent with the GOM PRSP priorities. However, it is estimated that about US$ 31 million
would be neededannually to reach the MDGtarget for rural water supply.

135.     The overall implementation of the national water supply and sanitation program
(PNAEPA) continues satisfactorily. Buildingon the positive trend and results of last year, DEAMEM
continues to lead the work o f the sector wide approach (SWAP) in close collaboration with other donors
(AfDB, EU, JICA, WaterAid, UNICEF, USID) to increase its absorptive execution capacity. More
specifically, on-going activities support the sector: 1) strengthening the medium term results oriented
program budget planning process in order to increase sector execution capacity, public expenditures
efficiency, and monitoring and evaluation; 2) harmonizing stakeholders' approaches; 3) increasing
responsibility and resources to deconcentrated levels as well as to regions and communes in decision
making for programming and supervising o f service delivery; 4) increasing support to sanitation and
hygiene promotion to maximize health benefits for the population and 5) promoting innovative water
service delivery mechanism using local Public Private Partnership, where half o f the capital investment is
provided to local governments (mostly by supplying pipes, equipment and meters) and where private
operators and community/local government provide the remaining 50% and sign a medium term
management contract for the service.

136.     The PRSC3 trigger for the rural water sector is fully met. The MEMDEA and its main
partners have implementedas expected all the recommendations ofthe 2005 sector review inthe program
budget2006-2008. Key actions taken include the following : i)Creation o f a new department inthe DEA
dedicated to the preparation and monitoring o f the program budget; ii)Definition o f criteria to select
communities to be included in the program; iii)Advertisement of bidding documents for works, goods
and services at the provincial and regional levels; iv) Dissemination to all stakeholders o f the national
manual of procedures ; v) Setting up of new procedures for collecting data to update the DEA water
points database; vi) Recruitment of a consultant to operate the computerized national water points
database; vii) Agreement with INSTAT on data to be collected for water in national surveys and viii)
Increased allocationfor sanitation in2006 DEA budget.

ExpectedResults

137.     The mainresultsat the end ofPRSC3 andtheir current status are as follows:
e    Increase in overall sector capacity. As discussed above, a number o f actions have beentaken by the
     DEA to increase sector capacity, as recommended by the stakeholders duringthe 2005 sector annual
     review. This is now an ongoing activity
e    The Program budget o f the DEA is the reference framework for strategic and operational
     programmingandthe monitoringand evaluation of all sector activities. This is now a going activity
e   Access to safe water will increase from 13 percent in 2003 to 18 percent at the end o f 2006 in rural
     and semi-urban areas. Available data suggest that this resultwill likely be achieved.


                                   E.        SOCIAL PROTECTION

138.     Seventy two percent of the populationlives in poverty and shocks are widespread. Interms
of natural disasters alone, more than 30 cyclones, 6 droughts and 2 famines have hit the island nation
since about 1970.     Madagascar's on-going risk and vulnerability analysis finds that other shocks,




                                                    49

including human disease, locust infestation and livestock disease, are widespread, if less visible than
natural disasters.

139.    Existing safety net programs are ill-adapted to effectively managing these risks. The current
system of safety nets has evolved in response to various crises. As a consequence, much of today's
spending appears to be crisis-driven, to the detriment o f longer term strategic aims.            Moreover,
beneficiary groups have not beenrigorously definednor prioritized. Although social protection spending
comes to about 1percent o f its GDP, the lack of a clear definition and prioritization of vulnerable groups
creates the risk that these resources will be spread across broad beneficiary populations, to little effect,
rather than concentrated on the neediest groups. Inorder for Madagascar's social protection resourcesto
achieve maximum impact, a greater portion of resources need to be invested further upstream, in risk
prevention and mitigation instruments; ina more coordinated fashion, with less overlap between different
partners' activities; and fot the benefit o f well-defined, agreed-upon vulnerable groups.

140.    In 2002, the Government created a Technical Committee on Social Protection (TCSP) to
address the issues raised above, through development o f a comprehensive RiskManagement and Social
Protection (RMSP) Strategy. Though the TCSP has been effective in this role (the RMSP Strategy is
expected be completed inFY06), it is not a permanent Government body, and its mandate does not extend
to implementing the strategy nor undertaking social protection reforms.           Madagascar now needs a
permanent institutional framework for social protection, with a mandate to implement the RMSP
Strategy, to lead social protectionreforms, and to guidekoordinate future investments inthe sector.

Reform Program

141.    The TCSP has prepared a Social Protection Policy Note that was validated in May 2005,
and has produced a draft RMSP Strategy that was presented for international peer review at a
workshop on the development of social protection strategies in Africa (Tunis, June 2005).             Final
comments by the Bank and donors are being integrated. The strategy will help Madagascar to set clear
objectives, reform goals, and cost-effective interventions. They will be based on an assessment o f the
priority areas o f vulnerability, and will take into account the need to balance short-term, risk-coping
instruments with long-term, growth-enhancing social protection interventions. The Strategy provides the
analysis necessaryfor social protectionreforms envisioned under PRSC3.

 142.    The TCSP has also done initial research on the creation of a permanent institutional
framework for social protection. Because resources are over-invested in emergency management and
response, it i s critical that the mandate of this social protection agency/committee/secretariat encompass
management o f all welfare-harming risks, and not only highly visible natural disasters and other
emergencies.

Expected Results

 143.   At the endofPRSC 3 the expected results andtheir current status are as follows:
0   The Finalization and validation o f the Risk Management and Social Protection Strategy is ongoing
    will be completed by July 2006.
0   Implementationof social protectionreform program, and accompanying interventions. This activity is
    delayed as it is contingent on the validation of the Strategy.

  STRENGTHENINGMONITORINGAND EVALUATIONOF THE PRSP

144.     The PRSPlays out the objectives,institutionalframeworkand operationalmodalitiesof the
Monitoringand Evaluation(M&E) system. The objectives of the system are to monitor inputs, outputs
and outcomes, and evaluate impacts. The system, anchored in the Secretariat Technique a l'Ajustement,
has producedregular reports and updates o f the strategy. However, it suffers from the limitedcapacity o f
some o f its actors, in particular some o f the sector ministries. In addition, the analytical content o f the
reports i s limited, as the links between activities/expenditures and outcomes or impacts are not
systematically establishedor analyzed.

145.     The institutional arrangements for the monitoring and evaluation system are a critical
element of the results-based MadagascarAction Plan. A clear logical framework for the Madagascar
Action Plan is essentialto ensure that monitoring and evaluation can become a tool for greater evidence-
basedpolicy making. The structure ofthe monitoring and evaluation system is currently beingrevised. In
particular, the government plans on simplifying and harmonizing the reporting requirements for its
agencies, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of all actors, as well as developing a clear calendar of
activities aligned with the decision-making processes, which will improve the analytical content and
provide meaningful feedback into the policy making processes. Once the system is clearly established and
its work program identified, these can form the basis for the coordinationof donor support.

146.     As part of the framework for M&E, the Government is currently elaborating a national
strategy for the development of statistics (Strategic Nationale de Developpement de la Statistique,
SNDS). This framework will help strengthen the statistical capacity, coordinate and rationalize the
statistical system, improve the quality o f the statistics, ensure greater access and use o f data for policy
making, update the legal framework, and coordinate external assistance. The Government prepared the
road map, which outlines the process for the elaboration of the SNDS, in September 2005 (with
representation from the PARIS 21 secretariat and key donors, including the World Bank, European
Union, UnitedNations system, IMF and France). The diagnostic, expected by endJune 2006, will form
the basis for the elaborationofthe strategy and a detailed action plan.

147.     The PRSCs are promoting the M&E of the PRSP to improve the results focus of the
strategy, the alignment of the programs to the PRSP, and data quality and accessibility. This
includes the development of a concrete plan for strengthening the M&E system, supported also by an
Institutional Development Grant. It also includes the elaboration and implementation o f the national
strategy for the development o f statistics, through direct guidance, the Institutional Development Grant,
and the Accelerated Data Program. The PRSCs have also supported the improvement o f statistics and
indicators inselectedsectors, among which education, health, and infrastructure. Finally, the PRSCs have
supported the elaboration and analysis o fthe 2004 household survey.

Povertyand SocialImpactAnalysis

148.     The proposedPRSC 3 does not support any reforms that are expected to have significant
distributionalimpacts. The Government however remains committed to understand the distributional
impact of key policy reforms and economic events. Ex-ante poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) has
beenundertaken inthe past or is planned inthe coming months to inform critical policy issues. Inthe last
two years distributional analysis has been conducted to understand the impact o f the reduction in rice
tariffs of 2005 and the implementation o f land tenure securitization. To date, PSIA is ongoing to
understand (i)the poverty and social impact of health care and the poor by investigating Government
efforts to meet the health care needs o f the poor inthe context of the reinstatement o f cost recovery for
drugs and (ii)the impact of oil price increases; following the 2004 fuel price liberalization and the

subsequent sharp increase in world oil prices in 2005, is essential to investigate the impact that such
changes are having inMadagascar, including their effect on householdspendingpatterns

149.    Foreign exchange system: an IMF safeguards assessment was completed in March 2006 and
identified continued weaknesses in the BCM's system of internal controls, financial reporting, and legal
framework. The assessment made recommendations to address the observed vulnerabilities, which
included (i)an annual external audit report on the BCM's transactions with the government and their
compliance with the central bank law; (ii)quarterly reviews by the BCM's internal audit function o f
monetaryprogramdata reportedto the Fund; (iii)    adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
as the BCM's accountingframework; and (iv) measures to strengthen the quality of the BCM's external
audit. An agreed action plan with the Central Bank authorities has been developedby the IMF to ensure
adequate and timely implementationof these recommendations.A previousassessmentwas completed in
November 2001. While some recommendationsto strengthenthe safeguards framework ofthe BCMhave
been put in place, others required more time and are now being addressed in the context of the new
assessmentand includedinthe above mentionedactionplan monitoredby the IMF.

150.    Public Finance Management System: the World Bank's CFAAICPAR, was completed in
2003. Other diagnostics carried out over the last three years by the Bank and other donors, identifieda
rangeo f issues hamperingthe performanceof Madagascar's budget andexpendituremanagement system.
To address these issues, the Government has developed since 2004, an annual priority action plan for
public finance reform which have been successfully implemented.Details of implementationfor 2005 are
provided insectionIV A above alongwith the challengesahead.

Disbursement,ReportingandAuditingArrangements

151.     The proposedcreditwill follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for developmentpolicy
support. Credit proceeds will be disbursedagainst satisfactory implementationofthe developmentpolicy
program and not tied to any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the
credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed in
compliance with the stipulated single tranche release conditions. Once the Bank's Board approves the
credit and at the request of the Borrower, IDA will disburse the proceeds of the credit into an account
designated by the Borrower that is part of the country foreign exchange reserves account at the Central
Bank ofMadagascar. The Borrower shall ensure that uponthe deposit ofthe Credit into saidaccount, an
equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to
the Bank.Based on previous experience, the execution of such transaction from the Central Bank to the
Treasury (Ministry of Finance) doesn't require more than four days. The Borrower will report to the
Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the
budget management system. While no external audit will be required it is expected that this written
confirmation will be signed off by both the Accountant General and the Auditor General, and will be
supported by a credit note from the Central Bank. If the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible
purposes (i.e. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as defined in the Financing
Agreement, IDA will requirethe Borrower to promptly upon notice from IDA, refundan amount equalto
the amount of saidpayment to IDA. Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.
The administrationof this credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. As requiredby law,


                                                   52

the Auditor General will carry the audit of public accounts and submit the annual report to the Parliament
prior to the date of its first sessionfollowing the year of the review ofthese accounts by the General Audit
Office. IDA will have access to this report. IDA will also receive a copy of the annual financial
statements o f the Central Bank audited by an international audit firm in accordance with International
Auditing Standards, withinsix months after the endof eachfiscal year.

Implementation

152.     The responsibility for implementing the PRSC program in Government rests with the
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget. The Government has continued to take the lead in
updating the program policy matrix, and the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget is coordinating
inputs from all the relevant ministries to update the policy matrix. The updated policy matrix will be
discussed duringpre-appraisal mission inApril 2006.


                                       B. ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

153.     The proposed PRSC 3 is a development policy credit insupport of a broadprogram of policy and
institutional reforms, for which the environmental requirements of OPBP 8.60 apply. The PRSC 3
program does not pose any significant environmental impacts. The Bank's overall strategy has focused
on further strengthening of the Government's legislative and institutional capacity to address environment
andnaturalresourcemanagement.


                                                      C. RISKS

154.     The implementationof the poverty reduction strategy inMadagascar continues to be exposed to
risks, many o f which were already identifiedinprevious PRSC operations. The mainrisks include:

(a)      Madagascar remains vulnerable to external shocks, particularlycyclones and increases in
         global commodity prices, such as oil and rice. As detailed earlier, these shocks impact
         negatively on growth and poverty reduction. The Bank has now finalized a Risk and Social
         Protection Review to assess risk prevention and mitigation strategies. Initial steps have been
         taken to investigate the feasibility o f specific options for risk mitigation to the external shocks
         faced by Madagascar (e.g. weather risk insurance schemes).           The Bank has also modified
         procedures for its Community Development Project (FID IV) to allow the project to respond to
         emergencies rapidly; the supplemental IDA credit for the FID project in FY05 was delivered in
         response to the two cyclones o f 2004.         In addition, the construction of schools, and re-
         construction o f damaged infrastructure have been greatly improved to withstand the effects of
         cyclones. The Cellule de Prevention et de Gestion des Urgences (CPGU) is operational and is
         charged with managing programs to prevent crises and mitigate their impacts when they do occur.
         Finally, the Government has made rice an important policy focus, with an emphasis on the entire
         rice value chain (production, distribution, marketing), and is also looking at policy options to
         better stabilize prices.
(b)      Political issues, particularly in an election year, present a risk The political situation in
         Madagascar is relatively stable, especially compared to many countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

         elections - scheduled for the end o f 2006 - will likely lead the policy agenda this year and carry
         The President's popularity remains high and his political party is dominant. The Presidential

         the main riskthat they could distract focus from reforms. There are also some concerns that the
         Government's ambitious and initially fast-moving efforts on fighting corruption have stagnated
         recently. However, at the same time, the elections also present an opportunity as they place extra



                                                      53

     pressure on the Government to deliver results to the population in 2006 which could ensure
     renewedvigor inimplementingreforms and poverty-reductionprograms. The political leadership
     has a clear vision of reform and is strongly committedto moving the PRSP agenda forward. The
     initial draft ofthe MAP is a testament to such Governmentcommitment. The Bank's focus inthis
     regard continues to be on issues of transparency and anti-corruption, with the PRSC and the
     Governance and Institutional Development Project being the main instruments of IDA support,
     andWBI playing a key role through various governance and capacity programs.
(c)  Maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment remains critical to the successful
     implementationof the PRSPand is a core area of focus of the future MAP. The Government
     has already made significant progress in 2005 in managing the high inflation in the face of
     continuedhigh internationalprices. Nevertheless,further inflationary pressures caused by world
     price volatility will continue to present a challenge.         The successful completion of the
     restructuringplan ofthe electric power utility,JIRAMA, is also essentialfor the maintenance of a
     stable macroeconomicenvironment given the negativerepercussionson the whole economy that
     another crisis, as experiencedinmid-2005 would have. The recent agreement with the IMF on a
     new PRGF programis akey aspect inmanagingthese risks.
(d)  The implementation of public finance reforms poses challenges and risks negatively
     impactingservice delivery. As detailed earlier, Madagascar has carried out an ambitious set of
     budgetary reforms that are already yielding results. Nevertheless, a number of key issues are
     worrisome such as a weak fiscal framework that over-estimatedrevenues, unpredictable budget
     execution, capacity weaknesses in applying the new program budget structure and poor reform
     coordination and M&E. The Governmenthas recognizedthese issues and has laid out a priority
     action plan for 2006 that continues and deepensthe reform program. Successful implementation
     of this priority action plan will be critical to ensure real impact on service delivery and poverty
     reduction. The Bank continues to support the reforms proposed in the areas of public finance,
     budget programming, procurement, institutional development and capacity building through the
     PRSC and the Governance and Institutional Development Project.               The Bank's on-going
     investmentportfolio also focuses on institutional strengthening, training and capacity building at
     the sectorallevel.
(e)  Capacityweaknesses present significant risks to the effective implementationof the poverty
     reductionstrategy. As noted above, to mitigate this risk the Bank is supporting institutional
     strengthening, training and capacity building.      In particular, the on-going portfolio of IDA
     investment operations focuses on building capacity at the sectoral level, as well as building
     capacity among development actors such as the private sector, community and farmers
     organizations and NGOs. WBI is also active in building capacity within Government for
     managingthe PRSP.
(f)  Reachingand maintainingthe economic growthtargets laid out inthe PRSPand the MAP-
     while feasible will be difficult. Sustainable poverty reduction depends on maintaining growth
                      -
     at high levels, attractingprivate investment into the labor-intensivemanufacturingsector and into
     agro-businesses. The erosion of trade preferences and the expiration of the MFA have already
     impactedthe growth of the textile sector inthe EPZ (textile exports in2005 were almostthe same
     as for 2004). Providing a favorable investment climate is crucial in this regard in order to attract
     higher levels of FDI. The recently-completedInvestment Climate Assessment (ICA) outlines a
     set of recommendations for mitigating this risk including accelerating reforms to improve

     ICA, the 2005 Development Policy Review and the up-coming CEM - focuses specifically on
     competitiveness and attract private sector development. IDA'SAAA program - including the

     growth issues to assist the Governmentprioritize and implementreforms.

  Mr.Chairman,

1. The Republic of Madagascar is conducting its development policy based on the Poverty
  Reduction Strategy Paper which expresses the country's strong will to work for an equitable,
   sustainable and strong economic development. The main purpose which the authorities set to
  themselves is achievingthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals, namely reducing poverty by halfby
  2015. The document was designedina participatory spirit, andthe final version of the PRSPwas
   completed through a participatory process, which culminated in its adoption in July 2003. In
   order to integratethe   MadagascarNaturally vision andthe new administrative reforms which
                                                 ))
  were undertaken, the document was updated in June 2005. It will be taken over by a five year
   innovativeplancalled (( MadagascarAction PlanD.

2. In the updated PRSP version, the choice for economic policy is directed to a strong growth
   focused on boosting global supply and increase in investment. The strategy rests on: (i)
   developing buoyant sectors, (ii) up an incentive and securing framework for national and
                                   setting
  foreign private investment, (iii)developing the human capital through enhanced access of the
   populationto services inHealth, Education, Water and Sanitation. The following are considered
  buoyant sectors: export oriented manufacturing, mining industry, tourism and, especially
  agriculture. Regardingthe latter one, a particular emphasis is laid on improved infrastructureand
  enhanced productivity which will be achieved with the support from financial partners through
   such projects and programs as the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and the Integrated
   Growth Pole(IG2P) [P61e IntCgrCde Croissance(PIC)].

3. In2003, the first year for implementing PRSP, the economic growth rate was 9.8%, and inflation
  was curbed. Suchgrowth increasedin2004, despite exogenous shocks -cyclones andrice and oil
  prices on the international market - that the country had to undergo, and which entailed overall
   increase in prices and depreciation of the national currency. The efforts led by the Government
  for keeping economic stability and implementing numerous institutional reforms came up with
  the attainment of the completion point in October 2004. Therefore, Madagascar was granted a
   significant cancellation of foreign debts within Paris Club. The year 2005 witnessed the
                                              76

   continuation of inflationary tensions which were containedat the end of the first quarter. Growth
  was somehow slowed down by problems inelectric energy provision andthe consequences of the
   dismantledMultiFiberAgreement, but it nevertheless amountedto a4.6% rate.

4. The actions and reforms started during these last years indicatethat the country is determinedto
  move forward. In the area of good governance 22 regions, which are provided for in the
   Constitution, are effectively established. Fight against corruption is materialized in tangible
   actions: the anti-corruption law and the law relative to money laundering were adopted in
   Parliament; the texts relative to their implementation were decreed by the Government; the
   Independent Anti-Corruption Office (Bureau Independant Anti-Corruption (BIANCO)) is
   operational; anti-corruption strategies were developed and implemented within the Ministry of
   Justice through reinforcement of internal control. In the mining and the forestry sectors,
   transparency is ensured through a biannual publication of lists of operation permit holders, as
   well as of fees collectedfrom each operator.

5. As regards public finance, the Government implemented the 2005 Priority Action Plan (PAP
   2005), which continued public finance reform. Such reforms relate to both revenues and
   expenditures. Regarding revenues, important improvement was brought to taxation for better
   revenue performance. Concerning internal taxation, tax and duty rates were revised downward,
   and the base was broadened through better inspections and controls by strengthening the
   economic role ofthe taxation system (modification ofthe base for ProfessionalTax, modification
   of Corporate Tax (BS) ....); the SIGTAS software was operational in August 2005. As regards      ,
   customs, the first year in the implementationof the Customs Action Plan enabled restructuring
   and rationalizing the rates in import duties and taxes (DTI), accelerating customs clearance,
   effective commissioningofthe SYDONIA++ software amongcustoms offices inToamasina, and
   instituting the payment for DTIthrough the bankingsystem.

6. Efforts were also deployed for the sake of transparency and good public expenditure
   management. The new programmatic budget was introduced by the texts governing the public
   finance reform as a whole, which were passedduring the year 2004 and applied starting from the
   year 2005. The organic law on Finance Laws namely institutedthe Medium Term Expenditure
   framework (MTEF) andthe programmaticbudget so as to ensure consistencybetweenthe budget
   and the development strategy. An Integrated Public Finance Management System was also
   establishedto strengthen transparency. Such a system is operational inthe Treasury (Paierie et la
   Recette GBnBrale) of Antananarivo, as well as in the five main treasuries of the main towns of
   Faritany. It enables producing the budget execution reports within 15 days following the closing
   of monthly entries inthe locations where it is implanted.The Procurement Code was adoptedand
   the texts for its implementationare beingfinalized.

7. In order to reach the objectives which the Government set forth, the intention is to take
   appropriate actions and to implement adequate reform programs. Priority will be granted to
   actions in good governance and rational management of the State finance, which will be
   accompaniedby appropriatemacroeconomic,structural, and sector-basedpolicies.

8. The reforms undertaken in the area of public finance management will be strengthenedboth in
   formulation and executionof the State budget, and incontrol. Budget allocations are inline with
   PRSP priorities. As regards public investment program for 2006, the social sector which is
   composed of education and health, benefitedfrom 27.2% of the total amount, and infrastructure
   from 39.7%. Concerning 2006 budget execution, training for      ((ordonnateurs secondaires and
                                                                                               ))
   activity managers were provided at the beginning of the 2006 in all provinces and former
   prefectures which are equipped with financial districts. A budget execution guide was edited and
   distributedto ordonnateurs secondaires and activity managers in the course of such training
                   ((                        ))
   sessions. The efficiency and the quality of the control mechanisms inpublic finance management
   will be improved as regards the management of committed expenditures through the

                                               77

   establishmentof an organizational and analytical audit of the Financial Control. Budget execution
   reporting based on an economic and functional nomenclature will be performed with the
   International Consultant recruited for such a purpose regarding training MEFB technicians. The
   budget execution report inthe framework of the four month review with donors will be extended
   to all ministries in2006.

9. The 2000 and 2001 Reports on Budget Execution (Lois de reglement) were passed inParliament
    in 2005. The 2002 and 2003 Draft Reports on Budget Executionwere reviewed by the Auditor
   General(Cour des Comptes) and forwardedto Parliamentfor including them on the agenda of its
    sessions for this year 2006. The 2004 Draft Report on Budget Executionwill be forwardedto the
   Auditor Generalat the endof June 2006.

10. Budget preparation for 2007 will start earlier than in previous years: the first phase of budget
    conferenceswill take placebefore July 2006.

11. Procurement reforms will be continued. In application of part of the code, the procurement
    managementunits inministries are operational. The applicationtexts of the new code adopted in
    2004 were developedby international Firms and reviewed by the SteeringCommittee. They will
    be presented to a Cabinet meeting for approval in May 2006. The Procurement Oversight
    Organization (Autoritd de Rkgulation des Marchks Publics (AMP)) members will be appointed
    at the end of May 2006. Training sessions for users of the new Procurement Code at both the
    central government level and local government level will be provided following the approval of
    application texts by the Government. Such application texts will be gradually established in the
    course of2006 second quarter.

12. Inthe framework of good governance, actions will be taken as regards fight against corruption,
    decentralization and justice. A sector-based anti-corruption strategy will be adopted and
    implemented. The reinforcement of the regulatory framework is continued, amongst others,
    through the adoption of anapplication decree governingissues inconflict of interest, and a decree
    involving recruitment and selection procedures for the public service. Anti-corruption officials
    will also conduct the following actions: independentreviews of procurement in large investment
    projects, independent audits of customs directorates, enquiries on probable conflicts of interest in
    specific areas. Inorder to fight against corruption within customs departments, service standards
    inlinewith internationalstandardswill begraduallyestablished.

13. With a view to having effective decentralization, budget allocations to communes will be revised
    upward. Such allocations already increased by 20% between 2003 and 2005, and by 42.5%
    between 2004 and 2006. The commune budget allocation system will be reviewed. The Local
    Development Funds will be made operationalfor building commune capacities in public service
    provision.

14. With a view to enhancing transparency and efficiency inthe judiciary system, service standards
    will be developed, and which set the number of cases to be processedby magistrates and court
    clerks. The programfor reducingbacklogs infile processingwill be extendedto lower courts.
15. The social sectors are also covered by the Government program. The educational policy has an
    important role to play for strengthening Madagascar competitiveness and for training skilled
    labor. The actions taken under the implementation of the policy of Education For All (EFA) are
    strengthened. In the second year of its implementation, it enabled to further strengthen the
    educationalsystem, especially the primary education. Thus, the net enrolment rate increasedfrom
    82% in2002103 to 98% in2004105 -thanks to the constructionof 920 additional classrooms and
    the recruitment of about 2,000 additional teachers. The efforts will be continued in both areas
    with a view to broadening education supply, as well as to promoting non formal education in
    order to valorize the human capital. Primary education receives particular attention from the
    authorities. The actions aiming at enhancing its quality are strengthened: introduction of the Skill

                                                78

   based Approach, developing adequate training strategies for primary school teachers,
   modification in the number of learning years for primary school, defining criteria in FRAM
   teacher recruitment, institutinga new status to encourage teachers to settle in remote areas of the
    island.

16. Improvement in the health sector is also of prime importance for development and poverty
   reduction. The actions aiming to promote mother and child health, to combat malnutrition and
    diseases, as well as to improve health infrastructure will be continued for the upcoming three
    years. Furthermore, a plan for redeploying human resources is being developed to improve
    service provision. Finally, capacity building in programming and budgeting at the central,
    intermediary, andperipheral levels was startedfor a rational use o fresources.

17. Three programs related to water, nutrition, and social protection will be implemented. Regarding
    the water sector, the National Program for DrinkingWater Supply and Sanitation, which aims to
    achieve the MillenniumGoals, was approved by the Government inJuly 2005. Between 2003 and
    2005, the access rate, in rural areas, increased form 14 to 16%. The Government intends to
    continue the efforts in such an area by setting up a programmatic approach, a medium term
    planning with the programmatic budget, standardization in line with the manual of procedures,
    coordination and harmonization o f actions by donors, namely through the annual sector review.
    Regarding nutrition, the plan is to integrate the current SEECALINE project into the National
    Office which will provide the coordination and the execution o f the strategies in the National
    Policy and the shift to the pilot phase o f the National Community-based Program for Nutrition in
    the 22 regions. In terms of social protection, the focus is on making operational the related
    strategy through the development o f an action plan, as well as the establishment of an institutional
    framework and a monitoring evaluation system. The provision o f safety nets will also be
    effectively implemented.

18. The Government will grant particular interest to the monitoring and evaluation of poverty
    reduction for which a plan will be developed. Besides, as the appraisal o f actions requires
    adequate, reliable, and relevant information, the policy on access to data will be prepared and
    adopted.

19. As Madagascar opted for an investment pulled growth, actions are provided for with the aim o f
    attracting both national and foreign investment and, therefore, o f developing the private sector.
    Apart from good governance, fight against corruption, and public finance reform, a larger
    consultation of the private sector is instituted to bring to perfection the credibility o f the State,
    and restore mutual trust. The authorities are seeking to bring in economic operators so that they
    are involved in policy processes and decisions related to generating wealth and growth. Support
    to acceleratedgrowth in regions and sectors with a higheconomic potential is provided thanks to
    the establishment o f infrastructure and services required in a business enabling environment.
    Investment promotion continues through the security it is provided, the development of a
    promotion strategy for foreign direct investment, and the extension of legal and regulatory
    provisions in the business laws, which are in compliance with the international and regional
    agreementsto which the country has adhered.

20. The implementation o f such actions will result in a consolidated growth. In the long term, the
    subsistence economy will change into a market economy, the rural economy will extend into an
    industrial economy, and the opening to foreign countries will be strengthened becauseo f increase
    inexport. Inthe short term, the 2006 economic growth rate will be 5.2% andthe poverty rate will
    decrease to 68%. The crosscutting actions undertaken will certainly have an impact on the
    economic sectors, which will develop in total synergy for the achievement o f the growth
    announced. Moreover, the projects achieved by the Government inagriculture andrural areas will
    bear their fruit. The secondary sector will experience a new lease of life inits activities following
    the resolution of power cut problems. The dynamism in industries relatedto agriculture, tourism
                                              . 79

   and mining will be boosted. The tertiary sector will go on being flourishing thanks to the
   programs for developing and intensifying infrastructure: buildings and public works, roads,
   telecommunications. Transport as a branch will also benefit from the overall improvement.
   Exports will definitely increaseby 10.6% interms of SDR.

21. The Malagasy Government is determined to achieve the objective of substantial poverty
   reduction. We rely on the support from the international community, namely the International
   DevelopmentAssociation to supplement the resources requiredby the State for the achievement
    of such an objective, preferablyinthe form of budgetary aid.

                        Annex 4. ProgressinSupportingBroad-BasedGrowth


1.      The Bank's support for the second strategic axis of the PRSP on broad-based growth
includes a significant portfolio of investmentlending, and policy dialogue. The first three PRSCs do
not include any specific policy actions on growth as triggers but it is intendedthat the engagement inthis
area will be deepened under future PRSCs. As noted in the PRSC 1 Program Document, the Bank's
support for the growth pillar is provided through its significant investment lending operations in private
sector development; transport, rural development and environment (see Table 7). This Annex summarizes
progress in three key areas: private sector development, transport and rural development and
environment.

                                  PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

2.      The PRSP emphasizes the importanceof creatingan investment climate that is conducive
for private-sector led growth. Since PRSC 2, additional steps have been taken in 2005 to improve the
investment climate, to implement public-private partnerships (PPP), and to improve co-ordination of
policies andto give voice to the private sector andcivil society, morebroadly. GUIDE, the one-stop shop
for enterprisecreation, has continuedto perform well and facilitates settingup enterprises. Although there
were no new privatization transactions since the sale of HASYMA in July 2004, the management
contracts for JIRAMA (energy) and SRAMA (sugar) are in place and the Government is examining
optionsto restructure these enterprises.

3.      Reforms in the energy sector have advanced slightly in2005, but much remains to be done,
and the energy situationremains critical. InApril 2005, atwo-year, IDA-fundedmanagement contract
took over responsibility for JIRAMA. The Government implemented tariff increases in July and
November 2005 after tariffs remainedfrozen from 2001 even though this was a period of high inflation,
sharp devaluationofthe local currency andrising world oil prices. Very limitednew investmenthas taken
place to increase power supply, while demand has increased substantially. JIRAMA's operational
performance is unsatisfactory, with high losses and poor maintenance.A donor's conference was held in
Paris in January 2006 to secure financing for JIRAMA and the Government is now implementing the
agreed restructuringplan.

4.      There has also been some progress in improving prospects for the key export-oriented
sectors that are driving growth. The tourism sector has shown continued strong growth in 2005 and
new investors have expressed interest inNosy Be (one o f the growth poles). Despite the overall decline
in the textiles and garments sector, there are signs of some new investments and consolidation taking
place in the industry as firms adjust to the increasing competition from Asian exporters. The mining
company Rio Tinto confirmed their decision to launch the long awaited ilmenite mining project in 2005
and the new port being financed by the Government through a private-public partnership with Rio
Tinto/QMM is expectedto boost agricultural exports from the region. Other new mining investors have
shown interest, including inthe petroleumsector.

5.      The Government is in the processof establishing a new investment promotionand business
facilitation agency that will function as an apex body for private sector development. The IDA-
supported Integrated Growth Poles Project (IG2P) was launched in 2005 and is expected to increase
private investments in the three geographical growth poles (Nosy Be, Antananarivo-Antsirabe, and Fort
Dauphin) in the key sectors of the economy. The IG2P supports infrastructure investments, support to
MSMEs, improving the policy andregulatory regime and strengtheninginstitutional capacity to leverage



                                                    88

private investments, including support for reviewing the legislation governing both Zone Franche and
domestic enterprises.

6.       The Bank completed an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and a Financial Sector
Assessment (FSAP) in FY05. A high level workshop was held to disseminate the findings and
recommendations of these studies which highlighted the poor business environment for firms which
hampers their productivity. The Government has initiated follow up action from the workshop to make
policy and regulatory changes that will improve the investment climate in Madagascar in areas such as
ease o f entry for new enterprises, import-export processes, tax administrationandconstruction licensing.

                                                  TRANSPORT

7.       The transport sector, particularly the roads program, plays a key role in Madagascar's
growth and poverty alleviation strategy. As noted before, remoteness is associatedwith poverty, and
improving access is critical for enhancing productivity inrural areas, improving access to social services
and expanding access to markets. Three decades of inappropriate sector policies have led to serious
deterioration o f the country's transport infrastructure. It is estimated that from 1970 onwards the country
lost on average 1,000 kilometers o f roads per year due to lack of maintenance, or the loss and
deterioration o f over 80 percent of the network over the last 30 years. InApril 2000, after almost ten years
o f sector dialogue and very little investment, the country adopted a comprehensive transport sector policy
which aims at (i)  focusing the Government's role on strategic planning, sector oversight and coordination;
(ii)creatingagenciesfor sub-sectormanagementandregulatoryfunctions thatarejointly controlledby
the public and private sectors and gradually user-financed; (iii)divesting operational activities to the
private sector, through privatization and concessioning arrangements; (iv) developing the local private
sector for works design and execution; and (v) rehabilitating transport infrastructure to appropriate levels
and ensuringtheir maintenance thereafter.

ReformProgram

8.       After the 2002 crisis, the Government launched-an ambitious road rehabilitation and
maintenance program (2003           -  2008) with the objective to rehabilitate or provide periodic
maintenance for approximately2,000 km per year. The road network consists o f about 25,100 km of
national and provincial roads of which 5,600 km are paved and 19,500 km unpaved. Overall 32% o f the
network is in good or fair condition and 66% o f the paved roads is in good condition. Since 2003, nearly
3,300 km of national and provincial roads have been improved. For rural roads, between 2003 and 2005
about 2,000 km were improved. Regarding the program financed by the Bank's Transport APL2,
1,300km have beenrehabilitatedso far. To rationalize the management o f the rural roads, the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport (MTPT) has created a rural roads unit which i s part o f the well-functioning
Large Works Unit.In2004 and 2005, the RMF contracted for the maintenance of 6,800 kmand 7,000 km
of roads respectively. The organizational effectiveness o f the RMF needs to be strengthened and its
resource base needs to be enhanced. Currently the RMF collects between 30 to 40 billion MGA annually
whereas its needs are 90 billion MGA and increasing with the continuing improvement o f the network.

9.       There has been some progress in setting up the autonomous sub-sector agencies. The
Maritime, Ports and River Agency (APMF) has been operational since October 2004 and its board has
been able to install a measure of independence. The appointment o f staff is virtually complete and the
private sector is satisfied with the functioning o f the agency. The Civil Aviation Agency (ACM), which
has been operational since 2000, has been restructured based on an organizational audit, to be more
efficient and to enhance the capacity of the technical personnel. Laws creating the Roads Authority (AR)
and the Land Transport Agency (ATT) were voted by the Parliament during 2005 but have not yet been
ratified.


                                                       89

 10.     In March 2005, the Vice Primature Office in charge of Economic Programs, Ministry of
Transport, Public Works, and RegionalPlanningwas dissolved, and two separate ministries were
 created:the Ministry o f Public Works and Transport and the Ministry o f Decentralizationand Regional
Planning. This reorganization has provided a better focus for policy and planning but the restructuring
brought with it further delays in implementing institutional reforms.            The Minister has made a
 considerable effort to appoint qualified staff for his cabinet and improvements are beginningto show.

 11.     The Government is using public-private partnerships for managing the transport
 infrastructure. As noted before, Air Madagascar is operating under a management contract and is
 performing well. The privatization o f the company should now be prepared. The concessioning of the
 airports is under way. The IDA-financed Transport Infrastructure Investment Project (APL3) has been
 restructured and now includes a component to finance the investment program o f the Northern Railway
 which was concessioned in 2002 to Madarail. The Government, in agreement with the donors, has
 decided to delay the concessioning o f the Southern Railway (FCE) becausethe tender did not result inan
 acceptable offer. The FCE will be under management contract with Madarail for the next two years at
 which time a new tender will be issued. The main port o f Toamasina, which handles more that 80 percent
 of the total traffic, has been restructured: its container terminal was concessionedand is now operated by
 the Philipino company MICTSL.            The operations o f the secondary ports Tulkar, Mahajanga, and
 Antsiranana/Nosy BeJAnkifywill be concessionedby mid-2006.

                              RURALDEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT

 12.     Rural development and environmentare critical elements of the PRSP, since over four in
 five poor peoplelive in ruralareas. Agricultural productivity is low and naturalresource degradation is
 widespread. The main elements o f the Government's rural development sector strategy reform agenda
 adopted under the Rural Development Policy letter recognizes the need for approaches to provide
 integrated solutions to multiple problems simultaneously (e.g. through growth poles, value chains etc).
 The strategy aims to address five main challenges:
 i.Maketheinstitutionalframeworkofthesectormoreeffectiveandefficientbycompletingthepublic
    administrationreform and implementingthe newly approved decentralization policy.
ii.Facilitateaccesstocapitalandproductionfactors byimprovingproducers' andinvestors' accessto
    land, developing sustainable financing mechanisms to facilitate access to working capital,
    technologies and equipments, and developingrural electrification
iii.Improve food security and food production through investment that increases productivity,
    diversification of agricultural production, and better risk management
iv. Promote better natural resources management through sustainable use o f soils, water, biodiversity,
    ecosystems, forest resources and rural spaces, and
v. Develop markets and promoting a commodity approach by encouraging public-private partnerships,
    supporting non traditional agricultural exports and emergence o f new markets participants, and
    developingofnorms and standards.

 13.     Inthe vision, MadagascarNaturellement,there is a renewedfocus on ruraldevelopment. In
 2004, despite the losses associated with the cyclones, agricultural growth was 3.5 percent, significantly
 higher than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2003.           Rice policy has been a dominant policy issue in
 Madagascar since mid-2004. Inearly 2004, the reduction in the rice production due to the cyclones, the
 sharp depreciation in the local currency and an increase in the international price o f rice contributed to
 price increases. Early announcements o f state intervention in case of a steep increase inthe price o f rice
 createduncertainty among private sector importers. Rice imports inthe first halfo fthe year in2004 were
 only 59,000 tons as compared to 150,000 tons in2003 duringthe same period. The shortage inrice with
 highprices triggered a Government facilitated rice import operation. In2005, the Government removed

the import tariff on rice, while maintainingthe VAT. This contributed to strengthening the rice market as
rice traders responded by importing sufficient quantities of rice in 2005/2006. Producers also responded
to price signals with a significantly higher yield (2.57 MT/ha) and production increase (13%) in 2005.
The Government is focusing on the entire rice value chain and intends to improve access to agricultural
inputs, privatize the seed multiplication centers and rehabilitate the irrigation schemes in high potential
agricultural areas.    The Madagascar Action Plan for 2012 proposes an increase of 150% in rice
production, from a current production of 3.42 milliontons o fpaddy.

ReformProgram

14.      The implementationof the Government's institutionalreform programfor the Ministry of
Agriculture,Livestockand Fisheries has started, aimed at supportingthe decentralization process and
improvingthe quality of services. Re-assignment o f staff and budget towards the regions has begun, with
deconcentration o f responsibilities to the Regional Directors for Regional Development (DRDR).
Decentralization efforts are also under way: the Ministry aims to establish district-level Agriculture
Service Centers (CSAs) as a consultative and service platform between farmers, private sector, NGOs and
the Government. Two CSAs are currently beingpiloted inItasy and Ambohimahasoa, and five more are
planned inthe near future.

15.      The Governmenthasdeveloped its Land PolicyLetter which was validated by a wide range
of stakeholders in February 2005 and adopted on May 3,2005. Under the National Land Program
the Government intends to put in place a land rights registration system based on the principles o f (i)
decentralization of the land administration to the lowest level o f local government; (ii)improvement of
landtenure information; (iii)  simplifiedlandtenure legislation; and (iv) capacity building, through a pilot,
learning-by-doing approach. Pilot activities have started in one area (guichet foncier communal) and 7
more are underway, with a target of 50 guichets fonciers by end-2006. The Bank is completing a AAA
on Land and Property RightsReview which has served as an inputto the National LandTenure Program.

16.      The implementationissues for makingthe maintenancefund for irrigation schemes (Fonds
d'Entretien des RCseaux Hydro Agricoles, FERHA) which was established in September 2003 are
being addressed. A Task Force is finalizing the operations manual for FERHA. Financingmechanisms
for FERHA are under discussion, and will be finalized as part o f the Bank's planned Irrigation and
Watershed Development Project (FY07).

17.      Food security and agriculture productivity are being strengthened through the National
Program o f Watershed Management and Irrigated Perimeters (to be supported under the Irrigation and
Watershed Development Project), promotion o f agriculture diversification, improved planning of
infrastructure in enclaved areas, a new rice observatory and diffusion o f agriculture statistics, and
consolidation o f early warning systems for disaster management.

18.      Market development is being promoted through public-private partnerships (PPPs), the
strengtheningo fprofessional organizations suchas the recently created Rice Platform (PC Riz) and Dairy
Board, establishment of Agriculture Chambers of Commerce, promotion o f agriculture growth centers in
major potential areas (Alaotra, Itasy, Andapa, and Marovoay), and reinforcement o f quality standards
(namely through the Aquatic Surveillance Agency, ASH).

19.      The Government has continued to expand its national System of ProtectedAreas (SAPM),
now at 2,750,000 ha. The SAPM is expectedto attain 6 millionha by 2010 (about 10% ofthe national
territory).   The Foundation for Protected Areas was established in January 2006 to help finance the
SAPM. The National Environmental Program - supported by the Bank's Third Environment Project - is
now inits third phase.


                                                     91

20.     The Ministry of Environment, Water and Forestry is undertaking a reform program
focusing on strengthened forestry and environmentalgovernance. The Governmenthas strengthened
its forest exploitation adjudication system, by publishing the status of forest exploitation permits on
newspapers. A Forestry Observatory and a mobile control unit are now operational. Mining and forest
exploitation has been prohibited in the new system of ProtectedAreas of Madagascar. Fire monitoring
committees have been created and are being strengthened at commune level. The decree making the
Office National pour 1'Environnement (ONE) the one-stop shop for enforcing the MECIE (National
Environmental Impact) law passed in February 2005. The Ministry will be also creating Environmental
Units in each of the 22 regions, starting from 2006, to help mainstream environmental concerns into
regional plans.
