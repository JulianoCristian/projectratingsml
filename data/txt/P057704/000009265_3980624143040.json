Project is to assist the government in improving the\n            efficiency of Egyptian ports and ancillary services in line\n            with the CAS objectives of promoting private sector\n            development and growth in exports. The project will\n            restructure the organizational and financial systems in the\n            sector and attract private investment to manage and operate\n            publicly-held enterprises in the sector. The project funds\n            the  operating expenses of the Secretariat Unit and provides\n            technical assistance in three phases: 1) Phase 1 assesses\n            deficiencies in trade logistics and potential for container\n            transshipment at Egyptian ports and recommends a strategy to\n            improve efficiency; and develops specifications and bid\n            documents for port/trade management systems including EDI\n            (Electronic Data Interchange) systems to facilitate trade.\n            2) Phase 2 develops a policy framework which accommodates\n            greater private participation in ports; and produces draft\n            regulations for the port sector to implement the new policy\n            of private participation. 3) Phase 3 a) creates a new\n            structure for a corporatized organization in the sector and\n            assists in its implementation; b) restructures the financial\n            management systems for port sector entities to make them\n            autonomous and self-financing; and c) develops a plan for\n            privatizing selected units and a labor redeployment program."}, "docdt": "1998-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
