The specific measures include : (1) phasing out of\n            economic subsidies for phosphate and potash fertilizers; (2)\n            privatizing public tubewells in fresh groundwater areas to\n            improve the management of groundwater resources and move\n            towards full recovery of irrigation operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) costs; (3) formulating an investment\n            program in the agriculture and water sectors geared towards\n            improving the efficiency of existing assets, and support\n            services in agricultural research and extension; and (4)\n            strengthening institutions that deal with agricultural\n            pricing, rice and cotton export, and water sector investments."}, "docdt": "1988-07-08T00:00:00Z"}
