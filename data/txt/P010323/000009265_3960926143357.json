The project\n            has partially achieved its objectives, the strengthening of\n            institutions is progressing, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, action was more timely in the areas of\n            federal government responsibilities than those of the\n            provincial governments. Second, there is a need for critical\n            appraisal of implementing agencies, especially those dealing\n            with programs that require difficult decisions on economic\n            reforms with wide political implications. Third, staff\n            requirements for program loans should not be underestimated.\n            Fourth, the ASAL focused on a few important issues rather\n            than attempting to deal with a broader range. Fifth, it is\n            important to combine reform programs with concurrent efforts\n            in the same area. Finally, it may be useful to adjust\n            procurement procedures in program loans, depending on\n            whether the importers are in the public or private sector."}, "docdt": "1992-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
