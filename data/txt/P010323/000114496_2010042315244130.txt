                        (Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan)
                        Amendment
Dear Sirs:
            We refer to the exchange of telexes between us, dated May 6
and June 19, 1990 whereby we have agreed, in addition to extending the
Closing Date for the above Loan to December 31, 1990 to (i) reallocate
the amount of $1,000,000 allocated for Category (1) of the Table in
Schedule I to the Loan Agreement to Category (2); and (ii) to increase
total procurement under the Loan Agreement through procedures other than
the international competition bidding procedures, by the equivalent of
$30,000,000.
            Based on the above, we proposed to amend the Loan Agreement
for the above Loan, dated January 2, 1989, as follows:
            (1)   The table set forth in Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement
is amended by deleting Category (2) and allocating the entire Loan amount
($200,000,000) to Category (1).
            (2)   Paragraph 2, which was added to Schedule 3 to the Loan
Agreement by the amendment letter dated February 23, 1989, is amended by
increasing the figure of $50,000,000 shown therein to $80,000,000.
            Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
signing and duly dating the attached copy of this letter and by returning
said copy to us.
                                        Very truly yours,
