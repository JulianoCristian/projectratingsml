    was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that rapid\n            increase in contraceptive prevalence is possible in rural\n            Africa through Community Based distributors. The project\n            proved the hypothesis by demonstrating dramatic increase in\n            family planning uptake in rural Malawi through a district\n            wide Community-based Distribution (CBD) program. The project\n            was successful due to a balanced focus on both demand and\n            supply issues. Demand was increased through a very effective\n            multimedia Information, Education and Communication (IEC)\n            campaign. Sustainability is an important concern CBD\n            programs that requires special attention. Notwithstanding\n            the fact that the cost per CYP in this project is much lower\n            compared to Zimbabwe (less than US$ 10 vs US$ 17 per CYP in\n            Zimbabwe) sustainability was seen as the biggest challenge\n            by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP). Lessons\n            from this project have already been assimilated by the MOHP\n            and are leading to several policy changes. First, the\n            ministry is putting greater emphasis on community level\n            activities. Secondly, PAC services at the district hospital\n            are being provided by Clinical officers and discussions are\n            on going to decentralize the services further to the nurse\n            or medical assistant at the health center. And finally, the\n            MOHP has seen the benefits of working closely with MASAF III."}, "docdt": "2004-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
