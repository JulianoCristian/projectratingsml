approach by the government to population/family planning\n            services provision in three pilot districts. There are four\n            components. The first, community-based distribution,\n            recruits community-based distribution agents (CBDAs) to\n            distribute contraceptives; provides supervision by CBDA\n            supervisors, health centers, family planning coordinators,\n            and the district health management team (DHMT); funds an\n            incentive package for the CBDAs, plus salaries, motorcycles,\n            and motor vehicles; and finances a wide mix of contraceptive\n            products. Component 2 supports the development, pre-testing,\n            production, and dissemination of information, education, and\n            communication materials (IEC); distributes materials in\n            local languages on the advantages and safety of family\n            planning (FP) and the dangers of STDs/AIDS; modifies\n            attitudes towards youth reproductive needs; and provides\n            training. Component 3 improves the capacity of health\n            professionals to support FP services through clinical\n            training; provides clinical supervision to CBDAs; supports\n            the FP coordinator; and manages the contraceptive logistics\n            system. Component 4 develops standard training protocols for\n            service skills, counseling, supervision, and performance\n            assessments for CBDAs and their supervisors; trains service\n            providers and their supervisors; and disseminates\n            educational messages."}, "docdt": "1998-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
