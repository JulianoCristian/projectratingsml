MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR AN EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for US$40 million to help finance a project for export development. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest rate for US-dollar denominated single currency
loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years' grace.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Following the oil crisis, Jordan's economy stagnated between 1985
and 1989, with GDP declining at an annual average of 1.2 percent. In 1989 the Government adopted a
stabilization program to liberalize and deregulate the economy and reduce budget deficits. The Paris and the
London Clubs rescheduled Jordan's external debt payments. As a result, GDP grew at an average of 6 percent
betwecn 1992 and 1994, inflation fell below 5 percent, unemployment was reduced from 25 to 15 percent,
and external debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 190 percent in 1990 to 120 percent.
3.    While Jordan's macroeconomic performance has improved substantially, the country still faces major
challenges in maintaining its positive economic momentum. The main factors that have supported its balance
of payments and public investments-remittances, official grants and concessional assistance, and regional
trade under noncompetitive protocol trade arrangements-can no longer be relied on as a basis for sustainable
growth. With a small domestic market and limited employment opportunities in regional markets, Jordan
needs to raise exports through an aggressive strategy to promote investment and international competitiveness.
4.    Export Sector. In 1994 the value of Jordan's exports was about one-third that of imports despite 6
percent annual real export growth between 1990 and 1994. Jordan's exports are concentrated on phosphate
and potash-based products (36 percent of all exports in 1994).  While nontraditional exports rose
significantly-from -2 percent per annum in real terms between 1985 and 1990 to 10 percent between 1991
and 1994, Jordan needs to accelerate this momentum. The regional peace process and potential European
Union partnership status and WTO membership provide Jordan unprecedented opportunities to integrate into
the global economy and exploit the benefits of rapidly expanding world trade. To capture this opportunity,
Jordan must foster an enabling policy regime, coupled with institutional and financial reforms and firm-level
support measures, to maintain the momentum of investment and growth, enable the private sector to expand
productive capacity, and acquire the technology and skills required for international competitiveness.
5.    Jordanian firms have been shielded from international competition. While Jordan's tariff regime has
improved in the last five years as tariffs were lowered, import restrictions and price controls lifted, and bans
reduced, it remains highly protective. Compensatory schemes, such as duty drawback and temporary entry,
are uncompetitive by international standards, complex, and non-transparent. The free trade zone regime does
not allow the private sector to develop export processing zones. Customs valuation is discretionary; import
and export clearances are lengthy, increasing transaction costs. The political climate in the region and a non-
transparent investment regime, biased against non-Arab investors, have limited Jordan's attractiveness to
foreign direct investment (FDI). Weak metrology, standards, testing, and quality management infrastructure
has been a barrier to meeting product and certification standards required by the world market. Product and
market diversification has remained marginal, and firms have not developed know-how in producing for, or
selling in, more demanding markets. While Jordan has a well established financial system, access to term
finance has been limited by the rigidities of the financial sector and the absence of term-lending instruments.
6.    Government Strategy. The centerpiece of the Government's strategy is private-sector led, outward-
oriented growth. The strategy has three main thrusts: (i) policy reforms to create an enabling environment



2
for the private sector to develop; (ii) administrative and institutional reforms and support at the firm level to
enhance international competitiveness; and (iii) reforms to deepen the financial sector.
7.     These reforms are outlined in the Government's September 1995 Letter of Development Policy for
the Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL, Loan 3947-JO). On the policy side, with support from
ERDL, Jordan has reduced maximum tariffs from 70 to 50 percent and border taxes on about 500 capital
goods categories, and has removed most tariff exemptions. Parliament recently enacted a new Investment
Law, for which IBRD and FIAS provided advice. The law provides uniform treatment of Arab and non-Arab
investors, substantially removes restrictions on foreign ownership, introduces transparency of incentives, and
replaces tax holidays with lower corporate taxes. Parliament has also amended the Income Tax Law to lower
maximum corporate tax rates from 55 to 35 percent. The Government, under the proposed ERDL II, plans
to further trade reforms, accelerate privatization, and reduce regulatory and administrative constraints to
private-sector growth.
8.    The Government also recognizes that trade liberalization, financial sector reforms, and the other broad
economic policy changes will not themselves deliver sustained growth, and that measures need to be put in
place to generate a speedy and effective supply response. To this end, it has prepared an Export Sector
Development Program (ESDP) and presented it in a Letter of Export Sector Development Policy to the Bank
on March 7, 1996. The Government states its commitment to the Program in the Letter and sets out the
specific legislative, institutional, administrative, and financial reforms and support measures it intends to
implement in order to enhance the international competitiveness of Jordanian firms. These actions include:
e     Reducing transaction costs to firms by simplifying import and export procedures, including Customs.
The Government is drafting a new Customs Law to meet international standards and the requirements
of proposed EU partnership and WTO membership. Customs operations will be simplified and a self-
declaration system adopted; clearance times reduced; duty drawback and temporary entry procedures
made more export-friendly; a reference-based price system established to reduce valuation disputes;
Customs operations automated; and training provided to Customs officials. The Government also
plans to amend the Free Zone Law to allow the private sector to develop and manage export-oriented
free trade zones for manufacturing and services. The German Government, through GTZ, has
provided grant financing to assist the Government in carrying out these actions.
*     Raising product standards by strengthening the Jordan Standards Institution, obtaining international
accreditation of product testing laboratories, establishing a calibration system, facilitating ISO 9000
certification services, and establishing a Standards Extension Service to help firms raise the quality
of their products to international standards. Partial funding for the program is provided by GTZ, and
the Government of Canada has expressed interest in participating.
*     Improving product quality and diversity, and market penetration and retention through a matching
cost-sharing program for exporters to secure services of export consultants and marketing firms. The
EU has offered grant financing for the program.
*     Increasing the level of investments, particularly FDI, by simplifying procedures and strengthening the
newly established autonomous Investment Promotion Corporation to facilitate and promote
investments. USAID is providing grant funds to support this objective.
9.    As the third thrust of its strategy, the Government is deepening financial markets and improving inter-
mediation efficiency. The banking system has been strengthened by the adoption of the Basle norms for
capital adequacy. Prudential lending guidelines are in place, and loan loss-provisioning has increased; on- and



3
off-site supervision have been strengthened; and bad loans have fallen to less than 6 percent of outstanding
loans. Interest rates have been deregulated, and direct credit controls are being replaced by indirect monetary
control. The Government, with support from the proposed ERDL II, intends to enhance competition by
eliminating the privileges of specialized banks and removing reserve requirements on inter-bank deposits. To
mobilize long-term savings, the Government plans to reform capital markets, strengthen contractual savings
institutions, and institute policy and regulatory reforms to allow private management of social security and
pensions.
10.   The trade and investment reforms supported by ERDL operations will motivate firms to upgrade
product quality and production capacity. These reforms, coupled with increased export opportunities, should
lead to significant new investments in the productive sectors and raise demand for term borrowing to finance
them. Machinery and equipment investment has doubled in the last four years and is projected to be about
US$4 billion between now and 2000; a survey of Jordanian firms and private banks (para. 21) confirms
strong unmet demand for term finance. As the impact of the financial sector reforms will be felt only over
the medium term, an interim measure is needed to provide term finance to private firms to foster a supply
response.
11.   Project Objective and Description.  The principal objective of the project is to support the
Government's Export Sector Development Program, which aims at enhancing the international competitiveness
of Jordanian exports and thereby increasing export revenues. The immediate objective of the project is to help
private firms expand their productive capacity through a credit line for term lending. The benefits of the
project would be monitored through a set of indicators agreed on with the Government (para. 22).
12.   The credit line would provide private banks access to term resources at market rates to finance
medium- and longer-term investments in plant and machinery in productive activities other than real estate and
housing construction. CBJ would be the Government's fiscal agent, onlending funds from the credit line to
strong, commercially viable, private participating banks (PBs) in US dollars or Jordanian dinars (JD) at
interest rates reflecting market conditions. Under current conditions, the US dollar onlending rate would be
LIBOR plus a spread of 100 basis points, and the JD onlending rate would be the Jordanian Treasury Bill rate
plus 50 basis points. The CBJ would review and adjust onlending rates every six months, as required. Funds
would be onlent on a first-come, first-serve basis to PBs under subsidiary financing agreements with CBJ.
To date, CBJ has prequalified six banks as potential borrowers; they have confirmed their intention to enter
into subsidiary financing agreements with CBJ. These banks account for 30 percent of the assets of licensed
banks, 35 percent of loans, 36 percent of deposits. and are well capitalized and profitable. Returns on equity
range from 5 to 23 percent.
13.   The PBs would make subloans to private borrowers in US dollars or JD at terms to be freely
determined, and bear the credit risk on the amounts onlent and commitment charges. Subborrowers would
be required to have total debt:equity ratios below 2:1 and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1:3. The
maximum repayment period for the subloans would be 7 years, including up to 3 years grace. The maximum
size of the subloans would be US$2 million. The credit line is expected to finance about 80 projects, with
an average subloan size of US$500,000. The subprojects would be required to have a minimum projected
financial rate of return of 15 percent.
14.   Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$60 million, with an estimated
foreign exchange component of US$40 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million would finance 67
percent of project cost, net of duties and taxes, and 100 percent of foreign costs. Private firms benefiting
from subloans would contribute US$20 million. Project cost breakdown and financing plans are shown in
Schedule A. Procurement arrangements and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key



4
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Jordan are given in Schedules C and D. A Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 14935-JO), dated March 7, 1996, is being distributed separately.
15.   Implementation. The CBJ will implement the project; for this purpose CBJ has established a two-
person unit, supervised by the Executive Manager, External Debts and Agreements Department. The unit will
monitor project performance, accounts, expenditures, costs, and compliance with Bank guidelines; it will
forward all withdrawal applications, reports and other documentation to the Bank. A detailed Implementation
Plan, covering operating guidelines and monitorable indicators, has been prepared. Monitoring indicators
include number of jobs created by the subprojects financed (para. 22).
16.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The Bank has not been involved in an industrial
credit finance operation in Jordan since the late 1970s; however, the lessons of Bank experience with such
operations in other countries are reflected in the design of the project. Specifically, the funds would be onlent
to eligible private banks at market interest rates on a first-come, first-serve basis, and the participating banks
would price the subloans freely. In addition, the macroeconomic environment is stable, inflation is low,
interest rates are deregulated, and the credit line would not be distortionary. Bank experience also shows that
prospects for achieving sustainable export competitiveness are greatly enhanced through a comprehensive
approach covering relevant policy and institutional reforms, support mechanisms to improve technical and
marketing know-how at the firm level, and availability of investment financing. The parallel implementation
of this project with the rest of the Govermnent's Export Sector Development Program, complemented by
policy reforms supported by ERDL operations, provides such an approach.
17.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project builds on the work done by the Bank on the industry
and export sectors and policy reforms in Jordan' and is fully consistent with the Bank Group Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on October 24, 1995. The CAS reflects the Government's
central theme: promoting private-sector led, rapid and sustainable outward-oriented growth as a vehicle for
reducing poverty and unemployment. The project supports this objective by helping firms expand their
productive capacity and export potential. The Bank was also closely involved with the Jordanian public and
private sectors in preparing the Government's Export Sector Development Program. The project is an integral
part of this Program. In addition, the Bank played a catalytic role in attracting grant financing from donors
for the other components of the Program. The project will also support IFC's strategy of developing Jordan's
capital markets through new financial institutions, instruments, and services, including investments in a credit
rating agency, and possible support for establishing a leasing company in Jordan.
18.    Project Sustainability. The project would enhance the capacity of participating banks to provide term
finance and to lend in foreign exchange. It would thereby create a base for increased longer-term lending
under the financial sector reforms that will be deepened under support from ERDL II. To help ensure
sustainability, the design of the credit line has been based on market conditions. Also, it is expected that the
credit line will serve as a catalyst to stimulate term finance by the banks. However, as the financial markets
are not yet sufficiently deep and term transformation limited, further support through credit lines may be
needed until the financial sector reforms take hold.
19.    Agreements Reached. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would cause
CBJ to: (a) every six months review and adjust US dollar and JD onlending rates to reflect market conditions;
(b) implement the project in accordance with the eligibility criteria and operating procedures for PBs, sub-
I/    Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3142-JO, 1989); "Export Incentives and Technological
Capabilities' (Report No. 10228-JO, 1992); Economic Reform and Development Loan (Ln. 3947-JO,
1995); and "Private Sector Assessment" (Report No. 14405-JO, 1995).



5
borrowers and subprojects, and monitorable indicators; and (c) carry out a Mid-Term Review on or about Jan-
uary 1998 to assess progress and introduce any required measures to improve project execution. Signing of
subsidiary financing agreements between CBJ and at least two prequalified banks to serve as participating
banks is a condition of loan effectiveness.
20.    Project Objective Categories and Enviromnental Impact. The project objective category is "Private
Sector Development." In view of the potential environmental impact of subprojects financed under the credit
line, the project is classified in Environmental Category "B". The PBs will ensure that each subproject
application under the credit. line will comply with enviromnental standards satisfactory to the Bank and
applicable laws and regulations of the Government relating to health, safety and environmental protection.
For this purpose, the Bank has prepared an environmental manual for use by PBs to screen subloan
applications for environmental impact of proposed subprojects.
21.    Participatory Approach. The project was prepared jointly with the Government, CBJ, private sector
firms, and banks. Interviews and group meetings were held with approximately 125 firms and 15 of Jordan's
21 commercial and investment banks. The eligibility criteria and operating procedures were developed with
CBJ, taking into account the results of the interviews, as well as Bank experience with credit lines. As part
of the Bank support to the Government in formulating its Export Sector Development Program, workshops
were held in December 1994 and January 1995 with public and private sector representatives on Jordan's
export performance, elements of modern Customs legislation, and international competitiveness.
22.    Project Benefits. The project would give Jordanian firms a timely opportunity to enhance their
competitiveness and productive capacity to enable them to participate more effectively in the global
economy-either directly or through joint ventures with regional or extra-regional partners. Approximately
80 firms would receive subloans to make the investments necessary to develop capacity to exploit export
opportunities. In addition to increasing trade integration, it is expected that these investments would generate
about 1,000 additional jobs, thereby raising total employment. Another benefit of the project would be to
improve access to term lending. The participation of private banks in the project would also improve financial
intermediation, enhance financial sector competition, and build project-financing capabilities. The eligibility
criteria for subprojects include a minimum financial rate of return of 15 percent, which is considered a good
proxy for the economic rate of return of the project.
23.    Project Risks. Deterioration of macroeconomic conditions as a result of various factors, including
adverse capital movements, could delay disbursements. However, the risk is small given the commitment the
Government has demonstrated to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, including flexible
exchange and interest rate policies, under adjustment programs supported by the Bank and IMF. Additionally,
Jordanian banks are relatively new to project appraisal and term lending techniques. This risk will be
addressed through close Bank supervision-including a project launch seminar-clearly specified operating
guidelines and eligibility criteria, and training of selected PB staff in project appraisal seminars.
24.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
