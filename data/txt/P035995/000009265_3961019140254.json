competitiveness of Jordanian exports and\n            increasing export revenues. The immediate objective of the\n            project is to help private firms expand their productive\n            capacity through a credit line for term lending. The major\n            component of the project is a line of credit under which\n            subloans will finance the following: 1) viable medium- and\n            longer-term investments in plant and machinery in productive\n            activities; 2) permanent working capital, marketing and\n            training associated with new investments; and 3) investments\n            in energy conservation and pollution control equipment."}, "docdt": "1996-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
