were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that clarity is\n            needed on the indicators and instruments to measure progress\n            or compliance and avoid unnecessary friction. The Bank\n            should also be clear about the communication channels\n            between partners and about their results frameworks. The\n            Bank should better define responsibilities for internal Bank\n            coordination and for communication with the authorities and\n            partners. Programmatic approaches require a longer time\n            horizon and strengthened monitoring and evaluation tools.\n            Studies which are part of the loan conditionalities should\n            not be undertaken by units of the Bank group.
