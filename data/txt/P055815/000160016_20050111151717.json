The main lessons are: 1) Tunisia's\n            successful economic performance has been due to three\n            attributes: ownership and broad political consensus, a\n            well-developed human resource base, and a stable\n            macroeconomic environment. 2)  Experience in privatization\n            and the financial sector shows the need for the Bank and the\n            development partners to stay the course and show flexibility\n            in their support, provided there is evidence of genuine and\n            sustained reform efforts. For example, by accepting partial\n            reforms in some areas, and building on partial successes to\n            deepen them in subsequent operations, the support from the\n            Bank and other partners was ultimately effective. Patience,\n            perseverance and flexibility paid off. 3) An important\n            lesson for other small emerging countries seeking to lay the\n            foundations for sustainable growth and poverty reduction is\n            the success of Tunisia in creating a competitive economy by\n            the coordinated use o f macro and structural policies and reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
