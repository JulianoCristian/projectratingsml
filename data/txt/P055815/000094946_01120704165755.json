Economic Competitiveness\n            Adjustment Loan Project (ECAL III) is the third in a series\n            of policy reform operations and supports the\n            Government's program to enhance the international\n            competitiveness of Tunisia's economy. It is aimed at\n            promoting private investment, strengthening the financial\n            sector, and liberalizing the information and communication\n            technology sector, while maintaining a stable macroeconomic\n            framework. The loan builds on reforms in the real sector\n            initiated under ECAL I (report no. P6890) and seeks to\n            deepen improvements in performance and efficiency in the\n            financial sector supported under ECAL II (report no. P7288).\n            In particular, ECAL III will benefit Tunisia's public\n            and private sectors through efficiency gains and a more\n            transparent investment climate, with continued disengagement\n            of the State from the economy. It will contribute to the\n            soundness and transparency of the financial sector, thereby\n            improving access to financial services for enterprises and\n            individuals while reducing the cost of these services. The\n            loan will also open the telecommunications sector to\n            competition and private participation, lowering prices, and\n            improving access to service for consumers. The loan will be\n            disbursed in one standard tranche and three floating\n            tranches. The release of the floating tranches will be\n            conditioned on continued satisfactory macroeconomic\n            performance, adequate implementation of the overall reform\n            program and of specific policy measures."}, "docdt": "2001-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
