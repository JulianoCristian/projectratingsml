MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF RENYA
FOR A FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya
for SDR 13.9 million (US$ 19.9 million equivalent) to help finance a
Forestry Development Project is submitted for approval. The proposed
Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. The
*         project would be cofinanced by grants from the European Economic Community
(US$ 15.8 million equivalent), the Overseas Development Administration (Us$
13.7 million equivalent), Swiss Development Corporation (US$ 5.6 million
*         equivalent) and the Finnish International Development Agency (US$ 6.0
million equivalent).
2.          Backgrounds  The Government of Kenya's (GOK) strategy for
economic growth, employment creation, and foreign exchange earnings depends
critically on a rapidly growing agricultural sector. Within this sector,
forestry plays an important role, producing economic, social and
environmental benefits. Forests regulate the flow of water, conserving the
soil mantle; they provide habitat for wildlife, the foundation of an
important tourist industry; they supply woodfuel, construction material and
numerous other commodities, such as fodder and fruit, to rural people.
However, Kenya's natural forests and woodlands have been continually
reduced due to their conversion to agricultural land caused by a fast-
growing population. The Forest Department (FD) lacks the capability to
protect the country's indigenous forests and fully develop industrial
plantations. Forestry research and education institutions are also
inadequate to generate the human resources and technology required. Also,
GOK's forest policy and most legislation are obsolete and in need of
revision. The proposed project is designed to overcome these constraints.
3.          Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The Bank's experience from
three forestry projects and the 1986-88 Forestry Sub-sector Review, IFC
investments of $86 million in pulp and paper production, as well as the
ongoing involvement in the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Operation (ASAO)
and support to the preparation of Government's National Arid and Semi-Arid
Lands Environmental Action Plan, place it in a strong position to assist
the Government in addressing sub-sectorwide issues. A Bank forestry
*         operation at this point is required to halt further deterioration of FD and
to initiate the institutional rebuilding process within a development
framework. The preparation of the proposed project has been a major effort
assisted by FAO-CP. IDA's involvement would ensure institutional building,
including technical assistance and training, to strengthen FD's technical
management and Government's capacity in policy planning and program
development. Aiming at structural changes in the sub-sector, it would be
consistent with important strategies agreed between Government and the Bank
within the ASAO framework.   The proposed project is one of a group of
projects designed to complement the proposed ASAO II which would deepen
policy reforms started under the first operation and begin new initiatives,
especially in stimulating smallholders' production, poverty reduction and
environmental actions. In addition, IDA would play an important role in
securing and coordinating cofinancing offered by other donors and providing
a long-term focus.



4.          The proposed project would be linked to the Bank's involvement
in other interrelated sectors in Kenya - population, land utilization,
environment and household energy. Kenya's environmental problems stem
largely from population pressures on its limited land resources. The Bank
has been involved, in conjunction with GOK and other donors, in studies on
land use and the environment and other input needed to assist GOK to
formulate land use plans and a National Environmental Action Program. It
has also been active in assisting GOK's program to reduce population
growth, which is one of the world's highest. The Bank also supports GOK's
program to promote the production and efficient usage of household fuels,
namely charcoal and fuelvood.
5.          Project Objectives. The proposed project has four main
objectivest (a) to enhance conservation and protection of indigenous forest
resources as well as of soil and water on forest, farm and range land; (b)
to alleviate the accelerating fuelwood deficiency; (c) to improve the
efficiency of timber production, including expansion of the revenue base
from industrial forest plantations; and (d) to establish a framework for
the subsector's long-term development. It would constitute the first phase
of a re-directed, broad-based subsector development program and provide
donors with a long-term plan for their assistance.
6.          Proiect Description.  The project would include investments
over a 6-year period to: (a) promote, on a pilot basis mainly, tree farming
through intensified extension services to smallholders and rural
communities and support to non-government organizations (NGOs); (b) improve
indigenous forest conservation, protection and management in the gazetted
and ungazetted forest areas; (c) improve the physical and financial
management of the existing 170,000 ha of industrial plantations; (d)
strengthen the institutional capacity of FD through physical investments,
training, management support and technical assistance; (e) upgrade forest
research and technical forestry education; and (f) prepare a comprehensive,
long-term Forestry Master Plan, including prerequisite studies and surveys.
The components to improve indigenous forest and industrial plantations
management include a program to rehabilitate 2,340 km. of existing forest
roads and their maintenance.
7.          The project would build on the experience of the three
previous forestry projects financed by the World Bank Group. The lessons
learned point to the importance of strengthening project management with
appropriate technical assistance, improving the efficiency of PD's labor,
providing an adequate and balanced budget structure for forest operations
and developing a forest policy to guide subsectoral development. The
project design incorporates the above lessons. The proposed project also
departs from the narrow approach of past projects (focussed on industrial
plantations) to include components that address subsectorwide issues.
8.            The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 83.8
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 44.6 million (532). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in



Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No.9005-KE dated November 19, 1990 is also attached.
9.          Agreed Actions.  (i) The Forest Department's (FD) industrial
plantations are a substantial source of income. However, the collection of
royalties on stumpage has been low; in 1988 and 1989, the actual revenue
collected was less than 502 of estimated royalties. The reasons are laxity
in collection, and the method of royalty assessment and pricing. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOK that the FD would complete
a review of the method of royalty assessment and introduce improved methods
for the calculation of stumpage rates by September 30, 1991. A key project
performance indicator would be royalty collection and would be reviewed,
together with other indicators, annually and during the project mid-term
review. GOK agreed at negotiations to hold the mid-term review before June
30, 1994. (ii) The low productivity of permanently employed PD labor has
been a serious issue in previous projects. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from GOK that an action plan satisfactory to IDA outlining
measures to improve the productivity of its permanently employed labor
force would be prepared by June 30, 1991 and its implementation would
commence by September 30, 1991. (iii) To remove existing disincentives to
smallholder tree farming and commercial fuelwood growing, GOK also agreed
at negotiations to prepare by June 30, 1991 an action plan which would
include measures to increase FD fuelvood and pole sales prices to market
price levels by the mid-term review. (iv) The Government's Forest Policy
dates back 20 years and is obsolete. A new subsector policy is urgently
needed to redefine the mandates of the various agencies active in the
subsector and to respond to the changed priorities. As a first step in
this process, assurances were obtained from GOK during negotiations that it
would prepare an updated Forest Policy Framework by July 31, 1991. After
the Forestry Master Plan is completed, the framework paper would be
developed into a full Forest Policy Statement to be adopted by mid-1993.
Other assurances were obtained regarding preparation of a framework to
promote private industrial plantations by the mid-term review; preparation
and submission of annual work plans and budgets; handling of FD's accounts;
annual reviews of project progress by IDA; and pricing of seedlings.
Conditions of effectiveness are: (a) finalization of arrangements with a
suitable organization for management strengthening at PD headquarters; (b)
finalization of the annual work plan for the first full project fiscal
year; (c) completion of a study on the productivity and profile of FD's
labor force; (d) submission to IDA of the outstanding audit reports for the
Forestry III Project; and (e) completion of consolidated offices for FD
headquarter staff so that the department can be fully operational and start
project implementation.
10.         Benefits.  The project would generate direct production
benefits from two sources. The first would be the incremental production
of plantation-grown timber, which is estimated to yield an economic rate of
return of 17X. This would be the only timber extraction activity included
in the project. The second would be from increased tree planting by
farmers as a result of intensified extension services in the pilot
districts. The project would also have a major environmental impact.
Benefits from the conservation of indigenous forests include the
preservation of gene pools, protection of wildlife and identification of



- 4 -
bio-diversity reserves. The conservation of forests in water catchments
would result in reduction in soil erosion, sedimentation and water run-off,
benefiting downstream users and ecosystems. An inventory of the natural
forests would furnish information not only on tree species and volumes but
also on their ecological importance. This would form the basis for the
preparation of forest management plans.   Expanded planting of trees on
marginal, degraded or fallow sites on farms, as well as boundary planting
and the general integration of forestry into agriculture and livestock
farming systems would prevent soil erosion, maintain soil fertility and
2.z crease the country's tree coverage. Women would be the principal
beneficiaries of the farm forestry component, which would increase the
production of fuelwood and fodder close to home. Gathering fuelwood and
fodder is a task of women in rural areas and they frequently have to walk
long distances to collect them.
11.         Risks.  The weak implementation capacity of the FD would pose
the main risk. This would be minimized through measures of institutional
strengthening comprising inservice training, employment of a management
team and other technical assistance, and establishment of management and
reporting systems. The risk of inadequate allocation of Government funds
would be reduced through joint reriews with IDA on annual budgets for the
project and related services. Government has made sufficient budgetary
allocations for the first project year. A third risk arises from the
involvement of several ministries in the project. This risk would be
minimized through the establishment of the Project Steering Committee to
ensure interministerial and donor coordination.
12.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
