deficiency; (c) to improve the efficiency of timber\n            production; and (d) to establish a framework for the\n            subsector's long-term development.  The project\n            includes investments to: (a) promote tree farming through\n            intensified extension services to smallholders and rural\n            communities and support to nongovernmental organizations;\n            (b) improve indigenous forest conservation, protection and\n            management in the gazetted and ungazetted forest areas; (c)\n            improve the physical and financial management of the\n            existing industrial plantations; (d) strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of the Forest Department (FD) through\n            physical investments, training, management support and\n            technical assistance; (e) upgrade forest research and\n            technical forestry education; and (f) prepare a\n            comprehensive, long-term Forestry Master Plan, including\n            prerequisite studies and surveys."}, "docdt": "1991-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
