Kenya (the Borrower) and the International Development Association
(the Association), and to various discussions held between the staff
of our Resident Mission in Nairobi and officials of the Kenya
Government with regard to the financing of civil works.
     This letter is to inform you of the Association's proposal to
amend IDA's share of costs for civil works.  Consequently, Category
3 (Civil Works) of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the
Development Credit Agreement is amended as follows:
                   Amount of the
                   Credit Allocated          % of
                   (Expressed in SDR         Expenditures
 "Category         Equivalent)               to be Financed
(3) Civil Works    2,510,000                 90% up to an
                                             aggregate of
                                             SDR 2,000,000
                                             50% thereafter"
     Please confirm your acceptance to the foregoing amendment by
countersigning and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and
returning it to us.  This amendment shall be effective as of October
30, 1992.
