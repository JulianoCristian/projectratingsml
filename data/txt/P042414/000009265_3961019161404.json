generate income transfers in rural communities - in which\n            education and health services will be reinforced by the\n            other two sister projects - through the use of\n            labor-intensive techniques; 2) to set up a body that will\n            have the permanent capacity to monitor and analyze the\n            socioeconomic standards of living of the population; and 3)\n            to raise public and political awareness of social issues,\n            their relation to economic growth, and the remedial action\n            required. In addition to providing specific actions in the\n            targeted rural areas of the thirteen selected provinces, the\n            project will amplify the impact of the other two projects\n            under the SPP/BAJ. It will include the following components:\n            1) reinforcement of the National Agency for Labor\n            Promotion's (Promotion Nationale) activities designed\n            to alleviate poverty; 2) creation of institutional and\n            technical tools needed to monitor and analyze social\n            conditions and implementation of programs whose aim is to\n            improve these conditions; and 3) assistance to a central\n            government body to coordinate the various actions undertaken\n            under the SPP and national social development strategy and\n            to provide feedback to decisionmakers."}, "docdt": "1996-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
