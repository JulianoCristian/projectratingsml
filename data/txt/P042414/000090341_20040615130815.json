PRIORITIES PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "loan_no": "4026", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            has proven that coordination at the central level is\n            cumbersome. A multisectoral approach in social development\n            interventions yields more significant and durable results.\n            However, this approach is complex to manage and requires\n            engagement and commitment of all levels of government\n            (central and local), sectoral ministries as well as the\n            civic society. The project correctly foresaw the need to\n            assist the government in establishing a reliable system. The\n            effectiveness of the system will depend on the\n            government's maintaining its interest in using the data\n            and in strengthening data collection processes as well as\n            its interest in making the data readily available to users.\n            The late execution of the establishment of the PMIS under\n            the project is one of the key factors handicapping the\n            monitoring of Social Priorities Program/Social Priorities\n            Programs (SPP/BAJ). As unemployment and underemployment\n            remain the biggest problems confronting the Moroccan\n            government, Bank-supported programs/projects should view the\n            PN as a potential partner in order not to miss the\n            employment-generating opportunities offered by PN\n            implementation methods. Even though the legal covenant set\n            under the project has a valid objective, i.e. to reorient PN\n            activities in favor of activities aiming at reducing\n            poverty, it is not realistically feasible without having\n            parallel mechanisms to provide income to the category of\n            workers associated with the jobs of temporary nature (EOO)."}, "docdt": "2004-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
