is to assist\n            the Government to optimize the development of the Seme oil\n            field. The field is being developed by Saga Petroleum Benin\n            (SPB), a Norwegian oil company, under a service contract\n            with the Government of Benin (Phase I). Specifically, the\n            project will permit further development of the proven\n            reserves and delineation of possible extensions to the\n            reservoir (Phase II). The project includes: (i) the drilling\n            of five development wells and two confirmation wells; (ii)\n            the installation of three monopod structures and an\n            integrated wellhead/production platform; and (iii)\n            modifications to Phase I installations. Other project\n            components include: (iv) consultancy services for detailed\n            engineering and supervision during construction. Specialized\n            consultants will also be hired to assist the Government in\n            monitoring SPB's activities, evaluating gas reserves\n            and studying the economics of their utilization; and (v)\n            training of Beninese professionals in the petroleum sector."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
