The project in itself was successful.\n            Government's losses incurred during first phase were\n            partially palliated, during the Bank-financed second phase,\n            through both: (a) an increase in oil production through the\n            addition of five producing wells; and (b) an increase in its\n            share from oil production revenues through the new financing\n            agreement with first phase lenders. Profit of the second\n            phase was made possible partly because most of the costly\n            production installations and facilities had been financed\n            under first phase. In a similar process, any further\n            development efforts, consisting of putting in production new\n            reservoirs, will increase oil production significantly at\n            low cost. The association and the European investment bank\n            undertook to finance this second phase of development. The\n            main components of the credit consisted of: (a) drilling of\n            seven wells; and (b) improvement of production facilities."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
