                      MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT


       SUBJECT:       Project Completion Report on Benin
                      Seme Oil Field Develo~mentProject (Credit 1503-BEN1


                      Attached is the "Project Completion Report on-Benin- Seme Oil Field
       Development Project (Credit 1503-BEN)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office,
       with Part 11 contributed by the Borrower.                      The PCR clearly identifies the
       implementation problems encountered, and recotmends a reasonable course of action
       for the future.        Its presentation of the financial and economic benefit cost
       streams does not follow standard Bank format and is, therefore, somewhat
       confusing.

                      The project was to increase the output from a Government-owned
       offshore oil field which, in its initial development phase had encountered
       serious technical, mar.ageria1 and financial setbacks.                        Although the project
       produced only 60% of the anticipated output, and the average price for oil
       declined substantially over the project life, the economic rate of return for the
       new investment was acceptable, and the Government'e share of the oil produced was
       increased through a renegotiation of the production sharing contract. However,
       the initial field development was not a profitable undertaking, and the increase
       in output was insufficient to repay the total debt incurred by the Government for
       its development.

                      In the past year production has fallen and costs risen, to the point
       where current income no longer covers current costs. Given the likely continued
       decline in the volume of output, the Government should be advised to close down
       field operations and sell its drilling rig.                 The overall project performance is
       rated as satisfactory, but its euetainability is unlikely, and the institutional
       development is rated as substantial.

                      No audit ie planned.

      This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Seme Oil Field Development Project for
which Credit 1503-BEN in the amount of US$18 million was approved on May 19, 1984. The Credit
was closed on February 28, 1991, four years and five months behind schedule. The last disbursement
was on June 27, 1991.

      This PCR was prepared jointly by the Africa Region Technical Department, Industry and
Energy Division (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and ID),and the Borrower (Part 1').

      Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit
Agreement, supervisionreports, correspondencebetween the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda and miscellaneous technical reports.

                                       EVALUATION SUMMARX




 1.            In 1968, off the coast of the Republic of Benin, an American company discovered the
 Seme oil field, but considered it as marginal and relinquished it. In May 1979, under a service
contract, and a US$110 million loan, guaranteed by the Norwegian Government, the Government
entrusted the field development to the Norwegian oil company SAGA (paragraphs 1.4-13).

2.             The field was developed, and came into production in 1982, with an initial production of
5,000 barrels per day (bopd). However, it soon appeared that production could be increased through
a second phase of field development (paragraph 1.10).



3.             The Association and the European Investment Bank undertook to finance this second
phase of development. The main components of the Credit consisted of: (a) drilling of seven wells;
and (b) improvement of production facilities (Paragraph 1.17).

h~lementationof the Proiect

4.             Between 1984 and 1985 two successful wells were drilled, and production was increased
to an average of 7,000 bopd in 1985. However, Government's share remained limited to about 7
percent of production, the remaining part going to debt-servicing and excessive operating costs
incurred by the Norwegian company. It should be noted that the Norwegian government agreed, in
1992, to forgive 50 percent of the lingering debt and to reschedule the remaining part with a ten year
grace period (paragraphs 1.24-1.33).

5.             After an interlude, during which the SAGA contract was cancelled and an oil sharing
agreement was reached with an American oil company (which did not honor its commitments), the
Government entrusted the production of Seme field to the American independent oil company
Ashland. The operator drilled three more development wells, which partially palliated production
decline from old wells (paragraphs 1.34-1A).

6.             During the interlude, a negotiation of the financial arrangements with Phase I lenders-
in which the B a d played a decisive role resulted in increasing Government's share of production
                                           -
from 7 percent to 20 percent (paragraphs 1.47-1.51).

Results

7.            The project in itself was successful. Government's losses incurred during Phase I were
partially palliated, during the Bank-financed Phase II, through both: (a) an increase in oil production
through the addition of five producing wells; and (b) an increase in its share from oil production
revenues through the new financing agreement with Phase I lenders. The current rate of return for

 the project, approximately 40 percent (see part 111, paragraph 6C), is below the 60 percent estimated
 at appraisal but is still an acceptable result. Government revenues mentioned in (a) and (b) above
 were included in the calculation of the rate of the return. Profit of Phase I1 was made possible partly
 because most of the costly production installations and facilities had been financed under phase I. In
 a similar process, any further development efforts, consisting of putting in production new reservoirs,
 would increase oil production significantly at low cost (paragraph 1.53).

 8.            From the beginning of production in 1982 until August 1991, debt service and inflated
 operating costs left the Government with a total revenue of US$46.8 million (including royalties and
 incomes) out of an aggregate income from oil sales of US283.9 million, and aggregate expenditures
 in excess of US250 million. Government financial participation in the project was U S 2 7 million
 during the same period. The Net Present Value of Government's Phase I and I1 investments,
 evaluated with a 10 percent discount factor, is minus US$146 million. Considering only the revenue
 in cash obtained by the government from Phase I1 (not including the financial cost related to Phase I
 loan capital) the net present value of the government, from 1984 to 1994, calculated with a 10 percent
discount factor, is U.S.$ minus 15 million (paragraphs 1.54-1.55 and part 111paragraph F).



9.             The Government's revenues stemming from the production of the Seme field will not
outlast the life of the field. The forecasted life of the field, as it is presently developed, does not
extend beyond the year 1993. Development of deep reservoirs could prolong the economic life of the
field into the next decade (paragraph 1.57).



 10.           Before entering into a service contract with Saga, the Government had vainly attempted
to find an oil company willing to enter into a development contract for the Seme field. At that time,
based on its wide knowledge of the oil industry, the Bank should have assisted the Government in its
search for a suitable partner, with financing capability and technical qualifications to develop the field
under a concession or an oil-sharing contract.

11.            During the prolonged preparation of the project, the Bank was apprised of SPB's
arrangement, including the excessive number of Norwegian expatriates maintained in Benin, and the
company's unreasonable operating costs, mainly related to the purchase of a drilling platform, the
Amazone. Decreasing the number of expatriates and streamlining the operating costs (inter alia by
selling 'the Amazone) should have been included as preliminary conditions of the project.

12.            The rate of return of Phase I is approximately 12 percent, which is less than half of the
rate of return of the Bank's project. Furthermore, this positive rate of return is artificial since it
stems from: (a) SAGA'S exaggerated initial rate of production (see Appendix 2); and (b) the
currently high international price of petroleum products. The high rate of production, which probably
damaged the reservoir and was responsible for the sharp decline in field production, resulted in high
initial benefits - the main source of the fair rate of return of Phase I  - butwas actually detrimental to
the overall rate of recovery of the field and to the government's interest.

13.            Although slowed by the participation of the bank to the project, the pioduction decline
started as early as the end of 1985, and was confirmed during the following )ears: in 1989 the
production was half of the 1984 peak value (which had been reached at the end of the first year of
production). The operating costs (deriving partly from the utilization of the amazone platform and

two supply boats as purchased by Saga) remained very high and the declining field revenues were at
best marginal during this period. Since the "Projet P6trolier de Semewis currently losing money for
each barrel produced, the government should be advised to close the field immediately. The oil wells
should be equipped with light cement plugs, easy to drill through in case it was determined that the
wells could be reentered and production could be re-started.

14.           Under a new petroleum project, consultants are carrying out a work program aimed at
reducing operating costs, and promoting the development of the field (including exploring lateral
entrapment and deep reserves to the oil industry. This considerationshould not preclude the closure
of the field waiting on a (possible) new entrant which will be capable to operate an accurate diagnosis
of the field, provisionally closed or producing at a loss.

B. Background


 1.1.          Benin is a small, poor nation which had a population of 3.5 million in 1982 with an
estimated per capita GDP of US$280. Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,
accounts for 40 percent of GDP and 36 percent of foreign exchange earnings. There is a small
industrial sector consisting of a few @port substitution and agricultural processing plants. It
contributed an estimated 11 percent to GDP in 1982. The tertiary sector is dominated by trade and
transit activities that link economic activity in Benin to conditions existing in neighboring economies.

1.2.          Because of this economic status, Benin's energy consumption-230 kg of oil equivalent
per capita in 1982-was among the lowest in the world. Traditional fuels, primarily wood and
charcoal, satisfy 87 percent of energy needs, the rest being met by imported petroleum products (11
percent) and imported hydropower (2 percent). The country's major energy sources are dense forests
and savannahs, covering about 78,000 kn2, but their indiscriminate use is leading to rapid
deforestation near cities and villages.

1.3.          The hydrocarbon resources were not yet fully explored in 1982 and the Government
planned to promote acreage to foreign oil companies under an exploration promotion program
financed under Credit 1207-BEN. (see paragraph 6 below). The country's main sedimentary area
covers about 15,000 km2, of which only 2,000 km2 on the continental shelf (up to 200 meter water
in depth) seem to have a fair hydrocarbon potential. Benin's coastal basin belongs to the Dahomey
Embayment, a small geoIogical province different from neighboring basins in both its stratigraphic
sequence and tectonic features.

1.4.          Two foreign oil companies, Union Oil (1965-1972) and Shell Oil (1971-1975), had
explored for petroleum in offshore Benin, shooting 6,000 km of seismic lines and drilling nine
exploratory wells. In 1968, Union Oil discovered the Seme oil field 15 km off the coast in water
depths ranging from 20 to 54 m. In late 1973, it proposed a development plan to the Government but
negotiations fell through and Union Oil relinquished its exploration acreage, given the expected
internal rate of return of the development scheme by industry standards under the applicable fiscal

 terms. For the same reason, subsequent negotiations with several oil companies did not bring about
 an agreement to develop the Seme field on a concession basis.

 1.5.         The Government decided in 1978to develop the field on its own with the support of the
 Norwegian Government. In May 1979, the Government hired as operator under a service contract
 Saga Petroleum, A.S. (Saga), a private Norwegian oil company. Under its service contract, Saga
 became the Government's authorized agent for all field development, production and marketing
 operations, as well as for securing financing for the project. Saga had created a wholly-owned
 subsidiary, Saga Petroleum Benin A.S. (SPB), registered in Norway, with a branch office in Benin.

 1.6.         During that period, the Government repeatedly indicated that it was not seeking IDA
 financing for the initial phase of the Seme oil field development. However, in May 1979, the
 Government invited the Association to consider financing the second phase development of the field
 (see paragraph 9 below).

 1.7.         SPB employed 50 expatriates (with an extra 20 expatriates of contracting companies) and
 310 Beninese staff, including 104 technicians which were progressively trained under the Credit 1207-
BEN (see paragraph 7 above). Furthermore, rather than renting, the operator purchased heavy
equipment whenever necessary, such as thejack-up platform, the Amazone. Due to decisions such as
these, the operating costs were far above international industry standards.

 1.8.         The Government exerted its supervision of SPB through Government representatives
employed by SPB. These dual role of these representativesdid not allow them to have the autonomy
to effectively supervise SPB's activities.

 1.9.         Seme oil reserves appeared to be distributed in two independent fields: the main one,
North Seme, and a smaller one, South Seme. Saga envisaged the development of the fields in two
phases: Phase I, where 9.8 million barrels would have been recovered by natural depletion with six
wells, and Phase 11, originally envisaged as a secondary recovery project, where an additional 11.9
million barrels would be recovered by water injection.

1.10.         Phase I included mainly the constructionof a jack-up platform for drilling and carrying
out in-the-well operations (workovers), three wellhead platforms (PI to P3), and an onshore tank
farm. Owing to delays resulting from drillingof a dry well, and an accident with the jack-up
platform, the field started producing commercially only on October 31, 1982, and the first crude
shipment took place on 2 million barrels as of March 1, 1984. Production from five wells averaged
7,300 barrels per day in the months of January-March 1984. The rate of production was probably
excessive with regard to the preservation of the reservoirs, since the field production, after 1985,
never reached half of the 1984peak production.

1.11.        Investments for Phase I amounted to approximately USS133 million including the
financial costs (interest during construction was about USS19 million). The Government had invested
USS13 million equity in the project in 1980. A blend of commercial loans and export credits totalling
about USS120 mission were secured from Norwegian banks (USS112 million) with the guarantee of
the Norwegian Export Guarantee Institute (Guaranti-Instituttefor Ebportkreditt - GIEK), and a UK
bank (USS8 million) with the guarantee of the British Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD).
The balance of financing requirements (USS7 million) was obtained from the project cash flow. The
loans and export credits are repaid through a security arrangement, whereby all sales proceeds are
deposited in a trustee account managed by a Norwegian bank.

1.12.          The financial performance of Phase 1 had been unsatisfactory because of delays in
production and a drop in oil prices. At this stage, it would have been necessary to inject equity
capital in the project. In late 1982 and 1983, SPB was operating the field on a precarious cash-flow
basis, and its tight debt service lee small margin for delay andlor a decrease in revenues, resulting
from a decline of production, or a further drop of oil prices on the international market. In
December 1983, the Beninese Government and the Phase I lenders agreed to reschedule debt
payments.

1.13.          The production history and reservoir simulation studies indicated the existence of a
partial natural water drive, and consequentlythe above-mentioned secondary recovery project through
water or gas injection was not justified. On the other hand, a stepat confirmation well, drilled in
July 1983, had established the validity of a western extension of the field, of which development
would be financed under the Phase I1 project. Furthermore, this Phase also would include the
delineation of other potential field extensions identified to the north and the northwest of the field,
and the testing of a gas section in the deeper zone which had been penetrated by a production well
drilled in March 1983. Components of Phase I1 were accordingly modified.

C. Project Objectives and Description

1.14.          In July 1982, the Government, following up with its May 1979request, officially
applied for IDA and EIB assistance to finance Phase 11. However, due to a change in reservoir
behavior and interpretation, the definition of the final requested project scope was delayed until the
last quarter of 1983. The requested project was in logical continuation of the first-phase development
of the Seme field. Its basic objectivewas to fully develop the proven reserves, including western
extension of the field, and to delineatepossible additional reserves to ensure optimum development of
the field.

1.15.          Both institutions,IDA and EIB, agreed with the Government request, under the
provision that the financial structure existing under Phase I should be rehabilitated. The following
actions were requested: (a) setting up of a Project Unit within the Government, assisted by an
expatriate petroleum engineer-consultant, to closely monitor SPB's activities; (b) include amendments
in the SPB contract reflecting the role of the Project Unit; (c) strengthenthe financial structureof the
project by providing additional equity through the proposed IDA Credit; and (d) decrease the annual
debt service ratio by a rescheduling of Government's debt incurred under Phase I. These requests
were met before the Credit became effective.

1.16.         Two supplementary conditions--before Credit effectiveness--were included:(a) the
extension of the Phase I security atrangement to EIB's credit; and (b) the contributionof cash flow to
initial financing of Phase I1 (see paragraph 24 below).

1.17.         The Project comprised the following components:

        (a)          drilling of five development wells, which would increase the recovered
                     hydrocarbon by 5.2 million barrels over the following eight years;

        (b)          drilling of two confirmation wells, to prove the possible north and northwestern
                     extension of the field;

        (c)          modifications of Phase I installations to handle more liquid volume (emulsion
                     treatment equipment, booster pumps, electrical power generation etc.);

        (dl          monopod platforms would be constructed and installed to rapidly establish a
                     development well, and, if warranted by the results of evaluation wells, put in
                     production the two confirmation wells (see paragraph (b) above);

        (el          alternatively (see paragraph 20 below) (i) an integrated well and production
                     platform was to be constructed to accommodate the last three development wells
                     of the Phase II investment program and the confirmation well, if justified by
                     positive results of this latter well. The platform would also include incremental
                     production and living facilities; or (ii) if the results of the confirmation well were
                     negative, Phase II program would be reduced to the erection of three monopods to
                     put in production the last three development wells;

       (0            engineering and consulting services; and

       (g)           a training program aimed at a progressive substitutionof expatriates by local staff.


D. Project Design and Organization

1.18.         The project was prepared by studies and surveys financed under the Credit 1207-BEN,
which had been approved in February 1982 (Phase I1 feasibility study, Reservoir Optimization study,
3dimensional (3D) seismic survey etc., for a complete list, see Part 111 Section 6-D).The common
                                                                              -
preparation of the project by Bank's staff and Government's officials led to a clear foundation for the
project, which was apparently well understood by all relevant parties.

1.19.         The design of the project led to organizing its implementation in two stages: (a) the first
stage included the drilling of the first two development wells and the two confirmation wells. The
second stage would consist of either the construction of an integrated development platform and the
drilling from this platform of the three last development wells (if the results of the confirmation wells
were positive), or the constructionof three monopods to develop the three last development wells (if
the results of the confirmation wells were negative). In the second case, the project's cost would be
reduced.

1.20.         It was agreed that the Government would continue to employ SPB, under an amended
contract (see paragraph 15 above) as Project Management Service Company to assist in developing
and exploiting the Seme field. In addition to its headquarters in Cotonou, SPB would have a Phase I1
development management team based in Oslo, which would ensure the detailed engineering,
procurement and supervision during constructionand installations of Phase I1 production facilities.
This team would be dismantled with the installation of the integrated platform.

1.21.         In accordance with the Association's conditions (see paragraph 15 above) a Petroleum
Unit was created, which reported directly to the Minister of Industry, Mines and Energy. The main
tasks of the Unit were to supervise SPB's service contract and activities, and to serve as liaison with
SPB, financial institutions, Government's agencies. The Unit was staffed with Beninese professionals
having received both theoretical and on-the-job training under Credit 1207-BEN. It was assisted by a
consultant hired in June 1984.

1.22.        The project was estimated to cost US$45.3 million. This amount covered the case of the
construction of an integrated platform, provided the confirmation wells yielded positive results. In

 the event that results of the confirmation wells were negative, the integrated platform would be
 substituted by three monopods, and the project cost would be reduced to US$34.5 million.

 1.23.         As indicated above (see paragraph 12) the Seme project needed an equity injection,
 which the Government was not in a financial position to provide. The Association agreed to lend the
 Government US$18 million. The European Investment Bank (EIB) agreed to co-finance Phase I1 (in
 an approximate amount of US$15 million) to construct the production structures. The Government
 was to provide an equity contribution of USS4.8 million. It was further agreed during negotiation
 that the Government would make arrangements, if necessary, to contract other loans and supplier's
 credits for an amount of US$7.5 million. Conversely, in the event of a decrease in the project's cost
 brought on by negative results of the confirmation wells, the share of each donor would be reduced
 by about US$1 million and the Government's share decreased to US$3.5 million.

 E. Project Implementation

 1.24.        The starting of the Credit was delayed by lengthy negotiations of SPB's amended service
 contract. Nine months elapsed between the Credit's signing date and its effectiveness. The Credit
was declared effective on May 26, 1985.

 1.25.        In order to start the implementation of Phase I1 earlier, the Government and the trustee
guarantor (Guaranti-Instituttet for Eksportkreditt- GIEK) agreed to draw the following from the
Government's Phase I1 cash flow: (a) a US$5 million amount representing Government's equity
participation; and (b) a US$8 million advance which was to be repaid by the loans from EIB and the
Association.

 1.26.        SPB drilled a first production well, S-7, which was completed in late June and put in
production in July 1984. The well was tested at 3,200 bopd with pumping, and at 1,270 bopd at free
flow. The well was connected to the production network of the field.

 1.27.        After drilling the first well, however, SPB put on hold any further activities under Phase
11, on the grounds that its amended service contract had not yet been signed. Upon the insistenceof
both the Government and the trustee guarantor, and as its amended contract had been substantially
completed, SPB resumed its development activities in November 1984. The amended contract was
eventually signed on March 4, 1985.

1.28.         SPB resumed drilling the development well S-8 in mid-1985. Although S-8 encountered
the reservoir below the oillwater contact (OWC) and was dry, S-8A, deviated from S-8, was drilled
into the reservoir above the OWC and was put in production at a rate of 2,500 bopd.

1.29.         The delineation wells, SC-2 and SC-3, were drilled respectively in December 1984-
January 1985, and in September 1985respectively. Both wells were dry, as the reservoir was
encountered only a few feet below or over the oillwater contact. SC-2 was drilled to the gas zone.
The latter was not tested, however, because the drilling platform was required for workover
operationson the field.

1.30.         The field did not extend to the North as it was expected. Assumed extension was based
on interpretation of 3-D seismic results, due to unforeseen lateral changes of seismic wave velocity in
the terrain over the reservoir.

 1.31.        Both wells S7 and S8 substantially increased the production of the field. Although
 completed dry, both so-called confirmation wells SC2 and SC3 contributed to a thorough delineation
 of the northern portion of the field, since both had identified the oiltwater contact. Constructionof an
 integrated platform was not justified, after the delineation well established a smaller producing
 reservoir than originally anticipated. The project cost was decreased accordingly (see paragraph 23
 above). The request for a US$8 million Government advance was consequently canceled, and the
 EIB's share project financing was decreased.

 1.32.        In the meantime, constructionof platform P3 extension was completed, and all major
 equipment (including two additional generators, one diesel, one gas; one black oil separator, and a
 booster pump) was installed by September 1985.

 1.33.        By the end of 1984, the field had produced nearly seven million barrels of oil.
Burdened with high operating costs, which the Bank was pressing to decrease but with no significant
result, and debt-servicing, the Government share of sale proceeds was minimal (no more than 7
percent). High operating cost were combined with an excessive production rate, which probably
damaged the reservoir. The government was highly dissatisfied with SPB.

 1.34.        Less than six months after the signatureof the SPB contract, the Government informed
the Bank, through a letter dated August 27, 1985, that it had decided to substitute for SPB a new
entrant, the American company Pan Ocean.

 1.35.        According to press release, the Government had entered into a cooperation agreement
with Pan Ocean company for an amount of US$2 billion. In addition to the development of Seme
field within the framework of an oil-sharing contract, this agreement included other development
projects such as constructionof an internationalairport, a hydropower dam, roads and irrigation
networks.

1.36.         As far as the Credit's implementationwas concerned, this Government's unilateral action
resulted in the following: (a) a rupture of the contractual framework, since the Credit Agreement had
been entered into by the Bank with the Government, and not with a joint venture between the
Government and a foreign private company; (b) a breach of the Development Credit Agreement, since
neither the selection of the company nor the contractual arrangements with this company had been
submitted for agreement to the Association (both the company's selection and the contractual
arrangements were later found unsatisfactory to the Bank); (c) a breach of the security arrangement
with co-financiers; and (d) technical issues regarding the appropriate method for maintaining of Seme
field production during the change in operators.

1.37.         With the agreement of Phase I co-financiers and trustee guarantors, the disbursements
under the Credit were suspended on September 20, 1985. The Bank subsequently insisted that the
Government: (a) obtain information about the new company's financial solvency and technical
competence in offshore operations; and (b) modify the Pan Ocean contract substantiallyto provide
greater protection of the Government's interests.

1.38.        Pan Ocean had no experience in offshore fields development. Furthermore, during the
company's period of operations, a high turnover of the local management staff occurred, reflecting
the poor organizational capacity. During this period, the decrease of oil production and the increase
in water cut were detrimental to Seme field's ongoing and future production.

1.39.          Disappointedby the company's noncompliance with its financial and technical
commitments and promises, the Government rescinded Pan Ocean's contract on May 15, 1986. At
this point, if the implementation of the project was to be resumed at all, the Credit has to be re-
appraised.

1.40.          For future operations, the Government and the Association agreed that the interim
operator would be the Seme Project Unit. It would contract on short term basis with individual
personnel or labor contractor for necessary expatriates. In the meantime, the Government would seek
a competent international company to act as operator for the field under a joint venture or a service
contract.

1.41.          Following this period of uncertainty, it was necessary to reassess the most appropriate
development plan for the Seme field. The Bank requested that a reservoir engineering simulation
study be carried out (the main issue to be addressed in the study was the progressively higher water
cut). The results of the study would establish the groundwork for a revised development program to
be implemented by a new operator for the field.

1.42.         The previous Phase I lenders' security arrangement was cancelled by the Government in
August 1985. During the preparation of a new financial framework, the Association insisted that a
reasonable rate of return should accrue to the Government as a result of incremental investment,
rather than let the revenue be absorbed by the debt service to Phase I lenders. Through its
participation in meetings with lenders, guarantors and Government's representatives, the Association
played the role of honest broker. The Association suggested that the Government obtain the assistance
of a consultant to negotiate new financial arrangements agreeable to all parties concerned.

1.43.         Upon a written request from the Government, the Association agreed in November 1986
to resume partial disbursements (with a US$0.5 million ceiling). This funding was to assist the
Government in meeting the following conditionsset forth by the donors to resume disbursements: (a)
a new operator's agreement with a competent oil company; (b) agreement on a revised field
development plan; and (c) a formal agreement with Phase I co-financiers on the rescheduling of their
loans.

1.44.         In June 1987, the parties reached a full agreement with following major provisions: (a)
the Government share on sale proceeds would total 20 percent (including export tax); (b) interest and
principal were to be paid only with sale proceeds after deduction of Government's share and operating
costs, with a roll over of unpaid interest and principal; and (c) the Norwegian share of the debt (about
90 percent of the total) would be converted to non-recourse at the end of Seme field's economic life.
The financial agreements were eventually signed on May 27,1988. Agreements were later on
modified: the Norwegian Government agreed to forgive 50 percent of the debt and to reschedule the
remaining part with a ten year grace period.

1.45.         The consulting firm which had been selected to carry out the reservoir engineering study
of the Seme field (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above) presented its final report in August 1988. It
noted that water production in the field is a complex interaction of the natural advance of the aquifers,
coning and mechanical problems. The firm also concluded that further incremental reserves could be
produced by drilling three additional wells in both North and South Seme fields and installing larger
submersible pumps. Its proposed development program was accepted by the Bank.

1.46.         After establishing contact with 20 companies, the Government proposed the American
Ashland Oil company to the Association, in September 1987, as new operator for the development of

 the Seme oil field. The Association as well as the Phase I lenders and guarantors agreed with this
 choice. The contract was signed on April 28, 1988.

 1.47.        All preliminary conditionsbeing met, the Association resumed the disbursementsunder
 the Credit on June 21, 1988. After an interludeof more than two years, the project was back on its
 tracks.

 1.48.        Through its fully owned subsidiary Ashland Exploration (Benin) Inc., the operator
actively started its work with an expatriate team including five people. Between October 1988and
September 1990, in accordance with both the Credit Agreement commitments and the consultant's
recommendations, the new operator drilled three development wells which were successfully
completed (S-9 and S-10 on the Northern Seme, and S-11 on South Seme). Simultaneously, two
monopods structures were constructed and subsequentlytransported and installed in the field, on S-10
and S-11 producing wells.

 1.49.        Due to a sharp increaseof international drilling costs, the operator requested, and the
Bank accepted, a reallocation of funds between the Credit's categories. This reallocation, dated
March 3, 1989, is as follows:

                               Table 1.1 Reallocationof Credit Funds

TOTAL


1SO.         On February 26, 1991, the company Williams Brothers Engineering Company acquired
100 percent of the stock of Ashland Exploration (Benin) Inc. Through a guarantee letter dated March
9, 1990, the new owner committed his new subsidiary to perform its work in conformity with its
service contract, and to assign highly qualified and experienced personnel to the project. The
Government, however, decided not to extend the company's contract beyond its expiration date (April
28, 1991)and opted to negotiate a direct contract with the expatriates operating the oil field.



1.51.        The Government's profits derived from the project are two-fold: (a) increased petroleum
production resulting in enlarged revenues; and (b) increased Government share from 7 percent to 20
percent on overall production through modifications in the Phase 1co-lenders financing arrangement
(in which the Bank played a decisive role). Profits from both sources should be incorporated in the
estimationof the project's rate of return.

 1.52.         Up to the closing date of the Credit, (February 28, 1991), the Seme field had produced
 approxintately 16million barrels of oil, of which about 10 million were produced during the life of
 the project. A little more than 3 million barrels stemmed from the five production wells financed
 under the Credit. Oil sales amounted to USS57.2 million, of which the Government received
 USS11.2 million due to recurrent l&h o~eratiacosb and payment of Phase I debt service.

 1.53.         Taking into account the increased production of the field, resulting from the wells
 financed under the credit, the project's rate of return is almost 40 percent which compares favorably
 with the 60 percent forecasted at appraisal time.


 1.54.         The rate of return of the whole Seme development project, including the Bank
 intervention, is 15.4percent (see Appendix I), compared with 11 percent as assessed at the time of
appraisal. The same rate of return estimated without the Bank's participation, and with no
modification in the Phase I financial arrangement, is 12.3 percent. Government's profit, however,
was negative, due to both the debt service and Saga's excessive operating costs. While the net
present value, calculated with a 10percent discount factor, is minus USS146 million for Phases I and
11, it is only minus US15 million for Phase I1 alone. It should, however, be noted that the rate of
return figures are mathematically skewed by the irregular cash flows (more details are presented in
Part 111, pages 19 and 20, and Appendices 1-3).

1.55.          However, while recognizing that Saga's operating costs were excessive, it should be
noted that a significant part of the company's operating expenses remained in the country, under the
form of local expenses (hotels revenues, living allowances spent locally, transports, etc.), or products
purchased locally.

 1.56.         The training efforts carried out under both Credit 1,207-BEN and 1503-BEN achieved
their objectives, since the national staff of SPB managed the production of the Seme field by
themselves during a nearly three-year period.

Project Sustainability

1.57.          Production from the Seme field, as it is presently developed, is expected to cease before
1993, at a loss for the project. However, for a relatively low cost, deeper zones could be thoroughly
tested, and, if results of the tests are positive, developed. This would prolong the economic life of
the field into the next decade.




1.58.         The project was well conceived and prepared, since its objectives were met beyond
expectation. However, during the appraisal process, since the Bank had become familiar with the
conditions of the Seme field development, it should have been concerned from the start by SPB's poor
performance and its excessive operating costs. Decreasing SPB's operating costs to a level consistent
with international industry standard should have been a preliminary condition to the Credit.

1.59.         During the supervision phase, the role of an "honest broker" played by the Bank was
appreciated by the Government as well as by Phase I co-financiers. This role was instrumental in
reaching an agreement between all parties concerned. The resulting production allowed for a

 significant increase of Government's share in the hydrocarbon sales (from 7 percent to 20 percent)
 generating incremental revenues of about USS13 million.

 Borrower Performw

 1.60.         National professionals drew a maximum profit from the training program provided under
 both Credit 1027-BEN and Credit 1503-BEN. They made substantialprogress in technical and
 managerial areas throughout the implementationof both projects. Between May 15, 1986 (date of the
 rescission of Pan Ocean contract) and April 28, 1988(date of the signature of Ashland contract),
production of the Seme field and the sale of petroleum were satisfactorily managed by local
professionals.

 1.61.         The Borrower kept the Bank regularly informed about the contractors*development and
production activities, and, as a rule, followed the Credit covenants, with the notable exception of the
Pan Ocean interlude. The Borrower's action, however, was probably motivated partially by its
feeling that, under the Saga arrangement, the Government had taken all the risk but was getting little
benefit from the production in return. Ultimately, however, the Borrower's actions were detrimental
not only to the ultimate oil recovery from the field but also to the image of the country with the oil
industry.



1.62.         The implementation of the project was marked by a mutual acknowldegement between
the Government and the Bank for their respective technical competence. This reciprocal esteem
assisted in clearing the most delicate phases of the Project, while maintaining a constructive dialogue.

1.63.         The Bank was successful in its role as intermediitiy betizen the Government and Phase I
co-financiers, in particular the Norwegian participants. Once the different parties became used to
seeing the Bank play this role, they invited the Bank's team to their meetings and requested its advice
on all important issues.

Consulting Services

1.64.         Contractorsplayed an important role in the project since they were successively hired to
manage the development and production of the Seme field. Their overall behavior varied from
company to company. The first contractor was interested in gaining at the time money and
international experience, and trained its own personal at the expenses of Government revenues from
the Seme field. The objective of the second one was probably to make quick money. The third
contractor, hired in 1988, performed its work satisfactorily, with limited operating costs.



1.65.         Abundant documents in Bank files assisted in the drafting of this PCR. However,
supplementary informationhad to be requested from the Government for the estimationof the
project's rate of return.

1.66.         The President's report provided a useful framework for the project, since different
hypotheses regarding the project's initial results, and the subsequent action to be taken, were carefully
described in the document.

                          SEME OIL FIELD DEVEUlPMENT PROJECT
                                         (CREDIT 1503-BEN)




2.1.         The Benin Government appreciates the impact of the World Bank through the Credit
1503BEN, its performance, its relationship with the Government of Benin and the other co-
financiers, and the lessons which can be noted from such cooperation.


A. Appreciation of the Results of Phase I1

      (a)    With the implementation of Phase ll, the production of Seme Oil field has increased.
             From 1982to 1987 10,819 barrels of crude have been produced i.e. 12,8 percent. This
             production has been increased at May 1991to 15,765,000 barrels i.e. 18 percent of
             recovery. From 1983to 1990, the proceeds have been evaluated to FCFA104,326
             million, from which the Benin Government received FCFA12,072 million, while
             Norwegian and UK Banks received more than FCFA35.000 million. When SAGA's
             contract was cancelled, from a total proceeds of USD147 million, Benin has received
             USD3 million i.e. about 2 percent while Norway and UK received more than USD55
             million i.e. about 38 percent.

      (b)    The above unequal distributionresulted from the poor results of the negotiation of the
             2nd Service Contract of SAGA PETROLEUM BENIN AIS. Although the Benin
             Government made an effort to convince SAGA and Norway to increase the part of the
             Government's proceeds, despite the assistance of the World Bank and Consultants, the
             results were not significant.

     (c)     This situation was one of the reasons which persuaded the Government to cancel
             SAGA's contract in May 1985. This breach of the Financial Agreements resulted in: (a)
             negotiating a new frnancial agreement with Phase I lenders, in 1988, under which the
             Government proceeds were increased from 7 to 20 percent; and (b) a suspension of EIB
             and World Bank credit, which delayed the main activities of Phase II for roughly three
             years.

     (d)     However, the new service contract signed in April 1988 with an American Company,
             Ashland Exploration (BENIN) INC., allowed Benin to reduce the service contracts'
             costs. It has not forecast any participation by the operator in the investment, therefore
             no main guarantee was given by ASHLAND for its activities.

     (e)     The appointment of the Project Bureau has been very beneficial to the Project. During
             all those changes of operators, the Government Representative has supervised activities
             of the operators, and has coordinated the cooperation with the Financial Institutionsof
             Phase I, EIB,IDA and the Government.

        (0    The Project Bureau has been very active for the negotiation of the Restructuring
              Agreements, the choice of a new operator, the reestablishment of EIB and IDA loans
              etc.

        (g)   The preliminary evaluationof deeper horizons of the reservoir of Seme Oil field has
              tentatively indicated that 11 million barrels of oil, 25 millions barrels of condensate and
              309 billion cubic feet of gas could be recovered.

        (h)   This evaluation needs to be confirmed by a geological and geophysical study before a
              final decision is made. Such reserves can be produced during a Phase 111development.
              But in the meantime the Seme Oil field production should be maintained while actions
              are taken to prepare a Phase I11 Development Program.

        (i)   Therefore the Benin Government has proposed to the World Bank a transitional
              development called Expansion Phase 11. This Phase 11was evaluated to 4.5 million USD
              and the following tasks have been planned:

                     (i)   Deepen and completion of existing well S3
                     (ii)  Test and recompletion of existing well S9
                     (iii) Recompletion of well S11
                     (iv)  Phase 111Engineering and reservoir studies.

2.2.         The Bank and the Government had established a work program for a new World Bank
project. All the technical preparation was completed when, in May 1991, the Bank decided not to
finance the program. As such a decision was not forecast, the Project has been faced suddenly with a
complex and difficult situation when Seme oil field production was decreasing. The World Bank has
suggested Benin Government to give the "Project Pbtrolier de Semb" to a private Oil Company which
would bring the necessary investment to proceed with the development.

2.3.         No oil company, however, would be likely to accept to support the heavy debt of FCFA
23 billion which the Project owns to Phase I Lender according to the Restructuring Agreements.
Therefore, the Benin Government started to negotiatethe restructuring of the Project's debts into the
public debts. The Government tried to obtain from the World Bank a Technical Assistance for USD
3.5 millions in October 1991which would cover:

       (a)   the Audit for the restructuring of Project Pbtrolier de Sbme

       @)    Research and negotiation with an oil company for the continuingdevelopment of Project
             Petrolier de Seme

       (c)   Restructuring of the Petroleum Sector of the Republic of Benin

       (d)   Financing of Direction de 1'Energie Priorities

       (e)   Phase 111Engineering and Reservoir studies.

This Technical Assistancehas to be successful for the continuationof the development of the Seme
Oil field.

2.4.          The World Bank Representatives and Consultants have done a good job during the Phase
II Development of Seme Oil field. They played a crucial role in the implementationof the Feasibility
Study and the Financial Matrix of this project. The World Bank assisted the Government in the close
monitoring of all the steps of the implementation, of the seismic acquisition and processing, reservoir
study, engineering and construction.

2.5.         The World Bank Representatives and Consultants have been efficiently involved in the
negotiation with Phase I lenders, for the establishment of the RestructuringAgreements which
increase Benin's proceeds, and the negotiation and the signatureof the Service Contract with
ASHLAND EXPLORATION (BENIN) INC. on April 1988.

2.6.         At the end of the Phase II development in December 1990, the results of drilling and
tests have tentatively indicated that gas, condensate and oil can be produced from deeper horizons.
Evaluation of the potential of this discovery was the main objective of Phase ll extension credit which
the Government requested from the World Bank (see paragraphs 3 and 4 above). Such a credit would
have make it easier the promotion of exploration of the Beninese basin.

2.7.         Except for the cancellationof SAGA Contract during the Phase II Development, Benin
Government implemented its commitments in accordance with the covenants set forth in the Credit
Agreement and with the procurement guidelines. A proper local support had been provided to
various service companies, and consulting firms,involved in the implementation of the project
components. the GovernmentRepresentative, the Beninese staff and the operator demonstrated good
will, keen interest and enthusiasm in performing their tasks. When Saga's contract was cancelled, the
Project Bureau and the Beninese staff have managed with skill to maintain the production till the
choice of ASHLAND in April 1988after the departure of PANOCO in May 1986.

2.8.         When SAGA'Scontract was cancelled, there was a tight cooperation between EIB,
World Bank, Phase I Lenders and Benin Government for the negotiation and the signature of the
Restructuring Agreements, and the reestablishmentof World Bank and EIB loans. However, the loan
Seme 2 of EIB has been cancelled before any disbursement was made. The conditions resulting from
the negotiations for the restructuring agreements are more favorable for the Benin Government (20
percent of proceeds instead of 7 percent). The World Bank Assistance has been very much appreciate
for obtaining those results.



       (a)   Because of the bad position of the Benin Government as far as the distribution of
             proceeds is concerned, World Bank should have maintained its assistancefor the
             continuation of the Phase I1 Program, and for resolving the financial issues with Phase I
             Lenders, Benin Government and EIB.

      (b)    The establishment of the Project Bureau has allowed the Government to coordinateall
             the actions, of all the parties involved in this project, during the difficult situations.

      (c)    For the future, all the Government interests and revenues which can be provided to
             Benin should be completely clarified, and the contract discussed accordingly, before a
             decision is made. The World Bank should continue to support the Government when it
             is faced with the Oil Companies and Banks.

      (a)  With the end of the Phase I and Phase 11, the main part of Seme Oil field development
           has been achieved. This project did not provide substantial proceeds to the Government,
           even when its share increased from 7 percent to 20 percent, in April 1988.

      (b)  The production of the field did not provide satisfactoryrevenues to the Government,
           because of the harshness of the Service Contract with SPB. Even though the Bank
           Credit 1503BEN has allowed the increase of production, and provided good training to
           Beninese, the impact of Seme Oil field Project in the Benin economy is not so
           significant. Despite the assistance of the World Bank during the review of the SAGA
           Service Contract, the results which have been obtained in April 1985 were not fully
           satisfactory.

2.9.       As far as the cancellation of the SPB Service Contract is concerned, the main lessons
which come up are the following:

     (a)   The Benin decision should have been taken at the end of Phase I program. Such a
           position would have avoided delaying the Phase I1 schedule for a long time.

     (b)   Although it was a breach of financial agreements, the cancellation eventually resulted in
           increased revenues for the Benin Government.

Comment: Initial high rate of production, and interruption of technical expenses during Pan Ocean
interlude, led to positive results during the initial years. However, while the production declined
operating costs did not decrease and from 1989 onward they have more than offset the revenue
from oil sales.

Comment: As in the case of Phase I, a promising start was rapidly followed by negative results.
From 1988 onward, PPS is losing money by prolonging the production.

Cornme-:    The rate of return of the project is not reliable, since, between 1984 to 1987, as
shown in table above, revenues were higher than expenditures: inexpensivedevelopment wells
were drilled and immediately connected with already existing production facilities. A minimum
value of the rate of return was evaluated by pushing backward by one year annual expenditures.
The result (230%) gives a minimum value of the internal rate of return of the project.

                                        1. During the SAGA period, the production rate
                                        was excessive as shown by the anomalic shape of
                                        the production curve. This may lead to the
                                        suspicion that SAGA may have participated
                                        to i t s own exclusion in 1985

                                        2. The production of well drilling under
                                        the Bank's project was not major, but
                                        participated in slowing this decline
                                        of production.
