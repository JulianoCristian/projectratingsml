Structural Adjustment Loan Project\n            will provide necessary assistance to the Lithuanian\n            Government in the implementation of its structural reform\n            program. Its objective is to put the economy on a path of\n            rapid and sustainable growth, as a means to permanently\n            reduce poverty. At present, reaching that path requires: 1)\n            solving the banking system's current operational and\n            under-capitalization problems; and 2) eliminating the most\n            serious sectoral imbalances in the rest of the economy\n            especially in the energy, agriculture and social security\n            sectors. The project will provide the Lithuanian Government\n            with critical financial support to cover the short term\n            costs associated with the cross-sectoral reforms needed in\n            order to continue the transition toward a market economy.\n            The project is divided into two equal tranches of 40 million\n            (US dollars) the second of which is to be disbursed upon\n            satisfaction of release conditions."}, "docdt": "1996-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
