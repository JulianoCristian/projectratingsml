Description        The main development objectives o f the Government energy sector reform
                   program are to strengthen Morocco's energy security, facilitate energy market
                   integration in support o f competitiveness o f the economy, and develop
                   sustainable energy reform. More specifically, the primary objectives o f this
                   Development Policy Loan (DPL) would be as follows: (i) the Moroccan
                                                                                 help
                   Government improve energy security through the development o f domestic
                   energy resources, efficient use o f energy, and the formulation o f a long-term
                   energy import strategy; (ii)   foster competition in the energy market through
                   regional system integration, liberalization o f the high-voltage domestic
                   electricity market, and open access o f competitors inthe petroleum downstream
                   market; and (iii) to reduce Government subsidies for petroleum products.
Benefits           The main group o f beneficiaries would be Moroccan energy consumers
                   (particularly households and energy intensive enterprises) who would benefit
                   from more competitive energy prices as a result o f the sector reforms, and from
                   a more stable energy market. The other important beneficiary would be the
                   Government budget, which will experience significant fiscal relief from the
                   gradual elimination o f petroleum products subsidies, thanks to energy prices
                   that better reflect real market prices. The country's balance o f payments would
                   also benefit from the envisaged reform, as Morocco would face lower energy
                   imports and reduced exposure to international price volatility. The public will
                   significantly benefit from the reduction o f atmospheric emissions-including
                   greenhouse gases (GHG), lead, and sulfur oxides (SO,)-as        a result o f energy
                   efficiency improvements and accelerated development o f renewable energy.
Risks              The mainrisks under this operation include the political risk associated with the
                   parliamentary elections in 2007. The different stakeholders show a strong
                   ownership o f the reform program, but a new ahnistration may choose to shift
                   priorities inreforms. As a mitigation strategy, it was decided to choose a single
                   tranche programmatic lending instrument in a medium-term framework,
                   allowing for adaptation to changes after elections. Another risk is the failure to
                   maintain momentum in the implementation o f renewable energy (RE) and
                   energy efficiency (EE) policy, resulting in slower or more modest results than
                   anticipated. This risk is mitigated through the integration o f EE and REpolicy
                   and institutional framework in the new legislation that includes sanctions for
                   noncompliance, and mobilizing the resources o f existing funds to provide
                   financial support to EE and RE. A final main risk is widely fluctuating
                   international energy prices, which may create instability in domestic prices o f
                   energy and induce the Government to suspend the continued pass-through o f
                   international prices to domestic consumers. This risk is mitigated through a
                   mechanism which smoothes price fluctuations and includes safeguard
                   provisions for extreme price fluctuations.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION


1.       Energy is a source of vulnerability of the Moroccan economy. Morocco is 95 percent dependent
on imported fossil hels, despite a significant potential in renewable energy.            The energy sector is
confronting three challenges: (i)   improving the country's energy security through improved management
o f energy resources, learning from the lessons o f the recent energy crisis; (ii)reenergizing the
liberalization process inthe petroleum and power sectors inorder to increase sector productivity; and (iii)
managing the budgetary impact o f highenergy prices on the Moroccan economy inthe short run.

2.       Morocco has a good track record of energy sector reforms. Morocco was one o f the first
countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to engage in significant reforms in the
energy sector. These reforms, which were initiatedinthe mid-1980s, included the successful introduction
o f the private sector in both the petroleum products downstream sector (Morocco has no significant
petroleum productionactivities) and the power sector. Reforms inthe petroleum product sector led to the
privatization o f the national refinery, SociCt6 Marocaine des Industries de Raffinage (SAMIR), and o f the
petroleum product distribution activities. Whereas distribution was organized competitively, refining
activities remained monopolistic, with the benefit o f a temporary protection against competing imports
until end-2008.      At present, all prices in the petroleum product sector are still regulated by the
Government. The power sector has been successfully opened to private investment for power generation
and distribution. The private sector was actively involved in developing the power generation capacity
between 1997 and 2003. As a result, the private sector plays a key role in the electricity sector in
Morocco, with over 50% of the power generating capacity inthe hands o f IPPs (contributing to over 70%
o f generation) and 55% o f electricity distribution done by private operators. Although private sector
financing inMorocco has been deemed a success storyi, interest has tapered off recently. Revival inactive
private sector participation is expected once a clear and stable regulatory framework i s established.

3.        The Government sees the objectives of energy security and competitiveness as mutually
reinforcing. By 2000, the risingprices o f imported energy focused the attention o f the Government on
ensuring energy supply security and adjusting the Moroccan economy to the energy shock. The initial
short-term response o f the Government to the international energy price increase was to reestablish
Government control over domestic prices, inthe hope that the price spike was temporary. The persistence
of highprices has made intervention very expensive and convinced legislators that domestic price policy
should be revised. The Government decided that domestic prices should be set based on market forces,
and that long-term measures needed to be taken to protect the Moroccan economy against future energy
shocks and to improve energy security. However, the pressure from competitors on the regional and
national market for goods and services makes it necessary for Morocco to balance the energy security
concern with the competitiveness objective.        As Morocco is well endowed with renewable energy
resources and has a substantial potential to improve economically its energy efficiency, the Government
sees the objectives o f long-term energy security and competitiveness as mutually reinforcing rather than
exclusive.

4.       The Government reengaged in active energy sector dialogue with the World Bank in2005. This
dialogue led to Bank support for a technical assistance program focused on energy security and efficient
management o f energy resources. It led to the Government formulation, in coordination with other
development partners and particularly the European Union (EU), o f a comprehensive energy sector
reform program. The reform agenda adopted by the Government for the energy sector i s aligned with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) priorities of improving the productivity o f the Moroccan economy in
a competitive Mediterranean market, andreducing the budget deficit.


                    11.     COUNTRY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

5.      Energy sector reform is part of the Government's agenda of structural reforms. Energy sector
reforms are new additions to the Government reform agenda that have been brought to the forefront by the
international situation in energy markets. The reforms are among the multiple structural changes that are
underway in Morocco in the areas o f trade facilitation, customs reform, transport sector liberalization,
liberalization and privatizationo f telecommunications, housing sector reform, financial sector reform, water
sector reform, and public sector reform. The Government has realized that energy sector reforms are
needed as an enabling factor to other sectoral reforms, particularly trade, transport, and housing. Combined
with specific and targeted social strategies, energy reforms are enhancing economic growth and
      '
competitiveness as well as social indicators.

A. Politicaland SocialIssues

6.       The Government is making sustained efforts on the employment and poverty fronts.2 The
unemployment rate has declined steadily since 1999, falling below a hstoric 10 percent threshold in the
first half o f 2006. However, unemployment remains stubbornly high among the youth (31 percent), even
among those holding a diploma (20.6 percent). Poverty rates have also decreased from an estimated 19
percent in 1999 to a current estimated 15 percent. Poverty continues, however, to disproportionately affect
the rural world, with 22 percent o f rural households living below the poverty line (versus 12 percent o f
urbanhouseholds). Vulnerability i s also particularly highinrural Morocco due to exposure to droughts for
both rain fed and irrigated agriculture: the 2005 drought cut cereal production by half. Many social
indicators are improving, including access to potable water, which has improved dramatically inrural areas
over the last decade. Some education indicators have also improved, including the illiteracy rate (57
percent) and girls' school enrollment rate (78.5 percent).          In the housing sector, the number of unfit
dwellings is yielding to the Government's slum reduction p r ~ g r a malthough aggressive effort will still be
                                                                            , ~
needed to keep up with new slums and un-zoned neighborhoods that are mushrooming inthe peri-urban and
semi-rural belts o f large cities. All these activities require reliable access to modern energy at affordable
prices and efficient utilization o f energy to optimize investment needs for meeting growing demand. The
PERG (Programme d 'Electrification Rurale Gdnkraliske) has succeeded in raising access to electricity in
rural areas from 65 percent four years ago to 89 percent in 2006, with prospects o f exceeding 95 percent
coverage in2007.

B. EconomicDevelopments

7.      Although GDP reached an exceptional rate of 7.3percent in 2006, GDPgrowth has been volatile
and low in thepast 15years. Indeed, growth averaged less than 3 percent between 1990 and 2005. Such a

modest performance derives from the slow diversification o f the economy and the persisting exposure to a
volatile, drought-vulnerable agricultural sector, which grew at an annual average o f 0.4 percent:
Nonagricultural GDP grew at an annual average rate o f 3.3 percent, and export growth remained in single
digits. However, the energy sector faired better, growing at more than 6.5 percent since 1990. The sector's
dynamism has translated into an increase o f its share inGDP by more than 70 percent, from 3.5 percent in
1990 to 6 percent in2005. Since 2000, however, the economy has recovered a more expansionary stance.
New sectors, such as construction, transports, communications, electricity, and water have regained
dynamism, leading to a hgher yet modest average growth rate o f 4.2 percent over the period. As a result o f
recovery, the unemployment rate has decreased from 13.6 percent in 2000 to an estimated 9.7 percent by
end-2006. Economic growth has generated an increase inenergy demand o f more than 4 percent per year,
which will require significant investment to meet or manage the demand. For example, investment in
excess o f US$400 million per year will be needed in the electricity sector alone to add 300 megawatts
(MW)ofcapacity every year plusreinforcement ofthe energy transport and distribution systems as the load
expands. Inthe absence o f corrective policy measures, the growth o f energy demand will increase GHG
emissions.

8.       The exceptionally high growth rate of 2006 was supported by an extraordinary agriculturalyear,
progress in reforms that enhanced+ the overall productivity of the economy, and infrastructure
development. Favorable weather conditions for rain-dominated crops such as soft wheat have resulted in
the second-best harvest o f the past decade. Recently adopted reforms relevant to the energy sector include
scheduled tariff cuts with the EU, which will increase the importance for Moroccan industries o f efficient
use o f costly energy, and liberalization o f air transport to promote tourism, for which energy i s a key input.
Successful privatization o f several state enterprises including concessions for power and water distribution
has also attracted foreign direct investment (FDI).Morocco has become the main recipient o f FDI inflows
inthe Maghreb countries, withFDIinflows accounting for 6.1 percent ofGDPin2005. The construction of
the Tangier-Med port-scheduled        to be finished by end-2007-has        the potential to open the domestic
market to increased competition, particularly the competitive import o f petroleum products by private
operators. The Government i s also seeking to attract FDI for the development o f Morocco's renewable
energy potential

9.       Macroeconomicfundamentals are sound. The country benefits from investment grade status since
April 2007. The external balance of payments benefits from record-high tourism receipts and remittances,
which offsets a high trade deficit due mainly to rising energy imports, thus maintaining a surplus in the
current account for six consecutive years. International reserves remain high at close to one year o f
imports. On the domestic balances, improvements in the fiscal accounts benefit from high revenues, a
lower public payroll, and tight control over expenditure^.^ While petroleum product subsidies remained
high during most o f 2006 (see para.16-17), the projected fiscal deficit is down to around 3.1 percent of
GDP, from an exceptionally high6.3 percent in2005.5

10.      Low inflation has been achieved by tight monetary and sound debt management. Tight monetary
policy i s helping contain inflationary pressures stemming from higher prices o f domestic petroleum
products. Prudent monetary management has absorbed excess liquidity, while active debt management has
diminished debt payments, reducing external debt exposure and improving investor confidence. However,
rising energy costs contributed to propel inflation to 3.3 percent by end-2006, well above the 1 percent
acheved in2005.




  Better control over expenditureshas happenedinthe context of a Public Administration ReformProgram(PARP),

  subsidies.

 11,     Moroccan productsface tougher external competition. The worldwide abolition o f quantitative
restrictions on exports o f textile and clothing that went into effect on January 1, 2005, translated into a 6
percent loss inMorocco's share o f the clothing market inEurope in2005, making it all the more important
to improve the energy efficiency in local industries to contain production costs. In addition, the gradual
reduction o f tariffs with the EU increased the competitive pressure o f imports from Europe inthe domestic
market. Morocco's trade balance deficit worsened to 15.7 percent o f GDP in 2005, up from 13 percent in
2004. In 2006, exports-mainly          textiles-regained    dynamism, explained in part by the ongoing
restructuring in the clothing and apparel sectors. This development has partially offset the risingvalue o f
imports resulting from higher prices o f oil and other commodities. The trade deficit i s projected to widen to
 16.4 percent o f GDP in2007 (based on oil prices o f $60 per bbl).

 12.     Morocco has an opportunity to achieve higher growth and employment. Growth has exceeded 7
percent in2006. However, to sustain such rates for several years will require that the Government not only
build on macroeconomic stability (for example, with low inflation and a solid external position) and a
multi-pronged structural reform agenda, but also develop a strategy that addresses the binding constraints
reported in the recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and in the investment climate assessment
(ICA) survey. These constraints include an anti-export bias, a rigid exchange rate regime, expensive
businesses and personal taxation, and rigid labor regulations that affect the hiring o f skilled labor. These
constraints are compounded by high cost o f credit, poor access o f small and medium enterprises to financial
services, weak enforcement o f property rights, severe restrictions on access to land, and low contract
enforcement by the judicial system. High energy prices have also been identified as an important factor
affecting competitiveness.       Various corrective measures are being taken, including tax reform,
strengthening o f the monetary policy framework and institutional reform o f the financial and public sectors.
Inaddition, the Government has announced its intention to move to a more flexible exchange rate regime
by2008.

C. Medium-TermOutlook
13.      The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is positive, assuming continuation of sound policies
and deepened structural reforms through the transition to a new Government in 2007. Economic growth
should exceed 4.5 percent on average in the medium term. Growth, especially nonagricultural, should be
drivenby hgher domestic investment and enhanced competitiveness linkedto a gradual recovery o fexports
and strong domestic demand. Faster growth will generate strong demand for energy. Inflation should stay
below 3 percent, as long as monetary policy remains tight and fiscal consolidation is sustained.

14.      Fiscal consolidation should succeed in the medium term. Authorities have adopted a medium-
term strategy aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit below 3 percent o f GDP and the public debt-to-GDP ratio
to below 60 percent by 2010. To this end, the Government has already started taking actions that include
curbing the high wage bill, reducing the cost o f energy subsidies, gradually replacing inefficient food
subsidies with targeted support to vulnerable groups, adopting performance budgeting within a medium-
term expenditure framework, improving human resources management, reducing arrears, and addressing
contingent liabilities. Civil service reform should keep payroll costs decreasing until 2009. Measures to
reduce energy subsidies by at least US$250 million per year have, also been adopted. Ultimately, lower
fiscal deficits should be a major determinant o f strengthened debt sustainability. As a result, public debt
should continue declining in terms o f GDP. As the fiscal consolidation strategy succeeds, Morocco's
foreign currency debt rating is likely to preserve its recently obtained investment grade.

15.      Major risks of shortfalls in the macro scenario are manageable. These risks include the
following: (i)  vulnerability to potential droughts; (ii) higher-than-projected fiscal deficits partly due to
higher wage bills arising from the political transition and energy subsidies; (iii)   slower-than-projected
exports recovery; (iv) decline in workers' remittances or tourism receipts due to a deteriorated
international security situation; and (v) shocks to terms o f trade, mainly related to prices o f primary
energy, phosphate rock, and phosphate derivatives. To offset these risks, authorities are seeking to




                                                       4

  diversify the economy, so as to be less dependent on agriculture and energy imports, and to alleviate the
  budgetary impact o f world oil price variations by activating the petroleum product price indexation
  system. The Government is taking other steps to offset macro risks that include creating a national
  consensus around the need for further fiscal consolidation, promoting exports with a recently adopted
  "Emergence Program" for export diversification and stimulation, implementing an ambitious tourism
  strategy aiming to attract 10 million tourists by 2010, developing "green energy" potential for import
  substitution and for export, and taking actions to curb the increase inthe energy import bill.

                         111.      MOROCCO'SENERGY SECTORAGENDA
A. Morocco's Energy Sector Issues

16.      Given the country's high dependency on energy imports, the exposure to energy price risk is
high and increasing. Energy security is a priority concern. Morocco is almost fully dependent on
imports to cover its energy needs. The country imports 95 percent o f its total commercial energy supply;
two-thirds o f energy imports are crude oil and petroleum products and one-third is coal. Energy imports
have increased steadily since 2000 and represented 22 percent o f the country's imports (US$4.6 billion) in
2005. Thus, Morocco is highly exposed to international price fluctuations,6 which have a destabilizing
effect on its balance o f payments. The increase inenergy prices i s estimated to have reduced Morocco's
GDP growth by 1percent over the 2000-05 p e r i ~ d .Inthe Government's projections, Morocco's energy
                                                               ~
riskexposure is projected to grow, as consumption increases from 13.2 milliontons of oil equivalent (toe)
in2005 to 17mtoe in2014. The energy price also impacts the poor directly through the increase intheir
energy-related expenditures, which presently represents 8.7 percent o ftheir budget.'

17.      Petroleum product subsidies weigh heavily on the Government budget. The price controlpolicy
inplace since 2000 subsidized energy up to US$1.04 billion in2005 or 46 percent of the Government's
capital investment budget, and would have further increased to US$1.26 billion in 2006 had the
Government not taken measures inSeptember 2006 to reduce subsidies.

18.      The Moroccan economy needs energy at the best price to preserve its competitiveness.
Morocco has engaged in a policy o f integration in the Mediterranean economy. Energy represents a
significant proportion o f the production costs of exporting firms and domestic industries that compete
with foreign firms exporting to Morocco. Butthe price of energy is significantly higher inMorocco' than
in neighboring countries. Efficiency gains in the electricity and petroleum product supply sectors are
therefore important to maintain competitiveness and for job creation.

19.      Meeting Energy sector development needs to be socially and environmentally sustainable. The
consumption o f petroleum products of poor quality harms the poor. Morocco still consumes petroleum
products that contain and release inthe atmosphere lead and sulfur chemicals harmfulto the health." The
concentration o f emissions inurban areas affects particularly the poor. The environmental sustainability
o f the increase in energy demand is also a concern because future demand will be essentially met from
fossil fuels transformation, with a corresponding increase in GHG emissions. Based on Government
energy demand projections and at the present level o f energy intensiy o f Morocco,11 GHG emissions,
which amounted to 37 million tons o f COZ in2005, would increase to 57 million tons by 2015.

B. GovernmentPrioritiesinthe Energy Sector

20.      Energy security, competitiveness, and reduction of energy subsidies. Government priorities
reflected inthe energy sector reform program supportedby the proposed operation are as follows:


  The increase o f petroleum product prices from US$38.25 per bbl in 2004 to US$54.0 per bbl in2005 increased
  Morocco's import bill by US$1.5 billion and imports' share in the balance o f payments from 17 percent to
  22 percent. Steam coal prices have also increased significantly over the same period, from US$34.9 per ton
'*(Europe) in2000 to US$69.6 per ton in2005.
  Based on DEC's evaluation o f the impact o f a $30 oil price increase on growth for middle-income countries.
  Energy expenditures represented in 2000 about 8.74 percent o f household expenditures for the lowest income
  quintile and 7.29 percent for the highest income quintile, based on Morocco's 2000-01 household survey results.
  The industry electricity tariff is US$0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) inMorocco, compared to US$0.046 per kwhin
  Tunisia, US0.028 per kWhinEgypt, and US$0.038 per kwhinAlgeria (IEA 2002, World Bank 2003).
loThe lead content o f gasoline and sulfur content o f diesel fuel are significantly above international best practice.
l1Morocco's energy intensity was 76 toe per millionDHin 2005, up from 60 toe per millionDHin 1990.

          (a) Reduce dependency on energy imports and environmentally harmful forms of energy:
              (i)Increasetheroleofrenewableenergyintheenergymix,takingadvantageofMorocco's
                   exceptional potential for wind and solar energy. The Government objective i s to generate
                   20 percent o f electricity from renewable energy sources by 2015, (saving up to 1 mtoe
                   per year on energy imports by 2015, worth US$SOO million per year).
              (ii) Promote more efficient utilization o f energy in industry, public buildings, and for
                   residential users (saving up to 700,000 toe per year by 2015, worth US$550 million per
                   year).
              (iii)Reduce GHG emissions by 1.25 million tons o f COz by 2015 (10 percent o f Morocco's
                   emissions) and reduce the emissions o f harmfullead by 150 tons annually by 2009.

          (b) Increase energy sector eficiency to support the competitiveness of industries on the
              international and domestic markets:
              (i)AcceleratetheintegrationofMoroccointheEUMaghrebregionalpowermarket.
              (ii) Complete the fvst stage o f electricity market liberalization to improve the productivity o f
                   the power sector and lower electricity prices to industrial consumers.
              (iii) effectivecompetitioninpetroleumproductmarkets.12

          (c) Address the jiscal stance issue through the gradual elimination o f subsidies on liquid
              petroleum products with a gain o f about US$250 million from 2007 onward.

C. GovernmentReformProgram

21.       The Government's program to achieve its stated goals includes four strategic reform areas:
(i) security and sustainable development;, (ii) sector productivity; (iii)
    energy                                                    energy                              Government
budgetary exposure in the energy sector; and (iv) energy policy monitoring, evaluation, and
communication.

Energy Securiq and Sustainable Development

22.      Reduce dependence on imported energy. The Government wants to increase its support for
development o f domestic energy resources when commercially and economically viable. The
Government proposes to develop wind energy for power generation, which has an estimated potential o f
about 6,000 MW. It also proposes to develop solar energy for power generation inisolated areas and for
water heating (from 160,000 square meters o f solar panels at present, to 400,000 square meters, by 2012).
The development o f renewable energy (RE), to be driven by the private sector, needs support from the
Government by way o f a suitable regulatory framework and facilitated access to financing, particularly in
the early phase o f development. Dependence on imported energy will also be reducedthrough improving
efficiency (EE) in energy transformation and utilization.         To support RE and EE, the Government
proposes to implement the following measures:

       (i)    Implement a national policy o f "better consumption" o f energy. The Government proposes to
              design and adopt enforceable efficiency objectives in key industries, public sector, building,
              and other activities, and expand the mandate o f existing institutions to include policy
              implementation. The objective is to increase energy efficiency ( by up to 10 percent) in
              industry and the public sector.




  Inefficiencies in the petroleum downstream market cost the Moroccan economy about US$140 million annually
  (project team estimate based on benchmarking against other countries).




                                                        7

       (ii)  Adopt RE legislation and regulation that sets enforceable objectives based on the experience
             inseveral industrialized and emerging economies. The objective is 1 000 MW of installed
             wind capacity by 2012 and 400 000 square meters o f solar panels by 2012.

       (iii)ExpandthemandateofCDERandcreatemechanismsforfinancingEEandREdevelopment.

24.      Reduce energy suppry risk. The Government program for managing the riskon energy imports is
centered on the following measures:

       (i)   Develop a long-term national energy supply strategy aimed at (i) diversification o f the
                                                                                    the
              sources o f primary energy (whch are only petroleum products and coal at the moment, with
             gas playing a modest role) and (ii)    management o f the price risk. Decision on an energy
             import strategy is urgent, given the hgh growth o f demand, the lumpiness, and the long lead
             times o f investments.

       (ii)  Establisha policy for strategic oil stocks.

25.      Reduce the negative environmental and health impacts of energy transformation and
utilization. The Government reform program aims at improving the environmental and public health
impacts performance o f Morocco's energy sector:

      (i)    Regulate emissions from the oil refineries and the power plants, in consultation with the
             industry as part o f a long-term planto ensure consistency with international practice.

      (ii)   Emphasize the importance o f public health as part o f the Government enerb policy and take
             measures to reduce the current widespread utilization of fuels harmfulto localpopulation.

Energy Sector Productivity

26.      Initial development of an open power market. The Government objective i s to reorganize the
electricity sector and to open gradually the electricity market to competition to improve sector
productivity, based on the general orientations of the Neighborhood Partnership Agreement with the EU
on market liberalization.

27.      Integration of Morocco in the regional power system. The Government recognizes that the
country could benefit significantly from integration in the regional power system. This would enable
Morocco to receive backup services and benefit from reserve capacity at a lower cost, purchase or sell
electricity from or to neighboring countries on the best financial terms, and possibly export "green
electricity" from wind farms. The avoided investment in reserve capacity, improved security o f supply,
and access to cheaper electricity will help lower the cost o f electricity.

28.      Gradual developmentof a competitivepower market. The establishment o f a competitive hgh-
voltage and very hgh voltage market will require (i)       reinforcement o f the legal framework; (ii)the
opening o f power generation to producers without purchase guarantee; and (iii)       the dismemberment o f
monopolies on competitive activities.

29.      Establishment of a power sector regulatory function.         Presently, the regulation o f the power
sector is split between several ministries, including the Ministry o f Energy and Mining (MEM), the
ministry o f Finance and Privatization, the Ministry o f Interior for the power distribution Regies, and the
Ministry o f General and Economic Affairs. The Government intends to concentrate the regulatory
fimction ina single Regulatory Agency.




                                                      8

30.      Transition to a competitivepetroleum products market. Although the petroleum market i s fully
privatized, prices and the entry o f new competitors are still highly regulated.       The Government i s
committed to encouraging competition in order to release potential productivity gains, which may
represent up to 4 percent o f the value o f the products (US$l50 million per year). The Government
strategy for the development o f a competitive market for petroleum products has three components:

       (i)   Liberalize prices and ensure fair competition between distributors.

       (ii)Encourage       f i r m s to optimize their operations, including through more efficient product
             sourcing, logistics, and improved efficiency o f their distributionchain.

       (iii)ReinforceGovernmentcapacitytomonitortheeffectivenessandfairnessofcompetitionand
             the application o f the antimonopoly law to petroleum products.

Government Budgetary Exposure in the Energy Sector

31.      Transferring the energyprice risk to consumers. Following the suspension in2000 o f indexing
petroleum product prices on international prices, the Government started compensating distributors
through its budget for the difference between the Government-set consumer prices and market prices as
determined by an indexation formula. The objective o f the reforms is to pass the petroleum price risk to
consumers and to eliminate over time petroleum products subsidies. Ths reform will also help prepare
for the liberalization o f the petroleum product market by promoting unsubsidized price competition. The
Government program o f reforms inthis respect includes the following measures:

       (i)   Transfer price variations to consumers and operators inthe petroleum products supply chain.
             The Government will proceed in stages, allowing first the price o f liquid products to
             fluctuate.

     (ii)    Finally, the Government will deal with the butane subsidization issue when the social and
             economic environment allows and when a social safety net to offset the negative impact on
             low-income groups i s operational.

Energy Policy Monitoring, Evaluation, and Communication

32.      The Government wishes to ensure that the energy sector reform agenda produces results on the
ground and reinforce accountability in the implementation o f reforms. It wants also to ensure that the
stakeholders in the reforms are duly consulted and informed on the reform program. To this end, the
reformprogram for the energy sector includes the measures discussed below.

33.      Reinforcing Government capacity for energy sector policy formulation and implementation.
The MEMneeds to reinforce its analytical capacity through the development o f an energy sector-specific
information system, as well as better coordination o f information both within the Ministry and with
representatives o f major energy sector participants on the supply and demand side.

34.      Focusing on the results of sector reforms. The Government wishes to carry out systematic ex
ante evaluation of the expected impacts o f reforms in order to support the most effective programs.
During the implementation o f the sector reforms, the Government needs to monitor progress and the
effectiveness o fthe actions it undertakes based on preset performance indicators.

35.     Implementing an effective communication program for energy sector reforms.                     The
Government has recently taken an innovative approach o f open and sustained communication with
stakeholders on energy sector reforms (Annex 5).            The MEM plans to continue to systematically




                                                        9

communicate with other Government administrations, local industry, civil society (in urban and rural
areas), and development partners.

D. Progresswiththe Implementationofthe EnergySector ReformProgram

36.      Continuingprogress. The Government has made significant progress with the implementation o f
the energy sector reform since 2005 in the areas o f RE development, EE, and energy prices. Significant
legal and institutional changes have been prepared and are under discussion for adoption in2007-08.

Energy Security and Sustainable Development

37.      Building on experiencefrom successful pilot projects. The Government has initiated action to
support pilot renewable energy projects aiming at testing the actual feasibility o f RE development before
developing a full institutional and regulatory framework. Some 114 MW have already been installed at
the Tetouan and Essaouira wind farms.          The objective is to reach 1 000 MW o f capacity by 2012.
Additional sites are under construction or being studied.         As an important first step toward the
establishment of a competitive power market, a law has been adopted by the Council o f Government in
January 2007 stipulating that self generators will be allowed to buildpower generating capacity up to 50
MW, andthat ONE will provide access to its transmission system for self generators of electricity. ONE
also i s building a solar-thermal plant o f 450 MW in which solar energy will contribute 20 MW. With
regardto thermo-solar energy, the Government has completed the implementation a 140,000 square meter
pilot program for solar water heating and the objective is to increase the solar water heating capacity by
30 000 square meters annually.

38.      The Government-in      partnership with municipalities, other public institutions and the private
sector-has    developed a number o f pilot EE programs since 2002, including the Sidi Bernoussi and
Tangier industrial EEprograms.

39.      Preparing legislation on EE and RE. Drawing on the experience from these pilot programs, the
Government has prepared a comprehensive legal framework for EE and RE. This framework establishes
a renovated institution for EE and RE policy implementation, seta EE standards, and supports the
development o fRE. This law was approved by the Council of Government inMay 2007.

40.      Preparing institutional reforms for energy management. Under the new EE and RE law, the
Government has initiated a program and regulatory framework to restructure and expand the mission o f
the Centre de Ddveloppement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER).

Energy Sector Productivity

41.      Ensuringfinancial viability of the electricity sector. Inorder to prepare the commercialization o f
the electricity sector, the Government adjusted electricity tariffs by 7 percent in February 2006. This
increase reflects the increase inthe cost o f imported energy and ensures that prices cover costs.

42.      Preparing lawsfor electricity sector reform. The framework for the development o f competition
inthe power sector is goingthrough the approval process. The new law and anamendment to the charter
o f ONE related to self generators mentioned above, and increasing the threshold for self-generation from
10 MW to 50 MW, i s a first step. The new law for the Liberalization o f the Power sector, which will be
presentedto the Parliament in2008, provides for the creation an open high- andvery high-voltage market,
the establishment o f a sector regulatory agency, and the unbundlingo f ONE with creation o f subsidiaries
for each activity.




                                                     10

43.     Preparing a gas law and opening the petroleum sector to competition. A draft law for the
development o f competition inthe gas sector is also under discussion with the Council o f Government.
The Government i s aware that the transition to a competitive market for petroleum porducts requires also
de-bottlenecking the logistics chain. At present S A M I R controls not only refining but also the only high
capacity sea-line receiving facility for diesel fuel and gasoline inMorocco's major port o f Mohammedia.
The Government has negotiated a third-party open access arrangement with the owners o f the Tangier
Port currently under construction and is negotiating the inclusion o f the open access principle in new
terminal ventures and future storage capacities for "white" products (light products).

Government Exposure in the Energy Sector

45.     Adjusting liquid petroleum productsprices to reflect international prices. Followingan interim
price increase in February 2006, the Government made the difficult decision on September 2, 2006 to
adjust the prices o f petroleum products to fully reflect international prices. The tariff increase o f 9
percent for gasoline, 7 percent for diesel, and 8 percent for kerosene eliminated the subsidies for gasoline
and kerosene and reduced by half the subsidy for diesel. This measure prepares the transition to a
competitive market for most petroleum products and will prevent the recurrence o f subsidies if
internationalprices increase inthe future.

Energy Policy Evaluation, Monitoring, and Communication

46.     In support of the formulation and implementation of a results-oriented energy strategy, the
Government restructured the MEM by decree in 2005. The new organization, w h c h has been effective
for a year and a half, established a specific Department for energy strategy formulation and monitoring.
The reorganization o f the MEM also established a Communications Department, which has led the
Ministry's effort to open a national debate on energy sector policy.

             IV.      BANKSUPPORT FORTHE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

A. Objective

47.      Three development objectiveshave been identifiedfor the proposed energy sector DPL:

         (i)   Improve energy security through the development o f domestic renewable energy aiming at
               substitution for imported fossil fuels, the enforcement o f policy and regulation supporting
               renewable energy, and the formulation o f a long-term energy import strategy.
         (ii)Foster    competition in the energy market through regional system integration, liberalization
               o f the high-voltage domestic electricity market and encouraging self-generation for large
               industries, and open access o f competitors inthe petroleum downstream market by 2009.
         (iii)Reduce Government budgetary subsidiesfor petroleumproducts while protectinglow-
               income consumers.

48.      Energy consumers and the public are the primary beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries o f
the energy security and energy sector productivity components o f the proposedprogram are the Moroccan
energy consumers (households and large enterprises).        They will benefit from lower and more stable
energy bills compared to the situation without DPL-supported sector reforms. The beneficiaries o f the
reduced Government budgetary exposure will be the public, which will benefit from the reallocation o f
subsidies on liquid petroleumproducts which currently benefit mainly the wealthy. The public also will
benefit from the reductiono f atmospheric emissions. Local populations will benefit from the reduction in
SO, and leademissions, andthe international community from reduced GHGemissions. The Government
will benefit from lower andmore stable energy import bills inforeign currency.

49.      The program i s expectedto produce the following direct results:

         (i)RaisetheshareofrenewableenergyinMoroccoandimproveenergyefficiencywithpotential
             savings onprimary energy imports o f 1.7 mtoe by 2015 (US$1.3 billion per year).

B. Rationale

50.      Theproposed energy sector DPL is part of a long-term sector dialogue. By providing policy
and reform support, the Bank has a unique capacity to help Morocco maintain a coherent overall picture
o f the economic, environmental, social, and budgetary aspects o f energy sector reforms to respond to the
challenges o f energy security and competitiveness.

51.      The Bank group brings valuable experience in energy sector policy formulation and
implementation, particularly for:


     0       managing the international energy price shock and for energy security;

     0       energy sector reforms;

     0       deregulation o fpetroleum downstream markets;

                                                     12

    0        developing policies, regulation, institutions, and financing instruments for renewable energy
             and energy efficiency.

52.      Consensus building. Bank involvement will facilitate cooperation between key Government
agencies including the Ministry of Finance and Privatization (MFP), the MEM, the MAEG, the Ministry
of RegionalPlanning, Water and Environment (MATEE), and ONE for the design and implementationof
sector reforms. Each of these partners may not have the ability to address the energy sector structural
issues on its own because of their different mandate, vision, capacity, and agenda. Bank involvement in
the proposed DPL will continue to help formulate a common vision to address sector structural issues.
The Bank plays an important role in facilitating the emergence of a consensus on energy sector reform
agendas and priorities between the Government and other development partners, including in particular
the EU, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the GTZ organization, the Agence
Franqaisede DCveloppement (AFD),andthe European Investment Bank (EIB).

53.     Supporting the international agenda on climate change. Bank support for Government policies
for renewable energy and transition to a low-carbon economy i s fully aligned with the recommendations
of the G8 at the Gleneagles Summit (July 2005), the Investment Framework for Clean Energy
Development adopted by the Bank group Development Committee in Singapore in 2006, as well as the
recommendations inthe document on "Climate Change, Energy and the World Bank" (DC2005-0019 of
September 16, 2005). The G8, the Development Committee and Bank Management identified energy
diversification and efficiency as primary areas for the Bank's financial assistance.

C. LinktoCAS

54.      Competitiveness and improved business climate. Though the energy sector was not specifically
identified as a strategic objective inthe 2005 Morocco CAS (3 1879-MA of June 14, 2005), the proposed
energy DPL operation i s consistent with its overall framework, and will, in particular, contribute to
achieving the CAS'S first strategic objective-namely,       improving competitiveness and the investment
climate. Furthermore, the Government specifically requested support from the Bank,as it was becoming
increasingly clear that, contrary to expectations in 2004 and earlier when the latest CAS was fmalized,
high energy prices would most likely continue to prevail for the foreseeable future.

55.      Growth and poverty reduction. Pursuing reforms o f the energy sector that improve energy
security, sustainability, and competitiveness i s a sound entry point towards addressing the two key
development challenges underpinningthe CAS: (i)       acceleratedgrowth andjob creation and (ii)reduction
of poverty and economic exclusion.

56.     Apolicy lending approach. The proposed lendinginstrument, aprogrammatic DPL, is consistent
with the CAS recommendation, which emphasizes the use of policy lendinginstruments under a "results
framework" approach that allows flexibility for responding to changing contexts. This i s clearly the case
inthe energy sector, as exemplifiedbythe recurrence andmagnitude ofthe hydrocarbon price shocks.

D. Collaborationwith Other Donors

57.     Several donors are active in the Moroccan energy sector and operate in close coordination with
the Bank, particularly inthe areas of renewable energy development, energy efficiency, regional energy
systems integration, andliberalization of energy markets.

Relations with the IMF

58.     The World Bank and the IMF maintain close collaboration in Morocco.                  The recently
published CEM of the World Bank had contributions from IMF staff. Similarly, the Article IV IMF
consultation mission inOctober 2006 to Morocco had contribution from Bank staff. The division of labor

                                                     13

between the Bank and the IMF for Morocco i s straightforward: the IMF i s focused on fiscal, monetary,
exchange rate, and debt issues, while the Bank covers selected topics of the structural agenda including
trade liberalization, civil service and public sector, water, energy, education, and housingreform. Inclose
coordination with and active participation from Bank staff, the IMF i s providing technical assistance to
Morocco on multiple regional activities inthe following areas:

         (i)Businessenvironment,reform, andgrowthprospects.AregionalseminarwasheldinRabat
               inNovember 2005.
         (ii)Monetaryandexchangeratepolicies. Ahigh-levelregionalconferenceisscheduledfor
               2007 to discuss issues relatedto a possible transitionto an inflation-targeting framework.
         (iii)Regionalintegrationandfinancialsectordevelopment.Aregionalconferenceonfinancial
                sector reform and prospects for regional integration in the Maghreb i s scheduled to take
               place inRabat at end 2006.
         (iv)  Regional integration and trade liberalization. The IMF i s conducting follow-up on the
               action plan adopted after the November 2005 Algiers Conference. Morocco subscribed to
               the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in December 2005. Annex 7
               contains the conclusionof the June 2006 Article IV IMF missionto Morocco.

Energy Sector Reforms

59.      The energy sector reform program is supportedjointly by the EU and the Bank. In2006, the
EUdecided to include energy inits dialogue with Morocco. The EUhas expressedinterest inworking
jointly with the Bank to strengthen the implementation of the energy aspects of the European
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) action plan, reinforce policy dialogue, and increase cross-border energy
trade. Inaddition, the EUhas prepared a 40 millionbudget support program calledAppui u la Rdforme
du Secteur Energdtique au Muroc (Support for Energy Sector Reforms inMorocco), which i s structured
inclose coordination with the proposed Bank DPL operation. It is expectedto be effective late 2007 or
early 2008. In addition, the EU envisages supporting the DPL objectives through an energy sector-
specific technical assistance (TA) program.

60.      Capacity buildingfor EE and RE. UNDP, incooperation with the Bank, i s planningto support
further efforts to develop the regulatory framework for EE in Morocco. GTZ, which was active in
developing the first wind energy pilot project in Morocco, is coordinating with the Bank its support
program for the development of capacity and a regulatory framework for non-wind REunder the new law
for EnergyEfficiency and Renewable EnergyLaw supported by the proposed DPL.

61.      Energy efficiency. UNDP supports efforts towards EE in new buildings construction. AFD also
promotes EE through the Fonds Franqais pour 1'Environnement Mondial (FFEM), along with the GEF.
Their program i s providing important inputs for the determination of the efficiency standards to be
includedinthe secondary legislation attachedto the EnergyEfficiency andRenewable Energy Law.

62.      Renewable energy. AFD supports, jointly with EIB, Morocco's rural electrification program
(PERG), including the development of solar systems, which has had notable success. With the World
Bank Group participating through the GEF, the African Development Bank i s currently preparing to co-
finance the project of a solar-thermal power plant at Ain BeniMathar. EIB i s involved inthe financing of
one of the first wind farms inMorocco.

63.      Regional integrationfor energy security. EIB has financed the Morocco-Spain gas pipeline and
i s involved through ONE in the construction of the Morocco-Spain power line. The proposed DPL will
accelerate the development of a competitive market for the optimal utilization o f regional
interconnections.

E. Relationshipto Other BankOperations

64.     A continued energy sector dialogue. Though the Bank has not lent to Morocco's energy sector
since 1997 (closing of the SecondRural ElectrificationProject), it has maintaineda dialogue inthe sector
through various activities. The Bank has completed the the preparation of an integrated solar combined-
cycle thermal plant project, supported with US$ 43.2 million grant GEF financing and presented to the
Board inMarch2007. The Bank i s also preparingan investment project with ONE for the reinforcement
of the transmission and distribution system and technical support for the restructuringand unbundlingof
ONE resulting from the Self-generators and Electricity Liberalization laws supported by the proposed
DPL. It also successfully secured fmancing from ESMAP and GEF in2003 for EEwork with the CDER
at the industrial park of Sidi Bernoussi Zenata (completed) and in2004 for a gas sector study. The Bank
also provided in 1997 its first partial risk guarantee inthe Middle East and North Africa (MNA) for the
private Jorf Lasfar power plant, a transaction that introduced independent, private power generation in
Morocco.

65.      A reinforced energy sector dialogue and TAprogram since 2005. Inthe context of its expanded
dialogue on energy sector reform over the past two years, the Bank has also developed a comprehensive
energy technical cooperation program for 2006-07, which includes assistanceindeveloping a sound legal
and regulatory framework for wind and energy efficiency promotion, as well as assistance in
strengthening the MEM's capacity to better monitor, model, plan, and inform policy decision making in
the energy sector.

66.      Coordination with water DPL. The Bank has closely coordinated the preparation of the
proposed energy DPL with the parallel preparation of the water sector DPL. The main common areas
between the two sectors are (i) the regulationof water and electricity inmultiservice utilities, which needs
to be consistent and coordinated, and (ii)   the financial transparency of the water, sanitation, and power
distribution lines of business, in order to avoid cross-subsidization between services, which could
jeopardize the development of a competitivepower market inthe longterm.

F. LessonsLearned

67.      While preparing for this operation, the Bank has learned lessons from its recent dialogue and TA
programs in the energy sector in Morocco, as well as from its wider experience with energy and DPL
operations across sectors and regions.

68       The design of the EE and RE components of the DPL relies on Bank best practices in these
areas. The ESMAP program and the Energy Unit of the World Bank Energy and Water Department
(EWDEN) have carried out a considerable amount of analysis and supported a large number of EE and
RE programs worldwide. Their experience is summarized in the ESMAP Renewable Energy Toolkit
(World Bank 2005) and the ESMAP Formal Report 283/04 (World Bank 2004). Internationalexperience
with the design and operation of institutions for EE and RE was gained through the BanMESMAP
sponsoredconference in Seoul, Korea (September 2006), which brought together representatives from 15
EEandREagenciesworldwide to discuss the optimaldesign ofEEandREinstitutions.

69.     Potential for EE in Moroccan industly is documented. The recently completed ESMAP-and
GEF-funded Sidi Bernoussi Zenata project,has demonstrated that promotion of EE on a larger scale in
Morocco i s possible and sustainable, provided a sound and comprehensive financial and business
incentive framework has been established, and project design i s developed in cooperation with energy
users. This lesson has been directly incorporated by emphasizing the operational role of the energy
management institution, the importance of energy audits in large- and medium-size industry, and the
development of energy saving companies (ESCOs) to share efficiency gains with energy users.



                                                     15

70.     Private sector financing in the Moroccan energy sector isfeasible. The Bank's experience with
the guarantee it awarded for the Jorf Lasfar power plant has successfully demonstrated the promising
potential of private financing inthe energy sector when a legal andregulatory framework is appropriately
defined. The privatization of the petroleum product distribution activities confirmed the potential for
foreign and domestic private involvement in the energy sector. The proposed operation, therefore,
supports the promotion of wind energy and EE inMorocco through private sector participation. Investors
will have access to specific financing instruments to stimulate their interest inEEandRE.

71.     Importance of consensus building and communication for reforms. Client consensus, buy-in,
and ownership of the operation's objectives and implementationmeasures are key to the success of policy
lending, particularly inthe highlypolitical energy sector. Inthat context, emphasis on wide consultation
and consensus has been introduced early on in the operation design and will continue during
implementation. Consultation has been integrated into the operations design through the following: (i)
the creation and close coordinationof multi-agency Government working groups to discuss and agree on
the sector reform's priority objectives and measures, (ii) organization by the Government inOctober 2006
of a sector-wide stakeholder awareness campaign and consultation on the reform during the national
energy sector conference (Journke de IEnergie), (iii)continued interaction and support to the
Communications Unit of the MEM, (iv) permanent contact between the Bank team and other donors
active in the energy sector in Morocco as the content of the reform program was developed, and (v)
preparation of a communicationplan on energy sector reforms with MEM(Annex 5).

72.     Monitoring and evaluation of sector reforms implementation. One key lesson i s the importance
of ensuring that the client prioritizes achievement of reform objectives over the implementationof a set of
measures. To that effect, the proposed operation includes strengthening of the accountability framework
for reforms implementation and impact evaluation, as part of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
process. To facilitate M&E, the Bank has made considerable efforts during preparation in encouraging
and supporting the Energy Sector Observatory Department of the MEM to take on the responsibilities of
monitoringthe progress and impact of sector reform.

G. Analytical Underpinnings

74.     TA work in energy efficiency and sectorpolicy. The latest Morocco Investment Climate Report,
jointly produced by the World Bank and IFC in2005, and the CAS have provided strong underpinnings
to the analysis and design of the proposed operation.         In addition, detailed social, environmental,
economic, fiscal, and budgetary impact analyses of Government sector reforms were conducted as part of
the energy sector dialogue over the past year and a half. Such impact analyses drew extensively on data
from numerous available sources, such as Morocco's comprehensive 2000 and 2001 household surveys,.
Additional information and analytical work was produced in the context of the various TA activities
supporting the Government during preparation of the loan and coordinated by the World Bank under
trust-find financing, includingthe following:

        (i)Moroccan      Gas Sector Study (ESMAPfunded): "Introduction du gaz naturel au Maroc-prix
              et principes de tarification du gaz naturel," ESMAP Paper 209/98, October 1998 (French &
              English);and "Introduction du gaz naturel au Maroc-Plan       de diveloppement gazier, Phase

A. Policy Areas

75.       The operation will provide budget support to the implementation of the medium-term
energy sector reformprogram. The proposed DPL would support the implementation, over the period
200649 period, of the Government energy sector reform program, as described in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex 1). The long-term perspective and action program necessary for energy
sector reforms i s describedinthe ImplementationMatrix giveninAnnex 2.

76.       Inorder to implement the reform program outlined in Section 111-C and to achieve the results
summarized in Section IV-A, the proposed operation will support Government action inthe policy areas
reviewedbelow.

Energy Security and Sustainable Development

77.       Reduce energy import dependency through the development of an enforceable framework for
EE and RE: A law for EE and REwas approved by the Council of Government inMay 2007, and the
secondary legislationwill be drafted end-2007 for adoption of the corresponding decrees and Government
decisions in2008.

          (a) The law provides an enforceable legal framework for energy management (RE and EE) and
               establish result-oriented institutions for energy managementincluding:

               (i)RestructuringCDERtotransformitintotheinstitutionfor energymanagementpolicy
                   implementation.       The new institution will be a small implementing institution with
                   specific operational objective^.'^    The agency will be endowed with an annual budget
                   appropriation of DH3 million. The charter for the new institution will take into account
                   the conclusions of an analysis carried out by international experts funded by ESMAP, and
                   ensure that it has a results-oriented businessplanaiming at saving 1.7 milliontoe per year
                   by 2015. A detailedrestructuringscheme will beadoptedby mid-2007.

               (ii)Establishing financial incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, that are
                   intended to be channeled through a specialized window in an existing Fund, based on
                   technical recommendations provided by the new CDER.14As the specialized window i s
                   expected to be operational end-2007, the first budgetary allocation will be made in the
                   2008 Budget Law to be prepared in 2007. In addition, the window will seek resources
                   from international donors.




l3
 Its role will be focused on (i) implementation o f Government policy anddelivery o f specific results interms o f
                                  the
development o fRE (except large grid-connected wind electricity) and EE, (ii) technical support for the development
andimplementationofEEandRE(same exceptionfor wind) projects and for project evaluation, and (iii)        interaction
with financing institutionsandindustry.
l4The specialized window will be placed in a Fundthat will be a legally independententity for fiduciary reasons
and will have a staff o f only a few individuals. The Fundwill help secure financing for energy efficiency and small
RE projects through long-term loans managed by commercial banks, guarantees to ESCOs, and other funding for
energy efficiency enterprises. It will administer directly grant support to EE and RE (except wind) projects on
behalf o f the Government.
                                                         17

     (b)      For EE, the law and the implementationdecrees will:

         (i)Setenergyefficiencystandardsforappliances,appliancelabeling,newbuildings,street
              lighting, andpublic buildings.
         (ii) Organize the execution and monitoring o f mandatory EE audits in large- and medium-
              size industries.
         (iii)Organize Government support for fmancing o f EEprograms.


     (c)      For ER, the law will:

         (i)Setthemedium-termobjectivesforRE(1,000MWofadditionalwindpowerby2012).
         (ii) theroleandobligationsofONEasSystemOperatorforthedevelopmentofwind
              Define
              energy through a minimum-capacity approach that will obligate ONE to contract every
              year a certain capacity o f wind energy to independent power producer (IPPs).
         (iii)Specify the mode o f selection o f private concessionaires for wind power through a
              competitive least-cost process.

     (d)      Inthe short run, the Government has included in the 2007 Budget Law provisions to
              ensure that EE and RE equipment and projects are subject to the same fiscal regime as
              other energy projects withregard to VAT and import duties.

78.  Reduce energy supply risk:

     (a)      The Government i s establishing a high-level inter-ministerial steering group for
         evaluating long-term energy supply options. The steering group will launch and supervise a
         study that will define by mid-2008 a long-term investment program inmajor electricity and
         gas transport infrastructure. The program will ensure that the country's energy needs and
         environmental objectives are met while improving energy security.

     (b)      The Government i s developing the legal framework including a Gas Sector Law in
         anticipation o f future gas sector development for energy diversification.         The driving
         principles o f the Gas Sector Law i s that third-party access for gas transport and storage will
         be ensured fair competition and that the financing and operation o f the future gas
         infrastructure will be entrusted to the private sector, under Government regulation and
         oversight. The Gas Sector Law was presented to the Bank mid-2006 i s expected to be
         approved by end-2007; the secondary legislationi s expectedto be approved in2008.

     (c)      The Government i s revisiting its strategy for security oil stocks to (i)   determine the
         desirable level o f security oil stocks, (ii)develop a system for stock management by the
         distribution companies on behalf o f the Government to be agreed by end-2007, (iii)      ensure
         effective monitoring o f security oil stocks, and (iv) secure the financial resources needed to
         reconstitute the stocks and to finance their management.

79. Reduce the environmental and health impact of the energy sector:

     (a) The Government i s introducing environmental regulationto limit atmospheric emissions from
        power plants and refineries. Technical discussions are on-going with ONE and S A M I R to
         establish emissions standards, as it has been done successfully for the cement plants. A
        decree will set the emissions limits applicable for existing units and for future units in order
        to converge toward the EUemission standards, organize an emission monitoring system, and
        specify penalties for noncompliance. The decree on emission standards will be issued before
        end-2007.
                                                  18

       (b) The Government will implement legislationto achievebyJanuary2009:

           (i)    Elimination of diesel fuel with 10,000 parts per million (ppm) of sulfuri5 to comply
                  with international best practice of usingdiesel with no more than 350 or 50 ppm. This
                  will reduce SO2 emissions, which are harmful to public health and forests, by 95
                  percent by 2009.
           (ii)   Elimination of leaded gasoline to reduce exposure of urban populations, particularly
                  children, to harmfulemissions containinglead by 2009.

Energy Sector Productivity

80     Opening of the electricity market to competition:

       (a) Regional integration. The Government and ONE will complete by end-2007 reinforcing the
           interconnection of the Moroccan electricity system with neighboring Spain and Algeria with
           sufficient capacity to remove physical constraints on exchanges of electricity. The proposed
           operation will support the development of the rules for regional energy trading between
           Morocco, other Maghreb countries, andthe European systems (Annex 2).

       (b) Liberalization of the high voltage power market. The first major step in the liberalization
           process i s the elimination of the monopoly for power generation and supply to create a
           competitive power market for highvoltage and very highvoltage consumers. As a first step
           to the introduction of competition, the Council of Government has adopted inMarch 2007 a
           law which allows large electricity consumers to produce their own electricity by installing
           power generation capacity of up to 50 MW and to access the ONE grid to transport the
           electricity they produce from one of their site to another. The self-generation law introduces
           private sector participation in generation and introduces competition, while allowing third
           party access to the transmission network for self-generators.

       (c) Electricity sector restructuring. The proposed operation supports the adoption and
           implementation of the Electricity Sector Liberalization Law in preparation. The law will
           contribute to improve efficiency by opening the sector to domestic and international
           competitionthroughthe following measures:

           (i)Implementthesecondstageofelectricitymarketliberalization, whichwillallowhigh-
               voltage consumers to purchase electricity on a free market inMorocco or inneighboring
               countries, and will allow private production of electricity for the high-voltage Moroccan
               market.
           (ii)Restructure ONE and unbundle it into three commercially separatedactivities: generation
               for the regulated market, dispatch and transmission, and distribution within a ONE
               holding company.
           (iii)
               Establish an electricity sector Regulatory Agency under the supervision o f the
               Government.      The Regulatory Agency will advise on price revisions, attribution of
               licenses for new generators and distributors, supervision o f existing and new concessions,
               setting of technical and commercial standards, supervision of calls for tenders for new
               capacity by the Independent System Operator, andregulationof competition.
           The law was prepared in 2006-07 and will be finalized by the end of 2007. It will be
           presentedto Parliament in2008. It will be followed bythe secondary legislationin2008-09.

         (d) The Government has createda highlevel inter-ministerial Committee for the implementation
                of the provisions of the electricity law and the restructuring of ONE, as well as for the
                development of regulations and institutions for the integrationof the Moroccanpower system
                into the regional power market. The group has convened for the first time inMarch 2007 to
                discussthe draft law.

82.      Stimulating competitionin thepetroleum products market:
         (a) The ceiling price for petroleumproducts i s set by formulae that were developed for oil market
                conditions when the price of oil was US$30 per bbl and less. The Government intends to
                pursue negotiations with S A M I R and sector operators for correction of some anomalies and
                revision of the pricing formulae to take into account the actual logistical and supply costs.16
                These negotiations have already produced some significant improvement in the structure of
                the pricing formula andare expected to be completed by end-2007.

         (b) The Government has indicated its commitment to stimulate competition in the liquid
                petroleum product market by end-2008 and its intent to allow prices to be set by market
                forces thereafter.

         (c) In preparation for the 2009 market liberalization, the Government will also facilitate the
                attribution of authorizations for the construction of storage capacities through the redefinition
                of the eligibility criteria for licensing. The Government will develop additional storage
                facilities as a common service to all distributors.

         (d) The Government has extendedto all butane terminals the obligationofthird-partyaccess.

         (e) In preparation for the opening of the petroleum product market to competition, the
                Government intends to reinforce its market monitoring capacity at the Direction des Prix and
                with the MEMto ensure that effective competition and quality ofproducts are maintained.

GovernmentFinancialExposure in the Energy Sector

83.      Reduce Governmentsubsidiesfor liquidpetroleum products:

         (a) The proposed operation supports Government adjustments of liquidpetroleumproduct prices
                since September 2006 and afterward based on the variations in international energy prices.
                These adjustments have eliminated subsidies on all liquidpetroleum products, except diesel,
                and reduced the budget-financed gap between the ceiling price to which distributors and
                S A M I R are entitled and the Government-controlled consumer prices from US$1 billion in
                2006 to a projected US$750 million in2007. The operation will also support the preparation
                in2007 of a plan and related social safety net for the future revision of butane prices, which
               would further help reduce Government subsidiesby up to US$450 millionper year.

         (b) The Government has committedto review international prices two weeks and to set consumer
               prices so as to reflect international price variations, except in exceptional circumstances for
                social reasons.

for monitoring national and world energy market trends. In a second stage, the Ministry intends to
reinforceits ability to modelthe Moroccan energy sector..

86.       Implementing communication plan on energy reforms. The Government will take steps for
implementationof a communicationplan (Annex 5): (i)              present its full communicationstrategy on energy
sector reforms early in 2007; and (ii)       ensure that the Communication Department of MEM has the
budgetary resources needed for the implementation of the plan. In the short run the MEM held the
Journde de 1'Energie (energy day) on October 30, 2006; organized a workshop on electricity reforms to
be delivered by end-January2007 (with PPIAF funding); and organized inNovember 2006 some 15 focus
groups on energy utilization across the social spectrum in Morocco. Inthe future, it will hold quarterly
"energy town hall" meetings on energy reforms, as well a semiannual follow-up Journde de 1'Energie.

B. OperationDescription

 87.     An overall agreement has been reached with the Government on the design and
 implementation of the reforms supported under theproposedprogrammatic operation as part of the
 long-term energy sector dialogue. Inagreementwith the Government, the ongoing energy sector reform
 programwill be implemented over the four-year 2006-09 period. The implementationperiodreflects the
 nature of energy sector reforms, which need to be implemented over a long time period. The proposed
 operation, as a programmatic DPL, supports directly the entire reform program over the 2007-09 period,
 incontinuation ofthe actions implementedin2006. The agreementona long-termstrategy, intermediate
 steps andimmediate actions i s reflected inthe Letter of Sector Development Policy (Annex 1) and Policy
 Matrix (Annex 2). The proposed operation i s a programmatic DPL comprising three successive single
 tranche loans. The Policy Matrix includes prior actions met for the proposed single tranche loan and
 triggers for the next loan. The triggers for the third loan will be finned-up duringappraisal of the second
 loan. Continued engagement of the Bank to support the medium-termreformprocess will dependupon
 progress and success in implementation of the action program and confirmation of the long-term
 perspective of energy sector reforms-amended                  as needed in light of the experience with the
 implementation of the first-year reforms-and the evolution of the internationalenergy market.

88.      Sectoral and macroeconomicobjectives. The proposed DPL will contribute to the simultaneous
achievement of both energy sector and macroeconomic objectives. The proceeds o f the Bank loan will
not be earmarked for the energy sector, but will provide overall budget support to the Government. The
funds will help address two effects onthe Moroccaneconomy ofthe energy market dysfunction:

          (i)imposes
                The gap between international energy prices and national prices for petroleum products
                        a budgetary burden, which will be eliminatedover time. The implementationofthe
                Government decision to move toward pegging all petroleum product prices to international
                prices needs to be implemented over several years because o f its social implications. The
                proceeds of the proposed loan will alleviate the budgetary burden of a gradual adjustment
                and of the transitory compensatory measures.
         (ii)Theenergybillinforeign currencyisrisingandputtingpressureontheMoroccanbalance
                of payments (it represented 22 percent of imports in 2005). The Government policy to
               improve energy efficiency and develop endogenous resources (in particular renewable
                energy sources) i s expected to reduce this burden from 2015 onward (1.7 mtoe equivalent),
               but the benefits will materialize only gradually. The proceeds of the loan will help bridge

                                VI.       OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Economic Impacts
91.      Net economic impacts of policy reforms envisaged under the DPL arepositive and substantial.
Reforms will yield fiscal benefits, freeing signijkant Government budget resources and will generate
efficiency gains in the whole energy sector throughprice changesand growth of competition.

               Liquid petroleum products price increases of 2 to 7 percent have taken place as a result of
               subsidy reduction. Negative economic impacts of those increasesare expectedto be modest.
               Their indirect impacts onthe prices of 19branchesof the Moroccaneconomy was estimated
               to range from 2.8 percent to 0.12 percent, amounting to a 1.4 percent increase inthe general
               level of prices." This impact i s expected to be neutralized by price reductions of about 4
               percent arising inparallel, from adjustments inthe price-formation mechanism of petroleum
               products and from increased competition. A more immediate impact will result from the
               improvement of the fiscal stance through a reductionof energy subsidies. The latter will free
               up budgetary resources of around US$250 million per year in the short term. The freed
               resources can be used to reduce taxes, or put to more effective use in the economy than
               subsidizing prices, or can be usedto reducethe Government budget deficit.

               For electricity, high wind quality in a number of Moroccan sites, points to a significant
               potential for developing wind electricity production on competitive terms compared to other
               forms of power generation. This least cost potential has been estimated at 1,000 MW of
               capacity. Inthe immediate years following reform of the high-voltage electricity market, all
               else being equal, self-generation, larger availability of electricity from Spain (or possibly
               Algeria at a later stage) are likely to lower the electricity price paid by large consumers. At
               the moment, high-voltage electricity prices are slightly lower in Spain than inMorocco, but
               the price differential i s dependent on international gas and coal prices. The reform is
               expectedto pushprices towards the marginal cost of supply, allowing differences invariable
               cost to be exploitedbetter.

92.      Reforms will also havepositive impacts on energy security and the environment. Reforms will
help reduce the growth of energy imports, generate savings for the trade balance and lower polluting
emissions. Costs of those measures can be compared to their benefits by assessing the differences
between two scenarios of energy supply-demand balances, with and without reforms. Main costs arise
from expenditures for energy efficiency and developing wind electricity capacity (net of conventional
energy capital expenditures that wind replaces). Those expenditures are expected to total US$l billion
over 2008-15 (US$0.4 billion for energy efficiency measures and US$0.6 billion to expand wind
electricity generation capacity up to 1000MW). Mainbenefits are savings of petroleum and coal imports,
which are estimated to reach 0.2 mtoe in 2009 and gradually grow to 1.7 mtoe in 2015, achieving on
average 0.7 mtoe per annum. Assuming prices of US$60 per barrel for oil, US$75 per ton for coal, and a
10 percent discount rate, the total fuel import savings over the period 2008-15 are US$1.1 billion, thus
generating a net benefit of US$lOO million over 2008-2015. In addition, avoided COz emissions are
expectedto yieldanotherUS$195 millionof environmental benefits over 2008-2015. The implementation
of measures of energy efficiency and the development of wind electricity generation capacity are
projected to yield net benefits of $295 million over 2008-15. Other benefits may accrue such as greater



l8Impacts on overall inflation o f fie1 price changes have been evaluated using a Leontieff framework. Using the
input-output table o f Morocco 2003 (Haut Commissariat au Plan), a linear model o f price formation has beenbuilt,
integrating the 20 sectors o f the table. The model has been calibrated using 2003 data on inputs, wages and capital,
taxes and subsidies onproducts, margins and external trade taxes.

B. Povertyand SocialImpacts

94.         Some reforms that the proposed DPL supports are likely to have positive social impacts. These
include improved air quality and increasedbudgetary resources for poverty reduction programs resulting
from the elimination of fuel subsidies. Some reforms, however, may have a detrimental effect on certain
social groups.

95.         The most significant negative short-term social impact is related to removal of fuel subsidies.
Before the implementation of the energy reforms supported by the proposed energy DPL, the subsidy
represented2 to 14percent of liquidpetroleumproduct prices. The subsidies have been eliminated on all
liquidproducts (some remaining on diesel) with a correlative increaseinconsumer prices. Price increases
may be partly offset by productivity gains, but the impact of the price increase will be felt immediately,
while the productivity gains may take some time to materialize. The household surveys, however, have
established that diesel and gasoline are not consumed heavily by the low-income groups,19 and therefore
these groups will not be directly affected in a noticeable way by the price increase. The removal of
petroleum subsidies, however, will indirectly affect households through its impact on the price of all
consumer goods. The evaluation of the impact of subsidy removal on prices has been evaluated and is
limited2'. Itwill represent from 0.14 percent for education and health services to 1.1percent for food and
2.9 percent for transport. It should be noted that the reduction of butane subsidies i s not included inthe
proposed DPL. If butane subsidies, which have a greater impact on the poor, are to be removed in the
future, a poverty and social impacts analysis would need to be carried out and compensatory mechanisms
would beneeded.21

C. EnvironmentalAspects
Environmental Legislation Applicable to the Energy Sector
97.         The environmental legislation applicable to the energy sector is already inplace but needs to be
reinforced. The environmental legislation applicable to the energy sector includes Law 10-1995 on water
resource management, Law 11-2003 on protection and sustainable use of the environment, Law 12-2003
on environmental impact assessment, and Law 13-2003 on air pollution control?2 Conspicuously, there is
no regulationyet inMorocco concerning EEor the development of RE.



l9Theincreaseindieselandgasolinepriceswillincreaseexpenditureslessthan0.04percentforthelowesttwoquintiles.
2o For diesel and gasoline, the top quintile receives more than three-quarters of the Government subsidy and the poorest quintile
receives less than 1 percent. The targeting o fthe diesel and gasoline subsidy i s therefore ineffective.The social impact ofthe
removal o f the diesel subsidy, which i s part o f the proposed operation, i s therefore very limited.
21 Possiblemeasureswould include(i)  decreasingtaxation(again, preferablyon essentialor inferior goods so that the poor would benefit); or (ii)
reducingthe cost (or improvingaccess or quality) of public servicesusedby the poor, suchas primaryeducation, healthcare, water, and
electricity. Expenditureon suchservices couldbetargetedto poorer areas or users through geographicaltargeting, vouchers, lifeline tariffs, lump
sumcompensatorypayments per household, and so forth.

22The mainprovisionsof these laws include the following:
                                                                    25

  98.      Together, these laws provide a comprehensive framework for addressing some of the key
  environmental impacts of energy transformation. However, inthe case of the water law, and especially of
  the air pollution law, the ability of the legislationto generate significant improvements inenvironmental
  quality will depend on the adoption and enactment of the related secondary legislation. This i s the reason
  why the package of DPL-supported reforms includes the issuance of a decree establishing limits for
  atmospheric emissions from refineries and power plants. The proposed DPL will address the gap inEE
  and REregulation.

  TheHealth and Environmental Impacts of Energy SectorReforms
  99.      Most of the reforms that the DPL will support have significantly positive environmental effects,
  whereas a few of them may have negative, but largely manageable, effects.

  100.     The main positive effects of the reforms for Morocco will be on health and air quality.
  According to a 2003 World Bank study, air pollution in Morocco i s estimated to generate health costs
  worth around DH 3.6 billion per year (about 1 percent of Morocco's GDP in 2000), of which DH 2.1
  billionis relatedto outdoor air pollutionand DH 1.5 billionto indoor air pollution.

  101,     The impact ofthe reforms onthe poor is likely to be significant. For example, reforms will have a
  positive affect on the significant pockets of poverty in large urban areas that are exposed to high
  concentrations of pollution. Reforms will also help alleviate the consequences of the limited access of the
  poor to the health care requiredto treat respiratory diseases and other ailments generatedby air pollution.

  102.     Severalof the reforms supported by the proposed operation will noticeably improve air quality by
  reducing energy-related emission that lead to air pollution (andto a lesser extent water pollution), and by
  reducing the related impacts on human health. In addition, reforms will help curb the release of global
  pollutants suchas C02 emissions.

  103.     The evaluation23of the emission-reduction potential of the DPL indicates that it will result, over
  the period 2009-15, inemissions reductions ranging from 98 percent (inthe case of lead) to 6 percent (in
  the case ofNO,) (see Table 6.2).

  104.     A conservative lower-bound estimate of the monetary value of SO2,NOx, and particulate matter
  (PM) reductions, based on EU figures of the external cost of air pollution adjusted for per capita income
  (inPPPterms), suggests a range of 0.3-1.7 percent of Morocco's GDP. The actual avoided damage (and
  hence the reforms' benefits) might be larger if one accounts separately for health effects in large urban
  areas (where P M concentrations are higher) as opposedto usingaverages across rural and urbanareas.




        The water law (10-1995) establishes a legal framework regulatingthe dischargeof polluting emissions into water bodies, as well as the
        principlethat water abstractionsand discharges shouldbe subject to fees (redevance de pril2vement et de diversement),bothto generate
        revenues for environmental protectionand to provide incentives for sustainablewater use. A regulation (Arrtte')jointly signed by four
    .   Ministries establishingthe norms for water discharges from refineries was approvedinDecember2005.

        The environmental impact assessment (EIA) law (12-2003) stipulates that a number of energy sector projects are subject to the EIA
        procedures, namely gas storage infrastructure, refmeries, power plants andother combustionfacilities generatingpower inexcess of 300
        MW, nuclearplants, andhydroelectric plants.

        The air pollution control law (13-2003) contains generalprovisionsonthe emissionof substances pollutingthe air, including obligations
        on companies and individuals, responsibilities for monitoring and enforcement, and transitional measures to incentivize pollution
        abatement activitiesand energy savings.The law defers the task of definingair quality standardsandnoms for pollutingemissionsfrom
        selected productionfacilities to pendingregulationsto be issued by the relevant Government bodies. These pending regulations will be
        finalizedunderthe proposedoperation.

 Note: The data from ONE assumes that by 2015, 1,200 MW of additional capacity will be added to power
         stations based on natural gas.

105.     In addition, the proposed DPL will generate further health benefits through the adoption of air
emission standards for power plants and refineries. While these effects have not been quantified in the
same detail as those identified inTable 6.3, they are likely to be quite significant, since power plants and
refineries currently account for about 60 percent of total SO2 emissions, 40 percent of NOx emissions,
and about 65 percent of P M emissions.

The GHGEmission Reduction Effect

106.     GHG emissions will be reduced by 10percent per year. The proposed operation will support
measures for increased EE and for the development of RE (wind and solar), which will result in a
reduction of utilization of fossil fuels, including coal gas, oil, and diesel for power generation and other
utilizations. The total avoided fossil fuel consumption will be 1.7 mtoe per year by 2015, corresponding
to a reduction inCOZemissions o f 6.5 million tons (10 percent) per year by 2015 (28.1 million tons over
the 2009-15 period).

TheNegative Impact

107.     The negative impact may result from the expansion of storagefacilities under a liberalized
market. The DPL-supportedreforms that might have some negative impacts on the environment include
the introduction of competition inthe petroleumproduct market. Measures to enhance price competition
among producers may be accompanied by a strengthening of the logistics infrastructure required to
effectively enable multiple operators to compete in the market. This may involve measures such as the
issuanceof authorizations for the construction of new unloading and storage facilities. Morocco, however,
has adopted in2003 legislation (Law 12/2003) to regulate the EnvironmentalImpact Assessment process,
interms of scope of application, substantive requirements, andprocedure of approval. To the extent that
the construction of unloading and storage infrastructures will be subject to the existing legislation, any
significant negative environmental effect i s likely to be avoided or mitigated.

      petroleum products contributing to the general
      budget have shrunk from a high of 4.3 percent of
      GDP in 1993 to an estimated 0.7 percent of GDP in
      2006. Inaddition casharrears have developed inthe
      fiscal accounts: The Compensation Fund (CF) has
      accumulated          compensatory        payments        due to
      distributors equivalent to 3.4 percent of 2005 GDP
      over the period 1999-05. In the same period, the
      Government transferred resources to the CF
      equivalent to 2.3 percent of 2005 GDP, which left




      111.       This DPL proposes a set of measures that wouldpreserve and increasefiscal surpluses. The
      DPL supports an increase of diesel price by DH 0.50 per                                    full indexation of liquid petroleum
      products, and an eventual liberalization of the liquid petroleum product sector in 2009. The net fiscal
      savings from implementation of the Government's mainreforms inthe energy sector would amount up to
      DH28.6 billion (US$3.5 billion) cumulated over the period 2006-09 (see Table 6.3), equivalent of 5.7
      percent of 2006 GDP.

      112.      Net fiscal savings would result from a combination of reduced subsidies concomitant with oil
      price increases at the retail level over the 2007-09 period and additional revenues resulting from the
      liberalization of petroleum product prices by 2009, including diesel prices. On the expenditure side,
      however, the estimated cost o f developing 90 days of energy security stocks25could be as much as DH5
      billion (US$600 million), equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP.

      E. Supervision

      113.       The MEM will be the primary entity responsible for overall implementation of the proposed
      operation and for reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned agencies (including
      the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Interior, MFP, MATEE, ONE, and CDER). The overall status of
      the Government's program will be monitored during supervision to determine whether the context of
      specific conditions of the proposed operation has changed. Inaddition, supervision missions will report
      on progress with sector reforms, prepare negotiations of subsequent Energy DPLs. Three annual
      supervisionmissions are anticipated, including one inthe last quarter of the calendar year, to take stock of
      DPL results, and assess the Government's performance with regardto the triggers.


      F. FiduciaryAspects

      114.       A Country Financial Accounting Assessment (CFAA) was conducted in 2003. The main
      conclusion of the CFAA i s that the Moroccanpublic financial management system i s characterized by a
      good level of transparency and accuracy and backed by a strong MFP (which has an extensive treasury
      network inthe country). The Ministryof Finance andPrivatization (MFP) will be the loanrecipient.

      115.       Foreign exchange. The review of a country's control environment for foreign exchange is
      generally made through a safeguard assessment of the country's Central Bank by the IMF. As part of this
      assessment, the IMF reviews the published annual audit reports and the financial statements of the Central
      Bank. As Morocco has not had an IMF program for several years, the IMF has not issued a safeguards
      assessment, but the first audit reports and financial statement of the Central Bankwill be issuedinlate 2006
      following a comprehensive reorganization of the Central Bank Al-Maghrib. The new organization rule of
      the Central Bank (Decree of November 23, 2005-Dahir                        No1-05-38 du 20 Chaoual 1426) states that the
      financial statements of the Bank must be audited by an independent external auditor or Commissaire am
      Comptes (Article 52). In addition, the new rule establishes the principle of the control of the financial
      statements of the Central Bankby the Court of Accounts. The World Bank knowledge of the Central Bank
      fiduciary capacity was compiled duringthe 2003 CFAA discussions with the Treasury of the Kingdom on
      the debt accounting and reporting system by the Central Bank. The Treasury appeared satisfied with the
      Central Bank performance and didnot raise any serious concerns to call for a specific assessment. No other
      IMF or Bank report raises any issues with foreign exchangecontrolat the Central Bank.


                                                                        29

116.     The Moroccan public financial management system is robust, but characterized by long
implementation delays. The system o f control is comprehensive (internal, external, ex ante, ex post) but
requires further modernization in order to provide performance-based audit and added value.                The
integrated computerization o f the system i s ongoing and expected to be effective in 2007. A number o f
reforms are underway, including an integrated accounting information system for the public sector,
performance-based budgeting, decentralization and deconcentration, and internal controls. These reforms
are expected to improve substantially the performance o f public sector management. Given the low
fiduciary risk o f the public financial management system o f Morocco, no condition inthe proposed DPL
i s necessary. However, in relation to the CDER reform, some form o f modernized control framework
over this renewed entity will be put in place. In this regard, Law 69-00 o f November 11, 2003,
modernizing the financial control o f the public sector, provides the appropriate tools, for example the
controle d` accompagnement andsome form o f contrat deprogramme.

G. DisbursementandAuditing

117.     The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursementproceduresfor Development Policy
Loans and will be disbursed in one installment. The disbursement o f the finds will follow the Bank's
simplified disbursement procedures for development policy operations approved by the Board on
February 1, 1996. The proceeds o f the loan will be disbursed in one single tranche in the amount of
US$lOO million equivalent upon loan effectiveness. Disbursements will not be linked to any specific
purchases, and there will be no procurement requirements.

118.     Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, theproceeds willbe deposited
by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptableto the Bank at the CentralBank of
Morocco (Bank AI Maghrib). The Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit o f the Loan into said
account, an equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign
currency account and credited to the budget management system. Ifthe proceeds o f the loan are used for
ineligible purposes as definedinthe LoanAgreement, IBRDwill require the Borrower to promptly refund
an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such
request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this loan will be the responsibility o f the MFP.
Although an audit o f the use o f the finds may not be required, IBRDreserves the right to require audits
any time.

H. RiskandRiskMitigation
Macroeconomic Risk
119.     International oil prices increase significantly. Inthe event international energy prices increase
significantly, Moroccan consumer prices would follow the same trend. This would have an immediate
impact not only on consumers' budgets, but also on costs for energy-consuming Moroccan industries.
This risk will be partly mitigated in the medium term by increasing reliance on RE, although the
development o f these resources will take several years to produce tangible results and will not fully
protect Morocco against international energy price fluctuations.          The higher efficiency in energy
utilization will also contribute to reduce exposure to the international price risk, but the impact o f the EE
policy will also take several years to materialize. Inthe long run, the integration o f the energy security
dimension inthe energy policy?6will help mitigate the international price risk.

120.     Appetite of theprivate sector to respond to the enhanced business opportunitiesin the energy
sector resultingfrom the Government reform program. The reformprogram o f the Government relies
onprivate sector initiative inseveral respects:



26A study on options for external energy supply is underway and its results should form the basis o f an energy
   supplystrategy.
                                                     30

         (i)developmentofpowergeneratingcapacity
         (ii)investmentingrid-connectedwindenergy
         (iii)creation o fprivate energy service companies (ESCOs)
         (iv) investment inpetroleumproduct storage capacity and logistics

 121.    The interest o f private investors in investing in power generation that serves high-voltage
consumers i s uncertain, because the market does not exist yet and the willingness o f creditworthy high-
voltage consumers to conclude long-term purchase agreements i s untested."           There i s therefore risk that
no party would be willing to invest in power generation for the high-voltage market.                 This risk is
mitigated through (i) adoption o f the Law to increase the ceiling for self-generators and o f the
                         the
Electricity Liberalization Law, which will create a stable and predictable regulatory framework; (ii)          the
actual commitment o f some high-voltage consumers to finance investment in new capacity from their
own resources (the Lafarge captive plant for example), which suggests that there i s already some interest
from potential investors); and (iii)      the possibility for the liberalized high-voltage market to develop
gradually through the purchase o f electricity from Spain, which will create a market and encourage
investment in new generation in Morocco. In addition, integration o f the Moroccan and EU power
systems will allow investors in power generation to find additional markets in Spain, if they can be
competitive.

 122.    The interest in wind energy o f domestic and international investors i s strong and documented.
The risk o f lack o f interest i s therefore low, and will be mitigated by the off-take guarantee offered by a
creditworthy ONE, as well as the development o f specific tender regulation for new wind capacities,
which will ensure that the wind projects yield a financial return inline with investors' expectations.

 123.    The interest o f private entrepreneurs in large-scale involvement in ESCOs and EE service
companies will require the support o f the Government to facilitate their access to commercial financing
from local banks. Support will be provided through the financing instruments offered by the EE and RE
Fund, particularly a risk guarantee to the local banks for the perfonnance o f the ESCOs and long-term
financing from the local banks inlocal currency.

124.     As several oil marketing companies have applied for licenses for new storage, there is a
demonstrated interest o f the private sector to invest in storage capacity.           Discussions with private
operators indicated that the risk o f delayed development o f storage capacity by private operators can be
mitigated through the clear indication by the Government that the sector will be liberalized by 2009 and
that operators will have equal accessto unloading facilities.
Weakening of Political Consensusfor Energy Reforms
125.     The post-election Government adopts a different strategy for energy reforms. There will be
parliamentary elections in2007. After the elections, a new Government will be formed. There i s a risk
that the new Government may select a different reform agenda and different long-term priorities and for
the energy sector. The main risks relate to (i)     the restructuring o f the electricity market, which may be
delayed or reversed for a return to an ONE-controlled market, and (ii)      the return to a regulated petroleum
downstream sector. The first risk will be partially mitigated through the adoption o f the Law on Self
Generation which has already been approved by the Council o f Government and by the creation o f an
inter-ministerial committee to prepare the approval and implementation o f the Electricity Liberalization
Law. The second risk cannot be really mitigatedand needs to be accepted, bearinginmindthat the return
to administered prices for petroleumproducts would put additional strain onthe budget andjeopardize the
liberalization o f the downstream market by end-2008.              Both risks are further mitigated by the
programmatic structure o f the proposedDPL: inthe event that a new Government would decide to reverse
the decisions engaged by the present Government, the Bank would have the option to delay future DPL
loans until,through sector dialogue, a new consensus on energy sector reforms i s found.


27 Most commercial lenders will require long term take-or-pay power purchase agreementsas a condition for
financing new capacity
                                                        31

SocialAcceptance of Reforms
128.     The social acceptance of petroleum product price increases contains some uncertainty and
poses a potential reputational risk for the Bank. The price of diesel i s a politically sensitive issue,
particularly with the organized local transport industry, which has voiced reservations about fiu-therprice
increases. The Government envisages to develop a plan to revise butane prices in the future. This is
socially sensitive with the low-income and rural population. The butane price has been maintained
constant for the past 15 years and is considered to be part of Government social policy. Inthe event of
steep increases in consumer prices of diesel and butane, there i s a risk of social unrest, which indirectly
may affect the Bank reputationifthe future butane price reform programi s perceived as Bank-supported.
Inordertomitigatethisrisk, the Government emphasizesthe importance ofcommunication anddialogue
prior to butane price adjustment. This dialogue, which will highlight the fiscal tradeoffs between
subsidies of petroleumproducts and alternative uses of fiscal resources, was launched at the Journie de
I'Energie.    In addition, the Government will associate any future significant increases with the
implementation of a social safety net and measures in support of the most exposed industries such as
agriculture andtransport. Discussion onthe design of the social safety net has begun.


Capacity to Implement ComplexSectorReforms
129.     The implementation of reforms will require strong leadership and capacity to mobilize high-
level technical expertise. The implementation of the reforms will require the continuation of a strong
leadership and a capacity to make decisions quickly and with authority. The need for strong leadership is
particularly important concerning the following issues:

        (i)ImplementationoftheElectricityLiberalization(restructuring) Law
        (ii)Preparationofthepetroleumproductmarketliberalization
        (iii)Managementofthestudyoftheenergyimportoptionsandimplementationoftheselected
              option


130.    The implementation of the reforms included in the Electricity Liberalization Law will be
conducted by a high-level implementationgroup (including no more than five members at the very senior
level) reporting to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the preparation of the liberalization of the petroleum
product market by end 2008 will be conducted by a small group under the lead of the MAEGE, including
also the MEM,the Ministryof the Interior, and MATEE. The Government will establish a steering group
for the energy import options study directly under the authority o f the Prime Minister's office, inorder to
ensure that the experts are shielded from the influence of the various parties, and that the choice of the
preferred energy-sourcing scenario i s made quickly, taking into account the intenninisterial dimension of
the decision (including energy security, economics, finance, andthe environment).

131.    Effectiveness of the new Energy Management Institution. The implementation of Morocco's
RE policy will be entrusted to CDER and the Energy Management Fund. The risk is whether the
reinforcement of CDER will be implemented fast enough, and the Energy Management Fund created as
quickly as expected. To mitigate this risk, in addition to the commitment of the MEM to an aggressive
implementation of the energy management policy, the Bank i s financing under the ESMAP program
technical assistance for EE and RE, including recommendations for the restructuring of CDER and the
establishment of incentive mechanisms to promote EE and RE. Further support for the restructuring o f
CDER and the Fundwill be needed. Other donors have been approached andhave showninterest.

Ntroliers reliant les prix sortie-raffinerie et les prix aux consommateurs aux cours
intemationaux. La r6percussion des fluctuations sur b msommateur avait 6tt!
cependant suspendue A partir de septembte 2000 du fait des fortes majorations des
prix int6rieursqu'elleauraitentralnees.

2-      Le d4veloppement de la production blectrique ind6pendante      .- Par dhret-loi

          -   Jorf Lasfar Energy Company qui a conclu le 12 septembre 1997 un
              contrat avec I'ONE pour I'exploitation des deux unites de production
              existantes B Jorf Lasfar et pour la r6alisation et f'exploitation de deux
              autres unites Ill et N dans cette mQmecentrale. La puissance totale de
              ces quatre unites est 1.370 MW. La production de cette centrale a

4-     Tarifs de I'dlectricitt3: Compte tenu de la hausse des prix des diffkrents
combustibles utilisds dans la production de I'6nergie Blectrique, les pouvoirs publics
ont prodd6 un relevement de 5 cts. /kWh sur les tarifs de vente de l'dlectricitt5en
T&s haute, Haute et Moyennetension B partir du ler fkvrier 2000. Une hausse de
7% pour la BasseTension est ddciddeA partirdu lerjuillet 2006.

 reduction du taux du soufre dans le gasoil et de reduireles&missionsnocives.

Ainsi, & partir dejanvier 2009, le gasoil 10,000pprn de soufre, dont la consommation
actuelleest de 3,7 millionstonnes par an, sera supprime et wnplad par le gasoil50
ppm. L'essence plombh, qui avec 240.000 tonnes par an reprbsente 65% du
march4 des essences, sera halement supprim6e. L'essence sans plomb sera
gbneralisb en janvier 2009. Un arrW en date du 10 aoOt 2005 (Bulletinofficiel5348
du 1 septembre2005) fixe I'adoption des qualit& des produitscites cidessus au l*'
janvier 2008. Un retard suppl6mentaire btant possible, lajanvierp r 6 w pour I'entrh
en vigueur des normes de qualit6 des produits est le lwdate 2009. L'introducth
sur le march4 marocain du gasoil 50 ppm de eoufre prmettra de reduire les
dmissionsde SO2 de 80.000 Tonnes B partir de 2009. La gen6ralisation de I'essence

diversification des sources d'approvisionnement et la valorisation des ressources
nationales, notamment A travers la promotion de toutes les formes mobilisables
d'hergies renouvelabks(hydrauliques, eoliennes et solaires).
Durant c88 demiires an-,           le secteur des energies renouvelables a et6 marque
par un environnement national et international favorable au dbveloppement des
filieresdesenergiesdurables.
Au niveau national, cet environnement est marque par la praisposition des

Mr.President,

The Government o f the Kingdom o f Morocco considers the energy sector as having a very
importantrole as a driving force for economic development and for raising the standardof living
o fthe population.

The Government has initiated reforms inthe energy sector at an early stage, taking into account
the nearly complete dependency o f the country on energy imports and the challenges resulting
from international energy market developments.

Progress on reforms in the energy sector are part o f the energy policy framework to strengthen
energy security, meet fast growing energy demand and ensure that energy costs stay reasonable
inspite ofrisinginternationalenergy prices.

I-CHARACTERISTICSOFTHEMOROCCANENERGYSECTOR

Morocco -which i s a non-oil-producing country -i s faced with serious energy constraints due to
its near total dependence (more than 95%) on imported energy and the wide-scale use o f
traditional sources o f energy: wood and coal. Per capita energy consumption i s relatively low
(0.4 tons of oil equivalent (TOE)/inhabitant/year). However, primaryenergy consumptionrose to
12.306 million TOE in2005, versus 11.51 million TOE in2004, Le., an increase o f 6.9%.

The energy sector inMorocco i s also characterized by a predominance o f oil products, although
their shareinenergy consumption decreasedfrom 83% in 1980 to 62% in2005.

Coal -which i s the secondmost important fuel inthe energy balance - has seen its sharegrow,
startinginthe nineteeneighties andreaching approximately 32% in2005. The use ofcoal hasbeen
significantly expandedincement and sugar factories andparticularly inthe generation o f electricity.
Hydropower is subjectto substantial variability depending onrainfalls andrepresented2.5% o f
overallprimaryenergy consumption in2005.

                                                45

Power generating capacity amounts to 5,252 MW. The parc o fpower planti s fairly diverse,
therefore satisfying the energypolicy objective o f fuel mix diversification. Theprimary forms o f
energyinuse or under development for power generation are coal, fuel oil, natural gas, wind and
solar power.
Morocco also has important sources of renewable energy, particularly with regardto solar power
with a radiation o f 5 kWh/m2/day, and wind power with a potential of 6000 MW, particularly
along the 3,500 kmo f coastal areas.
Renewable energyhas taken on an importantrole inshaping the government's energy strategy. It
i s anticipated that renewable energy (including hydro) will be responsible for 10% o f primary
energy requirements by 2012 versus 3.9% now.

With regard to energy efficiency, it has been estimated that there is a potential 15% savings o f
total energy consumptionthat can be achieved by 2020.

Moreover, due to the increase inthe prices o f oil and coal on the international market, the total cost
o f energy in Morocco went from MAD 27 billion (US$ 3 billion) in 2004 to MAD 37.7 billion
(US$37.7 billion) in2005 and approximately MAD44 billion(US$5 billion) in2006.

The cost o f oil (crude oil andrefinedproducts) went from MAD23 billion (US$2.6 billion) in
2004 to MAD33.4 billion (US$ 3.750 billion) in2005 and approximately MAD 40 billion (US$
2.6 billion) in2004, Le., an increase o f 74% between 2004 and 2006. This has been due to the
increased imports and the rise inoil prices. The cost of oil imports currently represents 7% o f
GDP and 20% o ftotal imports o f goods into Morocco.


This situation has translated into a heavy burden for the Compensation Fund that went from
MAD3.7 billionin2004 to MAD7.4 billionin2005 andto MAD7.7 billion in2006.


11- THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGYFOFREFORMINGTHE ENERGYSECTOR


    REFORMSUNDERTAKENSINCE 1990

Since 1990, reforms have been undertaken to liberalize and restructure the oil and electricity
sectors and encourage private participationin largeprojects.

      Oil Sector: The Moroccan oil sector underwent significant reforms during the nineteen
      nineties. These reforms primarily involved the privatization of oil distributors and
      refineries, and the SOMAS company (underground butane storage company). The reforms
      also covered oil taxation and led to the establishment in 1995 o f the price indexation
      system o f oil products linking refinery gate prices and consumer prices to international
      prices. However the indexation system was suspended in September 2000, because o f the
      large consumer price increases it would have entailed.

      The development o f independent power producers (IPPs): By decree/law no. 2-94-503 of
      September 23, 1994, the National Office o f Electricity (ONE) was authorized to issue
      public tenders and to enter into agreements with private corporations for the production of

                                                 46

      electricity by power plants o f capacity o f over 10 MW, provided production i s solely used
      to meet the needs o f the National Office of Electricity (ONE).

Withinthis context, three contracts for the production o f electricity (with guaranteed purchase
bythe ONE) havebeensigned with the following companies:
           -  Jorf Lasfar Energy Company that signed a contract with the ONE on September 12,
              1997, for the operation o f the two existing production units [Iand 111at Jorf Lasfar
              and for the buildingand operation of two more units (Units I11and IV) at the same
              plant. The total power capacity o f these four units is 1,370 MW. The production of

           -  this power plantrepresented 55.4% o f demand at the end o f 2004.
              The company called Eolienne du Dktroit (Wind Power o f the Straits) that, within
              the context o f a contract with the ONE, signed on October 2, 1998, designed, built
              and operated the Abdelkhalek Torres wind power station, with a power capacity o f

           -  50 MW.
              Energie Electrique de Tahaddart, that is owned 48% by the ONE, 32% by
              ENDESA and 20% by SIEMENS. This company built and currently operates the
              Tahaddart combined-cycle power plant, which has 400 MW o f installed capacity
              andusesnatural gas. The plantwas placedinoperationon March 26,2005.

3-    Privatizing distribution: Starting in 1997, some municipalities have delegated the public
      service o f electricity distribution to private distributors. These include Lydec, RCdal and
      Amendis respectively inthe cities o f Casablanca, Rabat and Tangier Tktouan.
                                                                              -

4-    Electricity tariffs: Taking into account the price increase of the fuels used for power
      generation, the government has increased the tariff by 5 centskWh for electricity at Very
      High,Highand Mediumvoltage startingFebruary 1, 2006. A 7% increase for Low voltage
      electricity was implemented as o f July 1,2006.

5-    Acceleration o fthe Global Rural Electrification Program (PERG): in 1995, the country was
      20% electrified; by 2006, this percentage grew to 89% and the goal o f 100%electrification
      i s expected to be reached in2007.

6-    Efforts at using renewable resources for the production of electricity such as small hydro
      plants, solar energy,biomass, wind power, etc.

7-    Development o f inter-connections: for example, the interconnection o f the Maroccan
      transmission network to the Spanish grid though the Strait o f Gibraltar has been in
      operation since 1998.

Inspite ofthese accomplishments, Morocco now must address challenges related to the new oil
situation andto the energy crisis o frecent years, while staying within its budget and dealing with
an acceleration in energy demand, maintaining the competitiveness o f the economy and
preservingthe environment.


    Mid-termStrategy



                                                  47

To meet the current challenges, the government will focus on consolidating reforms that have
already been undertaken on one hand; and on the other, it will develop and establish a strategy
based on the following priorities:
    -    Strengthening energy security ina sustainable development framework;
    -    Developing the competitiveness o f the Moroccan economy and competition inthe energy
         sector.
    -    Monitoring and evaluating the energy policy.
Inorder to achieve these objectives, the Government will implementthe following actions:

A-       Strengthening energy security ina sustainable development framework

Mindhl of the importance of diversifying energy resources, continued service and clean
development, the government will perform the following:

1. conduct a strategic study on the supply o f energy inview o f ensuringthe long-term reliability
  of the energy supply, with the objective o f adopting an energy supply diversification strategy
  by2008. An inter-ministerial steering will be created to supervise this study.

2. create an ad-hoc committee to establish a strategic storage policy aimed at optimizing the
  level o f inventories and their financing, inorder to prevent oil supplydisruption.

3. reduce risks to the environment and public health due to energy consumption. In order to
  assure the supply o f Morocco in the best conditions and guarantee the safety and prevent
  industrial risks, a Convention for the modernizationo f refinery facilities o f Mohammedia was
  signed on December 20,2004 between the Government and the refinery company.

The project for upgrading the refining facilities by building a hydrocracking unit, a
  hydrodesulhrization unit and a sulfur recovery unit will make it possible to adapt these
  facilities to the structure o f the Moroccan market, to improve the quality o f the products,
  specifically to reduce sulfur content ingas-oil and to reduce toxic emissions.

  Thus, starting in January 2009, 10,000 ppm sulfur gas-oil     - o f which 3.7 million tondyear is
  currently consumed - will be phased out and replaced by 50 ppm sulfur gas-oil. Leaded gas,
  which with 240,000 tondyear represents 65% o f the gasoline market, will also be phased out.
  Only lead-free gasoline will be distributed starting inJanuary 2009. A decree dated August 10,
  2005 (Official Gazette 5348 o f September 1, 2005) states that the quality standards o f the
  aforementioned products will go into effect as of January 1, 2008. While an additional delay i s
  possible, the date planned for the entry into effect o f product quality standards i s January 1,
  2009. The introduction on the Moroccan market o f 50 ppm sulfur gas-oil will make it possible
  to reduce SO2 emissions by 80,000 tons beginning in 2009. Use o f lead-free gasoline
  throughout Morocco will reduce lead emissions by 150tondyear.

4. increase energy independence by developing Morocco's own energy resources. Due to its
heavy dependence on imported energy, Morocco has long focused its energy policy on the
diversification of supply andthe development o fnational resources, particularly bypromoting all
forms o frenewable energy (hydro, wind and solar power).


                                                 48

Over the past few years, the national and international environments have been favorable to the
development o frenewable energy resources.
At the national level, this environment is distinguishedby the willingness o f public and private
operators to work with renewable energy due to its potential for offsetting Morocco's external
energy dependence, its safety, and the diversification o f the national energy supply.
 The importance of our localpotential, the evolution intechnologies andthe strong growthinthe
 global market for renewable energy equipment - accompanied by a noteworthy and sustained
 decline in costs - are essential advantages for Morocco that will result in these new resources
 becoming a significant percentage o f national energy supply in the coming years. The objective
 i s for renewable energy to reach 10% o f primary energy requirements by 2012 versus its 3.9%
 now.
With regard to energy efficiency, the government has undertaken a series of actions within a
national energy efficiency plan.
This planis currently beingrevisedby a group o f operators andplayers inthe energy sector.
The various actions will be based on the most advanced technologies, such as solar-heated water,
wood energy and energy efficiency inthe sectors o f industry, health, housing, tourism, education
and social-type establishments and for the development o f local communities.


5. the law on energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE), currently pending approval,
sets energy policy guidelines for achieving targets set by the Government and announced during
the National Debate on Energy with regard to energy efficiency and the development o f
renewable sources o f energy, namely:

             - Large-scale development o f the use o f renewable energies and in particular grid-

             - connected wind power.
               The contribution to Moroccan energy independence through energy conservation
               on the order o f 1.7 million TOE by 2020, by adopting measures and actions
               pertaining:
                   -   to regulations that establish minimum performance standards in the
                       production, transport and uses o f energy;
                       to the mandatory energy labeling o f equipment and appliances;

                   --

             - Inview o f developing its institutional capacities, Morocco will adopt a plan to
               restructure institutions incharge o f the development o f renewable energy. Within
               this framework, the Center of Development o f Renewable Energies (CDER) will
               be restructured to establish an entity that promotes the use o f renewable energies
               and develop energy efficiency, while ONE will be incharge o f the development
               o f grid-connected wind power.

            -   In order to promote the development and use o f renewable energies and to
                increase energy efficiency, the government i s setting up mechanisms and
                incentives to promote renewable energy, energy efficiency and the development
                o f co-generation plants whose capacity and generation thresholds are set by
                regulation. These incentives and methods o f operation and licensing, the criteria
                for gaining access and the method o f management are established within the
                framework o fthe finance law.

        The law will be adopted by the Council o f Government in2007.

6. increase the ceiling for self-generation: Within the context o f the efforts made by the
Government to develop the use o f renewable energy, the electricity sector is being called upon to
encourage self-generation and guarantee third-party access to the national electricity grid under
favorable conditions to self-generators. However, the current rules and regulations - most notably
the decree for the creation o f the National Office o f Electricity (ONE) as supplemented and
amended - limits the threshold o f self-generation to 10 MW. To encourage self-generation and
meet the demand for electricity, the government has decided to increase the ceiling on self-
generation from 10to 50 MW.

The modification o f the law supplementing the ministerial purpose o f the ONE - that was
approved by the Council o f Government in January 2007      - will thus enable self-generators to
install power generating capacity o f 50 MW or less.

7. the development o f the institutional capacity to implement policies for energy management
andrenewable energy development

Tax incentives are also plannedto promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. To this end,
the 2007 finance law includes tax provisions aimed at reducing the VAT rate applied to solar-
powered water heaters from 20% to 14%. This measure i s also intended to stimulate the
diversification o f energy sources and the mobilization o f local resources to respond to our
country's demands for a safe supply.

Lastly, in 2007, the govemment will draft regulations and standards aimed at improving
environmental performance o frefineries and electric power plants.

B-     Developing competitiveness of the Moroccan economy and competition inthe energy sector

The Government will adopt regulation and develop institutions to promote competition in the
sector and to better manage costs. Withinthis framework, the following will be carried out:

1. the reorganization o f the electricity sector and the partial opening o f a competitive market,
through:
        -   The connection o f Morocco's electricity grid to that o f the European Union through
            Spain and to Algeria's grid. To this end, the inter-connectionwith Spain through the
            Strait o f Gibraltar, in operation since 1998, was reinforced by the establishment o f a
            second underwater connection completed in June 2006, increasing the capacity for
            cross-border exchanges from 700 MW to 1400 MW. With regard to the
            Morocco/Algeria connection, the establishment o f a third 400 KV line between
            Bourdim and Hassi Ameur in Algeria that i s currently being constructed will
            strengthen the existing 225 KV connection and make it possible not only to improve
            electricity exchanges betweenthe two countries, but also to establish a first milestone
            for the future Maghreb electricity market.

            Other measures will also be initiated, in particular the organization o f the electricity
            market in 2009 that will make it possible to specify the contractual relationships
            between the different regional players, the standardization in 2009 o f dispatch
            systems and SCADA and the preparation in 2009 o f rules for transmission tariffs and
            third-partyaccessto the gridfor the cross-border exchanges of electricity.

        -   The integration and the liberalization o f the Moroccan electricity market will ensure
            competitiveness o f industrial electricity prices which i s critical in an economy which
            i s open to competition from abroad, provide incentives for monopoly activities to
            operate efficiently and ensure that cost reductions are passed through to customers in
            the form o f price reductions, establish a sustainable financial equilibrium o f the sector
            andprovide incentives for private participation inthe sector.

Within this framework, a law for the liberalization and modernization of the electricity sector is
currently pending approval. This law i s based on the following principles:

        --  Guarantee the public service o f electricity and the security o f supply;
            Take an active part in the building o f the regional economy and in particular the
            electricity sector; take advantage o f the connections from Morocco to Europe and

        --- Northwest African countries;
            Draw lessons from countries that have already opened up their electrical sectors
            Adopt a gradual opening to competitionmaking it possible to control the transition;
            Respect commitments already made in production (contracts with purchase
        --  guarantees) andindistribution (delegated management);
            Initiate a restructuring o f the ONE based on its essential functions
            Extract value from cross-border connections.

Moreover, the government has now set up an inter-ministerial committee for the re-organization
o fthe electrical sector that includes representatives from the Ministryo f Energy and the Mines

                                                  51

(MEM),the Ministryofthe Interior, the MAEGandthe MinistryofFinance andPrivatization,
and any department or entity that the committeemight call upon.

3. Improve the efficiency o fthe oil sector and set up an open market by 2009. Consideringthe
risingoil prices on the internationalmarket, the impact ofthe oil sector has become increasingly
important, at the consumer level and at the level o f the State budget. The government i s
determined on one handto continue reforms that would make it possible to limit the portion o f
the budget allocated to subsidize liquid oil products (gas, gas-oil, kerosene) and on the other, to
take into account the impact that the price o fthese products has on the consumer. Within this
context, in2006, the government made several adjustments to consumer prices following price
fluctuation on the international market.

Inview of gradually reducingthe Compensation Fund's deficit, two price increases were applied
in2006: one inFebruaryand the other inSeptember. However, withthe reduction inoil prices as
recorded last September, the government reduced the prices o f oil products in October 2006.
Following the drop in prices that the international market experienced at the beginning o f
January 2007, the government reduced domestic prices o f liquidoil products for the second time.

Moreover, bound by commitments made to the SAMIR refinery within the context o f its
investment program that provides for maintaining the price structure in effect until the end o f
2008; the government downwardly adjusted the reimbursement rates by the compensation fund
in September 2006, for oil transporting costs between Mohammedia and Sidi Kacem and with
regard to the SAMIR refinery and distributors. The total earnings generated for the State budget
were MAD 150millionper year.

The Government has agreed to continue its price-settingpolicy for consumers, that was set up in
September 2006. Every two weeks, the government will examine the change in international
prices o f the various products. This variation will then be reflected in prices to Moroccan
consumers.

However, the government intends to reserve the right to temporarily suspend the automatic
application o f the bi-weekly adjustment if it so deems necessary in view o f important
fluctuations inoil prices for reasons related to the social context.

The objective o f the government remains to assure that liquid oil products other than gas-oil are
not permanently subsidized and that consumers receive the proper signals with regard to the
price of these products through periodical adjustments in response to changes in international
prices.

Among the measures taken to improve the efficiency o f the oil sector, in October 2006, the
government instituted access o f third parties to storage infrastructures for butane gas (obligation
for centers to supply themselves from the closest receiving and storage terminals) which will
make it possible to save MAD25 million per year with regardto bulkbutane transport costs.

Moreover, in 2007, the government will conduct a study intended to examine international
experiences with regard to associated measures for low-income butane gas consumers, inview o f
a future reform o fthe price o fbutane gas.



                                                  52

Inorder to increase the use of natural gas, particularly in industry, studies are currently being
conducted in partnership with public and private operators for the establishment o f the best
possible gas infrastructure. These studies include the evaluation o f the potential market, the
optimization o f supply routes (pipeline, LNG, etc.), the technical/economic feasibility study and
sizing o f the various infrastructures, the choice o f LNGreceivingports, etc.

Considering construction requirements, such a gas infrastructure could only be capable o f
meeting domestic demand in 2012. By this time, the needs o f natural gas o f the main operators
would thenbe around 3.75 billion m3,almost 20% o fthe total national need.

Moreover, the development o f the gas sector will be established by creating a regulatory
framework for the gas market open to competition and the drafting o f a Gas Code.

A draft gas code, aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for competition, has been
prepared. This draft code has focused on defining the main principles o f the gas market, the right
o f use for future infrastructures, access o f third parties to the infrastructures, the essentially
private method o f financing, etc.). The approval o f this law i s plannedfor 2008.

C- Continually monitoringand evaluatingthe energy policy

Inview o fproviding more visibility to the energy sector inMorocco, priority has been given to
increased observation and strategic monitoring in order to manage efficiently the sector. The
purpose o f this increased monitoring consists of:
    --  Bringingstatistics ofthe Moroccan energy sector inlinewith international standards,
        Better targeting actions o f Moroccan energy policy all while situating sector-wide

    -   reforms within their strategic framework,
        Strengthening energy forecasting capability inthe medium- and long-term.

To this end, the Office for Observation and Programming (DOP) a newly created entity
(February 2005) at the time o f the re-organization o f the Ministry o f Energy and Mines,
contributes to the preparation and implementation o f the national energy policy, the institutional
development o fthe sector, and the forecasting, planning and evaluation o fprojects.

Accordingly, priority has also been given to strengthening the powers o f the DOP to establish a
system o f observation and strategic monitoring o f the energy sector.

Within this framework, the DOP has set up a multi-year program of surveys involving sector-
wide energy consumption, and i s conducting a study on the future o f energy demand from now
until 2030 and is intending to set up an entity responsible for the strategic monitoring o f the
energy sector.

To this end, the following actions will be conducted bythe Ministryo fEnergy and Mines:

    -  Reinforcing the energy information system by preparing a circular making access to
        energy-related information mandatory; conducting a survey on energy consumption inthe
       industrial and transport sectors and conducting a survey on residential and commercial
       energy consumption(the survey for the agriculture sector i s scheduled for 2010).



                                                   53

    -   Reinforcing capacities for energy forecasting, by developing a model of the energy
        supply and demand, implementing forecasting and scheduling tools and developing a
        systematic model for preparation o f the detailed energy balance by sector, source and use.

    -   Establishinga system for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the energy
        policy by establishing monitoring and evaluating indicators o f the implementation o f the
        energy policy, by establishing a strategic monitoring unit for the energy sector and by
        establishing benchmarks related for the energy sector in the regional and international
        context.


111-Methodsfor monitoringandimplementation


Inadditionto the monitoringlevaluationofthe program that will be conducted by the Office of
Observation and Programming o f the Ministry o f Energy and Mines, the steering committee set
up with the MAEGwill provide a periodical status report on the progress andimplementation of
reforms and will prepare annual reports for this purpose.

Aware o f the need to obtain support with regardto the objectives, content and implementation o f
the reform, the government has prepared a communication strategy that defines the messages and
the target audiences. The debates on energy held in2006 were the first phase inthis direction.

Sufficient resources will be placed at the disposal o f the Ministryof Energy and Mines (MEM)
for the annual execution o f the communication plan.

Considering the breadth o f this reform program that i s part o f the efforts already undertaken, the
government i s counting on the support of your institution for a programmatic development
policy loan.

We would like to thank you for the interest the Bank has shown in the development o f this
sector, and hope that you will accept our best regards.

                       ANNEX 3: PROGRAM'S IMPACTS ASSESSMENT

1. ECONOMIC IMPACTS

1.1. Impactsof changes infuel prices

1.       Impact of fuel price increases on petroleum product demand. The Government has raised fuel
prices (apart from butane) on several occasions recently, ranging from 2% to 7% over the February-
September 2006 period. Such increaseshave an impact on petroleumproduct demand. Intun, the main
economic impacts will be felt as demand for fuels changes, following a growth intheir prices, as well as
from the inflationary pressure that fuel prices increases may exert on the rest of the economy through
inputpricegrowth.

2.       Little reduction in petroleum product demand i s to be expected from the 2006 price changes in
the immediate future. For the longer run, it i s estimated that long-run price elasticity equals -0.15 (this
figure i s commonly used, based on earlier studies made in OECD countries using 1971-1997 data).
Overall, price changes equaled approximately 10% in2006. Long-run income elasticity i s unknown and
assumed to remain constant. As a result, net growth of petroleum products demand from income i s
assumedunchangedat 8%. Applyingthe above elasticity, petroleumproduct demand i s estimated to grow
at around 7.85% over the next two years, as demand growth will be slightly reduced following price
increases (net reduction from the price increase will be 1.5%). Inthe absence of price changes, demand
would have grown by 8% pea.over the next two years. The net impact on petroleumproduct demand of
current price changes i s therefore small (-0.15%).

3.       Impacts of fuel price increases on inflation. Impacts on overall inflation of fuel price changes
have been evaluated using a Leontieff framework. Usingthe input-output table of Morocco 2003 (Haut
Commissariat au Plan), a linear model of price formation has been built, integratingthe 20 sectors of the
table. The modelhas beencalibrated using2003 data on inputs, wages and capital, taxes and subsidies on
products, margins and external trade taxes. The average impact on general price level of the petroleum
price increasessince February 2006 is 1.4%, rangingfrom 0.14% to 2.4%.

4.       Impacts of fuel price increases on welfare. Measures of the impacts of fuel price increases on
welfare were based on the household expenditure survey carried out in 2000-1, which covered 15,000
households and provides information about expenditures for 400 items, including seven energy products
(butane, gasoline and diesel, electricity, other liquidfuel, charcoal, fuel wood)

5.       Energy expenditures represent between DH 1,750 (lowest quintile Q1) and DH 5,010 (Q5) of
household expenditures. There i s a linkage between income and energy consumption, although the share
of energy inhousehold expenditures remains relatively stable rangingfrom 8.8% for the lowest quintile to
6.3% for the richest. Rural households tend to spend more on energy as a percentage of their total
expenditures than their urban counterparts. Expenditures related to transport range from DH 898 per
annumto DH2,578 for the richest households on average.

6.       Urban households spend more on transport than rural ones in absolute terms. Since urban
incomes are however much larger than rural ones, the transport share of total household expenditure i s
less for urban households (3.5% for the lowest quintile to 3.0% for the richest) than for rural households
(4.3% for the lowest income group, against 3.4% for the richest). For the lowest income groups, both
energy and transport expenditures represent close to 13% of their income. It i s difficult to conclude from
the data whether this high figure i s due either to high energy (and transport) consumption, large
household size, low efficiency of energy use or a combination of factors, including high energy prices.
Giventhis level however, fuel prices increasescall for measuresto enable social protection of the lowest
income groups. Indirectly, the growth in transport prices following fuel price increases i s also going to
affect the lowest quintiles as well as the urban middle-income groups. Although for transport
expenditures,the highincome elasticity of demand also meansthat fuel price changes will be strongly felt


                                                      60

byhigher income groups, who could inturn impact the overall householddemandfor transport fuels (the
long nuincome elasticity assumption of 1used above may need to be revised, yielding a higher impact
ondemand than estimated.

7.      Impacts of fuel price formula revision. As a transition measure to full price liberalization in
2009, the reform is going to propose a revision of price formulas to reduce the undue rents that may exist
inthe current set up.These revisions are likely to generate two effects (i) end-users fuel prices or
                                                                                    reduce
mitigate the increaseo fprice and (ii)     reduce the amount o f subsidies(for products yet to be indexed).

8.      Revisions of the components of the price formula for liquid fuels could generate savings in the
order of $200 million per annum. This i s equivalent to 20% of the subsidies to fuel prices in2006.

1.2. Impacts of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy production

9.      Real benefits may come from foreign currency savings from lower oil, coal and gas imports
resulting from energy efficiency measures and renewable energy development. To obtain an order of
magnitude, those benefits have been quantified and compared to the costs associated to the
implementationof reforms. Two projections of Morocco's energy balance with andwithout reforms were
derived.

10.     The reference scenario is basedupon a final electricity consumption growing at the annual rate of
7.5% in 2006-2010 and 7.0% in 2011-2015. Primary energy demand for electricity production was
calculated using ONE'S investment program. Primary energy demand in other sectors was estimated
based upon historical trends. In the reference scenario, the annual average total final energy demand
growth rate i s 4.5% per annum over 2006-2015. The reform scenario translates investments in energy
efficiency carried out over 2008-2014 into a slower energy demand growth rates at 4.1% p.a. on average,
and achieving on average 1.O mtoe savings of total final energy demand. Projections of renewable energy
assume an additional 1,000 MW of wind electricity production capacity spreadover 2008-2011, including
the EssaouiraandTangier projects.

11,     Detailed and realistic projections of the potentials for energy savings from investments inenergy
efficiency measures have been made using the results o f past energy efficiency efforts in Morocco and
several studies that assessed this potential.** Those past experiences have showed that in Morocco, a
potential of 15% reduction in heat use and 7% in electricity use across sectors is feasible. A realization
ratio of 70% and a return on investment of 2.3 years is assumed here. Net wind electricity capital
investments (wind capital investments minus displaced conventional energy investments taking into
account the lower availability of wind electricity over conventional electricity generation) are assumedto
be $800 per kW installed, plus $20 per kW installedof operation and maintenance.

Source: World Bank (assumptions: oil price is $60 per barrel over the period, discount rate is 10%)

12.     Expenditures for EE measures and wind electricity capacity (net of conventional energy capital
expenditures that wind replaces) are expected to total US$1 billion over 2008-15 (US$0.4 billion for EE


28E.g.: GEM project funded by USAID, IZDIHAR project funded by GEF). See in particular
  GEFAJNDP/CDEWItalian Ministryo f Environment and Territory, Dossier d'kvaluation des ktudes techniques et
  des projets pilotes d'knergie renouvelable et d'efficacitk energetique, EESD, Alexandna / Rabat, Sept. 2005.

measures and US$0.6 billion for wind electricity generation capacity). Benefits in terms o f savings o f
petroleum and coal imports are estimated to reach 0.2 mtoe in 2009 and gradually grow to 1.7 mtoe in
2015, achieving on average 0.7 mtoe per annum over 2008-15. Assuming prices o f US$60 per barrel for
oil, US$75 per ton for coal, and a 10 percent discount rate, the total fuel import savings over the period
2008-15 translates into US$1.1 billion. Other benefits may accrue from reforms, such as the local and
global benefits o f avoided polluting emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and greater energy security
from diversificationo f electricity supply. The latter have not beenquantified.

1.3. Impacts of electricity liberalization

13.        The liberalization should be assessed against three possible positive impacts that they are
expected to yield: better service quality for electricity consumers, improvement in government's fiscal
position and more affordable electricity for the poor. The main elements o f reform restructuring (markets
liberalization, regulation, and the roles o f public and private participants) are expected to generate
positive impacts.

14.        Few studies have quantifiedthe impacts o f power reforms, but one econometric assessmentusing
panel data for 51 countries over 1985-2000 has concluded that introducing competition i s effective in
improving performance, irrespective o f changes in ownership or regulation, since competition appears to
bring about favorable results for service penetration, capacity expansion, labor efficiency, and prices to
industrialusers29.The same study also concluded that the coexistence o f privatization and an autonomous
regulator reforms together i s correlated with greater electricity availability, more generation capacity, and
higher labor productivity; and an effective regulatory framework should be emphasized when privatizing
electricity supply under monopolistic conditions.

15.        International experience shows that among developing countries, gains in efficiency have been
achieved successfully so far in a few South American countries. Efficiency gains however have not
systematically been shared equitably between power suppliers and consumers, or among consumers.
Often, generators initially kept a high proportion o f their productivity gains, and were obliged to pass
some o f these gains to purchasers o f their output only in competitive wholesale power markets.
Distributors were obliged to pass some o f these gains to consumers only under regulatory price reviews.
Likewise, gains in terms o f real electricity prices have been positive generally for industrial and
commercial consumers, but seldom for residential consumers who often benefited from subsidies before
the reform and saw their price levels increase after the reforms were implemented.

16.          InMorocco, reforms will likely improve the incumbent electricity utility's performances. The
likelihood o f these positive impacts i s high but they may not be extremely large since the incumbent
already achieves some good performance levels. For example, labor productivity o f ONE measured by
number o f electricity subscribers per staff was 292 in 2004, which compares favorably with numbers
observed in utilities in the developing world (ranging from 40 in very poor countries to 300 in middle
income countries). Yet, competition i s likely to put pressure on salaries and reduce labor costs, as well as
increase operating efficiencies (procurement costs, maintenance, etc.).

2. SOCIAL AND POVERTYASPECTS OF HOUSEHOLDSENERGY CONSUMPTION

2.1. Patterns ofEnergyCons~rnption~~

households use a combination of several different energy sources to meet their needs. There are
significant differences between rural and urban households inthe way they use different energy sources.
Electricity and diesellgasoline are for
instance primarily used by urban                        120.0%
inhabitants,       whereas       wood        and
kerosene are primarily used by rural                    100.0%

households. The chart on this page                       80.0%

 18.      Patterns            of           LPG
Consumution: Nearly all households
in Morocco (99%), in both rural and
urban areas, use LPG. LPG i s used
primarily for cooking but, in rural
areas where there is noelectricity, it i s also used for lighting.In1999, 40 percent of rural householdsused
LPG for lighting.31This figure has certainly declined with the Government's expanded efforts at rural
electrification. But no current figures on the use of LPG for lightingare available. Some urbanhouseholds
also use LPG for heating water. In a marketing survey of LPG users, 43 percent of the respondents
reported using LPG for heating water.32 Although LPG use i s widespread, households tend to use it in
combinationwith other fuels (wood, charcoal, elecricity etc.). Using other sources enableshouseholds to
express their cultural preferences (e.g. for baking bread in a wood oven), and reduce cash needs by
collecting wood themselves.

 19.      The higher the income level inboth urban and rural areas, the greater the expenditure rates on
LPG. As illustrated in Chart 3, per capita, the richest urban quintile consumes more than one and a half
times the LPG of the lowest quintile (approximately DH 1,467 compared to DH 900). The contrast is
even greater between rural poor and rich: the top rural quintile spends almost three times that o f the
lowest quintile. This top rural quintile also spends almost twice as much as its urban counter parts (2,200
DHfor the 5* quintile of rural inhabitants versus 1,400 DHfor urbanites). This findingmaybe dueto the
higher price that rural consumers often pay for LPG because o f poor road infrastructure resulting in
higher transportation costs, as well as the less competitive market inrural areas.

20.       Inprinciple, a 12kilogrambottle of LPGshould sell for 40 DHandthe 10kilogrambottle should
sell for 30 Dh. However, the actual price consumers pay varies according to locality, and in some rural
areas, a 12 kilogrambottle can cost as much as 60 dh. Rural consumers prefer the relatively lower priced
3 kilogram bottles (selling at approximately 20 dh), whereas urban households prefer the 12 kilogram
bottles. Ninety six percent of rural compared to 83 percent of urbanhouseholds use 3 kilogrambottles; 95
percent of urban and 83 percent of rural households use the 12 kilogram bottles.33The differences in
preference for bottle type are due to the differentuses of LPG- 3 kilogrambottles are generally used for
lighting-but also becausethe lower cost makesit more affordable for cashstrappedruralpopulation.

21.       While the absolute amounts spent on LPG by the poor are less than those spent by the better off,
these constitute a higher portion of their household budgets. This trend i s especially marked in urban
areas, no doubt a reflection of higher urban incomes. For instance, the lowest urban quintile spends 3.7
percent of their household income on LPG, whereas the top quintile spends only 1.7 percent. Inrural
areas, however, the budgetary shares of LPG expenditures are relatively flat at around 4 percent,
indicating anear-zero income elasticity of demand for LPG.

22.       Patterns of Diesel and Gasoline Consumption: Diesel and petrol are consumed by the wealthiest
urban households. Only 13 percent o f Moroccanhouseholds consume diesel or petrol. These products are
almost exclusively used for motor vehicles, and are purchased predominantly by the top urban quintile.
The analysis shows that the top urban quintile consumes nearly 40 times that o f the poorest quintile
(about 1800 DHversus 50 Dh).Inrural areas, gasoline and diesel consumption are lower for all income
quintiles compared to their urban counterparts. It i s also observed that the share of household budget
spent on gasoline and diesel increases with income.               However, even the top quintile, the largest
consumers, spends only 1.4 percent of their incomes on these products.

23.       The government has phased out kerosene because of the ease with which it can be converted to
diesel, a higher cost product. Furthermore, as electrification expands, demand for kerosene and LPG for
lighting will decline. Even for rural households, keroseneranks 5* interms of energy consumption. This
suggests that phasing out kerosenedidnot have a significant adverse effect onthe poor.

24.       Patterns of Wood Consumption: Wood fuel continues to be an important source of household
energy inMorocco, especially inrural areas. Wood i s primarilyused for cooking, especially bakingbread
and heating inthe winter. The national consumption data on wood are derived from the household budget
survey and therefore only include wood which i s purchased. Sociological research indicates that wood
collection for home consumption continues to be significant. The Centre de Dkveloppement des Energies
Renouvelables (CDER) i s currently finalizing a study o f wood collection covering 3 geographic zones of
the country. Preliminary results indicate that wood inrural areas i s collected by women, over a 4 to 6 hour
period, 2 or 3 times a week. Consumption also varies considerably by geographic region, rangingfrom 40
kilograms per day per household in the Atlas Mountains to 8 kilograms per household in Taoudant, an
arid province in the west. In these arid areas, households commonly collect agricultural residue for
cooking.34

25.       The Poverty Survey on which this assessment is based indicates that nearly 42 percent of rural
households and 3 percent of urbanhouseholds purchase wood. Inrural areas, wood constitutes the second
largest budgetary expenditure for energy, after LPG. Expenditure on fuel wood by rural households
analyzed by quintile shows an inverted `V' shape, with the richest and the poorest quintiles purchasing
less than the middle. At the lower end, this i s no doubt due to lack of disposable income, while inthe top
quintile, higher consumption of LPG, as discussed in the earlier section, is the likely explanation. As
would be anticipated, consumption of wood as a percentage of household expenditure also decreases with
income quintile.

26.       Patterns of Charcoal Consumption: Charcoal i s not an important source o f household energy.
About 12 percent of all Moroccan households use charcoal. The main uses are for barbequing and
smoking shisha (water pipe), which are more often practiced inhigher income households. The rural rich
are the biggest spenders on charcoal, at over 100 DH annually compared to 80 DH by their urban
counterparts. The share of the household budget spent on charcoal i s slightlyhigher for rural households,
reflectingtheir lower incomes. Nevertheless, charcoal represents a negligible percentageof the household
budget for all groups (about . I O percent for urbanhouseholdsand .20percent ofrural households).

2.2. Subsidies on LPGand Diesel

27.       The Government of Morocco provides subsidies on both LPG and diesel through a system of
official prices and refinds to petroleum companies to recover the wholesale price. The prices for both
products are fixed by the government, at 3.3 DH per kilogram for LPG and 7.5 DH per kilogram for
diesel. The subsidy i s equal to the difference between what would be the consumer price if it was the
result of market forces and the government imposed price. The market prices fluctuate inline with prices
on the international market.

28.      LPG Subsidies. Subsidies on LPG are regressive - the higher the income group, the higher the
net benefit. At a national level, the top quintile gains more than a third of the government subsidy and the
poorest quintilereceives less than 10 percent. Among rural households, the top quintile receives nearly 40
percent of the subsidies whereas the bottom quintilereceives 8.7 percent. Inurbanareas, the top quintile
receives a third of the subsidies and the bottom quintile receives a tentho f the subsidies. We do not have
sufficient data to predict how households may behave if subsidies were removed. However, the survey
conducted by LMS-CSA provides some indication as reported by consumers. Two-thirds of the
respondents said they would not change their behavior if the price on the 12 kilogram LPG bottle
increased from 40 to 50 Dh. Twenty nine percent stated that they would change their consumption
behavior: 65 percent of those inrural areas said they would use wood and 48 percent of urban residents
said they would use charcoal since wood collection i s not a viable option.35The overwhelming majority
of the public (89 percent) i s unaware that LPG i s being subsidized and as there has not been a price
increase inmore than a decade, 86 percent could not remember the last time this occurred.

29.      Diesel Subsidies. Diesel subsidies primarily benefit the wealthiest households. Nearly three
quarters of the subsidies are captured by the top quintile and the lowest quintilereceive less than 1percent
of the subsidy. The market price for diesel i s around 8.5 DH per liter and the price paid by consumers
(including the subsidy) is 7.5 DHper liter.

30.      Poorer households may benefit to some degree indirectly from dieseypetrol subsidies inthe form
of reduced prices for public transportation. However, the data shows that transport costs, especially
bus/taxi/coach services likely to be used by lower quintile groups, account for less than 1 percent of the
household budget expenditures across all income groups and urbadrural localities. Insummary, gains by
the poor from the diesel andpetrol subsidies are likely to be negligible.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

31.      According to a 2003 World Bank                      air pollution inMorocco i s estimated to generate health
costs worth around 3.6 billion DHper year (about 1% of Morocco's GDP in2000), of which 2.1 billion
relatedto outdoor air pollution, and 1.5 billionto indoor air pollution.

32.      The incidence on the poor of these impacts is likely to be significant, on account of the presence
of significant pockets of poverty inlarge urban areas exposedto highconcentrations of pollution, and of
the more limited access of the poor to the health care required to treat respiratory diseases and other
ailments generatedby air pollution. The potential for improving environmental quality through reforms in
the energy sector i s quite significant, considering that power plants and refineries account for about 60%
of total SO2 emissions, 40% of NO, emissions, and about 65% of Particulate Matters emissions.

3.1. The Reference Scenario

33.      To evaluate the reduction in polluting air emissions resulting from the implementation of DPL-
supported reform, a first step i s the establishment of a reference baseline scenario, representing the likely
evolution of energy use inthe absence of DPL-supportedreform. Based on an analysis of recent trends of
energy demand growth by type o f fuel, and taking into account ONE'S plans for capacity expansion
(about 3,000 MW over the period 2007-2015), fuel-specific and electricity growth rates were assumed,
varying between 3% and 7.5% over the two sub-periods 2006-2010 and 2011-2015. When applied to
official energy balance data available for 2005, these generated year-by-year projections of energy
consumption, for the years 2010 and2015.

3.2. The Reform Scenario
34.       A second step is the development of a reform scenario, in which the consumption of energy is
evaluated (by year, fuel type and sector) taking into account the effects o f the following DPL-supported
reform:

35.       Renewable enerm: under the DPL, the government will set a medium-term objective of
developing 1,000 MW of additional wind power by 2012. It i s assumed that this additional capacity will
be phased in200 MW tranches, startinginthe year 2008; and that the additional power provided by the
wind installations will displace an equivalent amount of power generatedby coal andheavy fuel plants in
Jerada and Kenitra.

36.       Enerm efficiencv: the DPL envisages that through the development of a suitable institutional,
legislative and financial framework, savings of 0.7 millionTOE per year will be generated, startinginthe
year 2012. While the detailed plan(including priority sectors of intervention) for achieving such objective
will be developed duringDPL implementation, for the purposes of the presentevaluation, an analysis has
been undertaken of the typology of interventions (by fuel and target sector) which present the highest
potentialfor energy efficiency interventions.

37.       Based on experience accumulated inMorocco inthe last decade (GEF project, DSM analysis in
the public and private sector3'), the priority fuel and sector of interventions and the related estimates of
savings potentialwere estimated.

38.       Overall, the potential energy savings would come 50% from electricity, 28% from petroleum
products, and 22% from coal. Interms of sectors affected, the breakdown would be 60% industry, 26%
households, and 14% service sector. The achievement of the energy efficiency objective would require a
volume of investment in the range of DH 710 million per year for the period 2008-2015. To ensure
adequate mobilization of private resources in the face of market and technology uncertainty, it i s
estimated that an amount of public support of approximately DH200 million per year would be required
during the same period. The value of the energy savings that can be achieved would be about DH7.2
billion over the period 2008-2015, which i s about 2.3 times the value of the investments required for their
generation. Besides the above mentioned, savings a reduction of the peak power demand of 260 MW can
be achieved starting 2012. This will delay the investment in an equivalent power generation capacity,
estimated at 260 millions dollars.

39.       Phase out of leaded gasoline: On account of the highly damaging effects of lead emissions on
humanhealth and on neurological development of children (now widely recognized inmost countries),
the government i s committing to a complete phase-out of leaded gasoline during the implementation
period of the DPL. To evaluate the reduction in emissions of both lead and SO2, the following
assumptions have been used: (i)            baseline rate of growth of unleaded gasoline of 5% per year; (ii)                      phase
out of "normal" gasoline inthe year 2007; (iii)                  complete phase-out of leaded gasoline starting inthe year
2008; and (iv) concentration of 80% of the legal limit of lead and sulfur in the gasoline produced by
SAMIR.

40.       Phase out of high-sulfurdiesel: Current Moroccannormestablish that the sulfur content of diesel
should not exceed 10,000 ppm. As result of technological evolution inthe market of diesel vehicles, the
demand for "cleaner" diesel (350 ppm) has been rapidly increasing inrecent years. To further reduce the
environmental impacts of diesel use, the government is planning to bring the maximum sulfur content to
50 ppm, thereby aligning Morocco's regulation with the EU norms.                                   S A M I R i s planning to start
operations of the required enhanced refining facilities in 2008. The assumptions used to evaluate the
emissions reductions due to the phase out of 10,000 ppmdiesel are as follows: (i)                           baseline growth rate of
diesel 350 ppmof 15% per year and (ii)               adoption of diesel 50 ppmby the year 2009.

Estimating emission reductions inphysical and monetary terms

41.     The third step i s the application of air emission coefficients to the energy use estimated in the
reference and reform scenario. The final step i s the calculation, by difference, of the air emissions
avoided throughthe implementationof the DPL supported reforms. Estimated reductions inair emissions
((total K-tons over 2009-2015) are summarized, by reformand by air pollutant, below.

42.     A conservative lower boundestimate of the monetary value of SOz, NO, and P M reductions, can
bederivedby adapting the figures ofthe unitdamage of air pollution estimated for the EuropeanUnionin
the context of the CAFE program38,and taking into account the difference in GDP per capita (in PPP
terms) between the EUand Morocco. By applying these unit damage figures to the estimated volume of
emissions reduced, one obtains a range of reform benefits from 0.3% to 1.7% of Morocco's GDP inthe
year 2000 (depending on the reform year considered, and on the valuation method used). The actual
avoided damage (and hence the reforms' benefits) might be quite larger if one accounts separately for
health effects in large urban areas (where P M concentrations are higher), as opposed to using averages
across rural and urbanareas.

46.         A total of DH 10.5 billion was transferred over 1999-2005, becoming significant by 2005 at 1%
of GDP. Budget transfers have not covered Compensation Fund deficits entirely, leaving cumulated
payment arrears as of end 2005 at 1.1% o f GDP. In2006, assuming an average oil price of USD 66 per
barrel and barring the impact of domestic price indexation occurring February 2006, the budget would
have to transfer more than 3.5 % of GDP to cover boththe 2006 deficit andthe remainingarrears. By the
end June 2006, the budget had already transferred 1.2 % of GDP (MAD 6 billion) for that purpose. T he
increasing burden on the budget of petroleum subsidies and payment arrears urged the government to
raise domestic prices on September 2006 for the fifthtime since 2004. It i s estimated that almost DH0.75
billion will be saved due to the latter rise reducing arrears payment by 0.2% point of GDP making total
subsidies due by end 2006 decline to 3.3% of GDP.

47.         Net effect on thefiscal balance. The drop of revenues as a percent of GDP to a lower threshold
since 2001 combined with the concomitant rise in budgetary transfers to support Compensation Fund
deficits have translated into declining net revenues levied on petroleum products. The energy budget
surplus (on a cashbasis) has halvedin5 years, from 3.7% ofGDP in 1999-2000 tojust 1.6% in2005. At

39 Itis worth notingthat from 1986to 1994the CF was runninghighsurplusesthat were transferredto the budget. The total amountreached DH
   9.8 billion. or 1.9% of2006 GDP.


                                                                68

these trends, reflecting high oil prices and the partial indexation of domestic prices implemented in
February and September 2006, the budget surplus is expected to drop to a mere 0.7% of GDP in 2006
assuming no more fund will be allotted beyond those provisioned by the budget law (BL) 2006. This
outcome will generate cumulated arrears of about 1.3% of GDP. Unless a decision reactivating the
indexation systemis taken, this trend will translate into deficits thereafter.

Policy measuresand theirfiscal impacts

48.     Price. The suspension of the indexation system in late 1999 has translated into a disconnect
between domestic and external prices of petroleumproducts. As a result, increasing world oil prices have
put growing pressures on the budget, urgingthe government to review the indexation formulae in2002,
along with significant price increases that helped balance the CF that year. However, this has been
insufficient. The subsequent boom in world prices has led to further price gaps. Five partial price
adjustments have since taken place to reduce them: one in2004, two in2005 and the last two inFebruary
and September 2006.

49.      Cumulated domestic price increasessince 1995 do not matchthose of world crude oil which grew
by more than 280% over the same period. As a consequence, based on an average world oil price of
USD66hbl in2006, the current diesel domestic price represents 89.5% of its equilibrium level, while
that of LPG represents less than 40%. LPG has a price freeze over more than 20 years. To reach their
respective equilibrium levels, the price of diesel needs to increase DH 0.94 per liter (a 12% rise over its
current price) and LPGDH61.5 for a 12Kgcontainer (a 154% increase).

50.     Fullprice indexation over all products in 2007, except diesel high sulfur (HS) and LPG. Not
counting diesel and LPG, all other liquidproducts -gasoline, kerosene, heavy fuel, andjet fuel- represent
36% of total consumption, but their subsidies representedjust DH0.5 billion in2005, reflecting the two
domestic price increases occurred last year that permitted to set domestic prices for gasoline above its
2005 equilibrium price while reducing the price gaps for the other petroleum products. With the two
increases taking place in 2006, the full price indexation has been achieved. The corresponding fiscal
savings i s estimated at DH 1.5 billionper year, or 0.3% of 2006 GDP.

51.     Diesel price increase of DH 0.5 a Liter (already implemented in September 2006) and the
eventualfull liberalization by 2009. In 2005, about 3.5 million tons of diesel were consumed. This
volume represents 45% of total consumption of petroleum products by Morocco. Diesel has three uses:
(a) passenger and merchandise transportation vehicles, (b) maritime and fishing ships, and (c) personal
cars. The multiplicity of users makes it very sensitive to any policy measure that might result into higher
prices. As a matter of fact, diesel i s the second most highly subsidized petroleumproduct after the LPG.
In2005, diesel subsidies amounted to DH3.2 billion equivalent to 40% of total subsidies on petroleum
products. Estimates for 2006 show subsidies for diesel will further rise to a total DH 5.7 billion despite
the partialprice adjustment of February2006.

52.     The energy DPL contemplates a two-step price liberalization for diesel. A first step ledto a price
increase of DH 0.56 per liter starting September 2, 2006. Total liberalization would follow in 2009,
representing an additional price increaseof almost DH0.6 per liter. Estimated savings from the first step
would amount to DH 0.6 billion in2006 and 1.8 billion per year thereafter (0.35% of 2006 GDP); while
estimated savings from the secondstep would amount to DH2.8 billionper year (0.8 % of 2006 GDP).

                           ANNEX 4: MOROCCO'S ENERGY SECTOR


Morocco's Energy Sector Context

With a domestic energy production amountingto only 6% of its total energy primary supply, Morocco is
almost fully dependent on energy imports for its needs. To improve its security of supply and expand its
energy supply, Morocco has carried out successful efforts to diversify its energy mix with the weight of
oil and oil products now reduced to 63% of the total supply, from 75% in 1993 (Figure below). The
development of coal use for electricity production has had a major role inthis diversification. Next inline
i s natural gas, which i s currently representing 3.5% of the primary fuel mix but i s expected to play a
larger role in the coming decade, with plans to enlarge Morocco's natural gas market. Morocco also
imports electricity from Spain since 1998.

Over 1990-2003, Morocco's GDP grew on average by 2.9% per annum in constant dollars (2000). Total
primary energy supply reached 10,891 mtoe in2003, and grew on average faster than GDP, at 3.8% over
the same period, to respond to final consumption of energy which itself grew at 5.1% per annum, led by
residential sector and agriculture (see table below).

Given its highly limited domestic energy resources and need for increased competitiveness of the
economy, Morocco has to maintain the highest possible standards of energy efficiency for its economy.
Energy supply per capita has grown faster than GDP, following a natural process of catching up,
structural changes of GDP and new uses of energy that drive energy final consumption (see figure below).
Morocco's energy per capita is still low compared to the world average (0.4 tons of oil equivalent per
capita versus 1.7 for the world in 2003). All countries go through a phase during which the energy
intensity of their GDP grows before declining. Morocco i s now in a phase where energy intensity
(measured as TPES intons of oil equivalent per unit of GDP inthousand $) has grown regularly and is
now starting a decline at 0.21 (a level above Asia -excluding China -and LatinAmerica averages).

Morocco's Energy Policy Goals

The Ministryof Energy and Mines (MEM) plays a central role inthe implementationand coordinationof
the energy policy. Its role was strengthenedand clarified by a government decree of February 2005 (No.
2-04-504). The Ministry supervises all energy activities related to electricity production (including
renewable energy, excluding hydroelectricity), oil products production and distribution, and energy
demand. Energy policy formulatedby the Ministryof Energyand Mines has five goals:
        To guaranteeexternal energy supply (diversification, energy supply infrastructure).
    0   To facilitate low cost energy supply (gradual price liberalization and the development o f
        competitioninenergy markets bothfor petroleumproducts and electricity).
    0   To promote energy access (rural electrification and subsidiesto LPG).
    0   To secure clean and safe energy supply (wind and natural gas for electricity production).
    0   To promote energy efficiency.

Electricity

Electricity Supply and Demand

The installed domestic power generating capacity is 5.2GW, of which 3.5 GW thermal and 1.2 GW
hydroelectric. The National Office of Electricity (ONE), a state-owned public establishment with
industrial and commercial character (EPIC), has a capacity of approximately 3 500 MW, of which 26
hydro power stations (1,265 MW) and 1pumping storage (464MW), the rest being thermal. The current
transit capacity of the interconnection betweenMorocco and Spainhas been doubled in2006, from 700 to
1,400 MW

The production and distribution of electricity are carried out by ONE for about 25% and 45%
respectively, and private operators paly a major role both in production and distribution. Private
production includes coal-fueled Jorf Lasfar power plant (1,356 MW, the Al Baida wind farm (50 MW)
and the Tahaddart combined cycle gas fueled plant, operated by ONE (48 %), Endesa (32 %) and
Siemens (20 %). The two first units of the Jorf Lasfar plant (2 x 330 MW) were commissioned in 1994
and 1995; units 3 and 4 in 2000 (2 x 348 MW).The Al Baida wind farm at Koudia near Tetouan (50
MW) was commissioned in August 2001. The first gas combined cycle power plant (384 MW) was
commissioned at Tahaddart inApril 2005.

Expansion plans call for the addition of new coal-fired and gas firedpower plants and about 1000 MW of
wind farms. Morocco's transmission grid in its current form seems unable to absorb a larger wind
capacity given the location of wind potential and the nature of the grid. Calls for tender for wind farms
were or will be launched by ONE on several sites: Tanger (140 MW), Sendouk (65 MW), Tarfaya (200
MW), Essaouira (60MW) and Taza (100 MW). ONE itself plans also to add 890 MW of capacity by
2009, through 4 mainprojects: hydroelectric power plant of Tanafnit El B o j (40 MW, 2009); greenfield
combined solar-gas power plant (450 MW, 2009); Mohammdia gas turbine (300 MW) and diesel unit at
TanTan (100 MW)..

Over 50% of the electricity produced in the country i s distributed via 12 autonomous Rkgies and
distribution utilities. From 1997, electricity distribution was delegated to "Regie$' and to three private
concessions (Casablanca, Rabat and Tangier).

Electricity demand reached 21.1TWh in 2006 and i s projected to grow at 6% per annum requiring the
addition of around 400 MW of capacity per annum.

Electricity Regulation, Targfs and Reforms

The regulatory functions applied to the electricity sector are currently spread between the following
institutions:
     0   Ministryof Energy andMines defines and implements nationalenergy policy and is responsible
         for the technical supervision of ONE.
    0    Ministry of Finance has the financial supervision of ONE and of the electricity distributors
         ("regies").
    0    MinistryofInterior is supervisingthe private concessionsofwater andelectricity distributionand
         the "rkgies".
    0    Ministryof EconomicandGeneralAffairs studies andproposestariffs.
    0    ONE plans the production and transmission system, and proposes tariffs changes, regulatory and
         legaltexts requiredto achieve its missions.

In1994, anew electricity law was adopted allowing foreignprivateinvestment inindependent electricity
production with guaranteed power purchases by ONE. The country launched in 1995 an important Rural

                                                     72

Electrification program (PERG); the target i s the electrification of 1500 to 2000 villages per year. The
rate of rural electrification of the country should reach 100%in2007 (82% in2005 against 17% in 1994).

While ONE and RCgies's tariffs are the same and subject to adjustment decisions made by the
Interdepartmental Commission on Prices, private concession tariffs are different and regulated by
contract. Morocco's electricity prices are the highest by regional standards (See Figure below). At the
nationallevel, concessionstariffs are on averageabout 7% higher (see figure below).

Morocco electricity sector faces four mainchallenges:
    0    To meet strongly growing electricity demand. Growth in Moroccan electricity demand has
         accelerated over the last 3 years from 6% p.a. on average during 1997-2002 to 8% p.a.
         during2003-2006.
    0    To ensure price competitiveness for industrial customers in the context of opening up of the
         Moroccan economy. Future electricity prices must be aligned on those practiced on neighboring
         markets, inparticular, on the open market inSpain.
    0    To implement a more responsive and less fragmented institutional framework to facilitate the
         formulation of a comprehensive sector-wide vision.
    0    To implement a regulatory framework and incentives for monopolistic activities which achieves
         higher cost efficiency.

The support ofthe World Bank aims at accompanyingthe government planfor a secondphase ofreforms
which aims to mobilize more investments and respond to the demand. To achieve this goal, the reform
plans to facilitate competition inthe electricity supply industry through third party access of the grid, to
corporatize ONE and to set up a centralized regulatory function within the government. The reform
includes the following measures:
    0    Initiatingthe opening of the electricity market to competition, basedonthe general orientations of
         the Neighborhood Partnership Agreement with the EUon market liberalization. The purpose of
         the introduction of competition in the electricity market i s to improve sector productivity. This
         market will initially be open only to high voltage electricity consumers and to private electricity
         producers, as well as providers from neighboringcountries
    0    Establishing a power sector regulatory function. Starting from the present situation where the
         regulation of the power sector i s split between several entities, the Government intends to
         concentratethe regulatory function ina single entity. The RegulatoryAgency will advise on price
         revisions, attribution of licenses for new generators and distributors, supervision of existing and
         new concessions, setting of technical and commercial standards, supervision of call for tenders
         for new capacity inthe context of sector planning by the ISO, and regulation of competition. In




                                                      73

         its initial configuration, the Regulatory Agency will not be fully independent, but will operate
         under the supervision ofthe Government.
         Integrating Morocco inthe regional power system. The Government recognizes that the country
         could benefit significantly from integrating in the regional power system through larger
         interconnections capacity and third party access to the electricity grid. This would enable
         Morocco to receive back-up services and benefit from reserve capacity at a lower cost,
         purchase/sell electricity frodto neighboring countries on the best financial terms, and possibly,
         export "green electricity" from wind farms. The potential gains interms of avoided investment in
         reserve capacity, improved security of supply, and access to cheaper electricity will contribute to
         lower the cost o f electricity.
     0   Vertically unbundlingONE.Reforms envisage separating ONE into several companieswith ONE
         being the holding company. The commercialization of the distribution activity will also allow
         benchmarking the performance of the distribution entities to monitor their efficiency and facilitate
         the regulationof their tariffs.


Oil and gas

Oil and Gassupply and Demand

Most crude oil used in Morocco i s imported at the rate of around 100,000 barrels per day (bud). LPG
(1,043 thousand tones in2002) and diesel (590 thousand tones in2002) are the main importedpetroleum
products. Small quantities of gasoline (9 thousand tones in2002) are also imported. Naphtha (and heavy
fuel oil) surpluses are re-exported (1,108 thousand tones in 2002). The refining capacity i s 154,900
barrels per day (bud), distributed in2 refineries: Mohammedia ( S A M I R ) (125,230 bl/d) and Sidi Kacem,
(29,670 bud).

The commissioning inNovember 1996 of the Algeria-Spain gas pipeline (Pedro DuranFarral), makes it
possible for Morocco to start consuming natural gas usingthe transit royalties of 0.8 billion cubic meters
per annum. Morocco has the option to perceive the royalties incash or inkind. The natural gas already
supplies the Tahaddart power plant. Discussions are in hand with Algeria for an initial purchase of 1
billion cubic meter additional natural gas. The possibility to extend the pipeline to the city of Casablanca
was studied inthe late `90s. Plans are progressing to study the possibility of developing an LNG terminal
onthe west coast.

Morocco displays an unusually highrate of per capita consumption of LPG, as a result of remaining LPG
price subsidy and the lack of alternatives for rich households (subsidies to electricity prices have been
eliminatedinthe mid-1990s) and some amount of subsidized LPG diversion inthe commercial sector.

Tables below show a large access to LPG and an already large share of expenditures for this fuel, inboth
rural and urban areas inMorocco as well as a large use of fuel wood inrural areas. It was not possible to
differentiate between users to understand the extent of multi-energy use in Morocco but these two
features tend to indicate that a possible subsidy reform for LPG (butane) is likely to generate some cross-
substitution, leading low income households to reduce their consumptionof butane for cooking purposes,
and increasing expenditures inother energy that can be substituted.

Reforms in thePetroleum ProductsSector

The liberalizationof the oilproducts market began inJuly 2002 with a reductionof customs duties; a total
liberalization i s planned for 2008. The objective is a reduction of 10% per year of customs duties in 6
years.

The government has raised fuel prices (apart from butane) on several occasions. Fuelprices were raised
10.8% in September 2000, and then were not raised until immediately after the harvesting season in
August 2004 (to spare farmers hit by drought), when they were raised by 3.5%. Fuel prices were raised
twice in 2005, in May and August. In February 2006, as the fiscal costs o f the subsidy became
unsustainable, the government raised fuel prices, leavingbutane price unchanged. In September2006, the
government decided to increase prices once again, as it had been impossible so far to re-establish full
indexation as planned in February. Plans are now to make sure that price indexation i s respected for all
products, except for butane left unchanged, and for regular diesel. The price of the latter was increasedby
7% between February and September 2006 as a first step towards full indexation (full indexation would
require another increase of diesel price of around 7% to bring prices in line with market values as of
September 2006).

Until2000, petroleumproducts' prices were indexed on international prices. Every fortnight, the prices
were revised to take into account, inparticular, fluctuations o f international prices o f petroleumproducts
and exchange rates. In 2000, worried by the rise in costs o f international markets and their impact on
consumers, and hoping that it was only temporary, the Government decided to stop reflecting price rises
on consumers. As the Government fixes prices for the consumers, it compensates the distributors for the
difference (indexed price minus fixed consumer price) as subsidies to oil and gas companies.

Reforms undertaken in the 1990s and earlier, aimed at privatizing the petroleum products' sector, and
structuring it to enable competition between market players with minimal intervention by the State. The
policy in force since 2000 does not stress competition, but regulation o f the sector. In the case of
Morocco, competition can fimction healthily, provided sufficient market oversight i s enforced to avoid
abuse of dominant positionby existing market participants.


Energy Outlook :the Impact of Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reforms

The measures envisaged in the government reforms will have impacts on the whole energy balances in
the years to come. Those impacts are captured in the reform scenario of Moroco's energy balance
depicted below, which compares to a reference (or business as usual) scenario. The reference scenario is


                                                      76

based upon a final electricity consumption growing at the annual rate of 7.5% in 2006-2010 and 7.0%
2011-2015 and primary energy demand in other sectors (table 7) estimated based upon historical trends.
Primary energy demands for electricity production was calculated using ONE'S investment program
(ONE Annual Report, 2004, and Bulletin de le FCdCration de l'knergie, 17, 3rd quarter 2006). In the
reference scenario, the annual averagetotal final energy demand growth rate i s 4.5% per annum.

The reform scenario translates investments inenergy efficiency carried out over 2008-2014 into a slower
energy demand growth rates at 4.1% per annumon average and achieving on average halfa milliontones
of oil equivalent savings of total final energy demand. Projections of renewable energy assume a growth
of an additional 1,000 MW of wind electricity production capacity spread over 2008-2011, inaddition to
the existingplans (Essaouira andTanger).

          ANNEX 5: COMMUNICATION PROGRAM ONENERGY SECTOR REFORMS


The implementation of energy sector reforms will be accompaniedby a number o f communicationactions, some of
which have already been engaged. It should be noted that it will be the f r s t time the energy sector is engaging in
communication with the public, the industry and other government institutions.

Organizationofcommunicationon energy sector reforms
The Government will organize communication around the themes listed below. The implementation of the
communication programwill be put under the responsibility of several government institutions, following the table
below.




          Communication
          with financing           MEM              ONE              MEM               CDER
          institutions


Communications actions
Actions already executed or scheduled
The Government has already taken a number of actions for communicationonenergy sector reforms:
Institutions
A CommunicationDepartment has been set-up and staffed inthe Ministry of Energy and Mines. This Department,
which will coordinate all communication actions involving MEM (see above) will be reinforced. As part o f the
DPOL,
    o it will present prior to the presentation to the Board of the proposed operation, its work plan to implement
         the communication program outlined above;
    o the Government will be asked to present to the Bank at the same time the budget allocated to
         communication inMEM and other institutions involved incommunicationon energy reforms, and to show
         that the corresponding allocation i s covered under the 2007 Loi de Finance; and
    o the MEM will select a local consultant on communication to help with the implementation of the
         communication planof MEMfor 2007.

Actions engaged
The Government has engageda number of actions to communicate onenergy sector reforms:
    o A workshop on energy sector strategy organized inMay 2005 at the CasablancaUniversity with high-level
         international speakers, targeting the press and development partner.          The event led to the wide
         dissemination in the press of the Government strategy and priorities in the energy sector (security,
         competitiveness, and sustainability).




                                                          79

    o The JournCe de l'Energie, which took place on October 30, 2006, and where the Government reform
        agenda was presented, closely aligned with the reform program supported by the proposed DPL:
        Responding to international energy shock, opening the energy sector to competition, and monitoring of
        implementation of sector reforms.      The targeted audience was the public at large, and development
        partners. A number of debates with the public were included inthe program, as well as a press conference
        where the Minister of Energy announced the priority for energy management and the development of
        renewable energy.
    o Regarding electricity sector reforms, the Government and ONE have organized in 2006 two internal
        workshops to discussthe electricity reformprogram, aimed at other ministerialdepartments(not the public)
        for consensus buildingand communicationof the content of the reformprogram.
    o The MEM and ONE have asked the Bank for support to organize a workshop on power sector reforms,
       targeting the industry and government departments. The workshop, which will be funded by PPIAF, will
        cover power sector restructuring and liberalization.

Actions to be implemented during the DPLperiod
    o Reaching out to the public: the MEMhas included inits work program (See Section 3-1 of the Matrix) the
        execution of several surveys on energy consumption in Morocco, including the organization of focus
        groups (the Banki s providing support to MEMwith the organization of 15 focus groups across the country
        and social groups under ESMAP funding; the conclusion of the focus groups for the scoping o f further
        surveys and communicationwere made available inNovember 2006). The budget for the surveys will be
        includedinthe MEMbudget and i s included inthe DPL matrix.
    o Media communications: it is envisaged that the Government (MEM coordinating) will organize quarterly
       "town hall" meetings on progresswith the energy sector reform, with participationo f the media.
    o Subject to confirnation, follow-up JournCes would be organized every semester following each of the

                         SIacroeconomic performance and Policies'


Macroeconomic conditions remain strong, and there are no short-term macroeconomic
concei-ns. Real GDP growth accelerated to 8.1percent ui2006. upfrom 2.6 percent in2005.
This strong performance was driven bothby a veiy good agricultural canipaip and the
recovery of noiiala@riculturalactivity. particularly inthe construction. telecom~iiiu~cations.and
tourism sectors. Overall growthis likely to decline hi2007 as agricultural production returnis
to n o m 1levels, but n o i ~ p i c d h w agrowth is expectedto accelerate. spearheaded by strong
                                           l
domestic demand and a pickup ininvestment.

The externalposition remains comfortable. The current account posted its sixth
consecutive surplus in2006, as reiifittmces and tourism receipts reminedbuoyant. The good
export performance. notably for textiles and phosphates. was niore than offset by the increase
hithe energy bill. resalting ina widening o fthe trade deficit. Boostedby an increase in
investwetit flows. gross official reserves ($20 billion at end-February 2007) continue to
exceed the total stock o f extenlal debt. Extern1debt continued to decline and the standard
debt sustainability analysis indicates that extenial vulnerabilities are limited.Recent analysis
suggests that tlie Moroccan dirliatii which is peggedto a basket o f currencies dori~hiatedby
the euro. is not inisaliped.

Public finances are improving. The deficit narrowed to 2.1 percent o f GDP in2006. down
from5.2 percent in2005.reflecting strong tax and nontax receipts. the impact o fthe
successfui iniplementation o f the early retirement propam for civil servants. and the
nourenewal o f exceptional expenditures incurredin2005.As a result, the stock of public debt
resumed its downward trend. falling to 57 percent o f GDP in2006. down from 62.7 percent
in200.5.The 2007 budget deficit target of 3.4percent ofGDPisbroadly consistent with the
authorities' niediuni-tenn fiscal consolidation objectives but appears consenative inview o f
the favorable deficit outcome in2006.

Inflation picked up in2006, prompting the central bank to tighten its m o n e t q stance.
Average headline hiflation increasedto 3.3 percent in2006. up froinjust 1percent in 2005.
Available data through February 2007 point to a slight 5lOwdOWi inheadline inflation. To
stave off inflationmy pressures. BAMraised the interest rate on its deposit auctions by
25 basis points to 2.75 percent and started conducting openiiiarket operations.

The medium-term outlook is favorable. Noiiagricdhultl GDP i s projected to reiminwell
above 5 percent on average over tlie next five years. with inflation at about 2 percent. Despite
strong tourism andremittance flows. the pickup ineconomic activity is expected to turn the
current account surplus into a deficit toward the end o f the decade. Xonetheless. strong
foreign direct investment would help keep official reserves at a comfortable level. Fiscal
consolidation would strengthen public savings.

~Iorocco'smainchallenge is to sustain and improve uponits good economic
performance to further reduce unemployment andensure that growth benefits all. The
authorities have already strengthenedtheir efforts to eliminate the remining impedimentsto
growth. The dialogue betweenthe Moroccan authorities andFundstaffhas focused onthree
key areas: fiscal consolidation. fuiaricial sector reform. and trade liberalization.

The authoiitieshave started to implement their medium-term fiscal consolidation
strategy, and the recent improvement inthe public finance position i s encouraging. The
success o f the early retirement programfor civil servants has reduced the public wage bill as
a share of GDP, which has longbeen a major source of fiscal rigidity.The partial
reinstatement o f the indexationmechanism o f retail petroleumprices to internationalprices
should reduce the cost of fuel subsidies borne by the budget.

The banking sector has significantly strengthened inthe last few years. The wire-off of
a substantial amount of nouperfonning loans has strengthened the balance sheet of the
banking sector. aid the restnictuwhgo f the two troubled state-owned banks i s complete. All
banksare expected to be infiillcompliance with Base1IIpivdential requirements by
June 2007.

The recent inroads inmultilateral trade liberalizationhaw deepenedMorocco's
integration inthe global economy. Inaddition. the latest free-trade agreements-notably
with the U.S. and Turkey, andi-egiomlpartners inthe context o fthe Agadir agreement-will
help boost trade. Further multilateraltariff reductions as well as liberalization o f trade in
services are appropriate next steps inthe trade liberalization strategy. Tlie authorities'
decision to prepare for a p d u a l transition to a more flexible exchaiige rate regime hithe
mediumterm is also welcome. as increasedexchmge rate flexibility canhelp ensure the
successful integrationo fMorocco inthe global economy.
