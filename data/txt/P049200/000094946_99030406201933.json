    project beneficiaries in poor rural communities, and\n            increase social capital at the local organizational level.\n            The project consists of two main components: 1) Financing\n            sub-projects prepared by recipients in poor rural\n            communities, and disadvantaged groups. This includes the\n            rehabilitation, upgrading, building or furnishing of small\n            rural infrastructures; the development of community-based\n            social services; and, income generating activities.\n            Furthermore, training and technical assistance will be\n            provided for building a community capacity, able to\n            participate, identify, and prioritize their own needs,\n            towards the design, implementation, and monitoring of\n            sub-projects. In addition, cost-effectiveness standards will\n            be maintained and appropriate technologies will be provided\n            to support small infrastructures. 2) Strengthening the\n            institutional capacity of the Social Development Fund and\n            supporting the overall management of the project. The\n            project will support poverty alleviation at the community\n            level through an increased cooperation in resource\n            mobilization and problem solving."}, "docdt": "1998-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
