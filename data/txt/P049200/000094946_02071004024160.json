satisfactory. Some key lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) Poor communities can go beyond\n            needs identification and participation in problem solving\n            and there is a high potential for civic engagement. 2) There\n            is increasing evidence that the bottom-up approach is\n            beneficial for sensitizing authorities to community-drive\n            development (CDD). 3) People from graduating villages have\n            turned out to be the best facilitators and promoters. 4)\n            Communities that receive Romanian Social Development Fund\n            (RSDF) grants want to communicate, share experience and\n            organize themselves in a network that will promote CDD in\n            Romania. 4) There is a wealth of poverty-related data at\n            RSDF level which needs to be analyzed and included in\n            studies. Findings of such analyzes need to be disseminated.\n            5) The RSDF has to make sure its control procedures do not\n            turn into bureaucracy."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
