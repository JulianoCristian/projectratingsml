CHAPTER III
THE CONSULTATION RESULTS
The Consultation result of BUIP Umbrella Andal shows that the public pays
much attention. It was proven by the so many questions posed by the
community members. The result of the Consultation note taker can be seen in
annex 5. The summary of the Consultation results can be grouped as follows:
3.1.  Public Suggestion
The suggestion proposed are general in nature to accelerate
communication and constitutionalize the public consultation as a part of
functional element in the development implementation system in Bali.
Those suggestions are:
* This kind of public consultation should be used as a model to inform
the projects that are considered to have significantly potential
impact.
. It is necessary for the Consultation to accomodate the community
aspiration, starting from the progam planning , controlling in the
implementation, and maintainance in the operation or use of
facilities.
*  It is necessary to follow-up the BUIP Umbrella Andal Consultation by
inviting the community members who are still interested in the
AMDAL regional commission meeting when discussing about the
Specific Andal Projects.
* It is important to maintain and develop the positive attitude of the
community in the Consultation to prevent the negative attitude from
exclusive group members, in order for the Consultation not to be
used as a forum for expressing their less adult emosion.
3.1.1. Suggestion forthe material
The constructive suggestion for the improvement of BUIP Umbrella
Andal are among others;
* The data on the projects of each sector for each town should be
completed soon.
* The significant impact estimate is needed to be reevaluated since
there are some environmental components that are absent of the
possibility of impact, especially the community health component.
a It is urgently required to determine which projects need Andal and
RKLIRPL and which of them need UKUUPL only.

Lokakarva Umunt Andal P3KT - BUIP                   Environnmental Sector
* The use of tables, panctuation marks must be consistent either in
indonesian or English.
* The use of terms, names, etc. must be consistent and in accordance
with the correct terminlogy.
* In the next Andal arrangement, it is proposed to involve more
experts, cultural observers, informant from Bali who understand and
know more about Balinese culture.
3.1.2. Suggestion for the Program
a It must be given priority to the development of terminal that replaces
Ubung terminal which is not appropriate anymore.
* Projects should be more carefully planned and programmed so that
there is no more overhaul for other project implementation in each
sector.
3.1.3. Proposal/suggestion for Follow-Up Action
* The result of BUIP Umbrella Andal report should be put in the
general library so that the community can read and join/participate.
a The same thing for the Project specific Andal that would be made,
such as for TPA, Free way roads,etc.
3.2.  Constraints and Opportunities
Better mutual information flows have been achieved through BUIP Umbrella
Andal public consultation. However, there are a number of constraints that
need to be paid attention to. In spite of that, there is opportunity to improve this
communication system in order to be more useful. The constraints and
opportunities are among others:
3.2.1. Constraints
The public consultation involving the public is a new event in Bali even and in
Indonesia. It needs further in.
.vestigation, whether it has already been appropriate to Indonesian culture and
its community attitude, especially in Bali, before it is civilized.
.  The same view/perception about public consultation has not been
developed yet that public consultation is an effective medium to
accommodate desires of all parties (ommunity and govemment).
*  It needs well preparation in all aspects relating to the consultation as it is
publically opened. It is difficult to anticipate the community participation.

* Select the program that needs public consultation in order to make the
existing fund source and capacity efficient.
3.2.2. Opportunities
The opportunity to perfect or complete the public consultation and alike is
welcomed, considering that:
*  In Banjar scale, deciding all society aspects is done through discussion
process. And it has already become one/united in the society life, including
the application of sanction to the agreement breaker.
*  In a wider scale, the above intended pattem is possibly done, but better
potential organisation is needed.

CHAPTER IV
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION
Some points can be concluded at the end of this public consultation report, and
suggestions are useful for the perfection/completion of this consultation
execution in order to succeed BUIP in general and Umbrella Environmental
Impacts Analysis in particular. The conclusion and suggestions are as follows:
4.1.  Conclusion
The public consultation which involves all parties including public community
can be used as a medium to channel aspiration and information directly. Its
implementation, however, must be so well planned that that distortion of
perception, concept and anticipation can be met.
4.2.  Suggestion
As it was shown in the public consultation, the public participation has already
appeared but needs to be more encouraged. It is suggested that the
community members who were present and paying attention to the matters
related to BUIP program should be given priority to be invited in the next
AMDAL commission meetings, in order to get input for Andal project.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                           Environmental Sector
PREFACE
At the present time, Pemda Tk. I together with 9 Pemda Tk. lis of Bali Province are
implementing BUIP, and in Bali Province it is more well-knows as EJBUDP (East Java Bali
Urban Development Program). This program is one of the joint programs between East Java
Province and Bali Province which financial sources is from IBRD World Bank through its Loan
No. 3304-IND.
BUIP consists of physical infrastructure investment as well as Operation and
Maintenance with seven sub-sectors of Public Work, among others: waste/sanitation, waste
management, drainage, urban roads, KIP and MIIP as well as other important components such
as Regional Revenue Increase, Regional Institutional Improvement and Capacity Analysis and
Regional Financial Plan. This program lasts for 5 years, and at the present time it enters the
last year of the program implementation.
At the present time, Pemda Tk. I together with 9 Pemda Tk. lis of Bali Province are
planning to arrange the second five years urban program with help from the central
govemment, in order to continue the urban program that have been done well enough, before.
That program is more well-knows as BUIP Preparation or Mid Term Planning of 'Bali Urban
Infrastructure Program".
Andal study is inseparable part of BUIP Mid Term Planning Preparation, thus the
reference framework of BUIP Andal is a part reference framework of BUIP Mid Term Planning
Preparation.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                     Environmental Sector
i    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
.i  Introduction
To achieve the goals of Indonesia's sixth Five Year National Development
Plan, 'Repelita VI', the Government of Indonesia a.o. intends to prepare
Spatial Plans and to improve the Environment as well as the Infrastructure.
The current 'Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)', to be implemented
by the Provincial Govemment of Bali, is to support these objectives in Bali
through investment in mainly traditional infrastructure, in combination with
strengthening the capacity for Environmental Management of infrastructure
projects at both provincial and local levels, in order to achieve sustainable
development. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
IBRD (World Bank) is the financing agency of this program.
The project has been classified as 'category A', requiring an Environmental
Assessment, according to IBRD's Operational Directive 4.01. This EA report
may be referred to as a Regional / Sectoral EA for BUIP since it deals with
the region of Bali Province and with the sector of Urban Infrastructure. It
may also be referred to as an 'Umbrella' EA, or UEA, since it addresses the
generic environmental consequences of BUIP, consisting of a great number
of mainly small sub-projects. Additionally, it presents screening guidelines to
identify the individual BUIP sub-projects that need further Environmental
Assessment before implementation.
This UEA covers the requirements for EA set forth by the Terms of Refer-
ence (TOR) of BAPPEDA Tk 1 and the KA-AMDAL approved by the
Governor of Bali.
Some individual sub-projects under BUIP, according to Indonesian legisla-
tion, will be subject to the formal Environmental Impact Assessment process
(AMDAL). Therefore, the methods used in describing the environment and
in screening sub-projects for individual EA, follow the requirements for
environmental impact assessment under Indonesian Law. Additionally, IBRD
requirements per OD 4.01 are taken into account. Projects which fall into
this category will not be programmed for the first two years of BUIP, to
allow for sufficient time to undertake necessary studies and prepare the
required documents (K-ANDAL, ANDAL, RKL, RPL).

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                      Environmental Sector
The objectives of this EA are to identify or define:
-    generic and significant impacts of BUIP projects;
-    environmental issues, opportunities and constraints;
-    assign BUIP projects to different categories of environmental man-
agement approach, possibly including further EA;
-    required environmental management capacities for BUIP implementa-
tion, proposing strengthening where required;
-    guidelines for prevention or mitigation of environmental impact;
and to promote or enhance:
-    information to the public to stimulate participation and awareness;
-    integration of environmental considerations in the decision making
process;
-    contribution to regional development planning.
This EA is based on existing information sources. A comprehensive 'Bali
Environmental Profile' was prepared as a separate document.
Diagram I on the previous page illustrates the process of confronting the
environment of Bali with BUIP, resulting in categorization of sub-projects for
different levels of environmental management.
i.ii   Environmental Management Policies and Legislation
In accordance with the Broad Outlines of the Nations Direction (GBHN), the
main key words of the objectives of environmental management are: sus-
tainability, environmentally oriented development, consolidation and
improvement of effectiveness.
For BUIP this means: optimize the use and consolidate operation and main-
tenance of existing infrastructure and improve effectiveness of development.
New infrastructure shall support the national development and stability.
Participation of the public and of the private sector will be stimulated,
management abilities of institutions will be improved, legislation   and
enforcement instruments will be developed.
Furthermore the quality of the urban physical and socio-economical environ-
ment should be improved.
Important issues that need attentions are: development must be based on
spatial planning, taking into account environmental opportunities and con-
straints, Environmental Assessment (ANDAL) is required for implementation
of activities likely to cause significant impact. Efforts should be made for
rehabilitation after implementation of projects, and awareness and participa-
tion of society in reaching government decisions should be developed.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                      Environmental Sector
The environmental attitude towards development in Bali is inspired by tradi-
tional philosophy: 'Tai Hila Carina', each development should maintain the
harmonious relations between human and the Gods, humans and humans
and between humans and their environment; 'Tai Mandata', spatial concept
based on the holiness level in Hinduism and 'Bosomy', determining the holi-
ness of certain areas.
Based on Law No.4 of 1982 regarding Basic Provisions for the Management
of the Living Environment, Government Regulation No.51 of 1993 and the
Decree of the Minister of State for the Environment of 19 March 1994 deal
with the process of Environmental Assessment (AMDAL). The legislation
contains a list of activities with criteria for size, and a list of protected areas,
for which situations an EA report (ANDAL) is required and shall be reviewed
and accepted by the Central or Provincial AMDAL-Commission, before a
permit or license, allowing implementation of the activity, can be granted.
The Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP) itself does not belong to the
categories of activities mentioned in the above mentioned legislation.
However, there may be individual projects that meet the criteria which make
it necessary for these individual projects to follow the AMDAL procedure. In
addition, the IBRD may require detailed EA for individual projects, after
screening the projects against their OD 4.01 criteria, or against generic
criteria for Bali developed for BUIP.
On the level of individual project implementation, provincial spatial policy
plans and environmental (mainly water) quality standards have to be met.
Diagram il presents the process of Environmental Assessment. All levels of
assessment will result in stipulating measures for environmental manage-
ment (RKURPL, UKUUPL or SOP) to be included in tender documents and
construction contracts.
i.iii The Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)
The BUIP consists of an investment program in the sector of traditional
Integrated Urban Infrastructure Programming (IUIDP), dealing with projects
of urban physical infrastructure and services, in the sub-sectors of Water
Supply, Urban Roads, Human Waste Water Sanitation, Solid Waste Man-
agement, Market Infrastructure Improvement, Village Improvement and
Urban Drainage and Flood Control. Additional sub-sectors for BUIP are
Traffic and Transport Management, New Markets, Bus Terminals and
Parking Lots. The projects comprise new developments (eg. new Final Solid
Waste Disposal Sites), relocation, expansion (eg. Road Widening) or
maintenance (eg. Road Overlay).

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                       Environmental Sector
Needs and wishes for new or improved infrastructure and necessities for
maintenance of existing infrastructure were inventoried for all districts and a
Real Demand Survey (RDS) was conducted for the sub-sectors Water
Supply, Human Waste Water Sanitation and Solid Waste Management. By
screening this inventory for technical, economic and environmental feasibil-
ity, a selected number of projects are proposed for implementation during
the five year period under BUIP.
Projects will be implemented in 32 Towns in all 9 Districts of Bali. Table i.iii
presents a summary of BUIP projects for each district (Kotamadya and
Kabupaten).

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                      Environmental Sector
L.iv. The Environment Of Bali; Challenges, Constraints and Oportunities
l.iv.i. Environment Condition
Bali province consists of a number of islets. Bali island is the main one, and
its islets are Pulau Nusa Penida, Pulau Nusa Ceningan, Pulau Nusa
Lembongan, Pulau Menjangan and Pulau Menjangan. The width of Bali as
a whole is 5,632.86 Km2 or 0.29% of the width of Indonesian archipelago.
The number of Bali's population is 2,777,356 with population density of 493
persons/Km2.
West of Bali is the province of East Java confined by Bali strait; east of Bali
is Lombok island confined by Lombok strait. While north of Bali is Java sea
and south of it is Indonesian ocean.
Geographically, Bali is located in between 80 - 0,3'-40" - 8° -50' - 48" South
Latitude and 1140 - 25'-53" - 1150 - 42'-40" East Longitude. Geologically,
the soil consists of kwarter rock, beneath kwarter, pliosin, and miosin. In
terms of relief and topography, in the middle of the island, there are
mountains spreading over from west to east. Among them there are two
active volcanoes, namely Gunung Batur (of 1,171m high) and Gunung
Agung (of 3,140 m high). The other mountains are Gunung Merebuk (of
1,386 m high), Gunung Patas (of 1,414 m high), and Gunung Seraya (of
1,174 m high). The existence of such mountain range geographically
causes the island spilt up into two unbalanced devisions. They are:
Northern Bali with a long narrow and less flat mainland.
Southern Bali with a wide and flat mainland.
In addition, Bali has 4 (four) lakes, namely Danau Beratan, Danau Buyan,
Danau Tamblingan and Danau Batur. Bali has tropical sea climate
infuenced by seasonal wind. It also has dry and wet seasons between
which is the transisition periode.
The weather is influenced by the place hight. The average weather in Bali
of 28° - 30°C. The mainland in the southern part is wider than that in the
northern part. Such natural condition has great influence toward the climate
in Bali. Generally, in the southern Bali the rain fall is much more than that in
the northern Bali in December up to February. The wind blows from west
and south west, while in August it blows from east and south east.
In March up to May, the wind blows from different directions. The humidity
in Bali is 90%; in the wet season it may reach 100%, while in the dry
season it reaches 60%.
In terms of soil types in Bali, it is dominated by Regusol and Latosol types.
Only a small amount is of Alluvial, Mediteran and Andasol soil. The Latosol

type that is very sensitive to erosion can be found in the western areas
such as Kalopaksa, Petemon, rengdikit and Pempatan. It can also be found
in the areas of Gunung Penyu, Gunung Pintu, Gunung Juwet and Gunung
Seraya, which cover of 44.9% of the island width.
The erosional sensitive Regusol soil can be found in the eastern part of
Amiapura and Culik. This type of soil can be also found along Singaraja
coastal areas untill Seririt, Bubunan, Kekeran, around Danau Tamblingan,
Buyan and Beratan areas, around Batukaru forest, in small parts of
southern coast of Kusamba, sanur , Benoa and Kuta. This covers of
33.93% of the island width.
;           Andasol is also sensitive to erosion and can be found around Baturiti, Candi
Kuning, Banyuatis, Gobleg, Pupuan and a part of Batukaru forest. The
Mediteran soil which is less sensitive to erosion can be found in the Bukit
Nusa Penida and its islets, Kuta hill and Prapat Agung. The Alluvial type is
not sensitive to erosion and can be found  in the mainland of Negara,
Sumber Kelampok, manggis and Angan Telu. The last three types of soil
cover of about 15.49% of the island width.
The forests that have functions as spring protector, erosion and flood
prevention or function as hidrology are speading over the middle areas of
the island from west to east.
Most rivers that come from the forests flow to the southern mainland
compared to those flowing to the northern one. As an agricultural area,
most people work in the agricultural sector, and therefore, rivers play an
important role as water souces for irrigation.
Looking at it from the land use in 1994, it shows that 9.60% of the land is
used for seftlement; 19.35% for rice field; 22.54% are in the forms of forest;
25.36 for plantation; 8.51%  of it is critical land; lakes take 0.46%  and
14.15% are for other uses.
If it is seen from its socio-economy, the location of Bali island is very
strtegic since it plays the role of connector the land, sea and air traffic
between the Java and Nusa Tenggara islands as well as between Asia and
Australia continents.
There are about 1.3 million foreign visitors and around 700 th.ousand
domestic visitors coming to Bali every year. Tourism industry and souvenir
marketting are very important for the economy in Bali. There is one
international air port in Bali(Ngurah Rai) that connects Bali to other cities
throughout Indonesia and to the cities in other coutries. In the sea ports, the
Ferry connects Bali to Java in the west and to Lombok in the east.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                       Environmental Sector
The environment condition in Bali is very special, various and beautiful
which is necessary to be preserved by implementing the environmental
oriented and continuing development. It is one of the main objectives of this
BUIP Andal study. In the last several years, the significant and sensitive
environment condition declines as a result of facilities and accomodation
development for tourists, the increase of traffic and the increase of waste.
To preserve the environment as well as to prevent the increase of negative
impact from decreasing quality environment by tourism development,
pattern arrangement of better environmental management policy and more
operative, new environmental institutional establishment as well as more
realistic application of law sanction is needed.
According to the spatial plan of Bali province (RTRWP) in 2010, the
regioanl characteristics used as instrument to manage the socio-economic
and environmental activities are devided into several types/characteristics of
geographical condition which cover:
1. Protected Area Consolidation Plan
1.   Area which gives protection to its sub-areas
*    Protected Forest Areas
*    Water Catchment Areas
2.   Local Protection Areas
*    Holy Areas
-    Holy Place Areas
*    Shore Border Areas
River Border Areas
*     Ravine Border Areas
Lake and Reservoir Surrounding Areas
*    Spring Surrounding Areas
3.   Nature Preservation and Culture Conservation Areas
*    Nature Preservation Areas
*    Mangrove Forested Coastal Areas
*    Great  Forest,  Nature  Tourist Park  and  Nature
Preservation Areas
*    West Bali National Park Areas
*    Culture Conservation and Science Areas
4.    Disastrous Sensitive Areas
*    Volcanic Disastrous Areas
*    Lanslide/Erosion Areas
*    Sea Water Intrusion Coast Areas

11. Management Plan of Caltivation Areas
1. Production Forest Areas
2. Agriculture Areas
3. Tourism Areas
4. Industrial Areas
5. Settlement Areas
6. Mining Areas
7. Security Defence Areas
One of the striking environmental characteristics in Bali is the existance of
so many bodies of water and rivers that this environmental characteristics
look very dense. The implication of the environmental characteristics toward
the development plan must be used as the evaluation basis for project site
area determination.
L.ivii. Challenge
In analyzing the environment in Bali, there are a number of challenges in its
management. Those challenges are among others:
1. Natural resources
* The limited natural resources
* Sustainable development and increasing needs in line with the
population   growth.
2.1 Advance of Technology
* The increase of industry causes the increase of pollution
l.iviii. Constraints
In creating the environment which is BALI, a short term for Bersih(clean),
Aman(secure), Lestari(everlasting) and Indah (beautiful), there are a
number of Obstacles, among others:
*     Casting off liquid and solid waste
*     Uneven deviopment that causes migration to the towns, and as the
result, there appears dirty areas
*    The shore condition in which many of the shores undergo Aberation
*    The critical areas are getting wider
*    There are a number of community members who do not care of their
environment yet.
L.iviv. Chances
In spite of challenges, obstacles/problems, Bali also has chances that can
be taken in supporting BUIP program, among others:

i.v   Environmental Interests Potentially Affected by BUIP
Table i.iv shows that the majority of towns for which BUIP projects are
proposed, are located in predominantly urban areas, which is to be
expected for urban infrastructure projects. In urban areas the environmental
characteristics of main importance are quality parameters related to human
health and safety. Table i.v.i shows the typical possible impact of the
different types of projects on environmental quality parameters.
Of some of the types or categories of projects it may be assumed that no
significant environmental impact will remain after implementation. Such
types of projects are those of temporary character, eg. maintenance, or pro-
jects that are combinations of small activities, such as village and market
improvement.
Focusing on the types of projects that may possibly cause lasting and
significant changes in the environment, attention should be paid to possible
occurrence of the following main potential impacts (Table i.v.ii):
These types of projects should be screened individually, using zone specific
criteria, in order to determine which category of environmental management
should be effected during and after implementation of individual projects.

i.vi   Possibilities for Avoidance and Mitigation
To avoid environmental damage, it is necessary to apply integral design, by
incorporating environmental expertise in the design teams to stimulate
creative design from an environmental point of view, and for formulating and
evaluating alternative solutions. If environmental damage is not prevented
by design, in most cases it can only be partly mitigated. As the expression
f                   ~~~says: One ounce of prevention is worth one pound of cure! As a conse-
quence, some activities may not be acceptable in a sensitive or vulnerable

Umbirella Environmental Assessment                     Environmental Sector
On the whole, environmental damage can be avoided for most BUIP
projects. Mainly, it is projects located outside urban areas requiring special
attention, such as Water intakes, Water purification plants, New roads,
Sewerage systems, Sewage treatment plants, New solid waste disposal
sites, New or relocated markets, bus stations and parking lots.
Environmental consequences that are to be avoided are, in particular:
resettlement of people; demolition of cultural objects; removal of large trees;
pollution of surface & ground water; pollution of soil and disturbance of
scenic landscapes.
i.vii Screening BUIP Projects
Bali-specific screening guidelines were developed to identify sub-projects
that should either be analyzed further by way of a site specific Environ-
mental Assessment (ANDAL, RKURPL), or should only be subjected to
environmental management and monitoring plans (UKL and UPL). For the
remaining projects, specification of environmentally relevant design criteria,
or implementation of safeguards during construction and/or operation
(Standard Operating Procedures, SOP) will be developed. RKURPL,
UKUUPL and SOP provide material that will be appended to the tender
documents and construction contracts for those projects.
Screening will be performed by a screening committee in which all involved
institutional parties will participate, applying the criteria as dictated by
Indonesian legislation as well as the criteria stipulated by the IBRD in OD
4.01. The set of criteria to be used for screening is presented in table i.vii.
Sub-projects that appear to be subject to the AMDAL procedure will be
reviewed by the Provincial AMDAL Commission.

i.viii Terms of Reference for AMDAL
For BUIP sub-projects screened from the PJM's, that require ANDAL
(including RKLURPL), UKL/UPL, or SOP, Terms of Reference (TOR) have to
be prepared for further study and preparation of the required documents.
For the AMDAL procedure, General Guidelines issued by the Minister for
the Environment, and in some instances also Technical Guidelines issued
by the Government Agency responsible for the BUIP sub-project involved,
are to be observed. For BUIP, being financed by the IBRD, OD 4.01 will
also be taken into account.
For AMDAL, the KA-ANDAL, the ANDAL and the RKL / RPL need to be
reviewed and accepted by the Bali Provincial AMDAL Commission, before a
permit can be issued.
For UKL /UPL, prepared if no ANDAL is required, the Minister for the
Environment also provides General Guidelines. Additionally, technical
Guidelines can be set by the responsible Government Agency. UKL and
UPL need to be approved by this same agency, before a permit can be
granted.
There will be many BUIP sub-projects that, given Location and Size, do not
require ANDAL, nor UKL / UPL. For these projects Standard Operation
Procedures (SOP) have to be written. The SOP will be an indispensable
part of the Construction Contract. Technical Guidelines of PU are one of the
sources for SOP. (See Diagram 11).
The objective of TOR for ANDAL / RKL / RPL is to establish scope and
depth of the study and to focus on themes that are of main or particular
interest. It is the aim of this UEA to provide generic information that can be
incorporated in individual EAs under this 'umbrella'.
Topics that should be covered in all ANDALs are:
-    Description and motivation of the project;
-    Description and evaluation of relevant aspects of the present environ-
ment and autonomous developments;
-    Assessment and evaluation of environmental impact and affected
interests;
-    Mitigative measures incorporated in the project;
-    Alternatives for the project, proposed site and mitigation;
-    Comparison of alternatives, including 'Go / No-Go' criteria;
-    Legal framework;
-    Environmental management and monitoring provisions; and
-    Making a summary accessible to the public.
For BUIP sub-sectors specific areas of attention, to be elaborated on in the
TOR for ANDAL (KA-ANDAL) are indicated.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                     Environmental Sector
i.ix  Public Consultation       -
Early in 1996 consultation of the public on BUIP was conducted at the level
of Bali Province, Districts and Towns. Participants were invited by provincial
and local authorities; NGO's were invited only at the level of districts and
towns.
The main conclusions are;
-    Meetings with the public should be better prepared, the public felt
they were not sufficiently informed about the project;
-    There was a clear request for better co-ordination between author-
ities (e.g. between roads and drainage); and
-    Concern was transmitted from the public toward the project manage-
ment, to preserve the Bali cultural atmosphere in design and rehabili-
tation of the built environment, especially new markets.
This draft report will be communicated to the public by the provincial
government, in order to obtain reactions and suggestions. The results of
this consultation must be available before BUIP appraisal.
NGO's will be invited (as non-permanent members) by the provincial
AMDAL-Commission to participate in the review of ANDAL's for those
projects that either meet the legal requirements for ANDAL or require an EA
according to IBRD criteria.
i.x  Institutional Capacities
The provincial government, via Bappeda Tk 1, is responsible for Environ-
mental Management as part of their regional planning and development
function. The organizational framework for execution of the environmental
component of this task (Biro Bina Lingkungan Hidup, BBLH) is slowly
developing.
Fragmentation between different environmental agencies complicates
effective operation. There is also lack of environmentally qualified person-

Bappeda-l should assist Dati-l1 staff, by preparing the ANDAL for those
BUIP sub-projects that require full environmental assessment (AMDAL),
using this Umbrella Environmental Assessment and annexes as a reference
source and data base. In addition, they should assist Dati-ll in preparing
standard clauses for environmental management and monitoring measures
to be incorporated in all tender documents and construction contracts.

Review of the AMDAL documents (KA-ANDAL, ANDAL) is the responsibility
of the Provincial AMDAL-Commission. Review of RKL/RPL and UKUUPL is
the responsibility of structural units of Provincial Government. It should be
coordinated by Bappeda, section SLH. BLH will participate in all reviews
and the cognizant technical Dinas would be involved according the sub-
project. The review should include screening of proposed project sites,
especially for Final Solid Waste Disposal Sites, to ascertain that they are
not located in protected or sensitive areas. Approval of the RKURPL or
UKUUPL is a condition for sub-project approval.
RKUIRPL and UKUUPL implementation depend heavily on training of field
supervisors (PIMPRO's), incorporating environmental management and
monitoring measures into tender documents and construction contracts.
Final engineering design consultants and Bappeda-l and 11 should insure
that the documents include these items as specific conditions of the con-
tract. Standard Operation Procedures (SOP), shall be developed by
BAPPEDA-1 for these types of sub-projects.
Dati-l personnel need training in UKUUPL regulations and preparation
procedures, as well as in environmental issues relevant for infrastructure
projects, so they can provide a prompt and informed review of UKL/UPL
documents and advise Dati-ll personnel as needed.
Dati-ll personnel will require training in relevant environmental issues and
regulations, UKUUPL preparation, incorporating environmental management
and monitoring requirements in tender documents and construction con-
tracts, as well as methods for supervising UKUUPL implementation.
After the above training is completed, Dati-l and Dati-ll personnel should
participate together in a one day workshop to review the training, share
views on how UKUUPL can best be prepared and implemented. As a result
of this workshop They should agree on working arrangements for prepara-
tion, review, implementation, monitoring and reporting.
To ensure that the program meets the real training needs, a training pro-
gram should be developed. The TOR for development of this training
program is presented.

Lokakarya Umum Andal P3KT - BUIP                         Environmental Sector
This public consultation is aimed at discussing BUIP - AMDAL matters. Its background is
an intention to succeed the sustainable development during this Pelita VI ,in which local
goverment of Bali and the community have conducted development in all aspect,
including supporting matters such as infrastructure development, environmental quality
improvement.
In this case, one of the programs is urban development. Pemda Tk I and Pemda Tk 11 try
to complate the urban infrastructure without forgetting rural area which is the source of
urban area in Bali Province.
The program meant is the integrated urban infrastructure development program and the
Indonesian term is P3KT. The result of this on-going program is that Bali Province
succeeds to get Adipura, the award for cleanliness. This P3KT will be continually
conducted with its specific characteristic, that is BUIP.
The difference between P3KT and BUIP is that BUIP is a physical infrastructure
development program, which is also trying to explain matters related to cultural and
environmental aspects. BUIP program is planned to be implemented in all kabupaten and
kodya in Bali Province. There are 32 towns where the BUIP can be implemented. And
other 21 towns are being further studied.
The physical infrastructures that will be developed through BUIP Program, among others:
-    Water Supply
-    Urban Roads
-    Human Waste Sanitation
-    Solid Waste Management
-    MIIP
-     KIP
-     Urban Drainage & Flood Control
-    Traffic and Transport Management
-    New Markets
-    Bus Terminals and Parking Lots
By the existance of BUIP, it is intended that the PAD will increase. And private donators
are indeed expected to participate in realizing the intention. The funding sources for this
BUIP are:
--    World Bank
-    APBN
-    APBD Tk.1

-     National Repelita: Bali Regional development
-     RTRWP Tk.l: Local Decree No.4/1996
-     RTRWP Tk.ll
Its aims are among others:
-     preparing the description of Bali environment condition
-     arranging guideline based on terms of reference either from  Central
Government or World Bank
-     giving information to the community about the importance of BUIP
-     preparing AMDAL instruments
-     creating community participation process.
S;cope of BUIP AMDAL Study
tBUIP covers 10 sectors, as stated above. There are 32 selected target towns in Bali
Fprovince that have significant impact. 19 out of these towns will receive a full approach,
vvith potential projects in all sub-sectors to be implemented. Others will receive a limited
approach consisting of upgrading of tourism infrastructure or water supply only.
Besides those 32 selected towns, other 12 towns where the project can be implemented
are still being studied.
All projects funded by World Bank in Bali Province need AMDAL study, but be
application is not for all projects as those projects must be screened based on the
siignificance of impacts, and the selection of screening category accordingly, depend on
tlhe type and scale of the projects, the location and sensitivity of environmental issues, and
the nature and magnitude of potential impacts. When making a screening decision, each
of these criteria should be taken into account.
Based on Law No. 4/1982 regarding Basic Provisions for the Management of the Living
Environment, Government Regulation No. 51/1993 and the Decree of the Minister of
sitate for the environment of the 19 March 1994 deal with the process of environmental
assessment (AMDAL), the environmental attitude toward development in Bali is also
inspired by traditional philosophy among others:
-     Tri Hita Karana
-     Tri Mandala
-     Bhisama.
