The Bali Urban\n            Infrastructure Project also had a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome but its institutional development impact is\n            substantial. The Municipal Innovations Project had a\n            satisfactory outcome with modest institutional development\n            impact. All three projects have unlikely sustainability. The\n            performances of the Bank and the Borrower for all three\n            projects were satisfactory.  Experience with the three\n            projects suggests the following lessons: 1) Local\n            governments should continue to build upon their demonstrated\n            capacity to improve infrastructure delivery, but need to be\n            more responsive to urban development needs expressed through\n            local community participation. 2) A cross-sector framework,\n            such as the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development\n            Program (IUIDP), can work well for local governments,\n            provided the investment resources within it are sufficiently\n            concentrated to adequately address needs in all included\n            sectors. 3) All stakeholders, including local governments\n            themselves, need to agree and clearly understand the purpose\n            behind local innovations - be it to increase efficiency, to\n            increase client-responsiveness. 4) The Bank should ensure\n            that local governments are always included as partners, as\n            it continues to emphasize improving their performance in\n            service delivery. 5) Monitoring and Evaluation systems need\n            to be designed and implemented to track outcomes related to\n            project objectives, as well as the inputs and outputs of\n            project activities that will help achieve these outcomes."}, "docdt": "2006-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
