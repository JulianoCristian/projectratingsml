Umbrella Environmental Assessment                       Environmental Sector
1    Introduction
To achieve the goals of Indonesia's sixth Five Year National Development
Plan, 'Repelita VI', the Government of Indonesia a.o. intends to prepare
Spatial Plans and to improve the Environment as well as the Infrastructure.
The current 'Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)', to be implemented
by the Provincial Government of Bali, is to support these objectives in Bali
through investment in mainly traditional infrastructure, in combination with
strengthening the capacity for Environmental Management of infrastructure
projects at both provincial and local levels, in order to achieve sustainable
development. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
IBRD (World Bank) is the financing agency of this program.
The project has been classified as 'category A', requiring an Environmental
Assessment, according to IBRD's Operational Directive 4.01. This EA report
may be referred to as a Regional I Sectoral EA for BUIP since it deals with
the region of Bali Province and with the sector of Urban Infrastructure. It
may also be referred to as an 'Umbrella' EA, or UEA, since it addresses the
generic environmental consequences of BUIP, consisting of a great number
of mainly small sub-projects. Additionally, it presents screening guidelines to
identify the individual BUIP sub-projects that need further Environmental
Assessment before implementation.
This UEA covers the requirements for EA set forth by the Terms of Refer-
ence (TOR) of BAPPEDA Tk 1 and the KA-AMDAL approved by the
Govemor of Bali.
Some individual sub-projects under BUIP, according to Indonesian legisla-
tion. will be subject to the formal Environmental Impact Assessment process
(AMDAL). Therefore, the methods used in describing the environment and
in screening sub-projects for individual EA, follow the requirements for
environmental impact assessment under Indonesian Law. Additionally, IBRD
requirements per OD 4.01 are taken into account. Projects which fall into
this category will not be programmed for the first two years of BUIP, to
allow for sufficient time to undertake necessary studies and prepare the
required documents (K-ANDAL, ANDAL, RKL, RPL).
The objectives of this EA are to identify or define:
generic and significant impacts of BUIP projects;
environmental issues, opportunities and constraints;
assign BUIP projects to different categories of environmental man-
agement approach, possibly including further EA;

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                       Environmental Sector
based on the holiness level in Hinduism and 'Bosomy', determining the holi-
ness of certain areas.
Based on Law No.4 of 1982 regarding Basic Provisions for the Management
of the Living Environment, Government Reguiation No.51 of 1993 and the
Decree of the Minister of State for the Environment of 19 March 1994 deal
with the process of Environmental Assessment (AMDAL). The legislation
contains a list of activities with criteria for size, and a list of protected areas,
for which situations an EA report (ANDAL) is required and shall be reviewed
and accepted by the Central or Provincial AMDAL-Commission, before a
permit or license, allowing implementation of the activity, can be granted.
The Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP) itself does not belong to the
categories of activities mentioned in the above mentioned legislation.
However, there may be individual projects that meet the criteria which make
it necessary for these individual projects to follow the AMDAL procedure. In
addition, the IBRD may require detailed EA for individual projects, after
screening the projects against their OD 4.01 criteria, or against generic
criteria for Bali developed for BUIP.
On the level of individual project implementation, provincial spatial policy
plans and environmental (mainly water) quality standards have to be met.
Diagram II presents the process of Environmental Assessment. All levels of
assessment will result in stipulating measures for environmental manage-
ment (RKURPL, UKUUPL or SOP) to be included in tender documents and
construction contracts.
3    The Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)
The BUIP consists of an investment program in the sector of traditional
Integrated Urban Infrastructure Programming (IUIDP), dealing with projects
of urban physical infrastructure and services, in the sub-sectors of Water
Supply, Urban Roads, Human Waste Water Sanitation, Solid Waste Man-
agement, Market Infrastructure Improvement, Village Improvement and
Urban Drainage and Flood Control. Additional sub-sectors for BUIP are
.Traffic and Transport Management, New  Markets, Bus Terminals and
Parking Lots. The projects comprise new developments (eg. new Final Solid
Waste Disposal Sites), relocation, expansion (eg. Road Widening) or
maintenance (eg. Road Overlay).
Needs and wishes for new or improved infrastructure and necessities for
maintenance of existing infrastructure were inventoried for all districts and a
Real Demand Survey (RDS) was conducted for the sub-sectors Water

SuDply, Human Waste Water Sanitation and Solid Waste Management. By
screening this inventory for technical. economic and environmental feasibil-
ity. a selected number of projects are proposed for implementation during
the five year period under BUIP.
Projects will be implemented in 32 Towns in all 9 Districts of Bali (see map
1). Table 1 presents a summary of BUIP projects for each district
(Kotamadya and Kabupaten).
4    The Environment of Bali, Challenges, Constraints, and Opportunities
4.1   Environmental Conditions
Bali province consists of a number of islets. Bali island is the main one, and
its islets are Pulau Nusa Penida, Pulau Nusa Ceningan, Pulau Nusa
Lembongan, and Pulau Menjangan. The width of Bali as a whole is
5.632.86 km or 0.29% of the width of Indonesian archipelago. The number
of Balis population is 2,777,356 with population density of 493 persons/km2.
West of Bali is the province of East Java confined by Bali strait east of
Bali is Lombok island confined by Lombok strait. While north of Bali is Java
sea and south of it is Indonesian ocean.
Geographically, Bali is located in between 80 - 0,3' - 40" - 80 - 50' - 48"
South Latitude and 1140 - 25' - 53" - 1150 - 42' - 40" East Longitude.
Geologically, the soil consists of kwarter rock, beneath kwarter, pliosin, and
miosin. In terms of relief and topography. in the middle of the island, there
are mountains spreading over from west to east. Among them there are two
active volcanoes, namely Gunung Batur (of 1,171 m high), and Gunung
Agung (of 3,140 m high). The other mountains are Gunung Merebuk (of
1,386 m high), Gunung Patas (of 1,414 m high), and Gunung Seraya (of
1.174 m high). The existence of such mountain range geographically
causes the island spilt up into two unbalanced devisions. The are:
-    Northern Bali with a long narrow and less flat mainland.
-    Southern Bali with a wide and flat mainland.
In addition, Bali has 4 (four) lakes, namely Danau Beratan, Danau Buyan,
Danau Tamblingan and Danau Batur. Bali has tropical sea climate
influenced by seasonal wind. It also has dry and wet seasons between
which is the transisition periode.
The weather is influenced by the place hight. The average weather in Bali
of 280 - 30°C. The mainland in the southern part is wider than that in the

northern part. Such natural condition has great influence toward the climate
in Bali. Generally, in the southern Bali the rain fall is much more than that in
the northern Bali in December up to February. The wind blows from west
and south west, while in August it blows from east and south east.
In March up to May, the wind blows from different directions. The humidity
in Bali is 90% , in the wet season it may reach 100%, while in the dry
season it reaches 60%.
In terms of soil types in Bali, it is dominated by Regusol and Latosol types.
Only a small amount is of Alluvial, Mediteran and Andasol soil. The Latosol
type that is very sensitive to erosion can be found in the western areas
such as Kalopaksa, Petemon, Rengdikit and Pempatan. It can also be
found in the areas of Gunung Penyu, Gunung Pintu, Gunung Juwet and
Gunung Seraya, which cover of 44.9% of the island width.
The erosional sensitive Regusol soil can be found in the eastem part of
Amlapura and Culik. This type of soil can be also found along Singaraja
coastal areas untill Seririt, Bubunan, Kekeran, around Danau Tamblingan,
Buyan and Beratan areas, around Batukaru forest, in small parts of
southern coast of Kusamba, Sanur, Benoa and Kuta. This covers of 33.93%
of the island width.
Andasol is also sensitive to erosion and can be found around Baturiti, Candi
Kuning, Banyuatis, Gobleg, Pupuan and a part of Batukaru forest. The
Mediteran soil which is less sensitive to erosion and can be found in the
mainland of Negara, Sumber Kelampok, Manggis and Angan Telu. The last
three types of soil cover of about 15.49% of the island width.
The forests that have functions as spring protector, erosion and flood
prevention or function as hidrology are speading over the middle areas of
the island from west to east.
Most rivers that come from the forests flow to the southern mainland
compared to those flowing to the northern one. As an agricultural area,
most people work in the agricultural sector, and therefore, rivers play an
important role as water souces for irrigation.
Looking at it from the land use in 1994, it shows that 9.60% of the land is
used for settiement; 19.35% for rice field; 22.54% are in the forms of forest;
25.36% for plantation; 8.51% of it is critical land; lakes take 0.46% and
14.15% are for other uses.
If it is seen from its socio-economy, the location of Bali island is very

One of the striking environmental characteristic in Bali is the existence of so
many bodies of water and rivers that this environmental characteristics look
very dense. The implication of the environmental characteristics toward the
development plan must be use as the evaluation basis for project site area
determination.
4.2   Challenges
In analyzing the environment in Bali, there are a number of challenges in
its management. Those challenges are among others;
1.    Natural resources
*     The limited natural resources
*     Sustainable development and increasing needs in line with the
population growth.
2.   Advance of Technology
*     The increase of industry cause the increase of population

6.    Possibilities for Avoidance and Mitigation
To avoid environmental damage, it is necessary to apply integral design, by
incorporating environmental expertise in the design teams to stimulate
creative design from an environmental point of view, and for formulating and
evaluating altemative solutions. If environmental damage is not prevented
by design, in most cases it can only be partly mitigated. As the expression
says: One ounce of prevention is worth one pound of cure! As a conse-
quence, some activities may not be acceptable in a sensitive or vulnerable
environment.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                      Environmental Sector
For UKL IUPL, prepared if no ANDAL is required, the Minister for the
Environment also provides General Guidelines. Additionally, technical
Guidelines can be set by the responsible Government Agency. UKL and
UPL need to be approved by this same agency, before a permit can be
granted.
There will be many BUIP sub-projects that, given Location and Size, do not
require ANDAL, nor UKL / UPL. For these projects Standard Operation
Procedures (SOP) have to be written. The SOP will be an indispensable
part of the Construction Contract. Technical Guidelines of PU are one of the
sources for SOP. (See Diagram II).
The objective of TOR for ANDAL / RKL I RPL is to establish scope and
depth of the study and to focus on themes that are of main or particular
interest, It is the aim of this UEA to provide generic information that can be
incorporated in individual EAs under this 'umbrella'.
Topics that should be covered in all ANDALs are:
Description and motivation of the project;
Description and evaluation of releva-nt aspects of the present environ-
ment and autonomous developments;
Assessment and evaluation of environmental impact and affected
interests;
-    Mitigative measures incorporated in the project;
-    Alternatives for the project, proposed site and mitigation;
-    Comparison of alternatives, including 'Go I No-Go criteria;
-    Legal framework;
-    Environmental management and monitoring provisions; and
-    Making a summary accessible to the public.
For BUIP sub-sectors specific areas of attention, to be elaborated on in the
TOR for ANDAL (KA-ANDAL) are indicated.
9.   Public Consultation
Early in 1996 consultation of the public on BUiP was conducted at the level
of Bali Province, Districts and Towns. Participants were invited by provincial
and local authorities; NGO's were invited only at the level of districts and
towns.
The main conclusions are;
-     Meetings with the public should be better prepared, the public felt

knowledge about Balinese culture; and
Results of this AMDAL and any subproject AMDALs should be placed
in the public libraries in such a way that the community can read
them and participate if necessary.
NGO'S will be invited (as non-permanent members) by the provincial
AMDAL-Commission to participate in the review of AMDAL'S for those
projects that either meet the legal requirements for AMDAL or require an
EA according to iBRD criteria.
10.  Institutional Capacities
The provincial government, via Bappeda Tk I, is responsible for Environ-
mental Management as part of their regional planning and development
function. The organizational framework for execution of the environmental
component of this task (Biro Bina Lingkungan Hidup, BBLH) is slowly
developing.
Fragmentation between different environmental agencies complicates
effective operation. There is also lack of environmentally qualified person-
nel.
The final engineering consultant and the Project Management Office of
Bappeda-l should assist Dati-ll staff, by preparing the ANDAL for those
BUIP sub-projects that require full environmental assessment (AMDAL),
using this Umbrella Environmental Assessment and annexes as a reference
source and data base. In addition, they should assist Dati-ll in preparing
standard clauses for environmental management and monitoring measures
to be incorporated in all tender documents and construction contracts.
Review of the AMDAL documents (KA-ANDAL, ANDAL) is the responsibility
of the Provincial AMDAL-Commission. Review of RKLURPL and UKLUUPL is
the responsibility of structural units of Provincial Government. It should be
coordinated by Bappeda, section SLH. BLH will participate in all reviews
and the cognizant technical Dinas would be involved according the sub-
project. The review should include screening of proposed project sites,
especially for Final Solid Waste Disposal Sites, to ascertain that they are
not located in protected or sensitive areas. Approval of the RKLURPL or
UKL/UPL is a condition for sub-project approval.
RKLJRPL and UKUUPL implementation depend heavily on training of field
supervisors (PIMPRO's), incorporating environmental management and
monitoring measures into tender documents and construction contracts.
Final engineering design consultants and Bappeda-l and 11 should insure

that the documents include these items as specfic conditions of- the con-
tract. Standard Operation Procedures (SOP), shall be developed by
BAPPEDA-1 for these types of sub-projects.
Dati-l personnel need training in UKlIUPL regulations and preparation
procedures, as well as in environmental issues relevant for irifrastructure
projects, so they can provide a prompt and informed review of UJKUUPL
documents and advise Dati-ll personnel as needed.
Dati-ll personnel will require training in relevant environmental'issues and
regulations, UKLJUPL preparation, incorporating environmental management
and monitoring requirements in tender documents and construction con-
tracts, as well as methods for supervising UKLJUPL implementat on.
After the above training is completed, Datl-I and Dati-li personnel should
participate together in a one day workshop to review the training, share
views on how UK1IJPL can best be prepared and implemented. As a result
of this workshop They should agree on working arrangements for prepara-
tion, review, implementation, monitoring and reporting.
To ensure that the program meets the real training needs, a training pro-
gram should be developed. The TOR for development of this training
program is presented.

PREFACE
At the present time, Pemda Tk. I together with 9 Pemda Tk. lis of Bali Province are
implementing BUIP, and in Bali Province it is more well-knows as EJBUDP (East Java Bali
Urban Development Program). This program is one of the joint programs between East Java
Province and Bali Province which financial sources is from IBRD World Bank through its Loan
No. 3304-IND.
BUIP consists of physical infrastructure investment as well as Operation and
Maintenance with seven sub-sectors of Public Work, among others: waste/sanitation, waste
management, drainage, urban roads, KIP and MIIP as well as other important components such
as Regional Revenue increase, Regional Institutional Improvement and Capacity Analysis and
Regional Financial Plan. This program lasts for 5 years, and at the present time it enters the
last year of the program implementation.
At the present time, Pemda Tk. I together with 9 Pemda Tk. lis of Bali Province are
planning to arrange the second five years urban program with help from the central
government, in order to continue the urban program that have been done well enough, before.
That program is more well-knows as BUIP Preparation or Mid Term Planning of 'Bali Urban
Infrastructure Program".
Andal study is inseparable part o' BUIP Mid Term Planning Preparation, thus the
reference framework of BUIP Andal is a part reference framework of BUIP Mid Term Planning
Preparation.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
Under 'Repelita VI', the current Indonesian Five Year National Develop
Plan, the urban development strategy of the Government Of Indonesia (
for Bali Province envisages an annual economic growth of about 60/c
achieve this, the Government of Indonesia intends to focus on:
preparation of spatial plans, including land use plans for the pro%
as a whole, as well as for individual urban centres;
improvement of environmental quality, and protection of watersl
and coastal areas;
improvement of infrastructure, especially of:
supply of clean water,
improved sewerage,
solid waste management
drainage
roads
traffic management
enhancing the capacity of local governments in urban developn
management
The current Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP), to be implementec
Bappeda Bali, the Regional Development Planning Agency of the Provin
Government of Bali, is intended to support the governments developrr
objectives in Bali, through a program of investment in traditional Integra
Urban Infrastructure Development Projects (IUIDP) under responsibility of
central Ministry of Public Works (PU), combined with programs to strengtl
the capacity for environmental management of infrastructure projects
provincial and district levels.
Urban development creates the need for urban management, which may
defined as the continuous activity of mobilizing and applying divers resourc
in a coordinated manner to plan, program, build, operate, maintain E
safeguard public services and the environment in order to achieve
sustainable development objectives of the government.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental
This Environmental Assessment (EA) report for the Bali Urban Infrastn
Program (BUIP) covers the environmental assessment requirements E
forth in Operational Procedure OD 4.01 of the International Bar
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (World Bank), being the fina
agency for the program. The project has been classified as 'cat 
A',requiring an Environmental Assessment, according to IBRD's Opera
Directive 4.01. It aims at a general characterization of the environment i
and identification of problem areas generic for BUIP type of projects ir
environment, policy framework, gaps in information and how to address -
means of integrating policies and institutional development. In a sen
serves as an 'Umbrella: covering the Bali environment and the BUIP p
as a whole. On the other hand it presents a methodology for identificati
individual sub-projects that at their specific site may cause significant irr
In this sense this EA serves as a sieve, catching the sub-projects thE
need further site specific Environmental Assessment.
At this preparatory, programming phase of the -BUIP, there is no
requirement for environmental assessment based on Indonesian Law. 1
may however well be individual projects that will be subject to GOI Regul
Number 51 of 1993 pertaining to Environmental Impact Assessment, b
those project are allowed to be implemented. Therefore, the methods use
description of the environment and for screening projects for indiv
environmental assessment, will as closely as possible follow the requiren
for environmental assessment reports under Indonesian law (ANDAL).
1.2   Objectives of this Environmental Assessment
The objectives of this environmental assessment for the overall BUIP pr
are (see also Diagram 1):
to identify the potential generic and significant impact of the propc
activities under BUIP, and to identify environmental issues, oppor
ities and constraints for the types of activities under the prc
(Chapter 4);
to estimate the magnitude and evaluate the importance of the sic
cant impacts, based on current implementation practices, in orde
screen the proposed projects under BUIP and assign them
categories with different environment management approaches, w
may involve further environmental assessment of individual E
projects (Chapter 7);

-    to define the required environmental management capacity for the
implementation of BUIP, providing an overview of the required institu-
tional capacity for the environmental management of BUIP during the
implementation phase, and propose strengthening of institutional
capacities where required (Chapter 10);
-    to identify environmental policies at provincial and district levels,
relevant for prevention and mitigation of potential impact of BUIP,
including requirement for application of best practicable or best
available practice, of generic mitigation plans and/or of Standard Oper-
ation Procedures (SOP) (Chapters 5 & 6);
-    to design and assist in administering the public participation process, in
order to stimulate public awareness and improve the attitude towards
protection of the quality of the environment (Chapter 9).
-    to develop Bali-specific screening guidelines, based on national and
IBRD guidelines;
-    to prepare TOR's for required EIS (Andal, RKLIRPL and UKL/UPL) for
the proposed BUIP projects (Chapter 8);
-    to provide information to the community to enable them to benefit from
positive impacts and avoid negative impacts of the proposed BUIP
project (Chapter 9);
1.3   Area of Study
The study area of the BUIP Regional / Sectoral Environmental Assessment
includes the whole of Bali Province. However, attention was concentrated on
areas of potential impacts. By nature of BUIP, most of the significant impacts
are expected to be limited to predominantly urban areas, that is mainly the
administrative area of the towns covered by BUIP - and areas 'downstream' of
them.
Under the Preparation Phase I, 32 selected towns will be considered, an
additional 19 in Preparation Phase II. Most of these towns will receive a full
approach, with potential projects in all sub-sectors to be implemented, others
will receive a limited approach, consisting of upgrading of tourism
infrastructure or water supply only.
Both full approach and limited approach towns are covered by the study area.
If certain activities will have a possible impact, reaching beyond the admin-
istrative boundary of the selected towns (this could be ecological or social),

these areas were also considered as part of the BUIP Environmental
Assessment study area.
1.4   Data Collection and Analysis
This assessment is based mainly on existing information sources. The base
line data of the regional environment (the so-called Bali Environmental
Profile) was prepared following an overview of components as presented in
Indonesian Environmental Guidelines and IBRD's OD 4.01, with particular
reference to urban centres and surrounding areas.
The information on the existing situation was then further analyzed evaluating
the relevant characteristics, functions and uses of the project area, This
resulted in a zoning of the project area with respect to general sensitivity of
specific areas for the kind of activities proposed under this urban infrastruc-
ture program, and thus with respect to the environmental acceptability of that
activity.
1.5   Prediction of Significant Impacts
The potential impacts, typical for each category of projects are described at a
non site specific level. These descriptions and indications in this phase of the
project can only be of a qualitative nature, based on professional judgement.
Within the given time frame it was not possible and not practical to predict the
impacts of all - possibly hundreds of - individual projects to a detailed
quantitative level in this Environmental Assessment. However, the projects,
which in the implementation phase require such detailed Environmental
Assessment, for instance location specific Andal, were identified in the
screening process. Such detailed environmental assessments for specific
projects will be executed in the Implementation Phase of the BUIP.
Thus, a specific approach for Environmental Assessment of the Bali Urban
Infrastructure Program was adopted. This approach consisted of the following
steps:
Characterization of relevant environmental zones in Bali, such as for
example 'urban areas', 'nature reserves', etcetera;
Assessment of impacts typical for each category of projects in each of
the environmental zones. The prediction of impacts resulted in a gen-
eral description of impacts for each of the categories of projects pro-
posed under BUIP.

1.6   Regional Environmental Analysis
The information on the existing environmental situation was analyzed to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the region with respect to the
general suitability for the kind of activities proposed under BUIP. This resulted
in a zoning of Bali with respect to environmental opportunities and
constraints.
Detailed evaluations were focused on urban areas (towns and surroundings
which are included under BUIP); other areas were evaluated in less detail.
The resulting zoning map, representing environmental characteristics,
environmental functions and categories of land use, may well be a useful
contribution to the Provincial (in Bappeda) spatial and physical policy planning
for Bali Province.
1.7   Structure of This Report
This report may be referred to as a Regional/Sectoral Environmental
Assessment report, 'regional' because it covers the well defined region of Bali
Province, 'sectoral' because it deals with all the projects in the (various)
sector(s) of Urban Infrastructure. It may also be regarded as an 'umbrella'
EA (UEA), since it deals with generic environmental consequences of a great
number of mainly small projects, and does not address the impact of
individual projects. This (sectoral / regional / umbrella) Environmental
Assessment will be used as a reference for more detailed Andal reports.
Chapter 2   Discussed the existing national and regional environmental pol-
icies and rules aiming at prevention or mitigation of significant
impact.
Chapter 3   The Bali Urban Infrastructure Program  (BUIP) is described
briefly, to the extent as necessary to form a professional judge-
ment of the potential environmental consequences typical of the
categories of projects under BUIP.
Chapter 4   The natural and cultural environment of Bali, as well as environ
mental issues and constraints are characterized, based on the
Bali Environmental Profile baseline study of Annex I.
Chapter 5   Discussed  on  existing  impacts  and  developments that
havealready been decided upon. the environmental interests,
potentially affected by the BUI projects are analyzed, in view of

their individual location in an environment with specific values
and sensitivity to impact.
Chapter 6   Discussed the possibilities for prevention and mitigation for
categories of BUIP-projects are assessed.
Chapter 7   Provides tools for screening of all BUIP projects individually,
resulting in possible recommendations for Standard Operation
Procedures (SOP).
Chapter 8   Provides Terms Of Reference (TOR) for preparation of full Envi
ronmental Impact Statements (Andal, including RKL / RPL) as
may be necessary.TOR for Andal and UKL / UPL will be framed
to meet the requirements of indonesian environmental legis-
lation and IBRD's OD 4.01.
Chapter 9   Discussed the way participation of the public before decision
making can be stimulated and effected.
Chapter 10  Discussed and assessed the current institutional capacity for
environmental management, especially for the BUIP projects.
Diagram I gives an overview of the various chapters of this
report and how they are interrelated.
Chapter 11  Summarizes  the  results  of this  study  and  presents
recommendations for ensuring  that negative (cumulative)
impacts are minimized, and that the necessary institutional
framework and skills are available to achieve effective
environmental management during implementation.
The Bali Environmental Profile, the TOR for ANDAL and the information on
Institutional Capacity relevant for environmental management will be provided
in Annexes 11, IV and V respectively. Annex VI is the report on Public
Consultation, conducted during preparation.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND LEGISLATION,
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL
2.1   Policies in Indonesia for Environmental Management
in accordance with the Broad Outlines of the Nations Direction (GBHN), the
main objective of environmental management is sustained and environmental
oriented development, in accordance with resettlement and housing develop-
ment policy. This National Environmental Policy can briefly be summarized as
follows:
General Policy:
-    optimize the use of existing basic infrastructure and facilities;
-    consolidate operation and maintenance of basic infrastructure and
facilities;
-    increase development effectiveness of basic infrastructure and
facilities;
-    expansion of basic infrastructure and facilities shall support the
national development and stability;
-    increase the ability of human resources;
-    improve the development pattern and comprehensive and integrated
resources management
Resettlement and Housing Sectors Policy:
-    increase of achieved resettlement and housing development
-    sustained and environmentally oriented development implementation
-    stimulate participation of the public and of the private sector
-    development of planning systems
-    consolidate institutions and improve management abilities
-    develop legislation and maintenance instrumentation
Urban and Regional Policy
-    increase productivity and urban financial strength
-    improve the quality of the urban physical and socio-economical
environment
-    improve urban management institutions and maintenance instruments
-    consolidate urban system and improve management
-    increase productivity and work quality in regional area
-    develop infrastructure and facilities in regional area
-    integrate area development and regional society institutions

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
Important issues that need attentions are:
-    development must be based on spatial planning
-    development must take into account environmental opportunities and
constraints
-    environmental assessment (ANDAL) is required for implementation of
activities likely to cause significant impact
-    efforts should be made for rehabilitation after implementation of
projects
-    awareness and participation of society in reaching decisions should be
developed
The environmental attitude towards development in Bali is inspired by tradi-
tional philosophy:
'Tri Hita Karana': each development should maintain the harmonious
relations between human and the Gods, humans and humans and
between humans and their environment.
'Tri MandaLa': spatial concept, sites and direction based on the holi-
ness level in Hinduism that consists of 'Utama Mandala', having the
highest 'privacy and holiness', 'Madya Mandala' having the
characteristic of 'semi-public' and 'Nista Mandala, having the
characteristic of 'public'.
- Bhisamaf: space holiness determination, based on community agree-
ment.
2.2   Legislation for Environmental Assessment
In Indonesia, care of the government for the preservation of environmental
qualities dates back to 1982, when Law no.4 regarding Basic Provisions for
the Management of the Living Environment was published in the State
Gazette.
To date, the prevailing legislation pertaining to Environmental Impact
Assessment in Indonesia is stipulated in Government Regulation of the
Republic of Indonesia Number 51 of 1993, and the Decree of the Minister of
State for the Environment, KEP-11/MENLH/3/1994, of 19 March 1994,
concerning the Types of Businesses or Activities required to prepare an
Environmental Impact Assessment. This decree contains a list. of businesses
or activities for which an EA or 'Andal' is required if the business or activity
exceeds a given magnitude, or is located in or borders on a listed protected
area.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
In the present preparatory phase of BUIP, the above mentioned legislation
does not yet require a formal Environmental Assessment, since the individual
projects have not yet been selected and fully designed. However, some of the
larger individual projects under BUIP, will possibly meet the criteria for
ANDAL, e.g intake of water for water supply, construction of new roads and
widening of existing roads, sewage treatment facilities, garbage disposal
facilities, new urban development and new or relocated markets, bus
terminals or parking lots. Also projects in or bordering on protected areas, like
water catchment areas, cultural reserve areas and coastal zones, may require
an Andal.
For those projects requiring an Andal, an Environmental Management Plan
(RKL) and an Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL) have to be made, before
the project can be implemented. The Andal will be evaluated by the provincial
AMDAL-Commission, the RKL and RPL will be evaluated by the competent
authority. It has been decided by the Central AMDAL-Commission, that
review of this BUIP Umbrella Environmental Assessment and possible
ANDALs for individual BUIP projects, will be under the responsibility of Bali
Province Bappeda Tkl (ref. Annex VIl).
BUIP projects possibly needing Andal or other further environmental
assessment resulting from the BUIP screening process, will not be imple-
mented in the first two years of the BUIP, to allow ample time to prepare and
review the required documents. Most other BUIP projects may require an
Environmental Management Plan and an Environmental Monitoring Plan
(UKL / UPL) according to the Procedure for Implementation of UKL / UPL
issued in August 1995 by the Central AMDAL-Commission of the Ministry of
Public Works (PU), or need to adopt generic Standard Operating Procedures,
to be prepared during the detailed engineering phase of BUIP (Chapter 7)
and to be included in the tender documents and project specifications for con-
tractors.

2.4   Conclusion
In Indonesia, Environmental Management policies and legislation are well
developed on the National level. On the Provincial level, Bali-specific
legislation and standards stiil need be developed.  Full effort should be
devoted to make existing legislation more effective. The EA process can
contribute to this, by scoping and focussing on the important issues and by
proposing effective environmental management and monitoring provisions.
Competent authorities can be more stringent in including requirements in
permits and licences, and enforce living up to these conditions.

CHAPTER 3
THE BALI URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM
3.1  Introduction
Under the current five year development plan, Repelita VI, the Government of
Indonesia's development strategy covers a.o. economic growth with equity,
poverty alleviation, environmental sustainability and enhancement of cultural
diversity. Under Repelita VI the Balinese economy is expected to grow by 6.9
% annually. BUIP is intended to support these national development
strategies in Bali.
The primary objective of BUIP is to promote sustainable urban and regional
development in Bali Province. This is to be accomplished through a program
of IUIDP-Plus investments that ameliorate degraded conditions in the urban
environment as well as provide additional infrastructure to advance the
objectives of the provincial strategic structure plan in a manner consistent
with the opportunities and constraints of Bali's natural and cultural resources.
For this purpose the traditional Integrated Urban Infrastructure Program
(IUIDP) will be expanded to IUIDP-Plus and be supported by innovative
components to suit the present development conditions in Bali.
IUJDP consists of an investment program of urban physical infrastructure and
services, local revenue improvement and related institutional development.
Traditional IUIDP physical investment sectors include: roads, drainage, water
supply, human waste water and solid waste management, kampung improve-
ment, and market environment improvement. Additional sectors in BUIP
include: traffic and transport management, development of bus terminals, new
markets and parking lots.
Supporting components and special features of BUIP include:
-    Special emphasis for infrastructure and services projects that improve
the natural and cultural environment. A regional urban environmental
profile as provided in chapter 3 and Annex 11 is to support this; it could
be developed - together with other components - into an outline for a
Bali Environmental Program.
'Beyond single city' regional consideration of infrastructure develop-
ment, particularly for the sectors 'solid waste' and 'human waste'
management', 'water supply' and 'inter-city transportation'.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
-    A program to preserve Bali's cultural heritage.
-    Community consultation in project preparation and implementation.
-    Community education related to the preservation of the natural and
cultural environment.
-    An evaluation of public private partnership options for infrastructure
and services development.
BUIP will be implemented through a great number of physical urban
infrastructure and services projects in 53 larger and smaller cities and
settlements throughout Bali during the five years FY (Fiscal Year) 1997/1998
- 2001/2002.
3.2   The Sub-sectors under BUIP
The projects proposed for BUIP are in seven traditional IUIDP sub-sectors of
urban infrastructure:
-    Water Supply (WS)
-     Urban Roads (UR)
-     Human Waste Water Sanitation (HWWS)
-     Solid Waste Management (SWM)
-     Market Infrastructure Improvement (MIIP)
-    Village (Kampung) Improvement (KIP)
-     Urban Drainage and Flood Control (UD & FC)
and in three additional sub-sectors:
Traffic and Transport Management (TTM)
-    New Markets (NM)
-     Bus Terminals and Parking Lots (BT) & (PL)
As a consequence of their nature, the greater part of the proposed projects
will be located in areas predominantly urban.
Under each of the sub-sectors, different types of projects are considered, as
listed below:
3.3   BUIP Types of Physical Projects:
Traditional IUIDP:
Water Supply
-     Raw Water (intake, & storage)
-    Transmission / Distribution

In the identification phase of the project, an island-wide inventorization was
performed in all districts of the need and wishes for new or improved urban
infrastructure in the above 10 categories, and of necessity of maintenance of
existing infrastructure. Also, for the sub-sectors 'Water Supply', Solid Waste
Management' and 'Human Waste Water Sanitation', a Real Demand Survey
(RDS) was performed to quantify the need and willingness to pay for of the
public in these sub-sectors. Both investigations resulted in what is referred to
as the 'long list' for BUIP sub-projects.
In the subsequent screening phase, based mainly on judgement of financial,
economic, environmental and technical feasibility, the long list was con-
densed to a 'short list' of feasible sub-projects proposed for implementation
during the five year period under this BUIP.
One of the considerations during the screening process from long to short list
was the selection of towns that would have a full approach, taking all of the
10 sub-sectors into account, and towns receiving a limited approach, covering
only some of the sub-sectors, depending on specific needs (e.g. water
supply) or where infrastructure investments are to facilitate a certain goal
(such as development of tourism).
A full approach was adopted for 19 towns: including all regional capitals,
strategic towns, and towns of substantial size. A limited approach was
adopted for 13 smaller towns as shown in Table 3.3.

Unbrella Environmental Assessement                        Environmental Sector
For each of these 32 towns, several sub-sectors may be involved, a sub-
sector may encompass several, different types of projects.
By presenting all of the Types of Projects in a table, with Kabupaten and
Towns as columns and the Sub-sectors and Types of Projects as rows, each
cell containing the total size of that particular type of project for each
particular town, a complete overview of all BUIP short list projects is obtained.
This overview shows the total size for all projects of the same type in each
Town and each Kabupaten. These tables are presented in Annex MIl.
The environmental implications of this short list are assessed in chapter 4 of
this report. For projects on the short list possibly requiring a full individual
environmental assessment (Andal), implementation will occur after the
second year, allowing sufficient time to comply with the Indonesian AMDAL
and IBRD's OD 4.01 Requirements.
3.4   Summary
Table 3.4 summarizes the totals for each type of project as proposed for each
of the 9 districts of Bali. Annex 111 provides details for individual towns.

CHAPTER 4
THE NATURAL & CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT OF BALI AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS
4.1.  Environment Condition
Bali province consists of a number of islets. Bali island is the main one, and
its islets are Pulau Nusa Penida, Pulau Nusa Ceningan, Pulau Nusa
Lembongan, Pulau Serangan and Pulau Menjangan. The width of Bali as a
whole is 5,632.86 Km2 or 0.29% of the width of Indonesian archipelago. The
number of Bali's population is 2,777,356 with population density of 493
persons/Km2.
West of Bali is the province of East Java confined by Bali strait; east of Bali is
Lombok island confined by Lombok strait. While north of Bali is Java sea and
south of it is Indonesian ocean.
Geographically, Bali is located in between 80 - 0,3'-40" - 8° -50' - 48" South
Latitude and 114° - 25'-53" - 115° - 42'-40" East Longitude. Geologically, the
soil consists of kwarter rock, beneath kwarter, pliosin, and miosin. In terms of
relief and topography, in the middle of the island, there are mountains
spreading over from west to east. Among them there are two active
volcanoes, namely Gunung Batur (of 1,171m high) and Gunung Agung (of
3,140 m high). The other mountains are Gunung Merebuk (of 1,386 m high),
Gunung Patas (of 1,414 m high), and Gunung Seraya (of 1,174 m high). The
existence of such mountain range geographically causes the island spilt up
into two unbalanced devisions. They are:
Northern Bali with a long narrow and less flat mainland.
Southern Bali with a wide and flat mainland.
In addition, Bali has 4 (four) lakes, namely Danau Beratan, Danau Buyan,
Danau Tamblingan and Danau Batur. Bali has tropical sea climate infuenced
by seasonal wind. It also has dry and wet seasons between which is the
transisition periode.
The weather is influenced by the place hight. The average weather in Bali of
280 - 30°C. The mainland in the southern part is wider than that in the
northern part. Such natural condition has great influence toward the climate in
Bali. Generally, in the southern Bali the rain fall is much more than that in the
northern Baii in December up to February. The wind blows from west and
south west, while in August it blows from east and south east.
Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)                         Page - 21



Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
In March up to May, the wind blows from different directions. The humidity in
Bali is 90%; in the wet season it may reach 100%, while in the dry season it
reaches 60%.
In terms of soil types in Bali, it is dominated by Regusol and Latosol types.
Only a small amount is of Alluvial, Mediteran and Andasol soil. The Latosol
type that is very sensitive to erosion can be found in the western areas such
as Kalopaksa, Petemon, rengdikit and Pempatan. It can also be found in the
areas of Gunung Penyu, Gunung Pintu, Gunung Juwet and Gunung Seraya,
which cover of 44.9% of the island width.
The erosional sensitive Regusol soil can be found in the eastern part of
Amlapura and Culik. This type of soil can be also found along Singaraja
coastal areas untill Seririt, Bubunan, Kekeran, around Danau Tamblingan,
Buyan and Beratan areas, around Batukaru forest, in small parts of southern
coast of Kusamba, sanur , Benoa and Kuta. This covers of 33.93% of the
island width.
Andasol is also sensitive to erosion and can be found around Baturiti, Candi
Kuning, Banyuatis, Gobleg, Pupuan and a part of Batukaru forest. The
Mediteran soil which is less sensitive to erosion can be found in the Bukit
Nusa Penida and its islets, Kuta hill and Prapat Agung. The Alluvial type is
not sensitive to erosion and can be found in the mainland of Negara, Sumber
Kelampok, manggis and Angan Telu. The last three types of soil cover of
about 15.49% of the island width.
The forests that have functions as spring protector, erosion and flood
prevention or function as hidrology are speading over the middle areas of the
island from west to east.
Most  rivers that come from the forests flow to the southern mainland
compared to those flowing to the northern one. As an agricultural area, most
people work in the agricultural sector, and therefore, rivers play an important
role as water souces for irrigation.
Looking at it from the lard use in 1994, it shows that 9.60% of the land is
used for settlement; 19.35% for rice field; 22.54% are in the forms of forest;
25.36 for plantation; 8.51% of it is critical land; lakes take 0.46% and 14.15%
are for other uses.
If it is seen from its socio-economy, the location of Bali island is very strtegic
since it plays the role of connector the land, sea and air traffic between the
Java and Nusa Tenggara islands as well as between Asia and Australia
continents.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
There are about 1.3 million foreign visitors and around 700 thousand
domestic visitors coming to Bali every year. Tourism industry and souvenir
marketting are very important for the economy in Bali. There is one
international air port in Bali (Ngurah Rai) that connects Bali to other cities
throughout Indonesia and to the cities in other coutries. In the sea ports, the
Ferry connects Bali to Java in the west and to Lombok in the east.
The environment condition in Bali is very special, various and beautiful which
is necessary to be preserved by implementing the environmental oriented and
continuing development. It is one of the main objectives of this BUIP Andal
study. In the last several years, the significant and sensitive environment
condition declines as a result of facilities and accomodation development for
tourists, the increase of traffic and the increase of waste. To preserve the
environment as well as to prevent the increase of negative impact from
decreasing quality environment by tourism development, pattern arrangement
of better environmental management policy and more operative, new
environmental institutional establishment as well as more realistic application
of law sanction is needed.
According to the spatial plan of Bali province (RTRWP) in 2010, the regioanl
characteristics used as instrument to manage the socio-economic and
environmental activities are devided into several types/characteristics of
geographical condition which cover:
L. Protected Area Consolidation Plan
1. Area which gives protection to its sub-areas
* Protected Forest Areas
* Water Catchment Areas
2. Local Protection Areas
* Holy Areas
* Holy Place Areas
* Shore Border Areas
* River Border Areas
* Ravine Border Areas
* Lake and Reservoir Surrounding Areas
* Spring Surrounding Areas
3. Nature Preservation and Culture Conservation Areas
* Nature Preservation Areas
* Mangrove Forested Coastal Areas
* Great Forest, Nature Tourist Park and Nature Preservation Areas

* West Bali National Park Areas
* Culture Conservation and Science Areas
4. Disastrous Sensitive Areas
* Volcanic Disastrous Areas
*  Lanslide/Erosion Areas
*  Sea Water Intrusion Coast Areas

1. Production Forest Areas
2. Agriculture Areas
3. Tourism Areas
4. Industrial Areas
5. Settlement Areas
6. Mining Areas
7. Security Defence Areas
One of the striking environmental characteristics in Bali is the existance of so
many bodies of water and rivers that this environmental characteristics look
very dense. The implication of the environmental characteristics toward the
development plan must be used as the evaluation basis for project site area
determination.
4.2.  Challenge
In analyzing the environment in Bali, there are a number of challenges in its
management. Those challenges are among others:
1. Natural resources
* The limited natural resources
* Sustainable development and increasing needs in line with the
population growth.
2. Advance of Technology
* The increase of industry causes the increase of pollution
4.3.  Constraints
In creating the environment which is BALI, a short term for Bersih(clean),
Aman(secure), Lestari(everlasting) and Indah (beautiful), there are a number

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
of Obstacles, among others:
. Casting off liquid and solid waste
* Uneven deviopment that causes migration to the towns, and as the result,
there appears poluted areas
* The shore condition in which many of the shores undergo Aberation
* The critical areas are getting wider
* There are a number of community members who do not care of their
environment yet.
4.4.  Opportunities
In spite of challenges, obstacles/problems, Bali also has chances that can be
taken in supporting BUIP program, among others:
* Natural Resources Variety as an asset for development.
* The Tri Hita Karana concept as the main basis for the Balinese in the
environmental oriented development.
* Technological development with management of limited natural resourses
in order to reach optimum results.
4.5.  The environment of Bali
Except for a relatively limited coastal zone, the northern regions of Bali are
mountainous and sparsely populated. This area is mainly covered by woods.
There are a number of villages and only a few roads. In the northern coastal
area there are a number of towns, of which Singaraja, the former capital, and
Gilmanuk with the ferry to Java, are the more important ones. On the foothills
and in the flatlands of the southern diamond shaped area there are numerous
small rural villages and sub-urban towns such as Ubud. Further south are the
densely populated ares, especially the urban centres of Tabanan, Klungkung,
Denpasar, Kuta and Sanur. Even more south is the Nusa Dua peninsula,
where a few villages and a large tourist resort are situated.
The natural as well as the cultural environment in Bali Province are diverse
and beautiful. Sub-Regions, typical for the environment of Bali, with charac-
teristics used in provincial and local structure plans, are indicated on maps
3.3.1 through 3.3.6. They are:
Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)                         Page - 25



Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
Natural conservation areas
These are the officially designated and protected areas such as Nature
Reserves and National Parks. To these areas enforceable rules, limiting
activities, apply. The largest area in this category is West Bali National
Park (Map 3.3.1).
Mangrove forests
These mangrove areas are mainly located on the tidal mud flats at the
south-east coast of Bali, between Semawang and Nusa Dua, and also in
south-west and north-west Bali near Gilimanuk. Much of these have been
destroyed by economic developments, such as salt production, shrimp
ponds and dumping of solid waste. Some replanting of mangrove has
been implemented. A large solid waste disposal site is situated in the
mangrove area near Suwung.
The mangrove areas are considered of high natural value, they also play a
role in natural protection against coastal erosion. Economic development
of 'Turtle Island' (Pulau Serangan) and within Benoa Harbor will constitute
a threat to the mangroves (Map 3.3.1).
- Water CaLchment Areas
Water resources are of paramount importance for nature, people, agricul-
ture and tourism on Bali. Scarcity of water makes allocation of resources
an important political topic.
The selection of locations for intake of water to produce drinking water of
sufficient quality at acceptable cost, is part of this problem. Low priority
assigned to water supply for human utilization as opposed to use for
agricultural purposes has led to decisions for water intake from the
downstream sections of rivers. Pollution of rivers by solid waste and
human waste water, as well as pollution of ground water bodies by
drainage of waste water, batik dyes and by leachate from solid waste
dumps, constitutes a serious threat to human health and highly compli-
cates water treatment requirements. Allocation of water resources does
not constitute a problem for water supply under BUIP, but may do so in
the near future. Therefore future watermanagement in Bali should be
thoroughly studied and implemented.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
Coastal Zone / Shore
The geological origin of the coastal zones of Bali is different for the
northern areas which mainly consist of volcanic, and the southern areas
which predominantly consist of coral material. At several areas the coast
is subjected to highly dynamic erosion processes that are responsible for
a characteristic steep rocky shore, at other places the coastline consists of
wide fine sand beaches, especially attractive locations for tourist
accommodation. Constraints on the preservation of the coastal features
are pollution by solid waste deposited by the public (including tourists) or
by the sea (mainly returning waste from rivers and sewers), and mining of
building material from coral reefs.
Cultural Preservation
The cultural heritage and contemporary culture of Bali is characteristic for
the island and unique in Indonesia and the world. Many cultural objects
are monuments from early times, most of them are still in use for
ceremonies and celebrations. Although property of the communities, some
of them are officially protected by the government.Construction of new
physical infrastructure may threaten the preservation of valuable
archaeologic or historic artefacts (Map 3.3.2).
Areas of Natural Hazards
Areas where natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, landslides,
flooding or earthquakes are not uncommon phenomena in Bali and should
be avoided for human settlement activities, unless adequate technical and
organizational measures have been taken to protect people and capital
goods against danger of death, suffering or damage.Hazard of volcanic
eruption exist around Gunung Agung, including Tulamben and Klungkung.
Hazard of flooding exists in Denpasar, Kuta, Negara and Mendoyo (Map
3.3.3).
Dry Agriculture
The areas for 'dry' agriculture are of both economic and scenic value. Co-
ordinated planning for construction of buildings and roads is necessary to
avoid hampering economic agricultural exploitation and damage to scenic
aspects of the landscape. Extracting ground water may lower the phreatic
ground water level, causing dry soil conditions (Map 3.3.4).

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
-  Irrigated Agriculture
The sawahs (rice fields) may be of similar economic importance as the dry
agricultural areas; the scenic value is probably greater, especially in areas
with steep slopes. In general, there is an intricate gravity fed irrigation
system providing the required water for specific growing phases of the
rice. Therefore great care should be taken in locating any structure in
these areas, so as to avoid disturbance of hydrological conditions or
damage to economic agricultural exploitation or scenic beauty of the
landscape (Map 3.3.4).
-  Plantations
Plantations are mainly of economic interest, in certain locations they may
represent scenic values, or even serve as unique habitat for certain
species of flora and/or fauna. Site specific information must be obtained to
assess possible environmental significant impact by any type of develop-
ment (Map 3.3.4).
- Urban Settlements
In Bali there are some 55 Towns, ranging from the City of Denpasar with
about 350,000 inhabitants to Pupuan (in Kabupaten Tabanan) with about
3,500 inhabitants, as well as numerous villages (desas). There are no high
rise buildings in Bali (with one exception, the 10-story Bali Beach Hotel on
the coast at Sanur). Probably only 10 Towns have centers that are really
urban, most smaller towns are of a sub-urban character. Many villages are
ribbon built along roads.
Most settlements are concentrated in the diamond shaped area of
Southern Bali, the plain between the foothills of the east-west oriented
mountain range and Nusa Dua peninsula.The environment within the
boundaries of urban areas (cities, towns and villages) is mainly character-
ized by physical parameters indicating the quality of the 'living' or 'human'
environment. These parameters are, in accordance width the Indonesian
guidelines for environmental assessment reports (Andal): Water and Air
Quality (including noise and smell) and Public Health (including risk of
accidents) (Map 3.3.5).

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
- Tourism and Tourist Development Areas
Environmental characteristics to be preserved for areas that typically
function as tourist leisure resorts (hotels and adjacent gardens, parks and
beaches) or as tourist facility (e.g. golf courses), are similar to those of
urban areas. Clean beaches, clean and safe sea water, and accessibility
may be items for special attention. There are about 20 tourist development
areas (Map 3.3.6), the most important are Nusa Dua, Kuta,
Sanur, Candidasa, Lovina, Tanah Lod, all located along the coast, and
Ubud, Bedugul/Pancasari and Kintamani in central Bali. Newly planned
tourist development areas are Tuban, Lebi, Soka, Batuampar, Gilimanuk,
Candikusuma, Palasari, Perancak and Nusa Penida. These new develop-
ments are all planned along the coast.
- Other features of the environment
There are a number of environmental components that are not covered by
the above specified characteristic areas. Some of them are:
.Rivers and Estuaries: There are a great many of small rivers flowing
down from the Gunung Agung, Gunung Batur and Gunung Lesong
volcanos as well as from the west Bali mountain ridge. These rivers are
too numerous and too small to formulate specific environmental
characteristics, they may have to be addressed at the level of the
individual projects.
Unique geomorphology or landscape: No specific areas have been
officially indicated or designated as featuring those characteristics.
Attention to this aspect should be paid at the level of individual
projects. Since the scenic landscape in Bali is an important character-
istic of the island, it is highly recommended that specific areas that
represent scenic landscapes be protected by government regulations.
Industrial zones and sites: These do not occur to a substantial size in
Bali.
For this classification and general description of the Bali environment, the
Presidential Decree KEP PRES 32 1990 was followed. This division is
used for provincial and local structure plans (e.g. Rencana Tata Ruang
Wilayah Propinsi Dati Bali Tahun 2010).
A geographical documentation of the various areas of characteristic types
of environment will facilitate management of the environment of Bali.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
Economic and social activities may then be subjected to guidelines issued
by the respective authorities responsible for the management of the envi-
ronment in each area.
The Bali Environmental Profile of Annex 11 has been compiled as a back-
ground paper for this regional/sectoral environmental assessment,
containing more detailed information on many aspects of the environment
of Bali.
Table 4.3 shows the locations of the 9 Kabupaten and 32 towns with
respect to the 11 environmental zones. As noted, almost all BUIP sub-
projects will be within existing urban areas. It should also be noted that
only a few of these urban areas are within or bordering on Natural
Conservation Areas or Mangrove Forests. A number of urban areas is
situated along the coast. Objects of Cultural Preservation are frequently
situated within urban areas.
4.6.. Urbanisation and Tourism
As stated above, the population growth over the ten year period 1980-1990
averaged 1.18% pa. In 1980 14.7% of the population were living in urban
areas, by 1990 this had increased to 26.4%, an average annual growth of
7.3% indicating a strong tendency to urbanization, mainly concentrated in the
'Southern Bali Region'.
Until relatively recently, the richness of the Bali environment was mainly of
benefit to the inhabitants, but nowadays many tourists from all over the world
enjoy visiting Bali. Some 1.3 million foreign plus an estimated 700.000
domestic tourists arrive in Bali yearly. Especially since tourism brings econ-
omic prosperity to Bali, it is the governments policy to further promote tourism
by stimulating improvement and expansion of tourist accommodation and
urban infrastructure. As a secondary effect of prosperity, there is an increas-
ing trade and demand for services, certainly one of the stimuli for urbaniz-
ation.
As a consequence of growing tourism and urbanization, increasing traffic,
demand for water supply, need for disposal of human waste water and for
disposal of solid waste, all constitute an increasing impact on the
environment. This impact is unmistakable, not only within the urban areas,
because of air pollution, noise, risk of traffic accidents and need for and
maintenance of roads and sidewalks, but also becomes evident in rural areas,

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                         Environmental Sector
because of conversion of agricultural land and loss of ecological green belts
for 'urban' activities (traffic, housing, tourist facilities, human waste treatment
facilities, solid waste disposal sites etc.) and privatization of coastline by the
tourist industry.
In the recent years it has become apparent that the urban and cultural, as
well as the precious and sensitive rural and natural environment of Bali is
deteriorating because of expansion of hotel accommodation, increasing
traffic, increasing amount of solid waste, and by pollution of surface water and
ground water with human and industrial waste.
Preserving the islands invaluable paradise-like environment by striving for
sustainable development is a responsibility of central, provincial and local
authorities. It will be to the benefit and welfare of everyone involved, tourists
as well as the Balinese themselves.
To protect the environment of Bali, and to prevent a negative feed back from
deterioration of environmental qualities on the volume and quality of tourism,
being a vital economic resource for Bali, new environmental policies on land
use, transport, solid waste and water resources (ideally resulting in a 'Bali
Environmental Program') and new government institutions, whose regulations
should be enforced effectively, should be developed.
Diagram 111 illustrates the relations between human urban activities, environ-
mental qualities and (growth of) population and tourism.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                        Environmental Sector
4.7.  Conclusion
Clearly, the most sensitive areas in Bali, from the natural environmental point
of view, are the Natural Conservation Areas, including the Mangrove Forests.
From a point of view of Public health the water catchment areas need to be
protected. The areas most sensitive to development and improvement of
Urban Infrastructure probably leading to progressing urbanization, are the
sub-urban and semi-rural areas situated on the periphery of existing urban
areas, and bordering on the rural and natural areas. Great care should be
taken to preserve the social, cultural and rural (agricultural and scenic)
aspects of these areas.
Although most of the BUIP projects will improve Quality of Life (improved
Public Health, better roads and sidewalks, improved drainage, less litter) in
the urban areas, air pollution, noise and risk of accidents may increase due to
increased and faster moving traffic.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                        Environmental Sector
5.2   Gross impact of BUIP sub-sectors, focusing on possible significant
impacts
Tables 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 show where impacts may occur during implementation
in each of the BUIP sub-sectors in each of the identified environmental zones
in Bali and how environmental quality parameters may be effected.
For BUIP, the sector 'Urban Infrastructure' consists of 10 sub-sectors (e.g.
'Urban Roads'), each sub-sector contains between two and six categories of
Projects (like 'Road widening'), while within each category of projects there
may be a number of sub-projects (e.g. widening of one particular road section
over a certain length).
Experience in other IUIDP programs suggests that the great majority of sub-
projects are relatively small and will not have a significant, but only a limited
environmental impact, provided appropriate safeguards are incorporated in
the design, and that construction is adequately managed and supervised.
However, some sub-projects may have the potential for significant impact
requiring detailed environmental analysis, to be documented in subsequent
environmental assessment reports (Andal).
Reviewing the various sub-sectors and relevant categories of projects, and
eliminating those unlikely to cause significant impact, will enable focusing on
those sub-sectors or categories of projects that possibly may have significant
environmental impacts.
As a first step in this process, categories of projects that are of a temporary
character, that will in most cases not affect the environment permanently,
such as upgrading, renovation and rehabilitation, are of less environmental
concern.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
Secondly, specific sub-sectors or sub-projects may also be of less concern:
Water Supply (WS);
(Water intake, Storage, Transmission / Distribution, Purification Plant,
House Connections)
Potential impacts of this sub-sector are: Water use in competition with
other sectors, such as irrigation for agricultural purposes. Reduction of
ground water levels and/or intrusion of salt water in catchment areas,
increase in production of waste water, risk of cross connections with
sewer system, risk of contamination by pollution of ground and surface
water.
Storage, transmission, distribution and house connection are - depend-
ing on scale and location - not expected to cause significant environ-
mental impact.
Urban Roads (UR);
(New Roads, Widening, Upgrading, Rehabilitation, Overlay)
Potential impacts of new roads are: Land acquisition and resettlement of
people living on that land, demolition of objects such as houses, cultural
objects, trees, influence on local hydrology, local air pollution by exhaust
vapors and soot of traffic using the new road, risk of accidents, etc. New
roads may form barriers, dividing or separating communities, or obstruct
small scale cross-traffic (house - school, house - market, etc.). 'New roads'
may in some cases mean 'improvement of existing dirt roads'. In those
cases there will be a significant change in character of the road that may
have significant impact on the social environment. Widening of roads may
affect the environment negatively, even if the widening does not exceed
the existing right of way. There may be dwellings, cultural objects, trees
etc. that have to be removed and people may have to resettle. Widening
may induce greater traffic intensity at higher speeds, leading to increased
risk of accidents. Widening of narrow roads and consequently increased
traffic, may have social impact in situations of ribbon building, where the
road has a social function, being a place for children to play and for
people to meet.
Upgrading, rehabilitation and new overlay within the existing road way
are not considered to have significant impact. New overlay needs to be

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
coordinated with drainage and flood control, since the inlets of drain
channels and ditches may be (partially) blocked by the overlay.
Human Waste Water Sanitation;
(Sewerage System, Sewage Treatment Plant)
Potential impacts of this sub-sector are: Soil pollution by leaking sewers
and septic tanks, sludge disposal from waste treatment plants, cross con-
nections with water supply system, odors from treatment plant.
Both sewage transportation and treatment are of environmental
concern.
- Solid waste Management;
(New Final Disposal Site, Depot / Transfer Station, Incineration)
Potential impacts of this sub-sector are: solid waste lost during transporta-
tion, soil and water pollution by infiltration and percolation of rain or
surface water into and subsequently out of the body of waste dumps.
Attraction of rodents, birds and other animals, that may spread diseases to
the human population. Soil pollution by improper composting, resulting in
contaminated compost. Air pollution by (inadequate) incineration or by
spontaneous combustion at dump sites. Health problems for labourers in
this sub-sector.
Except for collection and transportation, all phases of solid waste
management are of importance, such as 'storage and transfer', Inciner-
ation, tipping and site operations.
- Market Infrastructure Improvement (MIIP);
(Public Toilets, Renovation and Market Infrastructure)
This sub-sector may be considered to be within urban market areas
and not to cause significant environmental impact.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
Kampung Improvement (KIP);
(New development, Town renovation, Inspection roads and Pathways)
This sub-sector contains only very small sub-projects within
Kampungs. They will certainly have an overall long term positive
impact on the environmental quality in the kampungs involved, but no
significant negative environmental impact need be expected.
- Urban Drainage and Flood Control;
(New Construction, Renovation, Upgrading and Rehabilitation)
. Large new drainage channels in urban areas will have significant
potential impact on land use - involving resettlement - and on
hydrology.
Many existing drainage channels and ditches are littered or obstructed
by accumulated sludge. Rehabilitation may have significant environ-
mental impact in cases where large volumes of (contaminated) sludge
are present and safe handling and disposal is required.
Traffic and Transport Management
(Signs and Markings)
Installation of traffic signs and marking of roads is not considered to
have environmental impact at the present level of reflection. Traffic
flow will improve, the environmental impact of the traffic tends to
decrease.
- New Markets (NM);
(New Construction, Relocation and Market Infrastructure)
Environmental consequences may be: land acquisition and change of
function for that area. Possible resettlement of people living in the area
occupied by the new market. Buildings, dwellings and cultural objects may
have to be demolished and trees removed. Additional solid waste will be
generated.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
Market infrastructure is in itself not considered a cause of environ-
mental problems.
- Bus Terminals (BT) and Parking Lots (PL);
(New, Expansion, Relocation, Renovation)
Bus terminais and parking lots are located in urban areas. New develop-
ment, expansion and relocation may have significant impact with large
Bus Terminals and Parking Lots, where new area is to be acquired and
changes function. Possibly people have to resettle, and objects and trees
may have to be removed,

5.4   Conclusion
Important potential impacts are: the need for resettlement of people, for
projects needing land acquisition, such as new or widened roads, final solid
waste disposal sites, water and sewage treatment plants, and new, expanded
or relocated markets and parking lots; Pollution of surface water, ground
water and soil, by waste and sludge disposal; Social and cultural impact by
new or'expanded (widened) roads, bus terminals, parking lots, markets etc.;
Increased risk of accidents on widened or improved roads. Impact on
landscape values by new roads and solid waste dumps. Impact of road
widening will have impacts especially in sub-urban and semi-rural areas.

CHAPTER 6
POSSIBILITIES FOR AVOIDANCE AND MITIGATION
6.1  Introduction
Negative environmental consequences of urban infrastructure projects can in
many cases be prevented by sound cost-benefit analysis, judicious site
selection for new projects, careful and creative design, including consider-
ation of alternative solutions or restrictions (e.g. minimal design) and
application of good operation procedures during the implementation phase. If
not all negative impacts can be avoided, full attention should be paid to
possibilities for mitigation and compensation.
Mitigating and compensating measures should be specified in the Environ-
mental Management Plans, RKL in cases when Andal is required, or UKL if
ANDAL is not required. If neither RKL, nor UKL is required, Standard
Operating Procedures (SOP) should perform this function, they should be
attached to the tender documents and construction contracts.
The following paragraph may serve as a technical framework for those
specifications.
6.2   Guidelines for Avoidance and Mitigation for Typical BUIP Projects -
Framework for SOPs
* Water supply (Water intake, Treatment Plant)
Water
- Avoidance:    Careful selection of water source and location of intake
will minimize need for purification. In case of limited
availability of surface water, priority should be given to
ground water as a source for drinking water, to avoid
water allocation problems with use for agricultural pur-
poses.
Water transport piping should be underground, parallel to
roads where possible, for easy inspection access and for
minimum visual disturbance of the landscape
For disposal of sludge from water treatment, preference
should be given to disposal at a final solid waste disposal

site, in order to avoid contamination of rivers with
chemicals used for purification, if any..
-  Mitigation:  After trenching  transport piping  prompt replantation
should be implemented for visual reasons and to avoid
soil erosion.
* Urban roads (New Construction, Widening)
Land Acquisition
- Compensation: Compensate for lost land, buildings, facilities, crops,
trees, etc.
-  Mitigation     Resettlement Plan
Soil erosion
-  Avoidance:    The extent of environmental impact of road projects on
soil may be reduced by:
-     reducing the area of ground clearance
-     prompt replanting and plant maintenance
-     avoiding sensitive alignments
-     controlling speed and volume of water flows
-  Mitigation:    Fitting the project into the environment by replanting or
by protecting slopes with retaining walls in the more
difficult cases
-  Compensation: Develop spoiled land for other activities

environmentally sensitive areas. The balance of impacts
from the projects in this Kampung Improvement sub-
sector will clearly be positive. Care should be taken for
preservation of cultural elements.

6.3   Conclusion
For Urban Infrastructure, in most cases negative environmental impacts can
be avoided by 'integrated' design, taking environmental interests into account
right from the beginning of the development process. This is achieved by
educating the design engineers and / or by including environmental
specialists in the design team. Not seldom this results in an overall better
solution.
Remaining negative impacts shall be mitigated to acceptable levels by
technical and managerial measures in design, construction and maintenance
phases of the BUIP sub-projects as indicated above, and after EA / ANDAL to
be formulated in RKURPL, UKUUPL and SOP and incorporated in Permits,
Tender Documents and Construction Contracts. Realisation of mitigative
measures should be enforced, and effectiveness monitored by government
inspection.

CHAPTER 7
SCREENING FOR SITE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
7.1  Introduction
In the foregoing chapters, the Umbrella Environmental Assessment elabor-
ated on general and generic aspects of the existing conditions of the
environment in Bali, on existing environmental issues and constraints, on
typical potential impacts on the environment of BUIP types of projects and on
ways to avoid or mitigate those impacts, or to compensate for them.
In this chapter, Bali-specific screening guidelines are developed to identify
individual projects or types of projects that should be either analyzed further
by way of a site specific Environmental Assessment (EA or Andal), or - for
less environmentally significant projects - should be subjected to specific
environmental management and monitoring plans (UKL and UPL). For the
remaining projects - neither requiring EA / Andal, nor UKL / UPL - specificati-
on of environmentally relevant design criteria, or implementation of
safeguards during construction and/or operation (Standard Operating
Procedures, SOP) shall be spelled out in the tender documents and contracts
for executing those projects.
The results of the screening process will at a minimum satisfy the criteria for
Environmental Impact Assessment as mandated by the Government of
Indonesia, and those of the IBRD.
7.2   Screening criteria of the Indonesian Government
The types of projects ('businesses or activities') that - above a specified
magnitude - require preparation of a full Environmental Impact Assessment
(Andal), including an Environmental Management Plan (RKL) and Environ-
mental Monitoring Plan (RPL)), or - below that specified magnitude - only
require preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (UKL) plus an
Environmental Monitoring Plan (UPL), are listed in Appendix I to Decree No.
KEP-1 1/MENLH/3/1994 of 19 March 1994 of the Minister of State for the
Environment.
Although the decree dictates that projects not requiring an Andal do require
UKL / UPL, the Central AMDAL Commission for the Public Works sector set a
lower standard by excluding projects below a certain magnitude from this

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
obligation (see table 7.4). This creates legally uncertain situations, which
requires clarification.
Types of projects not listed are required to implement UKL/UPL (incorporate
and specify Environmental Guidelines in the tender documents and
construction contracts. The quantitative criteria as applicable for BUIP sub-
projects are listed in Table 7.4.
7.3  IBRD screening for EA categories
The purpose of screening, as stated in Annex E of IBRD Operational Directive
OD 4.01, is 'to decide the nature and extent of the environmental analysis
(EA) to be carried out on the proposed loan or credit'.
Projects are assigned to one of three categories:
-  Category A:    Full EA is required;
-  Category B:    No full EA  required, however, some environmental
analysis is necessary;
-  Category C:   No EA or other environmental analysis is required.
The selection of the category should be based on professional judgment and
information available at the time of project identification.
Criteria for Making the Screening Decision
The significance of impacts, and the selection of screening category
accordingly, depend on the type and scale of the project, the location and
sensitivity of environmental issues, and the nature and magnitude of the
potential impacts. When making a screening decision, each of these criteria
should be taken into consideration.
Project Type and Scale
The above lists are based on prior experience, they provide a starting point
and framework for the screening decision. However, because of other factors
involved, such as project siting, the nature of impacts, and the need for the
EA process to be flexible enough to accommodate them, the lists are only
guiding.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
Project Location
The selection of a screening category often depends substantially on the
project setting, while the 'significance' of potential impacts is partly a function
of the natural and socio-cultural surroundings.
Sensitivity of Issues
These issues may include (but are not limited to) disturbance of tropical
forests, conversion of wetlands, potential adverse effects on protected areas
or sites, encroachment on lands or rights of indigenous peoples or other
vulnerable minorities, involuntary resettlement, impacts on international
waterways and other transboundary issues, and toxic waste disposal.
Nature of Impacts
The following examples of impacts warrant consideration of Category A
attention:
- permanent conversion of potentially productive or valuable resources
(e.g., fishery, natural forests, wildiands), or destruction of natural habitat
and loss of bio-diversity, or environmental services provided by a natural
system;
- risk to human health or safety (e.g., from generation, storage or disposal
of (hazardous) wastes, inappropriate occupational health and safety
measures, violation of ambient water or air quality standards);
- displacement of large numbers of people or businesses;
- absence of effective mitigatory or compensatory measures.
Magnitude of Impacts
There are a number of ways in which magnitude can be measured, such as
the absolute amount of a resource or ecosystem affected, the amount
affected relative to the existing stock of the resource or ecosystem, the
intensity of the impact and its timing and duration. In addition, the probability
of occurrence for a specific impact and the cumulative impact of the proposed
action and other planned or ongoing actions may need to be considered. The

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                    Environmental Sector
impact may be different depending on its duration and frequency of
occurrence -- continuous or permanent, seasonal, intermittent or accidental.
7.4  Screening BUIP projects
Screening the individual BUIP sub-projects will at a minimum meet the
requirements of the Indonesian legislation for Andal set forth by Decree of the
Ministry of State for the Environment (KEP-11/MENLH/3/1994) and by the
AMDAL Commission of the Ministry of Public Works (PU). Also taking into
account the screening guidelines given in Operation Directive OD 4.01 of the
IBRD, the set of screening criteria for BUIP as presented in table 7.4 results.
After Project Appraisal the BUIP sub-projects of the PJM's will be screened
for the required level of Environmental assessment by a Screening Commit-
tee presided by Bappeda Tk I. Members of the Committee are: Bappeda Tk I,
PU Tk 1, BBLH Tk I, Bapedalda, KOMDA AMDAL, and if applicable Bappeda
Tk II and BBLH Tk II. Screening will be performed, using the criteria of the
GOI and of the IBRD, as presented in Table 7.4. The screening process
results in assigning all sub-projects to one out of the following three
categories:
Category A: Projects requiring full EA / Andal + RKL/RPL
Category B: Projects requiring UKL/UPL
Category C: Projects requiring SOP
RKL/RPL, UKL/UPL and SOP specify environmental management and
monitoring measures to be incorporated in the tender documents and
construction contracts and operation procedures.
For category C sub-projects, PU will provide technical guidelines for the
Detailed Engineering Design (DED) Consultant to prepare the SOP to be
incorporated in the tender documents.
For category B sub-projects, PU will prepare the UKL/UPL documents,
assisted by the Environmental Consultant. The UKL/UPL will be reviewed by
Bappeda, BBLH and the IBRD. Completion of a satisfactory UKL/UPL will be
a prerequisite for approval of each sub-project. The DED Consultant will
prepare the tender documents in accordance with UKL/UPL as approved by
Bappeda.
For category A sub-projects, the KA-Andal will be prepared by PU, assisted
by the Environmental Consultant. The KA-Andal will be reviewed by KOMDA
AMDAL and the IBRD. Successively, PU will prepare the Andal and the
RKL/RPL, assisted by the Environmental Consultant. Andal and RKURPL will

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                    Environmental Sector
be reviewed by KOMDA AMDAL and the IBRD. Completion of a satisfactory
Andal and RKL/RPL will be a prerequisite for approval of each sub-project.PU
will then prepare the tender documents, assisted by the DED Consultant, in
accordance with RKL/RPL as approved by KOMDA AMDAL and the IBRD.
7.5  Timing of screening and implementation
For screening of projects, preparation of SOP, preparation and reviewing of
UKL/UPL, KA-Andal, Andal and RKL/RPL training under responsibility of
Bapedalda, assisted by a Training Consultant, will be necessary (refer to
chapter 10). When started with training for screening, followed by training for
SOP, then for UKL/UPL and Andal-RKLURPL, Screening, implementation and
monitoring activities may be adequately spread over the first two years of
implementation, without slowing down execution of BUIP. Implementation of
projects requiring Andal may commence early 1999, as illustrated in the
barchart of table 7.5.
7.6   Conclusion
Criteria have been developed for environmental screening of BUIP sub-
projects as proposed for implementation in the PJMs. These criteria are
based on GOI regulations and IBRD guidelines. Screening will be effected in
a Screening Committee consisting of representatives of all agencies involved,
including IBRD.
The Screening Committee will determine whether full EA / Andal is required
or UKL/UPL is necessary. Remaining sub-projects are required to prepare
SOP.
The EA documents, Andal/RKL/RPL, UKL/UPL and SOP should clearly
describe operational environmental mitigating, management and monitoring
measures, so that these can be incorporated in permits/licences, tender
documents and construction contracts.
The screening process should be accompanied by environmental training, for
which a training consultant should be engaged.

CHAPTER 8.
TOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT AND
MONITORING
8.1  Introduction
For BUIP sub-projects screened from the PJM's, that require Andal (including
RKL/RPL), UKL/UPL, or SOP, Terms of Reference (TOR) have to be made
for further study and for preparation of the required documents.
For the AMDAL procedure, General Guidelines issued by Decree of the
Minister of State for the Environment (KEP-14/MENLH/3/1994), and in some
instances also Technical Guidelines issued by the Government Agency
responsible for the proposed activity, are to be observed. For BUIP, being
financed by the IBRD, OD 4.01 will also be taken into account.
For AMDAL, the TOR ('KA-Andal') and the Environmental Impact Statement,
Environmental Management Plan and Environmental Monitoring Plan (Andal,
RKL and RPL) need to be reviewed and accepted by the Bali Provincial
AMDAL Commission (KOMDA AMDAL), before a permit can be issued for
execution of the BUIP sub-project involved.
BUIP sub-projects requiring Andal are planned to be implemented not before
the first year, in order to allow for adequate time to conduct necessary studies
and for preparation and review of the required documents.
For Environmental Management Plans and Environmental Monitoring Plans,
to be prepared if no Andal is required (UKL / UPL), the Decree of the Minister
of State for the Environment (KEP-12/MENLH/3/1994) provides General
Guidelines to be observed. Additionally, technical Guidelines can be set by
the Government Agency responsible for the proposed activity. UKL and UPL
need to be approved by this same agency, before a permit can be granted.
Environmental Management Plans and Environmental Monitoring Plans, be it
RKL/RPL or UKL / UPL, should provide adequate information on environ-
mental provisions and practices to be observed during execution (construc-
tion and operation) of the sub-projects and to be stipulated in Tender
Documents and Construction Contracts, in such a way that they can be
inspected during and after implementation.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                     Environmental Sector
There will be types of BUIP sub-projects that, given Location and Size, do not
require Andal, nor UKL / UPL. For those sub-projects Standard Operation
Procedures (SOP) have to be written. The SOP shall be an indispensable
part of the Construction Contract. Technical Guidelines (Pedoman Teknis) of
PU (such as the 'Interim Standard Environmental Mitigation Measures' of
September 1993) are one of the sources for SOP. (See Diagram 11).
8.2  Issues for special attention.
The objective of TOR for Environmental Assessment, Management and
Monitoring is to establish scope and depth of the study and to focus on
themes that are of main or particular interest, e.g. magnitude and importance
of impacts. It is the aim of this UEA to provide generic and general
information that can be referred to in individual EAs (Andals) under this
'umbrella', so that it need not be repeated over and over. By doing so, these
EAs can concentrate on the relevant issues, making them more accessible to
a broader range of interested readers. They should be carried out in order to
enable adequate account for the environmental implications of the project
involved.
Topics that should at least be covered in all Andals are:
- Description and motivation of the project
- Description and evaluation of relevant aspects of the present condition of
the environment and autonomous developments
- Assessment and evaluation of Environmental Impact and Affected
Interests (opportunities and constraints)
- Mitigative measures incorporated in the project
- Alternatives for the project, the proposed site and mitigation
- Comparison of alternatives, including 'Go I No-Go'
- Legal framework
- Environmental management and monitoring provisions
- Summary written in a style accessible to the public
The following issues require special attention for BUIP sub-projects. They
should be addressed in the KA-Andal when scoping the Andal study, in the
Andal studies when predicting and evaluating potential significant impacts,
and in the RKL/RPL as well as in the UKL/UPL when defining prevention,
mitigation and monitoring remaining significant impacts.

8.3   Conclusion
For EA / Andal, regulations and 'general guidelines' of the GOI are compre-
hensive. More specific 'technical guidelines' for BUIP type of projects are not
yet available. The first step in the AMDAL process is preparation by the
proponent of the TOR: the KA-Andal, which has to be reviewed and accepted
between the proponent (mostly PU), the responsible agency (Bappeda) and
the Provincial AMDAL-Commission (KOMDA AMDAL).
Among the topics to be treated in each Andal is the comparison of alternative
solutions for the project. For BUIP sub-sectors, issues that should be
elaborated on in the Andal and thus have to be stipulated in the KA-Andal are
mentioned above. They concentrate on potential impacts that should be
avoided, because they are irreversible or difficult (or expensive) in mitigation.

CHAPTER 9
PUBLIC CONSULTATION
9.1   Consultation at start of the project
In February and March 1996, during the preparation phase of BUIP,
consultation meetings were conducted at the macro levels of Bali Province as
a whole, at the meso-level of kabupaten (districts) and at the micro level of
kacamatan (towns) and desa (villages). Macro and meso meetings took the
form of workshops to which representatives of district authorities and
universities were invited for the macro level meetings, and also representa-
tives of NGO's for the meso workshops. The meetings on micro level were
more informal and took the form of 'dialogue'. Invited to the micro level
meetings were representatives from youth and women organizations, from
the private sector (hotel owners and traders) and leaders of the community,
such as leaders of the farmers, of the towns, the desas and informal leaders
of the banjars in the desas, like teachers. Information on the Bali Urban Infra-
structure Program was supplied with the invitation, about one week ahead of
the meetings. A whole day was reserved for each meeting.
The most relevant conclusions of the meetings may be summarized as
follows:
- BUIP should be in accordance with the Rancana Umum Tata Ruang
(RUTR) (General Spatial Planning Program) of Bali and of the Kabupaten
and kotamadya (Provincial Capital).
- BUIP should preserve the identity of towns, and their historical aspects,
sustain temples and their ritual significance for the spiritual life of the
Balinese, and aesthetic aspects, enhancing Balinese architecture. In
short: BUIP should be characterized by the concept of 'BALI': Bersih
(clean), Aman (secure), Lestari (everlast) and Indah (beautiful).
- There should be good coordination between BUIP projects as well as
among responsible agencies.
- Use of ground water should be given priority, in view of the limited sources
of water supply.
- Use of surface water should be coordinated with the subak (organization
for coordination of water usage).

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                     Environmental Sector
- Development of waste dumping sites should be in consultation with the
community.
- People should be educated to be aware that littering, dumping rubbish into
rivers etc. is environmentally unfriendly behaviour.
- Legal action should be taken to deal with waste problems in tourist areas.
- Kampung Improvement should be focusing on underdeveloped
kampungs, enhancing local concepts of 'Tai Hila Carina" (the relations of
humans with the Gods, with fellow humans and with the living environ-
ment), maintaining desa and banjar as centres for social and cultural
activities.
- New Markets should not necessarily compete with well organized tradi-
tional markets. Involve the community and subak for harmonious rela-
tionship and to sustain the two kinds of markets.
In the report on this public consultation, support was suggested for cultural
programs, which are integrated in community educational and participation
programs, for BUIP to be more communicative, sociable and culturally
oriented. The purposes of such a participation program are expected to be:
- strengthened community support
- provision of input for BUIP
- acceptance of output by the community
- involve the community for project maintenance
A report on the consultation at the start of the project is attached to this EA as
Annex VI.
9.2   Consultation of women
Although not explicitly stipulated in the TOR, in the EA process for BUIP, it
was agreed that special attention be given to consultation with women.
Actually, no such consultation meetings especially for women took place.
However, in the Real Demand Survey (RDS), it is estimated that 60% of the
survey respondents were women. In the answers to the survey there is no
reference to the gender of the respondent.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                      Environmental Sector
IBRD has engaged a specialist in Public Consult to prepare, conduct and
analyze the results of random encounter surveys with women, focusing on
water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and on Market and
Kampung Improvement components of BUIP.
9.3   Public Consultation
It is the requirement of the IBRD that affected groups and interested parties
(among which NGO's and women) be informed of the findings of this draft
EA report and given opportunity to express their views on them before this
report is finalized. The draft of this EA is completes, and was issued to
BAPPEDA Tk1, a public meeting was conducted on August 19, 1996 to
provide for consultation.
9.4   Disclosure
It is a requirement of the IBRD / World Bank that the final version of this
report be published. (made available for review by anyone, a summary in
the Indonesian language is available on request)
Results of public consultation are included in Annex 6, and the complete
report including annexes will be available through the bank's public
information centre. In addition, copies of the complete report & annexes
have been deposited in the offices of Bappeda I & II Bali, public libraries in
all kabupaten (Tk. II) and Udayana University library.
9.5   Public participation in the AMDAL process during Implementation
As a consequence of the recent revision (1993) of the AMDAL procedures
as part of a package of deregulation measures, both the central and
provincial AMDAL-Commissions now invite NGO's as non-permanent
members. This may be expected to encourage greater public involvement in
the assessment of BUIP projects.
Experience gained with Public Participation in reviewing this Umbrella
Environmental Assessment may produce a model to be used for Public
Participation in further Environmental Assessment Procedures required for
implementation of BUIP sub-projects.

9.6   Conclusion
Public Consultation during the preparation phase of BUIP took place on the
basis of invitation. It was organized on three administrative levels: Province,
Kabupaten/Kotamadya and local. NGOs were invited for the Kabupaten level
workshops. Representatives of women, youth, private sector as well as
leaders of farmers, towns and desas were invited for local discussions.
Separate consultation of women took place on a basis of random encounters.
Concerns expressed by the pubiic were mainly concentrating on co-ordination
between BUIP sub-sectors, eg. between road improvement and drainage, on
preservation of the cultural heritage and on continued consultation with the
public.
This UEA will be published and the public will be consulted on the potential
impact and environmental management during BUIP implementation. It is
expected that experience with this public participation will be used in improve
the participation process for further EA of BUIP sub-projects that are
screened to require Andal.

CHAPTER 10
OPERATIONAL CAPACITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
10.1  Introduction
Environmental Management is a part of the regional planning and develop-
ment function of the Provincial Government, for which Bappeda Tk I is
responsible. The organizational framework for regulating and controlling the
environmental aspects of development is slowly developing.
- The Environment (Lingkungan Hidup) section in Bidang Fispra has existed
since Bappeda Tkl was established, but the task of this section is limited
to planning.
- The environmental section in Setwilda Tk I has been upgraded to Biro
status, but as a 'staff unit it is in principle charged with policy preparation
and administrative matters only.
- Kantor Bapedal Wilayah was established in July 1995, but is not yet fully
staffed and organized. Its main tasks are to provide support, technology,
norms and standards for environmental impact measurement and
analysis, and to conduct Regional Audits.
- Bapedalda Tk I will soon be established, this unit will play a key role in
environmental impact assessment and enforcement of regulaiions.
- Central government agencies, other than Bapedal are also involved in
environmental management in Bali. For example the AMDAL-Commission
of PU has delegated the review of Andals related to BUIP to the provincial
AMDAL-Commission, but wishes to participate in the process (ref. Annex
VIl).
Apart from the fragmentation between different environmental agencies, there
is the constraint of the virtually complete lack of qualified personnel for
environmental management. Biro Lingkungan Hidup, for example, has 20
staff, mainly administrative. Of the staff with academic degrees, most are
economists, one geographer and one agricultural specialist. There are no
chemists, biologists, etc. and it will be difficult obtaining them at the current
zero growth personnel policy.
At present it is not functional to further assess environmental capacities and

Ulmbrella Environmental Assessement                     Environmental Sector
skills of institutional bodies. When Bapedalda has been established, it shall
be adequately staffed to perform their task of environmental management in
Bali, including that of BUIP. It is likely that the establishment, staffing and
equipping of Bapedaida Tk I is a prerequisite to creating the necessary
capacity and capability for environmental management in Bali. As this
organization does not yet exist it is as yet impossible to determine the
capacity and capability for environmental management.
Experience with review and public participation during the implementation
period of BUIP will reveal capacities and skills of other parties involved, such
as NGOs and private individuals. It is expected that their function will mainly
be that of maintaining a satisfactory level of environmental awareness.
10.2  Preparation, review and implementation of Andal, UKL/UPL and SOP
The final engineering consultant and the Project Management Office of
Bappeda-l should assist Local Government staff, by preparing the Andal for
those sub-projects that require a full environmental assessment, using this
Umbrella Environmental Assessment and annexes as a reference source. In
addition, they should assist Local Government in preparing standard clauses
for environmental management and monitoring measures to be incorporated
in all tender documents and construction contracts, using the UKL/UPL for the
PJM's as prepared by Local Government.
Review of the AMDAL documents (KA-Andal, Andal) is the responsibility of
the Provincial AMDAL-Commission. Review of RKL/RPL and UKL/UPL is the
responsibility of structural units of Provincial Government. It should be
coordinated by Bappeda, section SLH. BLH would participate in all reviews
and the cognizant technical dinas would be involved according to the sector
of the sub-project.
The purpose of reviewing is to ensure that the adequacy of environmental
safeguards is considered in the sub-project appraisal and that the manage-
ment and monitoring measures are included in sub-project design and
implementation.
The review should include screening of any proposed project sites, especially
for Final Solid Waste Disposal Sites (TPA's, for which field visits are a
necessary part of the review), to ascertain that they are not located in
protected or sensitive areas.
Approval of the RKL/RPL or UKL/UPL is a condition for sub-project approval.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                    Environmental Sector
There is a number of ways to promote and insure that environmentally sound
operating procedures are adhered to during the implementation of BUIP
projects:
1: The authorities responsible for initiating and implementation of the
projects, in this case the ministry of Public Works (PU), and Bappeda Bali
Tk 1, should take interest and responsibility for taking good care of the
environment, their organizations  should  incorporate  experienced
environmental specialists.
2: During the detailed engineering phase of BUIP, clear conditions directed
towards sound environmental practice shall be included in the tender
documents and contracts for execution of the work.
3: Supervising engineers, both of the contractors as well as of the super-
vising consultants should be environmentally trained. Since BUIP involves
a diversity of projects, scattered over a relatively large area, it is
recommended to prepare a training program for project supervisors (see
below).
Diagram IV presents the key agencies involved in environmental manage-
ment.
RKL/RPL and UKL/UPL implementation heavily depend on training of
PIMPRO's, incorporating environmental management and monitoring
measures as fully as possible into tender documents and construction
contracts and required reporting from Local Government to Provincial. Final
engineering design consultants and Bappeda-l and 11 should insure that the
documents include these items as general conditions of contract or sub-
project specific requirements, as appropriate. Standard Operation Procedures
(SOP), being developed by BAPPEDA-1 for this type of project, will specify
Dati-ll reporting requirements for UKL/UPL implementation, so that it is
explicitly addressed by all PIMPRO's, overseen by the Provincial
Government, and included in quarterly progress reports.
10.3  Capacity to perform institutional environmental tasks
The particular tasks that need to be executed for BUIP in the environmental
sector will require that Provincial Goverment of Bali is able to undertake the
tasks as indicated on the left hand side of Table 10.3. This table also
indicates which agencies are responsible and which are involved in each of
these tasks.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                      Environmental Sector
An important first step in the environmental management tasks of the Provin-
cial Government is the screening of the BUIP projects in order to determine
which require an Andal, UPL/UKL or Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
The screening will be undertaken by a Screening Committee in which are
represented:
- KOMDA Andal
- Bappeda Tk I, if it concerns a Tk I project
- Bappeda Tk II, if it concerns a Tk II project
- Agency proposing and responsible for the project (Dinas PU Tk I or Tk II,
or other technical agency)

10.4  Training in Environmental Management
Propvincial personnel need training in UKL/UPL regulations and preparation
procedures, as well as in environmental issues relevant for infrastructure
projects, so they can provide a prompt and informed review of UKL/UPL
documents and advise Local Government personnel as needed.
Local Government personnel will require training in relevant environmental
issues and pertaining regulations, UKL/UPL preparation, incorporating
environmental management and monitoring requirements in tender
documents and construction contracts, as well as methods for supervising
UKL/UPL implementation.
This training should be conducted in the Kabupaten or Kotamadya offices so
that all staff involved can be trained. The training should include presentation
of actual case studies for each type of BUIP sub-projects.
After the above training is completed, Provincial and Local Government
personnel should participate together in a one day workshop to review the
Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)                         Page - 82



Umbrella Environmental Assessement                    Environmental Sector
training, share views on how UKL/UPL can best be prepared and
implemented. As a result of this workshop They should agree on working
arrangements for preparation, review, implementation, monitoring and
reporting.
To insure that the program meets the real training needs, the training program
should be developed by a consultant qualified in AMDAL and UKUUPL, in
consultation with Dati-l staff from Bapedalda Tk i, Bappeda, Division Physical
Infrastructure (Bidang Fisik & Prasarana), Environmental Section (Seksi LH)
and the Bureau Environmental Management (BLH) of the Secretariat of the
Governor's Office. Possibly training material developed for IUIDP in East Java
can be used as a starting point.
A draft TOR for the Environmental Training Component is provided in Annex
lX.
10.5  Conclusion
As yet, in Bali environmental management responsibility is fragmented
between different agencies, lacking sufficient qualified personnel for envi-
ronmental tasks.
Soon the Provincial Environmental Agency Bapedalda will be estabiished, it
shall be adequately staffed to perform their task of environmental manage-
ment in Bali, including that of BUIP.
It is likely that the establishment, staffing and equipping of Bapedalda Tk I is a
prerequisite to creating the necessary capacity and capability for environ-
mental management in Bali.
RKL/RPL and UKL/UPL implementation heavily depend on training of all
parties involved. This training should be conducted in the Kabupaten or
Kotamadya offices so that all staff involved can be trained. To insure that the
program meets the real training needs, the training program should be
developed by a consultant qualified in AMDAL and UKLUUPL. A draft TOR for
the Environmental Training Component is provided.

CHAPTER 11
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
11.1  Policies and Legislation
In Indonesia, Environmental Management policies and legislation are well
developed on the National level. On the Provincial level,
Bali-specific legislation and standards should be further developed.
Full effort should be devoted to make existing legislation more effective. The
EA process can contribute to this, by scoping and focusing on the important
issues and by proposing effective environmental management and monitoring
provisions.
Competent authorities can be more stringent in including requirements in
permits and licences, and enforce living up to these conditions.
11.2  The Bali Environment
The most sensitive areas in Bali, from the natural environmental point of view,
are the Natural Conservation Areas, including the Mangrove Forests. From a
point of view of Public health the water catchment areas need to be
protected. The areas most sensitive to development and improvement of
Urban Infrastructure probably leading to progressing urbanization, are the
sub-urban and semi-rural areas situated on the periphery of existing urban
areas, and bordering on the rural and natural areas. Great care should be
taken to preserve the social, cultural and rural (agricultural and scenic)
aspects of these areas.
Although most of the BUIP projects will improve Quality of Life (improved
Public Health, better roads and sidewalks, improved drainage, less litter) in
the urban areas, air pollution, noise and risk of accidents may increase due to
increased and faster moving traffic.
11.3  Potential Environmental Impact
Important potential impacts of BUIP are:
- Stimulation of urbanization and traffic;
- The need for resettlement of people, for projects needing land acquisition,
such as new or widened roads, final solid waste disposal sites, water and
-,.sewage treatment plants, and new, expanded or relocated markets and

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                       Environmental Sector
parking lots;
- Pollution of surface water, ground water and soil, by waste and sludge
disposal;
- Social and cultural impact by new or expanded (widened) roads, bus ter-
minals, parking lots, markets etc.;
- Increased risk of accidents on widened or improved roads. Impact on la-
ndscape values by new roads and solid waste dumps. Impact of road
widening will have impacts especially in sub-urban and semi-rural areas.
11.4  Prevention and Mitigation
For Urban Infrastructure, in most cases negative environmental impacts can
be avoided by 'integrated' design, that is: taking environmental interests into
account right from the beginning of the development process.
This is achieved by educating the design engineers and / or by including
environmental specialists in the design team. Not seldom this results in an
overall better solution.
Remaining negative impacts shall be mitigated to acceptable levels by techni-
cal and managerial measures in design, construction and maintenance
phases of the BUIP sub-projects as indicated above, and after EA / Andal to
be formulated in RKL/RPL, UKL/UPL and SOP and incorporated in Permits,
Tender Documents and Construction Contracts.
Realisation of mitigative measures should be enforced, and effectiveness
monitored by government inspection.
11X1.5  Screening for further EA
Criteria have been developed for environmental screening of BUIP sub-
projects as proposed for implementation in the PJMs. These criteria are
based on GOI regulations and IBRD guidelines. Screening will be effected in
a Screening Committee consisting of representatives of all agencies involved,
including IBRD.
A Screening Committee will determine whether full EA / Andal is required or
UKL/UPL is necessary. Remaining sub-projects are required to prepare SOP.
The EA documents, Andal/RKLURPL, UKLUUPL and SOP should clearly
describe operational environmental mitigating, management and monitoring
measures, so that these can be incorporated in permits/licences, tender
documents and construction contracts.

Umbrella Environmental Assessement                    Environmental Sector
The screening process should be accompanied by environmental training, for
which a training consultant should be engaged.
11.6  TOR for Andal
For EA / Andal, regulations and 'general guidelines' of the GOI are compre-
hensive. More specific 'technical guidelines' for BUIP type of projects are not
yet available and should be developed by Bappeda. The first step in the
AMDAL process is preparation by the proponent of the TOR: the KA-Andal,
which has to be reviewed and accepted between the proponent (mostly PU),
the responsible agency (Bappeda) and the Provincial AMDAL-Commission
(KOMDA AMDAL).
Among the topics to be treated in each Andal is the comparison of alternative
solutions for the project. For BUIP sub-sectors, issues that should be elabora-
ted on in the Andal and thus have to be stipulated in the KA-Andal are
mentioned above. They concentrate on potential impacts that should be
avoided, because they are irreversible or difficult (or expensive) in mitigation.
11.7  Public Consultation
Public Consultation during the preparation phase of BUIP took place on the
basis of invitation. It was organized on three administrative levels: Province,
Kabupaten/Kotamadya and local. NGOs were invited for the Kabupaten level
workshops. Representatives of women, youth, private sector as well as
leaders of farmers, towns and desas were invited for local discussions.
Separate consultation of women took place on a basis of random encounters.
Concerns expressed by the public were mainly concentrating on co-ordination
between BUIP sub-sectors, eg. between road improvement and drainage, on
preservation of the cultural heritage and on continued consultation with the
public.
This UEA will be published and the public will be consulted on the potential
impact and environmental management during BUIP implementation. It is
expected that experience with this public participation will be used in improve
the participation process for further EA of BUIP sub-projects that are
screened to require Andal.
11.8  Institutional Operational Capacity and Training
As yet, in Bali environmental management responsibility is fragmented

RKL/RPL and UKL/UPL implementation heavily depend on training of all
parties involved. This training should be conducted in the Kabupaten or
Kotamadya offices so that all staff involved can be trained. To insure that the
program meets the real training needs, the training program should be
developed by a consultant qualified in AMDAL and UKL/UPL. A draft TOR for
Environmental Training is provided.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR CONSULTANCY SERVICES
FOR THE rREPARATION OF THE
BALI ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM
(B * E * I * P)
I    BACKGROUND
1.1   Current Urban Development Program Under Implementation
The Provincial Governm=ent of Bali, together witlh the 9 local governments
in the province are presently implementing the Integrated Urban Infrastructure
Development Program (IMIDP). IUIDP or "P3KI" as it is popularly known in
Bahasa Indonesia comprises  physical investments and   operation and
maintenance (0&M) in seven (7) public works sectors, namely: water supply,
urban  roads,   urban  drainage, solid  waste  management,   human
waste/sanitation,   kampung  improvement program  (KIP) and  market
infrastructure improvement program (MIP). The IIJID program is embodied in
a medium term planrning document called the "Program Jangka Menengah" or
popularly known as the PJM. Other than the proposed physical investments and
provisions for O&M expenses, the PJM also comprises other important
components suclh as the Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAP), the Local
Institutional Development Action Plans (LIDAP) and the Financial Capacity
Assessment/Financial Plan for the implementing agency (i.e. Pemda Tk II or
PDAMs).
At the start of the program implementation in early 1992 the approved
projects in tlhe PJMs were documented in the form of Project Memoranda. The
lists of project memoranda were then used as the basis for the annual IRakorbang
and budget preparation processes; these lists also formed the basis for the
subsequent recording of the projects in the accounting and financial reporting
system of thle program, using tlhe PFAMS system.
Tihe IUIDI' for Bali Province, or commonlv known as the Bali Urban
Development lProgram-i is one of tlhe two major components of the East Java Bali
Urbaan Developmlent P'roject of th-e IBRD (Loan 3304-IND). Tlle province is now
in its last year of implenmenitation of the five-year program. Overall progress in
program implem-ienitationl lhas been generally very satisfactory, except for a delay
in tlle implementation of the water supply project of PDAM Baduing, which
comnprises a suibstai-uial portion of tlhe rovincial program.
T.O.R f3AU  E      PROGC .BAI1



Furthlernmore, the program has encountered a major problem in thie form of
inadequate external funding for the last year of implementation, altlhough this
problem lhas now been substantially resolved.   This problem  came about
because in the course of program implementation, substantial revisions were
necessitated - thereby resulting in a substantial increase in program cost (e.g.
PDAM Badung water supply project). On the other hand, no additional increase
in external funding was provided for the program.
1.2   Proposed Bali Environmental Infrastructure Program
As the title suggests, the proposed Bali Environmental Infrastructure
Program (BEIP) covers a much wider scope than what is presently being
implemented. Th-e proposed program for the period FY 1996/97 to FY 2000/01
is discussed in the paper entitled "Outline of the Proposed Bali Environmental
Infrastructure Programn", which should be read in conjunction with this TOR
The objective and the components comprising the proposed five-year program
are discussed in section 2.
The expansion in the scope of the Bali urban development program, has
evolved from  the present IP3KT to P2KT plus regional development and
environmental concems, takes into account the current thinking of GOI and the
IBRD.
1.3   Status of Program Preparation
Although the program preparation is still at its conceptualization stage,
some likely components of the program are already identified and proposed by
thie participating local goverrnments.  During a series of technical sessions
undertaken in February 1994, under the auspices and guidance of the PPMO Tk
I Bali and its advisory team, each of the nine (9) Pemda Tk II in Bali Province
prepared a draft PJM for the next five-year period. The draft PJM comprises
all the essential components, including the strategic urban development plan,
physical investment and O&M proposals, RIAP, LIDAP and financial capacity
assessment/finalncial plan. The physical investment and O&M proposals in the
draft PJiMs cover all the six (6) sectors which are the direct responsibility of the
Pemda Tk II, namely: urban roads, urban drainage, solid waste management,
ihluan wiaste/sanitation, KIP and MIIP. However , th-e consultant under th-is
aissignment, togetlher witlh the PDAMs, and under guidance of PP'MO and
PIP'U, shiould develop thie PJMs for water supply sector.
The draft PJlMs lhave thieir limitations. Most of the RIAPs and financial
capacdit assessmnt/financial plans have still to be refined furthier. Obviously,
the financial CapaICitv assessments and finan-cial plan would also hiave to be
redone, in vievc of thie expanlded scope of thle program; furtheer, the funds
allocatiun aind chiaunneling arrangements presently in use, and wlhich were used
as tlhe b--s!s of tLe drtit IJMls, may substantially change uncier thle next programr.

The program preparation consultants should take the draft PJMs into
account. Furth-er refinements in the RIAPs already prepared by Pemda Tk II
should take into account the work presently being done in tlis area by the
Pemda Tk II, under the guidance of thie RIAP consultants provided under the
current prog-ram. Likewise,  O&M  provisions should take into account the
work of the POMMS consultants (also provided under the current program) and
the Pemda Tk UI in Batch 1 (Batch 2 Pemda Tk II, while not covered under the
scope of the POMMS implementation work, are expected to be trained as well
by the POMMS consultants).
2     OBJECTIVE AND COMNONENTS
2.1   Objective of the BEIP
The primary objective of the BEEP is to promote sustainable urban and
regional development in Bali Province. This is to be accomplished through a
program  of investrnents that ameliorate degraded conditions in the urban
environment as well as provide additional infrastructure to advance the
objectives of the provincial strategic structure plan in a manner consistent with
the opportunities and constraints inherent in Bali's natural and socio-culturai
resources. Forming part of the foregoing objective are the strengthening of the
institutional capacity, environmental management among the various agencies
and units tlhat will participate in the program, and involvement  of tlhe public in
project preparation.
2.2   Components of the BELlp
Th-is program, which will take into account Bali's unique natural and
socio-cultural features, will have a number of innovative aspects, including: a
provincial perspective, based on the provincial strategic structure plan; increased
decentralization, with project preparation being the responsibility of the
provincial government, and enhanced roles anticipated for provincial and local
government agencies in project implementation; community participation in
project preparation  and  implementation, and  coumunity  education  on
enviromnental issues during project implementation; and preservation of Bali's
unique cultural properties.
The overall prognuxn will consist of the following major components:
(a) A  five  year  lntegated  Urban  Developmtent  lProgram   (ProgrTZI
Penibangunin Kota Terpadu, or P2KT), with an emplhasis on environimental
infrastructutl-e suLb-projects, including investments in sectors suclh as w-ater
supply, sanitation, solid wvaste disposal, drainage, urban roads and traific
|management (e.g., in greater Denpasar and Singaraja), .3s wvell as in
|mnarkets, tTrinsport terminals and parkin- facilities.

(b)  A five year Regional Infrastructure Development Program, which will
address provincial needs, especially in thle greater Denpasar area, for:
coordination in planning and provision of solid waste and waste water
treatment facilities; sharing of water resources among urban  areas;
provision of infrastructure in tourism areas; and, if appropriate, inter-urban
roads.
(c)  A program  to inventory Bali's unique cultural properties, including a
condition assessment, and an estimate of the costs of rehabilitation and on-
going maintenance.
(d) Institutional development and capacity building for urban environmental
management at provincial and local government levels, especially in areas
such as land-use planning and control, medium term investment planning,
programming and budgeting, operations and maintenance, revenue
enh-ancement, and cost recovery for services.
(e)  A program to promote environmental awareness in the general population,
as well as goverrunent officials. This component will utilize broadcast and
print media to educate the general public, will develop materials for
environmental education (on urban environmental topics) in schools, and
will also provide training to government officials, both in envirorunmental
agencies and in operating agencies.
(f)  Technical assistance for program implementation, especially for the various
agencies and units directly involved in program implemnentation, as well as
TA for the development of an environmentl plan for the urban areas of
Bali and the surrounding areas.
(g) Identification of opportunities and formulation of options for private sector
participation in the provision and operation of urban infrastructure and
environmtental management services.
3     SCOPE OF WORK
1hlie con-sultasncy assistance being, sought is expected to provide assistance
in tlle preparation of the BEIP tn the Prr)vincial Government of Bali, all the
Penmda Tk 11, and otheer con-cerned agen-cies and ulnits which will be involved in
the progradim implementation. The preparation of the program should include
the participation  of conununities through appropriate means, in addition to
the actit'e intvolvernent of all participating agencies. The various program

provincial level shall be prepared directly by the progran proponents, with the
guidance of the consultancy assistance.
The consulting team is expected, however, to prepare tihose components
which are bevond tile teclnical expertise of the provincial and local government
units to undertake by themselves-namely, the  economic and   financial
feasibility analyses for the projects comprising the program and wlhich need to
be justified from the economic and financial points of view. The consulting
assistance is also expected to provide the expertise in evaluating the various
program proposals of participating agencies and in providing guidance to the
Provincial Government in the formulatian of the high-priority investments in the
first phase of the prog-ram.
The consulting assistance will be responsible, either directly or indirectly,
in the preparation of the following:
3.1   Review of the Strategic Structure Plan (RUTR)
The consultants shall familiarize themselves with the RIJTR for Bali
Province through discussions with Unit P2R of Dinas PU and with Bappeda Tk
I. There are two purposes for this review: (a) to ensure that the high-priority
investmnents to be implemented during Phase I of BEIP are consistent with the
RUTR, and (b) to serve as a foundation for developing the Terms of Reference for
the environmental plan to be prepared during project implementation.
3.2   Preparation of Phase I: Sub-Project Selection Criteria
On thle basis of tlteir review of the RUTR and the land-suitability criteria
adopted in the ADB-supported Land Resources and Marine Resources
Evaluation and Planning Projects (LREP, and MPEP, respectively), and thle
necessary  envirorunental assessments, the  consultants  will recommend
appropriate selection and siting criteria to be used in determining the
investments to be undertaken in Phase I. These recommendations will be
presented to Bappeda Tk I for review and clearance. A similar review will also
be undertaken bv the Central Advisory Committee for the the BEIP.  It is
I ecognized that these criteria will be for interim  use and will probably be
modified during thie preparation of th-e environmental plan before they are
applied to IPlhase ll of the project.
3.3   Preparation of Environiental Assessments
The consultant *ill prepare  Environmental Assessments (EA) for tlle
progrnam. In lin-e witU- Lie Bank's practice, Sectoral Environmental Assessments
(Sectoral I LA) sfiuld he prepared for the overall project. ITle mavin purposes of

the Sectoral EA are (a) to identify tile enviromnental issues and constraints in
Bali Province pertinent to the types of activities likely to be supported under the
project and (b) to develop appropriate environmental management approaches
for thiem. Besides the generic impacts associated withl possible investments, the
Sectoral EA will also address, among other topics: information gaps in tlle sector;
sector policies; the imnpacts of current investment planning and implementation
practices in the sector; capacity of environmental management institutions;
public attitudes and environmental awareness; and economic incentives for
environmental protecton. The recommendations will include : appropriate
application of ANDALs (be it project-specific, regional, etc.); use of standard
operating procedures, best practice, or generic mitigation plans; improved
facilities planning and site-selection processes; baseline data collection programs;
institutional strengthening; private-sector involvement, etc. The Sectoral EA will
be based prinicipally on existing information sources; primary data collection will
be minimal. However, the consultant will design and assist in administering a
public consultation process ( coordinated with related activities described in
Section 3.4 and 4.3 below).
Before commencing tihe Sectoral EA, the consultant should consult with
;          BAPEDAL and witlh Bappeda, Komisi Daerah, and BBLH of Bali Province, agree
on the proposed approach, and prepare a work plan for review to ensure
consistency with World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 and GOI Regulation
Number 51 of 1993 (PP 51). Attachment 1 to this TOR provides further guidance
on Sectoral EA.
3.4   Resettlement
The extent of resettlement, if any, will not be known until specific
investments are identified.   However, under the assumption  that some
resettlement will be required, preliminary planning will be accomplislhed during
preparation to ensure that the requirements of Banak Operational Directive 4.30
("Involuntary Resettlement") will be met In conjunction withl tlhe preparation of
the Sectoral EA, the consultanlts will:
(a)  Review existing policies and procedures for land acquisition, compensation,
resettlement and relhabilitation in Bali province, ' vith particular attention to
issues of entitlemelit and procedures for consultation wN.itlh affected groups;
(b)  Review recen-t experience withl these activities in Bali
(c)  Assess institutionoli  capacity to impleimen-t resettlemelnt;
,d) ldentnfy cac-as in which cuirreint practice dLoes not meet OD 4.30 objectives;

(e) Describe remedial actions.
In addition, for projects identified for implementation in the first phase,
any site-specific resettlement plans necessary will be prepared for Bank review
prior to appraisal, along with an estimate of costs of resettlement activities that
would require funding by local governments. Indonesian counterparts will be
assigned to participate in all aspects of the resettlement planning process to
ensure transfer of methodology from the consultants.
3.5   Identification of High-Priority Investments to be Implemented During
Phase 1 of the Program
The consultants will assist the provincial government and Pemda Tk II in
developing the list of high priority investments to be proposed for funding
during the first TWO vears of the program. This activity will include
consultation witlh local governments, NGOs, religious and cultural organizations,
community organizations, local academic experts, private sector representatives
and the public. (See Section 4.3 below).
TIhe integrated nature of the program will require analysis of data
covering a wide range of sectoral and geographical divisions. As has been
successfully demonstrated in recent IUIDP projects, the collection, management,
analysis and presentation of such data can be greatly enhanced and expedited
with the use of highly efficient, fast, user-friendly, interactive graphics based
GIS.  The consultants shall use a suitable GIS to construct a preliminary
integrated spatial data base, which shall form the analytical and presentational
framework for preparation of the environmental plan, as well as the foundation
for furtlher support to environmental and other planining and monitoring
processes during program implementation.
Recent IUIDI' program preparation experience has shoown thiat thle use of
highly accurate digital map data in preliminary spatial analyses can substantially
improve the reliability and validity of subsequent evaluation and planning
processes based upon thiem. The consultants shall, whenever possible, make use
of thie considerable amiount of relevant existing data for Bali already available in
digital form. Wh-ere necessary and feasible, relevant existing non-digital data
will be digitized. The preliminary integrated spatial data base shall include land
suitabilit) criteria und strategic plhysical planning data generated by thie LREP
uand MREP projects, data from the review of tlhe Provincial RUTR, as wx ell as data
from otlier relevant Bali studies completed or in progress. Iicremental results of
the urban/regional development and enviroinmental planuning processes shall be
stored directl1 inl tlhe data base.

In addition to formal analytical uses, early establishment and subsequent
incremental aug,mentation and refinement of the GIS based system and data
base wvill be required to meet the increasing need for accurate and reliable
custom mappin-g as an interpretive, analytical and presentation/reporting tool
during program preparation and implementation. The system shall be capable
of rapid full screen reviewN- and print production of hiigh-quality monochrome
and color map output at a variety of scales and sizes, fully customized for
specific needs. The consultants shall use GIS programming tools for rapid,
iterative development and refinement of a set of custom application utilities to
give non-specialist users a standardized means for easy and efficient access,
exploration and analysis of data base.
In common with similar GOI initiated developments currently underway
elsewhere in the Public Works and other ministries, it is expected that during
program implementation the GIS based system will' be furthler integrated and
expanded, with direct links to other systems and data bases to facilitate spatially
enhanced interpretation, analysis and reporting of data of all types, and their
spatial inter-relationships.    These  links  should  include, firstly, other
*           planning/modelling systems (e.g. transport modelling) and, secondly, program
monitoring and management systems, both established (e.g. PFAMS) and under
development (e.g. POMMS).
3.6   Guidance to the Program Proponents in the Preparation of the PJM
The consultants shall provide expert guidance to the participating
provincial agencies, deconcentrated project offices, Pemda Tk II and its PDAMs
in the preparation of the PJM of each program proponent The guidance shall
include the application of national guidelines on  program  and  project
preparation and appraisal. As mentioned in section 3.2 the program may be
divided into tAwo phases, namely: (a) phase 1, which shall comprise all the 1high-
priority projects during the first two years of the program, and (b) phase 2,
*which shall comprise all the other projects which are proposed for inclusion in
the program, along with an indicative resource envelope.
High priority projects in Plhase I should be supported by full teclhnical,
economnic, enivirounmental and financial feasibility analyses suitable for appraisal
by Peemda Tk I, I'usat, and the World Bank, takintg intto account thle teeluhical
uieuloranrda anld the econom-ic and finanicial guidelinles w, hich will be issuedf by
concer-n-edi nationzal agenicies in due course. Reports required under tile AMDAL
process slhould also be provided along withl the project feasibilily studies. The
consultants sliould be aw-are that while thie fulfilll.ment of AMDAL requirenments
-as promulgated in 1'l'5o  and regulations thereunder is generally sufficient for
compliance w,-ith Bank's requirements for enviroinnleintal assessment emi-lbodied in
Operaolnail Directive 4.01. there are somiie exceptions. Chlief anicong tiielt is tll;I

facilities, whereas KEP-l1/.MEN/LH/3/1994 exempts landfills receiving less
than 800 tons per dav. Projects involving land acquisition that necessitate loss of
property or income or involuntary resettlement will also be subject to the
requirements of the World Bank Operational Directive 4.30, Involuntary
Resettlement.
Preparation of the PJM would basically follow the process which was
successfully used in the P3KT; in addition, the consultants shall consider the
phasing of the projects as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs. The PJMs
should likewise contain the basic parts as contained in the "Outline of the Bali
Environmental Infrastructure Program". These would consist among others, of:
(a) development considerations, (b) proposed investments and O&M, (c)
proposed institutional arrangements, (d) RIAP, (e) LIDAP, and (f) financial
capacity assessments and financial plan.
In cases where tlhe program proponents lack the technical capability to
prepare the PJM, the consultants should  prepare thie program together with
selected key personnel from the program propoiients.
3.7  Identification of the Technical Assistance Needed for Program
Implementation
The consultants, together with the provincial government, shall identify
the various technical assistance (consultancy/advisory support and training)
needed to implement the program.  Some of these tecluical assistance
components are mentioned in the "Outline of the Bali Environmental
Infrastructure Program". Likewise, Terms of Reference (TOR) shall also be
prepared for each teclnical assistance component and for the environrmental
planning process from which thle remainder of the investment component will be
derived.
The consultancy/advisory support for the program implementation
should also have tlhe capability to prepare thie detailed projects comprising the
remainder of the program  from  tlhe 3rd to the 5th year,  including the
preparation of project feasibility studies and AMDAL.
3.S   Preparation of the Project Preparation Report and Implementation  Report
Tile conisultants shall prepare the Project Preparahon Report and the
Project Implementation Report, wlhich   slhall be used  by the Provincial
Goverrunent as thle basis for the request for programl funding assisLance. These
tw o repoi Ls slhould be prepared in formnats wArhiclh are similar to the ones
prepared for the recenit Senmarang-Surakarta Urban Development Project; these

reports will be used de t:he basis for the appraisal of t1he entire program by f0
and byl the lending agencies, including the rBRD.
The Project Preparation Report shall present a summary of tlhe program as
well as of the individual project components, particularly for the high-priority
projects for inclusion in thie phase 1 of the program. It slhall also show in detail
the proposed institutional arrangements for the implementation of the program,
summary of RIAPs, summary of LIDAPs, financial assessment and financial
plan summary. It shall also include draft Program Implementation Agreements
(PIA) between the Pemda Tk I and the various program proponents.

authority to coordinate contractual arrangements for this project
.;The final acceptance of works as meeting contractuai commitments and
approvals of contract or work schedule adjustment proposals will come from
Bappeda Tk I Bali. Bappeda Tk I Bali will in tum base its approvals on the
evaluation and endorsement of the existing Provincial Program Management
Office (PPMO) at tlhe Bappeda Tk I.
Although most of the program components are expected to be prepared
directly by thle program proponents, tle consultants shall be responsible for the
quality of preparation of all the components forming part of the PJMs.
4.2   Coordination With the Program Proponents and On-Going
Technical Assistance/Advisory Teams
The consultants slhall, during tlhe term of tlhe assignment, maintain close

with the on-going teclhnical assistance teams for the current program. These
consultancy/advisory supports include those of the PPMO, PPMU, PPFO,
PFAMs, RIAP, POMMS, and UP2L training consultants. Coordination slhould
also be undertaken withll other consultants working in thae tourism and regional
development sectors. These consultancy and advisory assistance teams are very
useful sources of inputs in the preparation of the BEIP.
4.3   Public Consultation
The consultant is required to ensure that the proposed project incorporate
findings from a process of public consultation. The consultant will design and
carry out a public consultation process that will: provide for informed
participation by the public; elicit information on needs for local community
environmental infrastructure and services and preferences for how they can be
met; enable transfer of local knowledge to those designing and implementing the
project; and be sensitive to unique aspects of Balinese culture and custom and
community organization, as well as to the particular views and needs of women
(who often play the primary role in environmental management at the household
and community levels). The process should provide for involvement of at least
thie following groups: women, youth, religious leaders, hotels, local business
persons, NGOs concemed with the environment and with low-income
communities, and educators.
In this context, the consultant is expected to arrange and facilitate at least
two workshops during project preparation, within approximately two months of
contract award: one for local government officials, and the second for
representative of interest groups such as tlhose outlined above. The consultant
will also assist in tlhe formation and support of a Permanent Advisory Committee
representilng citizens and inter.est groups, which will provide a means for
continuous dialogue between citizens and groups on the one hand and BEEP
consultants and government  officials on the otler. Other means of public
inform-iation and consultation should be employed as appropriate.
The consultant is also required to design .and conduct real demand
surveys according to established IUIDP/IIUDP procedures. Survey work plan
and instruments for the surveys are to be prepared in consultation witlh Bappeda
Tk. I and DGCK prior to initiation of the survev work.

Sectoral Environmental Assessment
Sectoral environmental assessment (SEA) is a much needed complement to project-specific EAs in development planning.
Where project EAsJfcus on the impacts of specific inxestments and of en treat sector strategic planning as a given, SEA offers an
opportunity for sector-wide envzronmental analysis before invcstment prwritis have been determined. It also supports integration
of environmental cocerns into long-term deadopment and investment planning. SEA is most cornmonly applied in the contert of
f sector investment progrmrns inroving multiple sub-prvjects. It can also be applied in conjunction with sector-oriented time-slice
and line-of-credit projects, and even with sector adjustment operations or in eraluation of sector policies.
This EA Sourcebook Update, which belongs to Chapter 1: The Environmental Review Process (Update Binder), dexscribes SEA
in terns of advantages, operational context, selection criteria, and components. It also discusses what some of the challenges associ-
ated uwith SEA preparation are, and how SEA is being used in Bank operations. This Update expands on etisting information in

ANNEX IV
BALI URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM
TERMS OF REFERENCE
PREPARATION OF AMDAL DOCUMENTS
1.   Background
As a result of the screening process to which all BUIP sub-projects will be
subjected, it is likely that a number of sub-projects are required to follow the
AMDAL procedure. This procedure requires preparation of a series of
AMDAL documents that need be reviewed and accepted by the Bali Provin-
cial AMDAL-Commission and the IBRD, before a permit for implementation
of the sub-project can be granted by the responsible agency.
It is to be expected that about 5 sub-projects will meet the criteria requiring
the AMDAL procedure to be followed:
- New Road (Western By-pass, Denpasar)
- New Bridge (near K!ungkung)
- New Sewage Treatment Facility (Site not yet known)
- New Final Waste Disposal Site (at Pesangaran)
- Drainage Channel (at Denpasar)
2.   Objectives
- To assist in screening BUIP projects for ANDAL.
- To prepare KA-ANDAL, ANDAL, RKL and RPL documents that will
satisfy the requirements of AMDAL Legislation and Guidelines of the
GOi, and that will gain acceptance by the Provincial AMDAL Commis-
sion as well as by the IBRD.
- The documents shall contain the information necessary to prepare
adequate and operational environmental management and monitoring
instructions that can be incorporated in Tender Documents and Con-
struction Contracts.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment                                    Draft
3.   Scope of work

Bapedalda and other parties involved in the AMDAL procedure.

UKL/UPL, or SOP.
- Collection of relevant base-line data and information, generic as well as
site-specific.
- Perform field survey.
- Take samples and perform analysis as deemed necessary.
- Prepare KA-ANDAL, ANDAL, RKL and RPL documents in Indonesian
Language, with Executive Summaries in English.

Subject           AMDAL Guidelines for P3KT -
BUIP Bali Province
Head of BAPPEDA Tk. I
Bali
Denpasar
In response to the letter of Deputy BAPPEDA Tk. I Bali No. 481/98/BAPPEDA dated 8
January 1996 re AMDAL Studies for P3KT- BUIP (Bali Urban Infrastructure Program), I
would like to clarify the following issues.
1.    Development activity plans of P3KT - BUIP stipulated in the Inception Report
annexed to the forementioned letter is basically an activity plan of infrastructure
development which is entirely under the authority of Public Works Department.
2.    On the basis of the AMDAL criteria stipulated in the Government Regulations or
PP No.51 Year 1993, it is justified that an activity plan whose license and
development are merely under one sector is obliged to process its AMDAL
through the AMDAL Committee of the Department of Public Works.
3.    Considering that the scope of studies and projects cover the whole area of Bali,
the conceptual framework of such studies should have well considered cumulative
impacts and been underlied by integrated spatial planning, a vital policy to be
implemented in the AMDAL study.
4.    Further procedural actions concerning this AMDAL should be consulted with the
Head of Central AMDAL Committee of the Department of Public Works.
-5.    Considering the strategic position of the project, discussions on each step of the
AMDAL documents should involve the Regional AMDAL Committee Tk. I Bali,
BAPPEDAL as well as other related sectors. Decisions concerning document
agreement should be first consulted with Regional AMDAL Committee of Bali.

All and each of the forementioned issues could be re-adjusted and re-considered if later
found additional and/or change of information and policy causing item 1 and 2 no more
inappropriate.
Thank you,

ANNEX IX
BALI URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
BUIP Environmental Training
I     Background
Environmental management is a major component in BUIP. During
project preparation it has been noticed that agencies at provincial
and local government level still lack capacity and capability to
execute various environmental management tasks. Partly, these
deficiencies will be addressed by the ongoing efforts of the
Indonesian Government to establish agencies for environmental
management and to equip these agencies with staff and legal author-
ity.Training and education of staff is another effort required to
strengthen the agencies and to enable provincial and local govern-
ment to execute the tasks for environmental management as
described in the relevant report of BUIP.
2     Objectives
To increase the capability of provincial and local government to undertake
environmental management tasks and responsibilities through training and
education of the staff assigned to the relevant aaencies.
3     Scope of *works
The training activities are an integral part of the Regional LIDAP and the
Environmental Management program under BUIP (see respective reports).
The training program will have to be prepared and conducted in conjunction
with the program described in attached barcharts. The primarv targets of the
trainiintg program are described in the attached table IX. that describes the
division of responsibilities for various environmental management tasks.
Mlalor activities to be undertaken bv the consultants assimned to the present

2.    IBRD screening criteria for EA per Annex E of Operational Directive
OD 4.01.
The purpose of screening, as stated in Annex E of IBRD Operational Direc-
tive OD 4.01, is 'to decide the nature and extent of the environmental
analysis (EA) to be carried out on the proposed loan or credit'.
Projects are assigned to one of three categories:
-     Category A:  Full EA is required;
-     Category B:  No full EA required, however, some environmental
analysis is necessary;
-     Category C:  No EA or other environrnental analysis is required.
The selection of the category should be based on professional judgment and
information available at the time of project identification. Below is a sum-
mary of the relevant sections of IBRD's OD 4.01:
Criteria for Making the Screening Decision
Initially, it is useful to look at key words in OD 4.01, Annex E, to describe
each screening category. The significance of impacts, and the selection of
screening category accordingly, depend on the type and scale of the project.
the location and sensitivity of environmental issues, and the nature and
magnitude of the potential impacts. When making a screening decision, each
of these criteria should be taken into consideration.
Category A
In general, certain types of projects either have or are likely to have
"adverse impacts that mav be sensitive, irreversible, and diverse."
Category A includes projects -whichl have one or more of the folloxw-
ing attributes that make the potential impacts "significant": direc.
pollutant discharges that are large enough to cause degradation of
air, water or soil: large-scale physical disturbance of the site and/or
air waer                   ors  Z
sulToundings; extraction.I consumption. or conversion of substantial
amounts of forest and other natural resources; measurable modifi-
cation of hydrologic cycle; hazardous materials in more than inci-
dental quantities; and involuntary displacement of people and other
significant social disturbances.
Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)                                Page 3



Umbrella Environmental Assessment
The following projects and components may have enivronmenrtal
impacts for which more limited analysis is appropriate.
-     aaro-industries;
-     electrical transmission:
-     aquaculture and mariculture;
-     irrigation and drainage [small-scale].
-     renewable energy;
-     rural electrification;
-     tourism;
-     rural water supply and sanitation;
-     watershed projects [management or rehabilitation];
-     rehabilitation, maintenance, and upgrading projects
[small-scale].
Category C
Category C projects generally do not require an environmental
analysis because they have negligible or minimal direct disturbance
on the physical setting. However, not all Category C projects are
entirely devoid of environmental impacts. For example. in a health
project, the design may have to provide for disposal of medical was-
tes.
These projects are likely to have nealigible or minimal environ-
mental impacts. No environmental assessment or analysis is required.
-     education;
-     family planning;
-     health;
-     nutrition;
-     institution development;
-     technical assistance;
-     most human resource projects.
Project Type and Scale
The above lists are based on prior experience, they provide a starting point
and framnework for the screening decision. However, because of other fac-
tors involved, such as project siting, the nature of impacts, and the need for
the EA process to be flexible enough to accommodate them, the lists are
onlyl atuidinE.
Bali Urban Infrastructure Program (BUIP)                                 Page 5



Umbrella Environmental Assessment
The projects or components included in the following list are likely
to have adverse impacts that normally warrant classification in
Category A.
~ -   dams and reservoirs
-     forestry and production projects
-     industrial plants [large-scale]
-     irrigation, drainage, flood control [large scale]
-     land clearance and levelling
-     mineral development [including, oil and gas]
-     port and harbor development;
-     reclamation and new land development;
-     resettlement and new land development;
-     river basin development;
-     thermal and hydropower development; and
-     manufacture, transportation, and use of pesticides and otlher
hazardous and/or toxic materials.
An environmental assessment (EA) is not limited to negative
impacts, but should encompass environmental benefits as well. A full
EA is the best vehicle to incorporate features in the project to
enhance positive impacts.
Category1 B
Projects in this category often differ from A-projects of the same
type only in scale. Large irriaation and drainage projects are usually
Category A; however, small-scale projects of the same type may fall
into Category B. Similarlv, a 50-meter hvdroelectric dam is clearly
large in scale and w;ll usually require Categ,ory A classification.
while low-head power dams are normally Category B. Construction
of a 50-km expressway would also require thorough environmental
analysis (Category A) due to scale, while rural road rehabilitation
will tend to raise only minor environmental issues (Categorv B).
Projects entailing rehabilitation. maintenance or upgrading rather
than new construction will usually be in Category B. A project with
any of these characteristics may have impacts. but thiey are less
likelv to be "significant" to the environment. Howvever. each case
must be judged on its own merits.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment
Project Location
The selection of a screening categorv often depends substantially on the
project setting, while the 'sianificance' of potential impacts is partly a
function of the natural and socio-cultural surroundin0gs.
There are a number of locations makin(z serious consideration of a category
'A' classification appropriate:
-      in or near sensitive and valuable ecosystems: wetlands, wildlands,
coral reefs and habitat of endangered species;
-      in or near areas with arclhaeologicai and/or historical sites or existing
cultural and social institutions;
-      in densely populated areas, where resettlement mav be required or
pollution impacts and other disturbances may be significant;
-      in regions subject to heavy development activities or where there are
conflicts in natural resource allocation:
-      alono watercourses. in aquifer recharge areas or in reservoir catch-
ments used for potable water supply;
-      on lands or waters containing valuable resources (e.g.. fisheries. min-
erals, medicinal plants, prime agricultural soils).
Sensitivity of Issues
Environmental issues that are sensitive within the Bank or the borrowina
country require special attention during the environmental analysis and
feasibility study, project appraisal and implementation. The project may
involve activities or environmental features that are always of particular
concern to the Bank as well as to many borrowers. These issues may
include (but are not limited to) disturbance of tropical forests. conversion of
xvetlands. potential adverse effects on protected areas or sites, encroachment
on lands or rights of indigenous peoples or other vulnerable minorities,
involuntarv resettlemenit, impacts on international waterways and otlher
transboundarv issues, and toxic waste disposal. The best way to ensure
proper treatmenit of suclh issues is to classify the project as Category A. so
that the level of effort will be adequate in terms of analytical expertise,
decision-making, inter-agency coordination, public involvement and disclos-
ure.

Umbrella Environmental Assessment
Nature of Impacts
The following examples of impacts warrant consideration of Category A
attention:
-     permanent conversion of potentially productive or valuable resources
(e.g., fishery, natural forests. wildiands), or destruction of natural
habitat and loss of bio-diversity, or environmental services provided
by a natural system;
-     risk to human health or safety (e.g., from generation, storage or
disposal of (hazardous) wastes, inappropriate occupational health and
safety measures, violation of ambient water or air quality standards);
-     displacement of large numbers of people or businesses;
-     absence of effective mitigatory or compensatory measures.
Magnitude of Impacts
There are a number of ways in which magnitude can be measured, such as
the absolute amount of a resource or ecosystem affected, the amount
affected relative to the existing stock of the resource or ecosystem, the
intensity of the impact and its timing and duration. In addition, the probabil-
ity of occurrence for a specific impact and the cumulative impact of the
proposed action and other planned or ongoing actions may need to be
considered. The impact may be different depending on its duration and
frequency of occurrence -- continuous or permanent, seasonal, intermittent
or accidental.
