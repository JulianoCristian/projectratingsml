Possible positive environmental\n            impacts from the project include: improved public health,\n            hygiene, and safety; decreased road noise; and improved\n            traffic patterns. Possible negative impacts and their\n            mitigation measures include: a) water demand increase\n            combined with an irrigation conflict, reduced groundwater\n            level, runoff possibilities, and increased waste water\n            amount - mitigated by reduced water speed, prompt\n            replantation, infiltration ditches or settlement basins,\n            careful water source and intake location selection,\n            underground water transport piping placed parallel to roads,\n            and sludge disposal at final site to avoid river\n            contamination; b) soil erosion and pollution - mitigated by\n            replanting and separate collection of clippings from dry\n            waste; c) resettlement of populace - mitigated by a\n            resettlement plan; d) noise and disturbance - mitigated by\n            locating markets away from densely populated areas and sound\n            barrier construction; e) reduced safety in rural areas;\n            mitigated by provision of safe crossings, signaling, and\n            speed limits; f) air quality, pollution and increased odor -\n            mitigated by use of vegetation to filter dust, seal dirt\n            access roads, use of closed sanitation treatment process,\n            closed garbage vans, and dump coverage, centralized\n            incineration and green zone creation; g) interference with\n            local drainage pattern and ground water; mitigated by\n            special attention to material and methods of sewers and\n            septic tanks construction, systematic inspections; selection\n            of dump sites above ground water level and covering dumps to\n            prevent rainwater infiltration; and h) flora and fauna\n            damage- mitigated by minimizing road cross section,\n            construction of animal crossings, and speed limits or fencing."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
