The project was a complex multi-sectoral urban\n            infrastructure project, with special emphasis on PSP and\n            cultural heritage, which expanded the decentralization\n            envelope in Indonesia. High quality at entry, strong client\n            commitment (especially at provincial and local levels), and\n            dedicated supervision from a field based Bank team enabled\n            the project to be implemented in a satisfactory manner,\n            despite the multi-layered crisis that affected Indonesia\n            from late 1997. The principal lessons concern handling the\n            PSP in water supply as a separate project; making the CHC\n            component more focused  on a limited number of activities\n            and making financing by the Bank and the Borrower more\n            effective; the efficacy of having strong leadership\n            commitment and field-based supervision; tackling the problem\n            of governance by making pioneering efforts made to benchmark\n            costs, and improve transparency; and lastly, focusing the\n            technical assistance component."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
