INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT ALD FECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE SECOND POWER TRA]'SMISSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $75
million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made 39 loans amounting to US $1,051 million
and the Association 30 credits amounting to US $1,294 million (both
loans and credits net of cancellations) to India of which eight loans
and three credits amounting to US $209 million (net of cancellations)
were for power projects. A further credit of US $23 million (Credit
No. 89-IN) was approved in 1966 as part of the Bank's contribution to the
Indus Basin Settlement of 1960. All of the power projects except one
were concerned primarily with the financing of additional generating
capacity; the exception was the First Power Transmission Project
(Loan No. 816-IN approved in 1965) under which all fifteen State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) were beneficiaries and which financed trans-
mission and distribution facilities in each of the States.
3.        The proposed project would assist in financing power trans-
miss-ion development programs as part of the Fourth Five-Year Plan
(I196/7h) to be carried out by SEBs in nine States of India and would
also support financial reforms being carried out.
4~.       This project was first appraised in November/December 1969;
the appraisal was updated by a further appraisal in December 1970.
At negotiations in March, 1971, the Borrower was represented by
Mr. K. A. Dave, Vice Chairman, Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC);
Mr. G. V. Ramakrishna, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance; and
Mr. P. P. Gangadharan, Member (Commercial), CWPC.
5.        A summary Statement of Bank Loans and IDA Credits to India
as at February 28, 1971, was included in my report on a proposed credit
to India for the Fourth Telecommunications Credit Project circulated
on April 8 (IDA! R71-17). The total amounts disbursed and undisbursed
as at March 31, 1971 for these loans and credits were as follows:

6.        In that report I also noted other projects we expect to have
ready for consideration by the Executive Directors before June 30, 1971
- namely, agricultural credit projects in Tamil Nadu and Haryana, Pochampad
Irrigation and Cochin Fertilizer.
7.        Since 1957, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totalling
Us $42.3 million, of which US $33-5 million represents loans and US $8.8
million equity.  As of   March 31,   1971  US $15.6  million of this total
had been disbursed and US $14.7 million cancelled or repaid leaving US $12.0
million undisbursed.   The largest commitment   is one   of US $18.0 million
to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertilizer plant in Goa.

PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "INDIA - Appraisal of the Second
Power Transmission Project" (PU-47a) on the proposed credit is attached.
10.       The Bank and IDA have had a long association with power develop-
ment in India starting in l950. Most of these projects have been concerned
primarily with the construction of specific generating plants and trans-
mission works directly related thereto; additions to generating capacity
under Bank/IDA financed projects amount to about 1.5 million kw, concen-
trated in the industrial Damodar Valley (Bokaro and Durgapur) in the East,
in the Bombay-Poona area (Trombay and Koyna) in the West, and at the Kotha-
gudem coal fields in Andhra Pradesh in the South.
11.       Over these last two decades, and more especially in the recent
years, the power sector has changed significantly.Interconnection of trans-
mission systems within each state was largely accomplished during the late
1960's, and plans are being implemented to integrate transmission systems
on a regional basis. Most types of electrical equipment are now manu-
factured in India, and significant export orders have been obtained
recently. SEBs, which were organized from government departments in the
late 1950's are seeking greater autonomy to manage their own affairs.
In 1963, the Government appointed the Venkataraman Committee to examine
the financial working of State Electricity Boards. The report of this
committee, which was accepted by the Government, made a number of proposals
including one which required that a rate of return of 11 percent should be
achieved by all Boards within 10 years. This proposal compares with the
7 and 8 percent rate of return covenants which the Bank Group had required
in its early lending operations in India.
IL2.      Over the period 1951 to 1970, energy generated has increased at
an average annual rate cf 12 percent and it is projected that this rate of
growth will be maintained over the next four years. Presently, there is
soni; excess generating capacity and India aims to increase its installed
capacity at an average annual rate of only 10 percent (i.e. from 15.5
million kw in 1970 to 22 million kw in 1974). The Fourth Plan (1969/74)
gives emphasis to the expansion of transmission and distribution, with
special attention being given to Statewide and regional grids as a means
to achieve a better balance between demand and capacity.
13.       The First Power Transmission Project (Loan No. 416-IN), approved
in June, 1965, had two important objectives. The first was to finance
imported equipment and materials required for the installation of high-
voltage transmission facilities which were being constructed in order to
interconnect systems within each of the States and to provide the first
steps toward integration on a regional basis. The second was to support
the reforms proposed by the Venkataraman Committee. Although physical
progress under the Project was slowed down somewhat by economic and other
difficulties, disbursements under the loan were affected much more by the
increasing emphasis placed by GOI on self-sufficiency and thereby, on
indigenous procurement wherever possible, often without much regard for
cost or delay. Largely as a result of these policies, US $20 million
of the original US $70 million was cancelled.    GOI also decided to



revise the Project in order to allow for some reduction in the
rate of implementation while extending the period of the Project from
3 years to 51t years. As a result, the remaining US $50 million of
Loan No. 416-IN financed imported equipment and materials for a sub-
stantially larger project as described in R 68-137 dated July 25, 1968.
11.       Just as physical implementation was delayed,so also performance
in relation to the rate of return targets fell substantially behind.
In 1969 a revised schedule was adopted which called for increases plhased over
the period 1970/71 to 1976/77 as outlined in my memorandum to the Executive
Directors dated March 10, 1969 (R 69-L8). The results for FY 1971 will not
be known until later this year, but present indications are that five of
the beneficiary SEBs will meet their interim targets; two others should
be close; but at least two, Bihar and Punjab, are expected to be well below.
15.       While there has been definite improvement during the last five
years and there is certainly a greater and growing awareness among SEBs
and State Governments of the importance of commercial factors and of the
usefulness of modern finaricial management, more has to be done not only in
increasing returns but also in improving accounting procedures. The
appraisal mission has given particular emphasis to two issues in the
financial field. First, although substantial investment in rural electri-
ficiation is being made,not enough is known about the impact of this invest-
ment on the finances of the various SEBs. Secondly, most Boards' (debt
service obligations are excessive and there is an immediate need to review
this situation.    In particular, many of the SEBs have not paid interest
on loans and these arrears will have to be dealt with.
16.       The nine SEBs participating in the present project plan a total
investment for the years 1969-7L4 of about US $2,260 million equivalent,
of which US $750 million is for transmission and distribution faci-Lities
and another US $410 million is for rural electrification. The nine SEBs
account for about 70 percent of India's total Fourth Plan investment in
the power sector, and the proposed credit of US $75 million would con-
stitute about 10 percent of their investment in transmission and distri-
bution over the five-year period. The Bank Group is the only source of
foreign assistance expected for this program. A further transmission
project, providing IDA financing for SEBs not included in the present
proposal, is scheduled for appraisal later in 1971.
17.       The project would provide equipment and materials needed Lo
construct about 4,500 circuit km of transmission lines operating at
voltages above 66 kV,and about 110 substations with an aggregate capacity
of about 3500 MVA. These are the lines and substations for which initial
site preparation, line surveys, or preparation of bids are in progress
in order to meet construction programs.

18.       Under the previous project, financing was provided only for
those goods which India had decided to import. Under the new project,
all procurement will be on the basis of international bidding in which
Indian and foreign suppliers are expected to compete. In evaluating
bids, a preference of 15 percent will be allowed for domestic manufacturers,
although the prevailing import duties for such items are significantly
higher than 15 percent. The estimated cost has been based upon ex-factory
prices for recent bids for similar goods together with some allowance
for reductions expected to result from international competitive bidding.
Indian manufacturers are expected to win a significant share of the bids,
and to the extent that .hey do, the proceeds of the credit will be used
to finance local expenditures. The GOI has agreed to issue import permits
promptly as required. Moreover, to avoid the kind of delay in disburse-
ments which occurred under the previous transmission loan, the credit
agreement provides that disbursement can be made only in respect of orders
placed not later than 18 months after the signing of the agreement.
19.       On the institutional side, the undertakings regarding financial
performance as revised in 1969 would continue to apply. In addition, GOI
has agreed to prepare financial data in respect of each SEB, separating
information relating to rural electrification from the Boards1 other supply
functions, so as to clarify problems relating to earnings, capital structure
and capital financing. The GOI has also agreed to discuss with State Govern-
ments arrangements for dealing with arrears of interest on government loans
and to make recommendations thereon by December 31, 1971. The treatment of
interest is part of a wider problem concerning certain provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act, tariff structures generally, and what capital
structure would be appropriate for these Boards which are growing rapidly
in asset size and responsibility. These broader issues will receive more
specific attention in subsequent Bank Group lending operations after the
renuested financial data has been analyzed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORIT(
20.       The draft Credit Agreement between India and the Association,
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Each SEB is required to give an undertaking regarding the implementation
of its part of the project, its management and financial performance
(Section 3.03 of the Development Credit Agreement). Under Section 8.02(b),
receipt of such an undertaking from each SEB is a condition of effective-
ness required in order to make effective the portion of the credit appli-
cable to that particular SEB.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-13a) mas distributed on April 24, 1970. As mentioned in
my report on the Fourth Telecommunications Project,which is scheduled to
be considered by the Executive Directors on April 20, the balance of' pay-
ments prospects and debt service position of India require that develop-
ment assistance continue to be provided to India primarily on concessionary
terms. A basic data sheet is annexed.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECCMMENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
