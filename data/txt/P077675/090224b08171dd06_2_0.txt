                        Implementation Support Visit: May 23 – June 8, 2011
Introduction

1.      A World Bank team participated in an implementation support visit to Serbia from May
23 to June 8, 2011. The objectives of the visit were to review (i) the overall implementation
progress in the four DILS components by sector; and (ii) the overall implementation progress in
the Serbia Health Additional Financing project. In addition, the team held initial discussions on
the health policy reform included in the Public Expenditure Development Policy Loan (PEDPL),
and agreed on conducting a Quality of Health Care study.1 The team met with representatives
of the beneficiary ministries and worked closely with all Project Administration Teams (PATs) at
the line ministry level (Ministry of Health, MoH, Ministry of Education Science, MoES, and
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, MoLSP), and the Fiduciary Services Unit (FSU).
2.      This Aide Memoire summarizes the main conclusions of the visit. The team is grateful
to teams from the Ministries of Labor and Social Policy, Education and Science, and Health, and
especially to the Minister of Education and Science, Mr. Žarko Obradović, the Minister of
Health, Dr. Zoran Stankovic, as well as Ms. Tinde Kovacs Cerovic, State Secretary of the Ministry
of Education and Science, Ms Nevena Karanovic, State Secretary from the Ministry of Health,
Ms. Elisabet Paunovic, State Secretary from the Ministry of Health, and Mr. Vuk Djokovic, State
Secretary from the Ministry of Finance.


                                            Serbia DILS project
3.      The DILS project has now been under implementation for approximately 19 months (the
project was approved in March 2008 and became effective in March 2009; the designated
account was established in June of 2009, and the project administrators were hired in August
2009). Significant progress has taken place since the last implementation support visit, in

  The team consisted of Ivana Aleksic (Human Development Specialist, Education and Social Protection), Ana Holt
(Health Specialist), Daniel Dulitzky (Lead Economist), Marijana Jasarevic (Operations Analyst), Nikola Kerleta
(Procurement Analyst), and Ethan Yeh (Economist). The Quality of Health Care study team included Alaka Holla
(Economist), Ana Holt, and Ethan Yeh.

September 2010. Most large activities included in the Procurement Plan are now under
implementation, with contracts signed and the first disbursements already realized.
4.      Table 1 shows commitments and disbursements during the life of the project and by
World Bank Fiscal Year, i.e. between July 1 and June 30 of a given year. While disbursements
from the beginning of the project until June 30, 2010 were approximately EURO 1.6 million,
between July 30, 2010 and May 25, 2011 DILS disbursed an additional EURO 4.9 million. By
May 25, 2011 total disbursements represented approximately 20 percent of the loan amount.
By June 30, 2011 it is expected that 24 percent of loan proceeds would be disbursed, and 56
percent committed.

5.      Figure 1 and Figure 2 show actual and projected commitments and disbursements over
time by sector (the DILS project support investments in three sectors: health, education, and
social protection). All sectors have significantly increased the pace of implementation relative
to the previous visit, in September 2010. From the beginning of the project until September 30,
2010 DILS had committed 18.2 percent of project funds and disbursed 8.4 percent. From
October 1, 2011 until June 30, 2011 it is expected that an additional 38 percent would be
committed and 16.2 percent more would be disbursed (most of it has already taken place).

6.     The following developments have contributed to normalize the pace of implementation
of the project: (i) the largest activities in health and social protection, related to Information
Technology, have all been contracted, and a schedule for implementation has been agreed, so
that disbursements should materialize at a predictable pace for the remainder of the project;
(ii) in education, the largest activity (the implementation of various lines of grants) required

                                                                                                         3
setting up a new institutional mechanism for requesting proposals, providing training to assure
good quality of proposals, support implementation, and monitoring performance.                  This
structure is now in place and the first set of grants have now been contracted (commitment
and disbursement of grants are almost simultaneous); from now on the implementation of
further grants should follow a predictable pace; (iii) also in education, a bottleneck identified
during the previous visit has been resolved. A management Board has been created in the
Ministry of Education and Science, to validate large activities financed by the Project. This
Management Board assures ownership of the activities by the entire Ministry, and
simultaneous decision-making by the various Ministry’s offices that are required to authorize
signing of contracts and payments. As a result, implementation of many activities has been
unblocked.
Improving planning.      As in the previous visit, some problems with planning need to be
addressed.     The Procurement Plan is outdated, the training plans have not been fully
completed, and the plan for committing the remainder of the loan proceeds has not been fully
laid out. The Procurement Plan is a key tool for managing, planning, and monitoring project
implementation activities, and therefore it is important that it always be updated. And while
the FSU has overall responsibility for consolidating the information reported in the
Procurement Plan, the sector teams/ the Project Administration Teams (PATs) are ultimately
responsible for relaying correct and up to date information to the FSU. Since the project
involves a very large number of project activities, better synchronization and a more systematic
approach will be needed.
Next Steps: A revised Procurement Plan will be submitted to the World Bank by July 15, 2011.
It will include an updated list of activities, justification for any proposed changes, updated start
and completion dates.
       a. The current Procurement Plan devotes approximately Euro 3Mn to training under
             various components. A training plan for the remainder of 2011 will be prepared and
             submitted to the Bank by July 15, 2011.
       b. A list of activities planned for the remainder of the project, by quarter, will be
             prepared and submitted to the World Bank by July 15, 2011.

7.       The World Bank team was apprised on grants activities already initiated by the line
ministries. Table 3 shows the total and the spent amounts per line of grant. Overall grants
represent about 25 percent of DILS, and approximately 34 percent of the total has already been
spent. Now that the structure for implementing the grants program in each line ministry has
been set up, the grants should disburse at a predictable and sustained pace. The Ministry of
Education and Science has indicated that Rural School Grants may not be implemented; in
which case the amount allocated to that line would be reallocated to another grant line. This
issue will be discussed during the Mid-Term review of the project.
8.       The World Bank team recommended to devote particular attention to the following
activities, because they have not been initiated yet and require large preparation time:
         a. Quality incentives for health care providers: DILS intends to support a pilot of
              performance-based incentives for health providers using a set of quality indicators
              that were developed by the National Committee on Quality. During the September
              2010 visit, a preliminary concept note was developed for an impact evaluation on
              quality incentives for health care providers. It was envisioned that these quality
              incentives would be implemented after the introduction of capitation payments in
              primary care beginning January 2011. Now that the introduction of capitation has
              been delayed, the World Bank team agreed with the Health PAT that the quality
              incentives could be introduced independently from capitation.
              Prior to conducting an evaluation, however, preparatory work remains related to the
              design and implementation of the quality incentives. Of the three issues identified in
              the September 2010 aide memoire, only the first has been resolved—it was agreed
              that a random sample of 40 dom zdravljas (DZs) from both DILS and non-DILS DZs


                                                                                                  6
          could be included in the pilot. Other remaining issues include: i) specific quality
          indicators and targets, ii) type and size of the incentive, iii) verification and counter
          verification methods, iv) flow of funds, v) institutional arrangements.
          Next Steps: The Health PAT agreed that a local consultant would be hired by July 15,
          2011, to: i) address these issues and finalize the design for the quality incentives
          pilot, ii) work with key stakeholders at the HIF and the MOH to reach agreement on
          the implementation of the quality incentives pilot. If this preparation work is not
          conducted soon, then the team will need to consider reallocating the funds.
       b. Procurement of vehicles for schools: during the September 2010 visit it was agreed
          that a consultant would be hired to prepare the technical specifications for vehicles
          to be procured for schools. This consultant has been identified but a contract is yet
          to be signed. The Ministry informed the World Bank team that a list of vehicles will
          be submitted by municipalities in the upcoming days and immediately after this the
          consultant will be appointed and begin work.         It is important that this activity be
          initiated as soon as possible, since it is the largest pending activity in the project.
       c. Education management information system (EMIS): this activity is relatively small,
          but it is the first stage in the implementation of the EMIS, which is mostly going to
          be funded by the European Investment Bank. A series of consultants have been
          hired and a coordinator of the consultants work is in the process of being re-hired.
          The Bank team looks forward to seeing a plan of action with a precise timeline, as
          well as the starting of the work on the conceptual design of the EMIS, since this will
          then trigger funding for software and hardware for the entire system. At this point,
          it is urgent to clear the documents leading to the preparation of an interim software
          and hardware solution for the school year 2011/12. However, in parallel, the
          decision is also needed for the development of the main EMIS system, which cannot
          be further delayed.
9.     Visits to DILS Primary Health Care Facilities - During this visit, the World Bank team
visited four DZs (DZ Savski Venac, DZ Leskovac, DZ Vlasotince, DZ Novi Sad), to examine the
implementation of DILS project activities, including the Roma health mediator program. The
team wishes to express their utmost thanks to the DZ directors, physicians, Roma health
mediators, and the Roma community members who facilitated these visits. The team was
impressed with the work of the physicians they observed, and noted that DILS investments in IT
equipment and information systems will hopefully reduce administrative burdens and increase

                                                                                                    7
clinical quality. The call center set up in DZ Novi Sad was particularly innovative in its outreach
activities and outgoing calls for preventive visits, and the team was able to witness patients
coming for important cancer screenings as a result of the center’s outgoing calls. The team was
also impressed with the work of the Roma health mediators. The mediators have been well
received by their associated dom zdravljas and Roma settlements, and Roma community
members praised the work of the mediators in improving immunization rates, increasing access
to health ID cards, increasing health information and awareness, and more.

10.      Monitoring and Evaluation: Results Framework. The team had discussions with each of
the PATs to update current values for each of the indicators. Since many project activities are
just beginning implementation (e.g., grants and IT), there will not be much change in the values
for some indicator values. Overall, however, progress towards achieving the project indicators
is largely on track, and it should be noted that several of the health indicators show significant
progress towards results. Since the last mission, the teams have also provided suggestions for
additional indicators to capture other results beyond what is captured in the current Results
Framework.
Next Steps: Each of the PATs will provide revised Results Frameworks by June 3, 2011.
11.      Impact Evaluation. Since the September 2010 visit, there have been several changes to
the impact evaluation for the Roma Grants program under DILS. The Bank team was
disappointed to learn that the impact evaluation, as originally designed, is no longer feasible. It
was originally envisioned that there would be 40 municipalities which would receive grants and
19 municipalities who would not receive grants. Now all municipalities will receive grants, so
there will be no treatment and comparison municipalities, and therefore no valid
counterfactual. Instead, a less rigorous evaluation will be conducted looking at before and after
changes in municipalities using the baseline survey conducted in June 2010 and a follow-up
survey (intended to be conducted in Jun 2012).
Next Steps: The Roma Grants coordinator will be prepare a matrix outlining the specific
activities that municipalities will be conducting by June 10, 2011. With this matrix, the team will
determine with which activities may be possible to assess their impact.
12.      In health, the quality incentives pilot is ideal for a rigorous impact evaluation since the
Health PAT would like to pilot the incentives in 40 randomly selected DZs across Serbia. The key
issue now is whether the quality incentives pilot can be designed and implemented before the
end of the project, particularly with the delays to the introduction of capitation, described
above.

15.    Serbia Health Additional Financing aims towards reform in financing of secondary health
care by improving information technology, hospital management and quality, monitoring and
evaluation and communication in MoH and HIF. It is continuation of Serbia health Project
dating from 2005. SHAF has become effective in October 2009 and the designated account has
become operational at the end of January 2010. Closing date is December 31, 2011.
16.     Disbursements and commitments for the project are shown in Table 4 and 5. Up to June
30, 2010, disbursement was approximately EURO 1.06 million (10.14%). From July 1, 2010 to
May 25, 2011 EURO 1.51 million (14.41%) has been disbursed and by the end of June 2011 a
further EURO 1.01 million (9.61%) will be disbursed, totaling to EURO 2.52 million (24.03%) by
the World Bank Fiscal Year 2011 (from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011). It is projected that by
June 30, 2011 total of 34% of loan be disbursed and 80% committed.

17.         The World Bank team has noted that significant progress in implementation of the
project activities has taken place since last mission that has been reflected in disbursement and
commitment increase. It can be attributed to finalizing procurement and signing contracts for IT
Equipment (LAN and Hardware) and Software for 20 hospitals totaling EURO 4.000.000
($5.800.000). Another important step was purchasing DRG License Deed from Australian

                                                                                                                                             12
Government. After noticeable delay due to defining conditions of purchase and details of the
contract, it has been signed in January 2011, thus enabling a series of a follow up activities
planned by the project.
18.     Planning. The WB Team reviewed SHAF Procurement Plan jointly with the PIU and
observed discrepancies, namely that many activities need to be updated. It has been addressed
by PIU Team promptly and an updated Procurement Plan has been sent to the Bank and
approved before the end of the mission.
        It has also been noted that the Training Plan needs to be updated beyond June 30, 2011,
to reflect activities until the end of the calendar year which is also the end of the project. The
PIU will submit the revised Training Plan to the World Bank by end June 2011.
18.     Since last SHAF Supervision Mission there has been a change in the MoH. The new
Minister of Health has been appointed in April 2011. The WB Team met with the new Minister
and his Cabinet and was very pleased to with continuation of strong partnership and
commitment towards implementation of all health related activities.
19.     Monitoring and Evaluation: Results Framework. Progress towards achieving the project
indicators is largely on track. In particular, there has been progress noted on the IT and the
quality indicators. The key indicators that have been delayed are the ones related to the
introduction of DRG reporting system in hospital. Since purchasing the DRG license was
delayed, it is anticipated that 18 hospitals will begin reporting based on DRG classifications in
October 2011. A revised Results Framework was provided to the Bank team (Annex 2).

Public Expenditure Development Policy Loan – health related policies

The World Bank team discussed with Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Health officials the
progress in implementing the policies included in the third phased of the Public Expenditure
Development Policy Loan (PEDPL3). The Government has suggested its interest in having the
operation processed before the end of 2011. This would require that the policies supported by
the PEDPL3 be implemented by October 2011. All health related policies included in the PEDPL
3 are progressing adequately, with the exception of the amendments to the Law on Salaries of
Public Employees. The amendments were drafted by the Ministry of Health, adopted by the
Government, and submitted to Parliament on June 2010, but the law revisions have not been
approved. The World Bank team shared the concern of the Serbian authorities about the lack
of progress, since much of the health reform planned by the Government (namely the
introduction of changes in payment mechanisms for doctors and health care facilities to
increase efficiency) hinges on the amendments to the law, which would allow a portion of
doctors’ salaries to be based on performance. Both Ministries are aware of the importance of
the reform and are committed to find a way forward. A World Bank team will visit Serbia
during June 20-29 to discuss these issues further.

Quality of Health Care Study

From May 16-27, 2011, the World Bank team met with the Ministry of Health, Health Insurance
Fund, Chamber of Physicians, Chamber of Nurses, and Agency for Quality and Accreditation to
discuss a proposed study to measure quality of health care among Primary Health Care
physicians in primary health care (PHC) facilities --dom zdravljas (DZ)--in Serbia. This study
builds on important quality improvement activities undertaken by the MOH since 2004 such as
creating a National Agency for Quality and Accreditation, developing a strategy for quality
improvement, and establishing a set of quality indicators. It would complement this work by
examining the clinical care that patients receive and which dimensions of the clinical encounter
require improvement—for example, history-taking, examinations, diagnoses, prescriptions,
referrals, or communication.

The World Bank team discussed the details of the study with the new administration at the
ministry of Health. The Minister expressed his support for the study and suggested that MOH
be a key partner in its implementation. All stakeholders including the HIF, Chamber of
Physicians, Chamber of Nurses, and the Agency for Quality and Accreditation expressed strong
demand and support for such a study that would provide an objective assessment of clinical
quality. The following next steps were agreed:

      The team will continue to work with the MOH and other partners to finalize the study
       design.
      A letter will be issued to DZs informing them of the quality study.
      The study will be submitted for ethical review in both Serbia and in North America.
