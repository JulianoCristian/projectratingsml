The extension of\n            the closing date is necessary to: (i) allow successful\n            updating of the Health Information System (HIS) software\n            originally installed in the four participating hospitals,\n            and (ii) full implementation of the HIS in 20 hospitals.\n            Good progress is being made in both activities with key\n            implementation milestones well advanced: (i) customization\n            of software has been finished in all hospitals, (ii)\n            training has been completed in all hospitals and primary\n            health care (PHC centers), and (iii) hardware has been\n            installed in all the facilities. However, to ensure that\n            acceptance procedures are carried out systematically, it is\n            prudent to allow additional time to avoid the risk that some\n            unexpected issues could slow down the process. This will be\n            the first and final extension of the loan closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
