                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most project activities have been fully implemented. The original credit for the project had a one-time extension from February 28, 2008 to December 28, 2009, to accommodate the
                         preparation of an Additional Financing (AF), which became effective on October 15, 2009.
                         Though the AF became effective on October 15, 2009, implementation started in late January 2010 because of delays in setting up the designated account. Of the 16 indicators
                         related to the project development objectives, all have been achieved or are on track except two: arrears in health care facilities and health sector reconfiguration strategy. Project
                         implementation has experienced delays in relation to the original implementation plan mostly due to the volume and the complexity of the Information Technology (IT) procurement,

                         the project.
                         Despite these initial delays, all planned activities are progressing in a satisfactory manner and will be completed by project closing on December 31, 2011. This includes all IT
                         procurement and installation and accreditation activities. To date a total of 36% of the additional loan has been disbursed and 80% committed.
