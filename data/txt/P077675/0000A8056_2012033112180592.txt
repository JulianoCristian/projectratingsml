                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities have been fully implemented. The original credit for the project had a one-time extension from February 28, 2008 to December 28, 2009, to accommodate the
                         preparation of an Additional Financing (AF), which became effective on October 15, 2009. After that implementation started in late January 2010 because of delays in setting up the
                         designated account. Of the 16 indicators related to the project development objectives, 13 have been fully achieved, one partially achieved while two have not been achieved: the
                         reduction of arrears in health care facilities and the adoption of the health sector reconfiguration strategy.

                         of the Loan amount) were signed by the MoH on December 5, 2011 less than 4 weeks before the original Closing Date of the project (December 31, 2011). Due to concerns on the
                         Bank’s side for the remaining activities to be successfully completed by the impending Closing Date, the project was extended for additional three months until March 31, 2012. All
                         pending activities have been finished by March 5, 2012.
