Key lessons learned from the project\n            include: 1) The Bank should more carefully monitor project\n            organizational changes. 2) Timely provision of technical\n            assistance and training should be provided from the\n            project's start by specific arrangements. 3) Contracts\n            for study, works, or supply should include clauses which\n            would clearly define conditions for exchange rates. 4) All\n            progress reports should include a financial balance sheet to\n            allow an easy comparison of resources and expenditures for\n            each category of loan proceeds, and to show the available\n            balance for the remaining activities. 5) National Agency for\n            Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure's (AGID's)\n            project monitoring focused only on technical aspects of\n            infrastructure implementation under the responsibility of\n            the Ministry of Equipment. More attention should be given to\n            key indicators for project operation following its\n            implementation; at appraisal, the Bank should give greater\n            care to the monitoring system to be put in place for the\n            project. 6) The Bank needs to ensure that an enabling\n            environment for project implementation is created and\n            maintained. 7) The financing of one third only of the\n            infrastructure needed to mobilize and convey the water to\n            the irrigated areas is not sufficient."}, "docdt": "1997-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
