The lessons learned indicate that\n            a Technical Assistance project which accompanies an\n            adjustment credit should not be prepared as an\n            after-thought. It should be properly designed and be subject\n            to the standard quality assurance requirements. It is\n            particularly important to make an adequate risk assessment\n            and include risk mitigation measures in the project design.\n            Substituting conditionality for government commitment or\n            weak institutional capacity does not accelerate the reform\n            process. Sustainable buy-in of a controversial change\n            proposal can only be secured through extensive debates where\n            all options are explored and the stakeholders are convinced\n            of the relative pros and cons of each option. Expectation of\n            the pace of accountability reform should be realistic. In\n            many young democracies in Africa, where elected leaders\n            struggle to balance competing interests and face constraints\n            in pursuing accountability reform, it will not be realistic\n            to expect radical improvement in a short period of time.\n            Continuity of Task Team Leaders and management attention to\n            problem projects is key to success. Financial management\n            reform and procurement reform are often part of an overall\n            public sector reform program of a country, so effective\n            support to the country requires a Bank team with a broad\n            based multi-sector expertise."}, "docdt": "2004-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
