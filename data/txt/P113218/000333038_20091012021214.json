           constraints and improve food security, rural incomes, and\n            community assets. Negative impacts include: terrestrial\n            habitat alteration; aquatic habitat disruption; soil\n            degradation; land acquisition/ private assets displacement;\n            use of inorganic fertilizers; construction nuisance; and\n            increase in solid wastes. Mitigation measures include: 1)\n            sites to avoid critical habitat through use of existing\n            utility and transport corridors, whenever possible; 2)\n            re-vegetation of disturbed areas with native plant species;\n            3) sites to avoid critical aquatic habitat such as\n            watercourses, wetlands, and riparian areas, whenever\n            possible; 4) minimizing clearing and disruption to riparian\n            vegetation; 5) assess soil characteristics and either avoid\n            or provide drainage for areas prone to water logging; 6)\n            provide appropriate technologies for integrated soil\n            fertility management; 7) ensure road development is\n            coordinated with local land use plans and discuss with\n            existing governance structures; 8) aappropriate quality and\n            quantity use of fertilizers according to soil capacity; and\n            9) provide for proper waste disposal, and water supply and\n            sanitation facilities."}, "docdt": "2008-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
