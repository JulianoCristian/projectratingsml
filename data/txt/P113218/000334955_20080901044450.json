concerns the\n            Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which was\n            endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008, and will be financed\n            out of and the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund\n            (TF) to support a Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural\n            Livelihoods Project (RRRRLP) in Somalia. The objectives of\n            the GFRP are to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and\n            volatile food prices on the lives of the poor in a timely\n            way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable\n            policies that mitigate the adverse impacts of high and more\n            volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the\n            creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support\n            broad-based growth in productivity and market participation\n            in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food\n            supply response. The worsening food crisis in Somalia points\n            to an urgent need for increased financial support and the\n            World Bank can best assist by financing funding gaps in\n            existing programs being implemented by international,\n            national, and non-governmental institutions. This approach\n            would enable rapid implementation and greatest impact.  The\n            grant will be made to the Food and Agriculture Organization\n            of the United Nations (FAO) as the implementing agency. FAO\n            is currently involved in numerous projects in Somalia, and\n            has an extensive knowledge of the situation on the ground\n            and capacity to coordinate and implement in an efficient and\n            effective manner. The will help finance, on an urgent basis\n            over 18 months to two years, the costs associated with\n            increasing crop and livestock production systems."}, "docdt": "2008-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
