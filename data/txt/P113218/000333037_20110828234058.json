LIVELIHOODS PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rapid Response\n            Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project for Somalia were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in an unstable\n            setting such as in Somalia, where normal trading is\n            disrupted, it is important to base emergency recovery and\n            rehabilitation programs on the production of traditional\n            crops. These crops substituted for imported foods in the\n            local markets thus reducing the impact of soaring global\n            food prices on consumers. There is much to be gained by\n            designing project activities that build upon ongoing\n            programs, as this allows the utilization of knowledge\n            accumulated over time by staff of different organizations,\n            local communities and the private sector. This, in turn,\n            leads to expeditious planning and implementation of project\n            activities, especially of repeater programs; reduced costs\n            of planning; and smooth implementation of activities due to\n            well established relationships with the local authorities,\n            communities and project beneficiaries. Involving the\n            communities in the identification of target beneficiaries\n            (e.g. resource-poor farmers and women headed households) has\n            enabled the project to assist the intended and deserving people."}, "docdt": "2011-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
