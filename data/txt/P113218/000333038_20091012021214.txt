EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This document provides an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(EMSF) outlining the screening, review and approval process for activities 
financed under the Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
(RRRRLP) in Somalia. The RRRRL project was prepared by the World Bank with 
the objective to increase crop and livestock production in areas affected by food 
crises in Somalia. The two main components (crops and livestock) pay attention 
to mainstreaming nutrition and gender concern in their interventions building on 
ongoing FAO projects in the country.  
 
Generally, RRRRL project will have minimal negative environmental or social 
impacts if any. Potential social impacts have to do with possible land acquisition 
for the construction of slaughter houses and auxiliary infrastructure, such as 
access roads, which could prompt the need for involuntary resettlement. 
However, this potential impact is considered very unlikely, given that most of 
the proposed facilities are expected to be constructed within existing 
infrastructure. The environmental impacts expected from this project are 
moderate to minimal. The slaughter houses and irrigation sub-projects could 
additionally trigger environmental impact, through increased use of pesticides 
and water abstraction. Thus, the safeguard policies triggered by the proposed 
project are OP/BP 4.01 environmental assessment, OP 4.09 pest management, 
and OP 7.50 projects on international waterways. The project is a category B 
project. 
 
The executing bodies responsible for ensuring social and environmental 
safeguards are adhered to include the project unit based within FAO Somalia, 
NGO’s and community based organizations sub-contracted for specific activities 
and contractors undertaking infrastructural work. However, to the extent that 
subprojects trigger safeguard policies, subproject specific safeguard 
documentation, such as sub-project pest management plans or even 
environmental impact assessment will be prepared. It is advised that an 
environmental specialist either in the project or from FAO Sub-regional office 
closely monitors project activities. 
 
As poverty is widespread in both rural and urban areas of Somalia, and 
particularly severe due to the long recurrent conflict and failure in central 
governance, failure to institute sustainable agriculture and natural resource 
management practices would lead to loss of opportunity to correct this vicious 
cycle. Thus from an environmental, as well as socio-economic and humanitarian 
viewpoint, the ‘no RRRRL project’ alternative is not preferred.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 
1.1 
Introduction 
 
Environmental Assessment (EA) is a process used to evaluate projects potential 
environmental risks and impacts in the area of influence, examines alternatives, 
ways of improving selection, citing, planning, design, and implementation. It 
aims to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse environmental 
and social impacts and enhance positive impacts throughout and after project 
implementation. Whenever feasible, preventive measures are favored over 
mitigatory or compensatory measures. 
 
This report provides guidelines for assessing possible environmental and social 
impacts of the subprojects of the Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural 
Livelihoods Project (RRRRLP) in Somalia. The guidelines indicate (i) how 
projects should be screened to determine their environmental and social impacts; 
(ii) how determination should be made and appropriate mitigating measures 
incorporated into the subprojects report and (iii) specify institutional 
responsibilities for undertaking environmental assessment including the social 
aspects, implementation of preventive, mitigatory or compensatory measures, 
and monitoring and evaluation  
 
1.2 
Project description 
 
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
spearheaded the preparation of the Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural 
Livelihoods Project (RRRRLP) for Somalia and received the approval of a grant 
under the Global Food Response Program (GFRP) Trust Fund (TF) for an amount 
of US$7.0 million. The Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) Trust Fund 
(TF), launched by the World Bank in May 2008 aims of minimize the threat posed 
by high food prices and sharply rising agricultural production and marketing 
costs to the livelihoods of poor urban and rural residents in developing 
countries.  
 
The project development objective is to increase crop and livestock production in 
areas affected by food crises in Somalia and would build on the ongoing FAO 
projects. The main components crops (component one) and livestock (component 
two) pay attention to mainstreaming nutrition and gender concern in the 
interventions.

Component 1: Improving Food Production Capacity (USD 3.8 Million) 
 
The project aims to improve food production capacity by removing the main 
production constrains and expanding acreage under agricultural crops. These 
would be attained through distribution of improved inputs and rehabilitation 
and improvement of crop production infrastructure. 
 
Sub-component one
,
improving food production capacity will support provision of 
good quality seeds of maize and sorghum mainly sourced from surplus areas of 
Somalia highly productive in similar environmental conditions. Direct inputs 
(such as seeds and fertilizers) and complementary inputs (such as 
tools/implements) will also be availed. Specific activities under this sub-
component are (a) distribution of technology packages (seeds, fertilizer and farm 
implements) and relevant training on appropriate use; (b) training of farmers
—
mainly women growing food crops—in improved agronomic and nutritional 
practices; which will be combined with vegetable seed distribution and (c) 
evaluation of use and impact of technology packages- will include post 
distribution review exercises carried out to inform/improve future assistance.  
However, if this will not be possible, i.e Somaliland seeds will be sourced from 
neighboring countries (Ethiopia), selecting varieties that have proved viable 
 
Sub-component two
,
increased food production through rehabilitation and 
improvement of crop production infrastructure will support expanding acreages 
under agricultural crops that the long absence of stability and consequently lack 
of institutions has stifled especially in the productive sectors of Somalia. The 
project will support irrigation rehabilitation. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land 
Information Management (SWALIM) unit expertise will aid in appropriate
 
project implementation of infrastructure rehabilitation activities.

The specific activities are (a) carrying out of profile surveys for all canals, 
embankment and roads that need to be rehabilitated; and (b) rehabilitation of 
infrastructure through a combination of private sector contracts and labor 
sourced from the community (with explicit commitment to employment of 
women).

Component 2: Support Strategies for using Livestock Resources to address Current Food 
Crisis (USD 3. 2 Million) 
 
About 55% of Somalis are directly engaged in livestock production and livestock 
provides 55% of calorie intake making it of direct importance for livelihood and 
food security. Constrains in production, animal health and marketing 
compounded by animal diseases and repeated trade bans by major trading 
partners in the Middle East exacerbates the current food crisis.   
 
Sub-component one
,
support to fodder production and marketing aims to secure 
livestock assets through fodder production and marketing as feed is a scarce 
resource in almost all parts of Somalia.  It aims to increase access to fodder and 
“guarantee” better returns to producers and traders and promote supply 
response. The specific activities will include (a) improving fodder production 
and productivity by using selected lines of improved local grasses and sorghum; 
(b) improving fodder harvesting (introduce better tools), storage (baling) and 
conservation (silage fodder with added of feed additives including molasses and 
nitrogen sources, fortification of maize stoves with molasses (energy source) and 
ammonium (nitrogen source); (c) enhancing fodder market access (d) creating 
employment by training youth to be manual balers to provide services for a fee; 
(e) training of farmers/pastoralist in preparation of silage and in appropriate 
range rehabilitation techniques; (f) increasing the area under fodder production 
by stabilizing rivers and irrigation canals
 
with grasses, while creating awareness 
on the need to improve range and water harvest.  
 
Sub- component two
,
improving slaughter houses with value addition services 
proposes a range of infrastructural intervention aimed at the rehabilitation of 
slaughter related basic infrastructures at community level. The specific activities 
under this sub-component are (a) rehabilitation of two slaughter facilities; (b) 
training of laborers in the facilities in efficient and hygienic meat production; (c) 
improving hides and skins collection and preparation; (d) harvesting and 
processing by-products alongside hides and skins (blood, bones and manure); (e) 
promotion of by-product use for improved nutrition and increased incomes, 
including consumption of what might be considered inferior products and use of 
manure for agricultural; (f) support for the production and sale of local 
traditional processed meat and (g) Improving recovery, sale and consumption of 
offals.

SUBPROJECT TYPOLOGIES AND THEIR POTENTIAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
 
2.1 
Sub-project typologies and Locations 
 
The RRRRL project detailed work plan indicates the project would focus on 
activities that can generally be categorized into agricultural technologies, soil 
fertility and better land management, inputs and outputs marketing and physical 
infrastructures themes that fall into the crop and livestock components. The 
activities are as illustrated in figure one.  
 
Overall, the project will operate in the Northern (Somaliland and Puntland), 
Central and Southern Somalia regions. Figure 1 illustrates the districts and 
planned activities in the project areas.

2.3 Subproject 
characteristics 
 
Anticipated sub-projects are generally expected to have some or all of the 
following characteristics: 
·
Labour intensity
:
Sub-projects would be generally labour-intensive and use 
simple tools as much as possible.  
·
Communal benefits
:
The subprojects will benefit the community as a whole or 
groups of households within a given area.  
·
Community acceptance
:
Subprojects should be accepted and approved by the 
community. They should have active community support and commitment.  
·
Feasibility and sustainability
:
The subprojects should be feasible technically, 
socially and economically. To the extent possible, they would be simple and 
manageable in implementation and maintenance to be sustainable.  
·
Gender sensitivity
:
Wherever possible, priority will be given to projects in 
which women are able to participate and from which they can benefit.  
 
2.4
 
Environmental impacts of RRRRLP subprojects and proposed 
mitigation measures
 
Environmental and Social benefits are likely to represent a substantial portion of 
RRRRLP subprojects. The proposed RRRRLP subproject has been designed, to 
create many beneficial impacts related to environmental regeneration and 
sustainable agriculture that are long-term rather than short-term, and will not be 
limited to the members of village community as well expounded in the proposal. 
 
However, they may also have adverse environmental impacts, if good practice is 
not followed in their citing, design and implementation. Generally, the project is 
not expected to have any significant negative social impacts. The two potential 
significant impacts have to do with possible land acquisition for the construction 
of slaughter houses and ancillary infrastructure, such as access roads, which 
could prompt the need for involuntary resettlement of the affected populations. 
However, this potential impact is considered very unlikely, given that most of 
the proposed facilities are expected to be constructed within existing 
infrastructure. Secondly, the proposed interventions could affect the sub-clan 
cohesion. Somalia is made up of several recognized sub-clans historically prone 
to tension due to resource allocation and leadership. To avert such tensions, the 
sub-clan would be the typically dominate group in their distinct geographical 
areas and their priorities would be address through participatory approach to 
planning and implementation. In fact, the RRRRLP
 shouldn’t finance any 
intervention that is determined through the ESMF process to be potentially 
detrimental to any sub-clan. 
 
Page  13

The environmental impacts expected from this project are moderate to minimal. 
The slaughter house and irrigation sub-projects are the only ones likely to have 
some environmental impact, either due to temporary disruption through the 
construction of ducts for water channels or from the construction of ancillary 
infrastructure, notably access roads, associated rural access to markets.  
 
Table 3 
sets out typical adverse impacts that need to be avoided, managed and 
mitigated and sets out a range of mitigating measures that have been found to be 
useful to offset potential adverse impacts to ensure optimum results from 
subprojects expected.  
 
Detailed mitigating measures recommended to offset adverse impacts for specific 
types of sub-projects will be integrated into the technical specifications, work 
norms and information kits guiding the implementation of sub-projects under 
the RRRRL project.

Analysis of alternatives 
Sub- projects will assess alternative strategies for achieving objectives of 
improved agricultural productivity, environmental improvement and more 
sustainable livelihoods. Alternatives considered would include but go beyond 
the no-alternative option.  
 
Their anticipated outcomes will be discussed with relevant stakeholders in the 
course of the environment and social screening process.

SUBPROJECT SCREENING, REVIEW AND APPROVAL 
 
This section outlines the screening, review and approval process for activities to 
be financed under the RRRRL project. It is important to have appropriate tools in 
place to assist the project implementing agencies in screening activities for 
potential impacts and to provide guidelines for implementing measures to 
effectively address them. 
 
Once the subprojects locations have been selected, the project should use this 
section as the guidelines to screening subprojects and implementing the 
appropriate measures while ensuring that all respective legislative requirements 
for screening and EIAs are adhered to as shown in section 5.2. 
 
3.1 Implementing 
Agencies 
 
As RRRRL project will cover Somalia but in different regions with different 
governance system and the project unit (based within FAO Somalia office), 
NGO’s and Community Based organizations sub-contracted to implement, and 
contractors under taking infrastructural works are the three main executing 
bodies under the project with responsibility of ensuring proposed screening and 
impact mitigation mechanisms are implemented. It is advised that an 
environmental specialist either in the project or from the FAO sub-regional office 
closely monitors the activities. 
 
3.2 
Screening and Review Process 
 
Since the sub-projects supported by RRRRLP are small and because rural people 
will be the drivers of the projects, the process of environmental screening must 
be simple and informative. The process will consist of the following steps: 
 
Step 1: 
Environmental and Social Screening of subproject activities
 
Once the subproject activity location has been selected, a screening form will be 
filled out. The form will allow for identification of the potential environmental 
and social impacts associated with the proposed activity. As the ESMF and 
Resettlement Screening Form should be utilized in tandem, the screening form 
will also allow for the identification and assessment of impacts related to 
potential land acquisition and involuntary resettlement if triggered. A template 
for screening is provided in 
annex 1 and 5
.
Step 2
:
Scoping and field appraisal 
Based on the information provided in the screening form, the reviewer (i.e. the 
relevant environmental ministry official/project manager/ FAO Somalia or Sub-
Page  21
16
regional office) will make a decision as to whether or not the subproject will 
require a more detailed investigation of the impacts through a field appraisal.  
 
Information collection will be achieved through observation and use of 
professional expertise and in some cases, interviews with the local people could 
provide information regarding human use values and/or environmental 
significance. As part of the field appraisal, the project shall identify the major 
stakeholders /community groups within the affected area that are likely to be 
impacted. A list of potentially affected groups shall be compiled and appended 
to the appraisal report. 
 
Step 3
:
Assessment and classification of impacts 
Based on the screening form and field appraisal (when required), the impacts are 
classified based on their risk category and decision made as outlined below:- 
 
(a) Category A
:
A
proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to have 
significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or 
unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or 
facilities subject to physical works. EA for a Category A project examines the 
project’s potential negative and positive environmental impacts, compares them 
with those of feasible alternatives (including the "without project" situation), and 
recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate or compensate 
for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. For a Category A 
project, the borrower is responsible for preparing a report, normally an EIA (or a 
suitably comprehensive or sectoral EA) that includes as necessary, elements such 
as environmental audits or hazard or risk assessments.  
 
Should RRRRLP sub-projects be assigned category A they will either have to be 
redesigned and re-screened, or dropped, because the RRRRL Project has been 
assigned the environmental category B. 
 
(b) Category B
:
A
proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential 
adverse environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally 
important areas - including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural 
habitats - are less adverse than those of Category A projects. These impacts are 
site-specific; few if any of them are irreversible; and in most cases mitigatory 
measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. The scope 
of EA for a Category B project may vary from project to project, but it is narrower 
than that of Category A. Like Category A, it examines the project’s potential 
negative and positive environmental impacts and recommends any measures 
needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and 
improve environmental performance.

(c) Category C
:
A
proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to have 
minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Beyond screening, no further EA 
action is required for a Category C project. 
 
The following table illustrates the risk categories, based on the 
World Bank OP 
4.01 environmental categories (A, B, and C). 
As mentioned earlier, category A sub-
project cannot be funded under the RRRRLP.

In cases where the results of the screening process indicate that the sub-project will 
not have significant adverse environmental and social impacts, if any, no additional 
environmental work will be required and sub-project implementation can proceed 
immediately
 
Since not all category B sub-projects are likely to require a separate EIA report, the 
screening process will recommend the assignment of (i) category B1 to sub-projects 
requiring only the application of simple mitigation measures (using the 
Environmental Management Plan 
–
Annex 2 of the ESMF); and (ii) B2 for those sub-
projects requiring a separate EIA report due to the severity of their potential adverse 
environmental and social impacts (using the generic EIA Terms of Reference – 
Annex 3 of the ESMF).
 
Page  23
18
 
Step 4
:
Identifying alternatives to subproject design 
For subprojects which are deemed high risk, as they may result in significant 
impacts, the project will re-assess the location and design of the subproject to 
ensure that there are no alternatives which may minimize or avoid these 
potential environmental and/or social impacts. If an alternative is not feasible, 
then the project must prepare an EIA and/or RAP. 
 
Step 5: 
Appraisal and Approval
 
(a)  
Environmental permitting requirements 
 
·
For Category B2 (subprojects requiring an EIA): 
The project will submit a 
copy of the EIA to the relevant authority for review. This should include 
all relevant information (as outlined 
in the country’s legislative 
requirements 
(refer to Chapter 5.2)
,
namely an EMP, a set of environmental 
contract clauses and a summary of public consultations carried out. 
 
Annex 3
 
provides the Terms of Reference for preparation of an EIA.
 
·
For Category B1 (subprojects which require an EMP): 
The project will prepare 
an EMP (refer to 
Annex 2
). The objective of the EMP is to identify and 
mitigate the environmental and social needs of the project in a simple, 
responsive and cost effective manner that will not unnecessarily overload 
or impede the project cycle. The EMP should be a simple two to four page 
document that outlines the main environmental and social mitigation 
measures; environmental training and capacity program; and 
environmental and social monitoring program.
 
Criteria for Approval 
 
i. 
For those EIAs which meet the country’s EIA requirements and World 
Bank OP 4.01, an environmental permit can be granted. 
ii. 
For those EIAs which do not meet the country’s EIA requirements and 
World Bank OP 4.01, an environmental permit is rejected and the relevant 
environmental authority (i.e. Ministry of Environment or Environmental 
Council) may want to carry out an audit. The Project will resubmit the 
EIA based on recommendations of the audit. As emphasized in the World 
Bank’s guidelines, a subproject should not be approved and funded until 
such reports are received, approved and disclosed. The EIA reports will 
also need to be reviewed and approved by the Bank. 
Page  24
19
 
Step 6:   
Disclosure of Subproject Information
 
Disclosure of subproject information would be undertaken as indicated in section 
6.2 - public consultation process.  
 
Step 7
:
Monitoring Reports
 
Compliance monitoring comprises on site-inspection of subproject technical, 
infrastructural and construction activities to verify that measures identified in 
the EMP and/or RAP and included in the clauses for contractors are being 
implemented. This type of monitoring is similar to the normal tasks of a project 
manager or designated officer whose task is to ensure that the implementation is 
within prescribed standards and specification. 
 
Once implementation of the subproject has started, regular supervision missions 
should be carried out and annual monitoring report must be submitted to the 
lead implementing agency for each region and compiled to the World Bank for 
review. The purpose of these reports is to provide a record of project and 
subproject transactions, environmental and social issues, a record of experience 
and issues running from year-to-year throughout the project that can be used for 
identifying difficulties and improving performance; and practical information for 
undertaking an annual review.

GUIDLINES FOR INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, TRAINING 
NEEDS AND COST ESTIMATES FOR MITIGATION MEASURES  
 
4.1 Institutional 
arrangements 
 
4.1.1
 
Implementation arrangements
 
The implementation of the RRRRLP will take place at different levels and at 
times not all levels given governance differences within Somalia but will take 
into account the coordination and implementation arrangements set out. This 
involves agencies and entities at the national level, state/regional level, locality 
level and community level.  
 
The lead implementing agency
will be the Food and Agriculture Organization 
Somalia Office (FAOSO). It would be supported, as needed, by officers from 
FAO technical departments of agriculture, natural resource and technical co-
operation on issues related to crops, livestock, natural resource management and 
emergency response. These would be drawn from FAO Eastern Africa Sub- 
regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and whenever needed from FAO HQ. 
 
Partner NGO’s and CBOs will consist of both local and international 
organizations at state and district levels and will form the backbone of 
distribution networks. Seeds, equipments will be normally procured from the 
local market and distributed through such partner organizations by contract 
agreements and if necessary through new partners. This would also form a 
reliable channel to ensure activity sustainability.  
 
The overall responsibility for agricultural development in Somaliland rests with 
the Ministries of Agriculture, while in Puntland with the Ministry of Livestock, 
Agriculture and Environment (MOLAE). A strategic plan for 
agricultural
rehabilitation and development was developed with a goal to ensure household 
food security by ensuring an equitable allocation of resources, improving crop 
production, and capacity building within the Ministry of Agriculture. The 
ministry of Water and Mineral Resources is responsible for the management of 
freshwater resources and for water withdrawal. In northeast Somalia, the 
Ministry of Pastoral Development and Environment is responsible for natural 
resource management, including the use of forest and surface water and 
groundwater
resources. These government arms would be significant in 
planning, implementation and monitoring. 
 
Members of the Community through their representatives will undertake - after 
training - both compliance monitoring and effects monitoring. This will be done 
throughout the sub-project cycle namely: 
Page  26
21
i. 
During the planning phase, the communities will participate in the 
identification of indicators for monitoring the mitigating measures; 
ii. 
During implementation (construction phase), monitoring the execution of 
works with respect to environmental aspects, e.g. verify the compliances 
of the Contractors with their obligations; 
iii. 
During operation and maintenance phase, the overall environmental 
monitoring and alerting on any emerging environmental hazards in 
conjunction with the ongoing sub-project activities. The communities will 
be enabled to pass on their observations and concerns through the review 
team and project management. 
 
4.1.2 Implementation 
challenges 
 
RRRRLP will operate in a generally unstable, diverse and precarious governance 
region. Although implementation challenges will vary from one region to 
another, ease of movement would generally be restricted among international 
staff and has to be carefully monitored from time to time. Minimum security 
operation standards (MOSS) for such areas as per UN regulation will have to be 
strictly adhered to and would to a certain extent affect operations. These would 
however be mini
mized through use of FAO’s extensive experience in the country 
who include trained local staff. 
 
Potential challenges which could affect the quality and effectiveness of the 
environmental standards of the anticipated projects is mainly the national level 
implementing agencies lack the necessary capacity and are less able to provide 
technical assistance to grantee implementation of the ESMF. Moreover, in a 
number of cases, the capacity of local organizations for sustainable work, 
accountability and maintenance of assets are not well developed, and therefore 
would require training in order to perform to the required standards. 
 
Thus, RRRRLP program would finance training in the ESMF for the relevant 
international, national, and locality staff. In a number of cases where the 
governance capacity is limited, the program would finance consultants to 
provide supplementary assistance.
 
Page  27
22
4.2 Training 
needs 
 
A
two day training seminar on familiarization with the EMSF framework is 
recommended for the project management team based in Nairobi and Somalia to 
become familiar with the principals of the ESMF. It would highlight the 
environment assessment process.

Additionally, a three to four day training program is proposed for the RRRRL 
project staff and review team in Somalia. In addition to familiarization with the  
environmental assessment process, the training should cover:- 
 
Environmental policies, procedures and sectoral guidelines (1 day)  
·
Review and discussion of 
Somalia’s environmental policies, 
procedures, and legislation 
·
Review and discussion of the Bank’s safeguard policies 
·
Review and discussion of Somalia’s existing sectoral guidelines 
·
Collaboration with institutions at the local, regional, national levels 
 
Selected topics on environmental protection (1 days) 
·

4.3
 
Cost estimates for mitigation measures 
 
The design of crop and livestock production activities, will and have taken into 
account environmental and social concerns and such would form part of the 
subproject costs. In construction and infrastructural works, it is expected that 
compliance with environmental and social conditions will be part of standard 
Page  28
23
good workmanship and state of art as will generally be required under Contract 
(annex 4). The item 
“Compliance with Environmental Management Conditions” 
would imply these costs. No other payments will be made to the Contractor for 
compliance with any request to avoid and/or mitigate an avoidable 
environmental and social impact(s). 
 
For EMSF, an estimated US$ 200,000 would be required to arrange for and 
coordinate training in environmental assessment, World Bank and Somalia’s 
governance policies, monitoring and follow up as summarized in table 5 below.

COMPLIANCE OF RRRRLP ACTIVITIES WITH WORLD BANK AND 
SOMALIA
’S POLICIES, GUIDELINES, LEGISLATION AND 
REGULATIONS 
 
5.1  
Compliance with World Bank safeguards policies 
 
A
list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard polices is summarized 
in annex 5. The proposed project has triggered OP 4.01 Environmental 
Assessment OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement and 
OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways. The environmental category of the 
project is B, and the safeguards category is S2. Project response to triggered 
safeguards policies are as in table 6 below:- 
 
Table 6: Summary of World Bank policies triggered  
The objective of this policy is to 
ensure that Bank-financed 
projects are environmentally 
sound and sustainable, and that 
decision making is improved 
through appropriate analysis of 
actions and of their likely 
environmental impacts.  
 
This policy is triggered if a project 
is likely to have potential 
(adverse) environmental risks and 
impacts on its area of influence. 
OP 4.01 covers impacts on the 
natural environment (air, water 
and land); human health and 
safety; physical cultural resources; 
and transboundary and global 
environment concerns. 
Depending on the project 
and nature of impacts, a 
range of instruments can be 
used: EA, environmental 
audit, hazard or risk 
assessment and 
environmental management 
plan (EMP). 
 
When a project is likely to 
have sectoral or regional 
impacts, sectoral or regional 
EA is required. The 
Borrower is responsible for 
carrying out the EA. 
OP 4.01 
Environmental
Assessment 
Investments under RRRRLP will be subject to environmental and 
social screening during the planning stage, and appropriate steps will 
be taken based on the results of the environmental and social screening 
process outlined in this document 
OP 4.09  
Pest 
Management 
The objective of this policy is to (i) 
promote the use of biological or 
environmental control and reduce 
reliance on synthetic chemical 
pesticides; and (ii) strengthen the 
capacity of the c
ountry’s 
The policy is triggered if : (i) 
procurement of 
pesticides or pesticide 
application equipment is 
envisaged (either directly 
through the project, or 
Page  31
26
regulatory framework and 
institutions to promote and 
support safe, effective and 
environmentally sound pest 
management.  
 
More specifically, the policy aims 
to (a) Ascertain that pest 
management activities in Bank-
financed operations are based on 
integrated approaches and seek to 
reduce reliance on synthetic 
chemical pesticides IPM in 
agricultural projects and 
Integrated Vector Management 
(IVM) in public health projects. (b) 
Ensure that health and 
environmental hazards associated 
with pest management, especially 
the use of pesticides are 
minimized and can be properly 
managed by the user. (c) As 
necessary, support policy reform 
and institutional capacity 
development to (i) enhance 
implementation of IPM-based 
pest management and (ii) regulate 
and monitor the registration 
distribution and safe use of 
pesticides. 
indirectly through on-
lending, co-financing, or 
government counterpart 
funding); (ii) the project 
may affect pest 
management in a way that 
harm could be done, even 
though the project is not 
envisaged to procure 
pesticides. 
 
This includes projects that 
may (i) lead to 
substantially increased 
pesticide use and 
subsequent increase in 
health and environmental 
risk; (ii) maintain or expand 
present pest management 
practices that are 
unsustainable, not based on 
an IPM approach, and/or 
pose significant health or 
environmental risks. 
RRRRLP has prepared pest management guidance for sub-project 
(Annex 7). 
OP 4.12 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
The objective of this policy is to (i) 
avoid or minimize involuntary 
resettlement where feasible, 
exploring all viable alternative 
project designs; (ii) assist 
displaced persons in improving 
their former living standards, 
income earning capacity, and 
production levels, or at least in 
restoring them; (iii) encourage 
community participation in 
This policy covers not only 
physical relocation, but also 
any loss of land or other 
assets resulting in: (i) 
relocation or loss of shelter; 
(ii) loss of assets or access to 
assets; (iii) loss of income 
sources or means of 
livelihood, whether or not 
the affected people must 
move to another location. 
Page  32
27
planning and implementing 
resettlement; and (iv) provide 
assistance to affected people 
regardless of the legality of land 
tenure. 
This policy also applies to 
the involuntary restriction 
of access to legally 
designated parks and 
protected areas resulting in 
adverse impacts on the 
livelihoods of the displaced 
persons. 
Given that all sub-projects are planned and implemented based on 
decisions made by the communities in this regard, it is highly unlikely 
that OP 4.12 will be triggered. However, a resettlement screening form 
is as attached in annex 5 to safeguard compliance. In the event it is 
triggered a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be developed in 
compliance with OP 4.12. 
OP 7.50 
Projects in 
International 
Waters
 
The objective of this policy is 
to ensure that Bank-financed 
projects affecting international 
waterways would not affect: 
(i) relations between the Bank 
and its borrowers and between 
states (whether members of 
the Bank or not); and (ii) the 
efficient utilization and 
protection of international 
waterways. 
This policy is triggered if (a) 
any river, canal, lake or similar 
body of water that forms a 
boundary between, or any river 
or body of surface water that 
flows through two or more 
states, whether Bank members 
or not; (b) any tributary or 
other body of surface water 
that is a component of any 
waterway described under (a); 
and (c) any bay, gulf strait, or 
channel bounded by two or 
more states, or if within one 
state recognized as a necessary 
channel of communication 
between the open sea and other 
states, and any river flowing 
into such waters. 
The project involves rehabilitation of existing canals, and does not 
involve works and activities that would exceed original scheme, change 
its nature, or alter and expand its scope and extent to make it appear a 
new or different scheme. Consequently, given its rehabilitation works, 
the project falls under the exception set forth in paragraph 7 (a) of OP 
7.50 as (a) it will not adversely affect the quality or quantity of water 
flows to the other riparians; and (b) it will not be adversely affected by 
other riparians’ water use. A memorandum to this effect has been 
drafted and approved by the Regional Vice President. 
Page  33
28
5.2 Compliance with Somalia
’s environmental management policies 
Since 1991 Somalia has not functioned as a unitary state.  The state has effectively 
fragmented into distinct regional blocks, loosely reflecting the territorial 
distribution of 
major clans, which remain the dominant force in the country’s 
affairs. In areas where public administration has been established, advances have 
been made in restoring the former juridical system that incorporated 
environmental management policies spread within different acts. 
For instance in Somaliland, the 1971 law governing the Water Development 
Agency was amended in a draft Water Act and a Water Policy prepared in 2004.  
Two key Ministries of Pastoral Development and Environment and Agriculture 
have each sponsored a law: the Conservation and Protection Act of May 1998 by 
the Ministry of Pastoral Development and Environment and the Agricultural 
Land Property Law of August 1999 by the Ministry of Agriculture that are quite 
prolific in environmental management but do not apply in other regions. 
Additionally, in most rural communities, traditional Somali law (xeer) and the 
Islamic Sharia law continue to be upheld. The ownership of land and water is 
based on the Somali social organization where each clan is associated with a 
particular territory. The law for instance says that water is public property but 
allows appropriation and usage is acquired by administrative permits.  
The existence of a failed state presents opportunities for non compliance in most 
regions of Somalia. It is advised that general environmental procedure for 
issuing environmental permits as shown below be adapted to selected locality in 
the RRRRL project (even though the specific regulation may not exist):-

PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS
 
6.1
 
Process for Public Consultation
 
During the screening process,, consultations will be carried out with relevant 
stakeholders (table 7) including potentially affected persons..

Potentially affected 
persons 
Communities, Individuals and even local 
authorities 
The key elements of a communication strategy for this project are: 
i.  the provision of correct information about the decision-making and 
implementation process of the project, 
ii.  the creation of mechanisms which allow people to express their views and 
grievances about the process, collect concerns and suggestions, 
iii. 
the creation of mechanisms which create confidence and effectively 
answer people’s concern. 
 
6.2
 
Proposed Disclosure Plan
 
As RRRRLP has been processed as an emergency operation, the World Bank 
procedures require that an ESMF is prepared and publicly disclosed within six 
months of effectiveness of the operation.  
 
Towards this end, this document(s) will be publicly released through the FAO 
Somalia Office and project sites, and in public locations in project 
implementation areas and at the 
Bank’s 
Infoshop for project appraisal. The 
Page  36
31
documents should be made available in compliance with the World Bank
’s 
Public 
Consultation and Disclosure Policy. 
 
6.2.1 
 Disclosure of subproject EMPs 
EMPs prepared for subprojects under the RRRLP will also need to be disclosed to 
the public. Copies of the EMPs should be made available to communities and 
interested parties in accessible locations, through the local government 
authorities, i.e. local councils, district offices, etc. Copies of the EMPs should also 
be provided to the implementing agencies in each of the areas and submitted to 
FAO Somalia and the World Bank. This will ensure record keeping of all 
activities implemented under the ESMF, and ensure that the third-party audits 
have the adequate information required when undertaking the annual 
environmental audits. 
 
6.3 
 Information and consultation means 
 
i. 
Leaflets and Newsletters
:
Leaflets on the Project (related to key issues and 
schedule of implementation) will be disseminated (in both electronic and 
paper versions) to inform the general public.
 
ii. 
Workshops
:
Workshops will be held both at the district and local levels 
during the technical feasibility and EIA processes, to ensure appropriate 
information and its disclosure to the population
 
and civil society.
 
A
report 
of each workshop will be available in the project office site
 
and at the FAO 
offices.
 
iii. 
Public Hearings
:
In order to ensure that public is well informed and has 
the opportunity to express its opinions especially in sensitive matters 
(
EA 
and relocation) should they be triggered public hearings will be held. The 
project, would organize transport from every part of the district to ensure 
that
 
everybody has the possibility and means to attend the public hearing. 
Each public hearing will be recorded and followed by a public hearing 
report.

Annex 2 
Somalia Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 
 
1.  
A project
’s environmental management plan (EMP) consists of the set of 
mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken during 
implementation and operation to eliminate adverse environmental and 
social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels. The plan 
also includes the actions needed to implement these measures. 
Management plans are essential elements of EA reports for Category B2 
projects; for many Category B2 projects, the EA may result in a 
management plan only. To prepare a management plan, the borrower and 
its EA design team (a) identify the set of responses to potentially adverse 
impacts; (b) determine requirements for ensuring that those responses are 
made effectively and in a timely manner; and (c) describe the means for 
meeting those requirements. More specifically, the EMP includes the 
following components. 
 
Mitigation 
2.  
The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may reduce 
potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. 
The plan includes compensatory measures if mitigation measures are not 
feasible, cost-effective, or sufficient. Specifically, the EMP 
(a) Identifies and summarizes all anticipated significant adverse 
environmental impacts; 
(b) describes—with technical details— each mitigation measure, 
including the type of impact to which it relates and the 
conditions under which it is required, together with designs, 
equipment descriptions, and operating procedures, as 
appropriate; 
(c) Estimates any potential environmental impacts of these 
measures; and 
(d) Provides linkage with any other mitigation plans required for 
the project. 
 
Monitoring 
3. 
 
Environmental monitoring provides information particularly on the 
environmental impacts of the project and the effectiveness of mitigation 
measures. Such information enables the borrower and the Bank to 
evaluate the success of mitigation as part of project supervision, and 
allows corrective action to be taken when needed. Therefore, the EMP 
identifies monitoring objectives and specifies the type of monitoring. 
Specifically, the monitoring section of the EMP provides 
Page  42
37
(a) a specific description, and technical details, of monitoring 
measures, including the parameters to be measured, methods to 
be used, sampling locations, frequency of measurements, 
detection limits (where appropriate), and definition of 
thresholds that will signal the need for corrective actions; and 
(b) monitoring and reporting procedures to (i) ensure early 
detection of conditions that necessitate particular mitigation 
measures.  
 
Capacity Development and Training 
4.  
To support timely and effective implementation of environmental project 
components and mitigation measures, the EMP draws on the EA
’s 
assessment of the existence, role, and capability of environmental units on 
site or at the agency and ministry level. If necessary, the EMP 
recommends the establishment or expansion of such units, and the 
training of staff, to allow implementation of EA recommendations. 
Specifically, the EMP provides a specific description of institutional 
arrangements— who is responsible for carrying out the mitigatory and 
monitoring measures. To strengthen environmental management 
capability in the agencies responsible for implementation, most EMPs 
cover one or more of the following additional topics: (a) technical 
assistance programs,(b) procurement of equipment and supplies, and (c) 
organizational changes. 
 
Implementation Schedule and Cost Estimates 
5.  
For all three aspects (mitigation, monitoring, and capacity development), 
the EMP provides (a) an implementation schedule for measures that must 
be carried out as part of the project, showing phasing and coordination 
with overall project implementation plans; and (b) the capital and 
recurrent cost estimates and sources of funds for implementing the EMP. 
These figures are also integrated into the total project cost tables. 
 
Integration of EMP with Project 
6.  
The borrower’s decision to proceed with a project, and the Bank’s decision 
to support it are predicated in part on the expectation that the EMP will be 
executed effectively. Thus, EMP must be integrated into the project’s 
overall planning, design, budget, and implementation. Such integration is 
achieved by establishing the EMP within the project so that the plan will 
receive funding and supervision along with the other components.

Annex 4 
Somalia Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
Environmental Guidelines for Contractors 
General Environmental Management Conditions 
 
General: Applicability of These Environmental Guidelines and ESMP 
 
1. 
These general environmental guidelines apply to any work to be undertaken under 
the RRRRL Project. For certain work sites entailing specific environmental and/or 
social issues, a specific Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, including 
an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), has been prepared to 
address the above-mentioned specific issues in addition to these general 
environmental guidelines. 
 
2.  
In addition to these general conditions, the Contractor shall comply with 
any specific Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the works he is 
responsible for. The Contractor shall inform himself about such an EMP, 
and prepare his work strategy and plan to take into account relevant 
provisions of that EMP. If the Contractor fails to implement the approved 
EMP after written instruction by the project manager or designated officer 
within the requested time, the organization reserves the right to arrange 
for execution of the missing action by a third party on account of the 
Contractor. 
 
3.  
Notwithstanding the Contractor
’s obligation under the above clause, the 
Contractor shall implement all measures necessary to avoid undesirable 
adverse environmental and social impacts wherever possible, restore 
work sites to acceptable standards, and abide by any environmental 
performance requirements specified in an EMP. In general these measures 
shall include but not be limited to: 
(a)  Minimize the effect of dust on the surrounding environment resulting 
from earth mixing sites, vibrating equipment, temporary access roads, 
etc. to ensure safety, health and the protection of workers and 
communities living in the vicinity dust of producing activities. 
(b)  Ensure that noise levels emanating from machinery, vehicles and 
noisy construction activities (e.g. excavation, blasting) are kept at a 
minimum for the safety, health and protection of workers within the 
vicinity of high noise levels and nearby communities. 
(c)    Ensure that existing water flow regimes in rivers, streams and other 
natural or irrigation channels is maintained and/or re-established 
where they are disrupted due to works being carried out. 
(d)  Prevent bitumen, oils, lubricants and waste water used or produced 
during the execution of works from entering into rivers, streams, 
Page  46
41
irrigation channels and other natural water bodies/reservoirs, and 
also ensure that stagnant water in uncovered borrow pits is treated in 
the best way to avoid creating possible breeding grounds for 
mosquitoes. 
(e) Prevent and minimize the impacts of quarrying, earth borrowing, 
piling and building of temporary construction camps and access roads 
on the biophysical environment including protected areas and arable 
lands; local communities and their settlements. In as much as possible 
restore/rehabilitate all sites to acceptable standards. 
(f) Discourage construction workers from engaging in the exploitation of 
natural resources such as hunting, fishing, and collection of forest 
products or any other activity that might have a negative impact on 
the social and economic welfare of the local communities. 
(g) Implement soil erosion control measures in order to avoid surface run 
off and prevents siltation, etc. 
(h) Ensure that, in as much as possible, local materials are used to avoid 
importation of foreign material and long distance transportation. 
(k) Ensure public safety, and meet traffic safety requirements for the 
operation of work to avoid accidents. 
4.  
The Contractor shall indicate the period within which he/she shall 
maintain status on site after completions of civil works to ensure that 
significant adverse impacts arising from such works have been 
appropriately addressed. 
5.  
The Contractor shall adhere to the proposed activity implementation 
schedule and the monitoring plan / Strategy to ensure effective feedback 
of monitoring information to project management so that Impact 
management can be implemented properly, and if necessary, adapt to 
changing and unforeseen conditions. 
6.  
Besides the regular inspection of the sites by the project manager/ 
designated officer for adherence to the Contract conditions and 
specifications, the project may appoint an Inspector to oversee the 
compliance with these environmental conditions and any proposed 
mitigation measures. State environmental authorities may also carry out 
similar inspection duties.  
 
Material Excavation and Deposit 
7.  
The Contractor shall obtain appropriate licenses/permits from relevant 
authorities to operate quarries or borrow areas. 
8.  
The location of quarries and borrow areas shall be subject to approval by 
relevant local and national authorities, including traditional authorities if 
the land on which the quarry or borrow areas fall in traditional land. 
9.  
New extraction sites: 
Page  47
42
a) Shall not be located in the vicinity of settlement areas, cultural sites, 
wetlands or any other valued ecosystem component, or on high or steep 
ground or in areas of high scenic value, and shall not be located less than 
1km from such areas. 
b) Shall not be located adjacent to stream channels wherever possible to 
avoid siltation of river channels. Where they are located near water 
sources, borrow pits and perimeter drains shall surround quarry sites 
c) Shall not be located in archaeological areas. Excavations in the vicinity of 
such areas shall proceed with great care and shall be done in the presence 
of government authorities having a mandate for their protection. 
d) Shall not be located in forest reserves. However, where there are no other 
alternatives, permission shall be obtained from the appropriate authorities 
and an environmental impact study shall be conducted. 
e) Shall be easily rehabilitated. Areas with minimal vegetation cover such as 
flat and bare ground, or areas covered with grass only or covered with 
shrubs less than 1.5m in height, are preferred. 
f) Shall have clearly demarcated and marked boundaries to minimize 
vegetation clearing. 
10.  
Vegetation clearing shall be restricted to the area required for safe 
operation of construction work. Vegetation clearing shall not be done 
more than two months in advance of operations. 
 
Rehabilitation and Soil Erosion Prevention 
11.  
To the extent practicable, the Contractor shall rehabilitate the site 
progressively so that the rate of rehabilitation is similar to the rate of 
construction. 
12.  
Always remove and retain topsoil for subsequent rehabilitation. Soils shall 
not be stripped when they are wet as this can lead to soil compaction and 
loss of structure. 
13.  
Topsoil shall not be stored in large heaps. Low mounds of no more than 1 
to 2m high are recommended. 
14. 
Re-vegetate stockpiles to protect the soil from erosion, discourage weeds 
and maintain an active population of beneficial soil microbes. 
15.  
To the extent practicable, reinstate natural drainage patterns where they 
have been altered or impaired. 
16.  
Ensure reshaped land is formed so as to be inherently stable, adequately 
drained and suitable for the desired long-term land use, and allow natural 
regeneration of vegetation. 
17.  
Compacted surfaces shall be deep ripped to relieve compaction unless 
subsurface conditions dictate otherwise. 
18. 
 
Re-vegetate with plant species that will control erosion, provide 
vegetative diversity and, through succession, contributes to a resilient 
ecosystem. The choice of plant species for rehabilitation shall be done in 
Page  48
43
consultation with local research institutions, forest department and the 
local people. 
 
Water Resources Management 
19.  
The Contractor shall at all costs avoid conflicting with water demands of 
local communities. 
20.  
Abstraction of both surface and underground water shall only be done 
with the consultation of the local community and after obtaining a permit 
from the relevant Water Authority. 
21.  
Abstraction of water from wetlands shall be avoided. Where necessary, 
authority has to be obtained from relevant authorities. 
22.  
No construction water containing spoils or site effluent, especially cement 
and oil, shall be allowed to flow into natural water drainage courses. 
 
Cost of Compliance 
23.  
It is expected that compliance with these conditions is already part of 
standard good workmanship and state of art as generally required under 
this Contract. The item 
“Compliance with Environmental Management 
Conditions” covers these costs. No other payments will be made to the 
Contractor for compliance with any request to avoid and/or mitigate an 
avoidable environmental and social impact(s).

Annex 5: 
Somalia Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
Land Acquisition Assessment 
 
The Land Acquisition Assessment serves as a screening tool to determine any 
potential issues that might emerge in relation to land acquisition for sub-projects 
such as slaughter houses, roads, ancillary facilities etc. Based on the screening 
results, the qualified member of the review team in consultation with potentially 
affected persons and relevant partners will discuss whether to (a) redesign the 
sub-project to avoid the need for land acquisition; or (b) retain the original sub-
project location and develop a comprehensive plan to compensate affected 
persons in accordance with OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement and the Banks 
procedures. 
 
Thus, as part of the environmental and social screening process, a qualified 
member of the review team will address the points below using the land 
acquisition assessment tool; the latter will be used to collect the following 
information: 
1.  
Location of the site 
2.  
Size of the site 
3.  
Status of the site: Is the land owned privately, publicly, collectively? Does 
someone hold a title to the land? Who is the legal owner of the land? 
4.  
Present use of the land: Is it used for agricultural purposes? Is the land not 
used by anybody? 
5.  
Who currently benefits from the use of the land in question: Are the 
current 
beneficiaries’ legal owners, renters, squatters, or do they hold legal 
contracts? 
6.  
What is the value of the land, the structures that have been built on this 
land? 
7.  
Who is donating/selling the site, and how is the donation/sales process to 
take place? 
 
In the event that private land will be donated/sold, the qualified member of the 
review team will ensure that this transaction is documented to show that the 
land was donated/sold willingly; the document is signed and notarized by the 
donor/seller and counter-signed by the local administrator and the relevant 
project staff; and a copy of this document is placed in the files of the local 
administrator for future reference.

Annex 6: 
Somalia Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies
 
·
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). 
As expounded in Section 5.1  
 
•
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). 
The conservation of natural habitats, like other 
measures that protect and enhance the environment, is essential for long-term 
sustainable development. The Bank does not support projects involving the 
significant conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives 
for the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that 
overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. 
If the environmental assessment indicates that a project would significantly 
convert or degrade natural habitats, the project includes mitigation measures 
acceptable to the Bank. Such mitigation measures include, as appropriate, 
minimizing habitat loss (e.g. strategic habitat retention and post-development 
restoration) and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected 
area. The Bank accepts other forms of mitigation measures only when they are 
technically justified. Should the sub-project-specific EAs indicate that natural 
habitats might be affected negatively by the proposed sub-project activities, such 
sub-projects will not be funded under the proposed RRRRL project. 
 
•
Pest Management (OP 4.09). 
As expounded in Section 5.1  
 
•
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). 
The resettlement policy is triggered when 
people are affected by loss of land, loss of property and/or loss of access to 
resources. It is therefore irrelevant whether or not the impact will entail 
physically relocation of the affected people, the policy is triggered in all such 
cases. This means that the impact may be of such kind that only compensation in 
cash or kind is necessary.  
 
•
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). 
This directive provides guidance to ensure that 
indigenous people benefit from development projects, and to avoid or mitigate 
adverse effects of Bank-financed development projects on indigenous people. 
Measures to address issues pertaining to indigenous peoples must be based on 
the informed participation of the indigenous people themselves. Sub-projects 
that would have negative impacts on indigenous people will not be funded 
under the proposed RRRRL project. 
 
•
Forests (OP 4.36). 
This policy applies to the following types of Bank-financed 
investment projects: (a) projects that have or may have impacts on the health and 
quality of forests; (b) projects that affect the rights and welfare of people and 
their level of dependence upon or interaction with forests; and (c) projects that 
Page  51
46
aim to bring about changes in the management, protection, or utilization of 
natural forests or plantations, whether they are publicly, privately, or 
communally owned. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, 
would involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or 
related critical habitats. If a project involves the significant conversion or 
degradation of natural forests or related natural habitats that the Bank 
determines are not critical, and the Bank determines that there are no feasible 
alternatives to the project and its siting, and comprehensive analysis 
demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the 
environmental costs, the Bank may finance the project provided that it 
incorporates appropriate mitigation measures. Sub-projects that are likely to 
have negative impacts on forests will not be funded under the proposed RRRRL 
project. 
 
•
Cultural Property (OP 4.11). 
The term “cultural property” includes sites 
having archaeological (prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious, and 
unique natural values. The Bank’s general policy regarding cultural property is 
to assist in their preservation, and to seek to avoid their elimination. Specifically, 
the Bank (i) normally declines to finance projects that will significantly damage 
non-replicable cultural property, and will assist only those projects that are sited 
or designed so as to prevent such damage; and (ii) will assist in the protection 
and enhancement of cultural properties encountered in Bank-financed projects, 
rather than leaving that protection to chance. The management of cultural 
property of a country is the responsibility of the government. The government’s 
attention should be drawn specifically to what is known about the cultural 
property aspects of the proposed project site and appropriate agencies, NGOs, or 
university departments should be consulted; if there are any questions 
concerning cultural property in the area, a brief reconnaissance survey should be 
undertaken in the field by a specialist. The proposed RRRRL project will not 
fund sub-projects that will have negative impacts on cultural property. 
 
•
Safety of Dams (OP 4.37). 
For the life of any dam, the owner is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate measures are taken and sufficient resources provided 
for the safety to the dam, irrespective of its funding sources or construction 
status. The Bank distinguishes between small and large dams. Small dams are 
normally less than 15 m in height; this category includes, for example, farm 
ponds, local silt retention dams, and low embankment tanks. For small dams, 
generic dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers are usually 
adequate. The proposed RRRRL project will not fund sub-projects that will 
impacts dams.  
 
Page  52
47
•
International waterways (OP 7.50). 
As expounded in Section 5.1. 
 
•
Disputed Areas (OP 7.60)
.
Project in disputed areas may occur the Bank and its 
member countries as well as between the borrower and one or more neighboring 
countries. Any dispute over an area in which a proposed project is located 
requires formal procedures at the earliest possible stage. The Bank attempts to 
acquire assurance that it may proceed with a project in a disputed area if the 
governments concerned agree that, pending the settlement of the dispute, the 
project proposed can go forward without prejudice to the claims of the country 
having a dispute. This policy is not expected to be triggered by sub-projects. This 
policy is unlikely to be triggered by sub-projects to be funded by the proposed 
RRRRL project. 
Page  53
48
Annex 7: 
Somalia Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural Livelihoods Project 
Pest Management Plan 
Guideline
 
Small-scale agricultural and livestock sub-projects in RRRRLP may involve 
strengthening existing practices, introducing, diversifying or the intensification 
of crop production. Support for the development of small-scale agriculture and 
certain livestock activities may lead to the introduction or increased use of 
pesticides and other agricultural chemicals such as herbicides and fertilizers. It is 
critical that appropriate planning, design and management be adopted for the 
handling, use, and management of all agricultural chemicals to avoid potential 
negative environmental impacts. For the sub-projects funded under RRRRLP, a 
pest management plan will address issues under the principal of Good 
Agricultural practices (GAP) including post harvest management. 
 
GAP are composed of a series of inter-related protocols, to apply in on-farm 
production and post-production processes designed to improve sustainability of 
crop production in the scenario of ever-increasing agro-ecological zone (AEZ) 
fragility and are aimed at meeting consumer needs for products that are of high 
quality, safe and produced in an environmentally and socially responsible way. 
GAP protocols require being informed on integrated production techniques for 
each of the major agro-ecological areas, thus to collect, analyze and disseminate 
information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts and relies on four 
principles (i) economically and efficiently produced sufficient, safe and 
nutritious products; (ii) sustain and enhance natural resources; (iii) maintain 
viable farming enterprises and contribute to sustainable livelihoods; (iv) meet 
cultural and social demands of society.  
 
GAP provides a means to assess and decide upon farming practices at each step 
in the production process. For any given agricultural production system, a sound 
and comprehensive management strategy must be in place providing for the 
capability for tactical adjustments in response to changes in circumstances. 
Implementing such a management strategy requires knowing, understanding, 
planning, measuring, monitoring, and record keeping, with the aim of achieving 
production, safety and sustainability goals. Successful implementation depends 
upon developing the skill and knowledge bases, on continuous monitoring and 
analysis of performance, and the use of expert advice as required.  
 
The process of developing and supporting the adoption of GAP is to:  
 
·
Formulate a set of generic practices and indicators from which guidelines 
for good agricultural practices for on-farm production and post-
Page  54
49
production systems can be developed, collaboratively by the public and 
private sectors and civil society  
·
Focus existing knowledge, options, and solutions into effective product 
safety and environmental risk analysis guidelines available for use as 
policy instruments  
·
Review existing codes of practice  
·
Translate codes of practice into management guidelines for crop and 
livestock systems in specific agro-ecological zones.  
·
Engage in discussion with governments on their strategies, priorities and 
instruments to move towards sustainable agriculture and rural 
development practices.  
 
The project will promote five practices that are considered the 
‘core’ of on-farm 
GAP that are promoted by FAO as part of its overall programme in technical 
assistance and capacity building for agriculture development, poverty 
alleviation, food security, environmental services, and natural resources 
management.  
 
Conservation Agriculture (CA):
 
Consists of three interlinked principles which have 
to be in place simultaneously or obtained gradually: minimal or no soil 
disturbance, permanent and maximum soil cover and crop rotations or 
associations/diversification. The outcome of well-applied CA provides the base 
for sustainable and profitable agriculture if combined with other elements of 
GAP. It subsequently aims at improved livelihoods of farmers.  
 
Integrated Production and Protection Management (IPPM):
 
The objective of IPPM is 
to reduce the use of and the reliance on pesticides to control pest and diseases. 
This is achieved through the growing of adapted cultivars, combined with 
appropriate cultivation practices and production technologies. In this way IPPM 
is a further development of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) expressing a 
stronger integration into the entire crop management, with the objective to 
reduce and where possible eliminate the use of pesticides by the application of 
suitable crop management practices. The tenet followed focuses on six control 
areas; 
 
·
Cultural pest control; the manipulation of sowing and harvest dates to 
minimize damage, intercropping, vegetation management to enhance 
natural processes, crop rotation and tillage systems. 
·
Host plant resistance; the breeding of crop varieties that are less 
susceptible to pests. 
·
Biological control; the conservation and manipulation of natural 
enemies; the introduction of exotic natural enemies and the use of 
microbial pesticides. 
Page  55
50
·
The rational use of chemical pesticides with economic thresholds. 
·
Mechanical control; use of tools or machinery; especially important for 
weed control. 
·
Legal control; the enforcement of measures and policies that control the 
utilization of pesticides.  
 
Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems (IPNS):
 
The concept of IPNS takes into 
consideration the nutrient cycle involving soils, crops and livestock, nutrient 
deficiencies, organic recycling, conjunctive use of organic manures and mineral 
fertilizers and biological nitrogen fixing potential. Of particular importance are 
not only the values of nutrients in the soil, but the relations between different 
groups of elements to achieve healthy and balanced plant nutrition. Nutrient 
dynamics in soils, the availability and accessibility of nutrients depends also of 
other soil characteristics, such as structure, moisture, biological activity and 
organic matter.  
 
Integrated Weed Management (IWM)
:
The aim of IWM is to use a combination of 
different practices to maintain weed densities at manageable levels. An 
integrated weed management approach to land management combines the use of 
complementary weed control methods such as grazing, herbicide application, 
land fallowing and biological control.
