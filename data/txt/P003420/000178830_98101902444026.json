small- and medium-size industrial projects needing\n            foreign exchange. The objective will be to help raise\n            investment efficiency through import of technology and the\n            introduction of improved project design and selection\n            methodology. Subborrowers will be some 60-80 state and\n            collective enterprises primarily in coastal provinces and\n            municipalities. Based on the experience under CIB I, the\n            investments are expected to have high financial and economic\n            returns. The main project risks relate to the capacity of\n            CIB, which is a young institution, to strengthen its\n            appraisal standards, especially in the technical, economic\n            and marketing areas, and to the need for continued\n            government commitment to CIB within the process of economic\n            reform. However, the project provides for recruitment of\n            additional technical and economic staff, plus training and\n            marketing consultancy for CIB's ability to identify and\n            evaluate projects. Furthermore, the Government's\n            commitment to economic reforms and to CIB remain firm."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
