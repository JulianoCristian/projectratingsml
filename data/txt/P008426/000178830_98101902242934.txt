INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A. (NIBID)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HELLENIC STATE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (NIBID),
with the guarantee of the Hellenic State, for the equivalent of US$25 mil-
lion to help finance a development finance company project. The loan would
have a fixed term of 12 years including two years of grace. The interest
rate would be 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Greece" (EMA-49a), dated March 22, 1972, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 31, 1972. An economic updating mission visited Greece in
January 1975 and is preparing its report; its findings are reflected in the
following paragraphs. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Following the Cyprus crisis in July 1974, the seven-year old mili-
tary regime was replaced by an interim civilian Government. In November 1974,
an elected Government, backed by a large parliamentary majority, was estab-
lished. In December 1974, the Greeks voted to establish a republic. The new
Government has been largely preoccupied with foreign policy issues, especially
relations with Turkey, and with economic issues, particularly the need to re-
store and broaden economic relations with the world at large and with the EEC,
as well as inflation, a growing balance of payments deficit and stagnating
economic activity.
4.        Throughout the 1960's and up to 1972, the Greek economy enjoyed
rapid GDP growth averaging 8 percent per year in real terms, with the main
stimulus coming from rapidly rising domestic demand stemming from large in-
creases in private fixed investment - especially in housing - and public in-
frastructure investment. Private consumption rose at a rate of 8 percent
per annum and gross fixed capital formation at 11 percent over this period.
This growth was associated with relatively stable prices. However, by the
end of 1972, as the economy reached full employment, supply constraints began
to develop and domestic prices came under increasing pressure. The inflation-
ary trend was reinforced by the termination of price controls in 1973 and by
increases in import prices, particularly of petroleum (after October 1973),
higher agriculture support prices, and increased Government expenditures.
Consumer prices, which had increased by less than 3 percent per annum (on an
annual average basis) in the previous five years, rose 16 percent in 1973 and
27 percent in 1974; but Government measures, including reduced budgetary out-
lays and restrictive monetary policies, reduced the increase in the second
half of 1974 to only 5 percent. However, these restrictive policies, together



- 2 -
with the impact of the Cyprus crisis and resulting domestic political uncer-
tainties, severely affected economic growth. GDP increased by about 9 percent
in 1973, but declined by about 1 percent in 1974. GNP per capita in 1974
(Atlas basis) is estimated at about $1,780.
5.        Agriculture still accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, 40 percent
of employment and 35 percent of all exports, besides providing raw materials
for the food processing and textile industries. Agricultural production has
increased by 5 percent per annum since 1968, somewhat below overall GDP
growth, but dropped in 1973. Following an increase in support prices in
October 1973, and with favorable climatic conditions, output increased by a
record 13 percent in 1974. Growth in agriculture continues to be hampered
by insufficient development of irrigation, the small size and fragmented
nature of farm holdings, and inadequate extension services.
6.        Industry has been the most dynamic sector, with an average annual
growth of nearly 10 percent between 1968 and 1974; industrial value added in-
creased by 13 percent in 1973; but dropped by almost 6 percent in 1974. There
was an increase in industry's share of GDP from nearly 29 to 32 percent. The
share of manufactured goods in total exports also increased sharply, from 25
percent in 1968 to an estimated 45 percent in 1974, largely as a result of in-
creased capacity in the chemical and basic metal industries. Despite rising
productivity, however, Greek industrial growth is still restricted by a small
domestic market, limited export orientation, inappropriate plant size and
heavy dependence on capital goods imports. The Government emphasis on indus-
trial development as a key to rapid growth is well justified. However, there
is a clear need for Government,guidance in determining priorities for future
industrial growth, including an emphasis on highly productive export-oriented
industries and medium skill consumer goods establishments, which can take ad-
vantage of a relatively inexpensive labor force.
7.        The Government has several credit channels for promoting industrial
development (para. 29), and regulates interest rates as a tool for stimulating
and directing investment in that sector as in others. These rates do not
necessarily reflect market conditions or the availability of capital; however,
with the curtailment of the rate of inflation in 1974, these rates have
moved closer to market rates. The interest rate structure is determined by
the Currency Committee, which establishes maximum rates for each type of
deposit and credit. The highest lending rate is 14 percent p.a. for imports
and domestic trade; the lowest is 3 percent p.a. for certain types of credit
for farmers. The maximum interest rate for long-term loans to industry is
10.5 percent plus a 1 percent commission p.a. which banks and investment in-
stitutions, including NIBID, are normally allowed to charge.
8.        Recent economic difficulties have been compounded by a deterioration
of the balance of payments in the last two years. The trade deficit stood at
$1.6 billion in 1972. It increased sharply to $2.8 billion in 1973 as im-
ports grew rapidly, reflecting domestic supply constraints caused by a high
level of economic activity. In 1974, the import bill increased only moderate-
ly, as non-oil imports reflected the decline in GDP. The increase in the oil



-3 -
import bill was $444 million, but re-exports of oil products rose too; the net
increase was $360 million, equivalent to 12 percent of 1973 exports of goods
and non-factor services and workers' remittances.   Rapidly rising exports
prevented any further rise in the trade deficit. While exports, particularly
of manufactured products, have grown by about 25 percent per annum between
1968 and 1974, they still finance only about one-third of commodity imports.
Invisible earnings, mainly from shipping, workers' remittances and tourism,
have usually been equivalent to nearly half of commodity imports. In 1974,
however, this proportion declined to 35 percent, reflecting lower tourism
receipts - largely because of the Cyprus crisis - and a decline in workers'
remittances due to reduced demand for foreign workers in Europe. As a result
of these developments, the current account deficit increased threefold from
1972, to some $1.2 billion in 1973 and 1974. Greece has had only limited
access to long-term foreign capital, and inflows of concessional funds have
been minimal. As a result, financing needs have been met by medium-- and short-
term borrowing as well as by suppliers' credits. The terms of borrowing
deteriorated noticeably in 1973 and 1974, reflecting both higher interest
rates and declining grace periods. Although foreign exchange reserves were
about $1 billion in 1972, the increased current account deficit and rising
amortization of capital inflows led to a slight decline to about $900 million
at the end of 1974. This was equivalent to less than 2-1/2 months of imports.
9.        The Government is postponing the formulation of a new medium-term
development plan for at least one year, until investment priorities can be
established. The crucial elements in such a plan are, however, already
apparent: reduction of dependence on agricultural and petroleum imports,
promotion of industrial and ag,ricultural exports, and less housing invest-
ment than over the last decade. Tourism and transport infrastructure, and
in particular highway construction, are likely to be accorded lower priority
than in the past.
10.       The Greek economy faces significant problems.   In the short-term,
the Government may experience difficulties in striking the right balance be-
tween measures directed to restore aggregate purchasing power and regenerate
growth on the one hand, and tihose to ensure relative price stability and ex-
ternal balance on the other.   Given the immediate priority of stabilization,
GDP growth is unlikely to exceed 2-3 percent in 1975, with the main contri-
butions coming from agricultural output and exports of manufactured goods. It
may not recover to the long-term trend of about 7 percent even in 1976. The
Government expects to keep price increases below 10 percent in 1975. lieavy
dependence on imports, especially for capital goods, and the vulnerability of
earnings from shipping, tourism and workers' remittances, pose serious short-
term problems. Even after taking into consideration available undisbursed
loan funds, access to the IMF oil facility, uncommitted funds from EIB, a new
financial protocol being prepared with the EEC, and a possible recourse to
the IMF, Greece will have to borrow a significant amount on world capital
markets and will need to obtain as great a proportion in long-term funding
as possible. In 1975 and 1976, the financing gap to be filled by non-conces-
sionary borrowing is forecast at $700 million and $980 million respectively,
assuming reserves are to be kept at the equivalent of at least 2 months of
imports.



- 4 -
11.       Although Greece's economy is approaching a more advanced stage of
development, significant regional and sectoral disparities persist. Further-
more, the economy has to prepare itself to face increasing competition from
imports from the European Economic Community (EEC), particularly in the indus-
trial sector, where tariffs and other protective barriers are being gradually
reduced under the Association Agreement with the EEC. Given the level of
economic development already achieved, a GDP growth rate of about 7 percent
per annum over the longer term seems feasible, provided there is favorable
weather for agriculture and provided relative price stability is maintained.
It depends mainly on continuing expansion of manufacturing industry at about
10 percent per annum and an increase in agricultural production of 4-5 per-
oent per annum. Participation in the EEC should foster improved management
and technological modernization. Greece has important assets in its flexible,
market-oriented entrepreneurial capacity and a comparatively cheap labor
force by European standards. However, full utilization of these resources
will require increased investment in. agriculture, in export-oriented indus-
tries, and the introduction of effective vocational, technical and managerial
training.
12.       Public external debt outstanding at the end of 1973 amounted to
$2,250 million, of which $730 million was undisbursed. Reported new commit-
ments in 1974 amounted to $404 million (excluding $124 million from the IMF
oil facility). Debt service payments in 1973 reached $?60 million (of which
$6 million was on Bank loans), and represented 8 percent of receipts from ex-
ports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances. Service pay-
ments on existing debt are expected to stabilize at around $350 million until
1980. Based on reasonable expectations regarding export growth and future
borrowing, the debt service ratio would increase to about 13 percent by 1980.
About 3 percent of total service payments would be due to IBRD. In view of
the good prospects for future economic growth, even if at a diminished rate,
Greece continues to be creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GREECE
13.       Bank lending to Greece started in 1968, after disputes in connec-
tion with the country's pre-war external debt had been substantially settled.
Greece has received eight loans totalling $163.9 million (net of cancella-
tions), of which $146.6 million was held by the Bank as of April 1975. These
include four loans totalling $71.6 to the National Investment Bank for Indus-
trial Development (NIBID), two loans for education ($37.3 million), and two
loans for irrigation ($55 million). In addition to the above, a third educa-
tion project of $45 million has been presented to the Board. The execution
of Bank financed projects has generally been satisfactory. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of April 30, 1975,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 5 -
14.       Bank assistance to Greece aims at providing essential infrastructure
in key sectors, including highways and sewerage; reducing regional disparities,
particularly in agriculture and industrial development; and supporting the
modernization of institutions in sectors where Bank financing would be pro-
vided. A third irrigation project has been appraised and is likely to be
ready for Board consideration in the first half of FY76. The Bank is acting
as executive agency for UNDP financed highway reconnaissance and feasibility
studies, which are expected to lead to a highway project, including support
for highway maintenance, later in FY76. A sewerage project being processed
would emphasize institution building as well as improving living conditions
in towns outside the highly developed Athens area.
15.       Greece is of course a developing country with a relatively high per
capita income, and should be able before long to finance its development pro-
gram without resort to the resources of the Bank. However, some further Bank
lending to Greece is still justified by the fact that the country's external
capital requirements still exceed what it can raise from alternative market
sources on reasonable terms, as well as by the role which the Government
wishes the Bank to play in strengthening some sectors critical for the country's
further economic development and for which the Bank is probably the only pre-
sent source of external funds. This year, Greece is facing particularly dif-
ficult balance of payments pressures at this critical juncture in its economic
and political life, and some relatively quick disbursing projects have been
included in the program.
16.       IFC has made investments totalling $16.2 million in six Greek com-
panies. An equity and loan investment of $600,000 was made in a fertilizer
factory in 1962 (sold in 1970); and equity investment of $720,000 in NIBID in
1965 (reduced to $102,000 in 1974); loan and equity investments totalling $8.7
million in an aluminum company in 1970 and 1972. In early 1975, IFC invested
$1.15 million in an agro-industry project in Larisa for processing of toma-
toes, and at later stages, asparagus and peaches from the area of the Ground-
water Development Project assisted by the Bank (Loan 754-GR).
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
17.       The Greek authorities have traditionally refrained from direct in-
volvement in industry, and the only major industrial public enterprise is the
Public Power Corporation (P.P.C.) which has a monopoly for electricity gene-
ration and distribution on the mainland. The Government has sought to develop
this sector, particularly the manufacturing sub-sector, by providing attrac-
tive incentives, including the maintenance of corporate taxation at a rela-
tively favorable level, and by making low cost capital available through the
banking system. The system of tax and credit incentives has encouraged large
investments from domestic and foreign sources, and favors export orientation
and more balanced regional development of various regions in Greece. In
particular, foreign investments have been encouraged through constitutional
guarantees, special tax incentives and measures allowing capital and earnings
to be repatriated. Protective measures, such as tariffs, restrictive quotas



and controls on investments and access to incentives, have not been major
factors influencing industrial development and are expected to play an in-
creasingly smaller role as external tariffs are progressively decreased in
line with the agreement with the EEC.
18.       In recent years there has been a significant trend towards more ex-
tensive development and processing of domestic or imported raw materials. A
major recent development has been the establishment of a few large petroleum
refineries with units geared for export of refined products from imported
crude oil (the refining capacity doubled in the last two years to about 20
million tons). Large capacity additions to the steel, aluminum and fertilizer
plants are underway and should contribute to foreign exchange earnings by
expanding the share of mineral exports that are domestically processed.
P.P.C. will also expand its production of lignite to reduce oil import needs.
The textile industry has also shown substantial growth, relying largely on
a domestic surplus of cotton.
19.       M4anufacturing is the dynamic motivating force behind the growth of
the Greek economy and a major source of gains in value added and productivity
experienced in recent years. It has contributed about one-third of GDP growth
since 1958 and today accounts for about 70 percent of the industrial GDP.
Manufacturing also accounts for more than 65 percent of the industrial labor
force, and has contributed substantially to the reduction of underemployment
in rural areas and in limiting net emigration flows. The drtive population
employed in manufacturing establishments numbers approximately 550,000 persons.
Nevertheless, Greek industry is primarily small scale, with 95 percent of
enterprises employing less than 20 workers. In view of the association with
the LEC and the need for improved competitiveness, the Government is placing
greater emphasis on capital intensive industrial development, and less
emphasis on increasing employment.
20.       The manufacturing sector generated about $900 million in foreign
exchange in 1974 (50 percent of total exports), compared with about $220 mil-
lion in 1970 (35 percent of total exports). This corresponds to an average
increase of 30.7 percent per year. In 1973 more than three-fourths of total
manufactured exports originated from chemicals (about 29 percent), basic
;.etals (about 20 percent), food processing (about 14 percent), and textiles
(about 14 percent). Chemical exports more than doubled over the period 1970-
1973, reflecting the new refinery capacity geared for export production. Ex-
ports of petroleum products reached 3.9 million tons in 1974 up from 0.3 mil-
lion tons in 1970, an increase in export sales of $125 million or about 20
percent of the total increase in manufacturing exports over this period; tex-
tiles, yarn and thread (contributing 15 percent of the total increase), fer-
tilizers and steel products also performed well.
21.       In spite of considerable progress, only 10.2 percent of total manu-
facturing production was exported in 1973 and only a few enterprises export
more than 20 percent of their output. The impressive performance of exports
in 1974, stems mostly from an increase in cement products and metal goods,
and from refinery products which have benefited from large price increases.



- 7 -
Moreover, the economy is still greatly dependent on capital goods imports
(more than $1 billion in 1973), particularly machinery imports. Capital
goods imports accounted for about 25 percent of investments in 1973, com-
pared to 13 percent in 1960.
22.       The prospects for further growth in the manufacturing sub-sector
are good, and the association with the EEC should provide a larger market
for Greek exports. Greece also plans to expand long standing ties with the
Middle East market. Industrialization efforts will continue to be hampered,
however, by the relatively small size of most domestic firms and the thinness
of the capital market. Skilled manpower is also still relatively scarce and
renewed efforts will be needed to gear existing education and training insti-
tutions to the needs of Greek industry and to promote advanced training pro-
grams for more mature and experienced personnel. On the other hand manufac-
turing enterprises are fortunately not handicapped by heavy investment in
aging plants or technology, and are not short on risk-oriented entrepreneu-
rial capacity. Provided government policies are strengthened (see para. 6),
adequate medium and long term financing is made available, and an emphasis
is placed on export-oriented production, the growth rate of the manufacturing
sub-sector should continue at a high level. For the near future, the Greek
manufacturing sector is expected to benefit from continued foreign capital
investment, greater availability of domestic credit due to the relative de-
cline in investment in housing, and a large labor pool, due to reduced emig-
ration abroad. Besides good prospects for major large-scale projects in
steel, chemicals and basic metals, there is substantial opportunity for less
capital intensive projects in certain fields of textiles, wood products and
appliances. The food processing industry should also continue to have good
marketing opportunities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
23.       The proposed project was prepared by NIBID and appraised in January
1975. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1975. The Greek delega-
tion included Mr. Costa P. Caranicas, representing the Guarantor, (hereinafter
also referred to as the Government) and Mr. George Gondicas, Managing Direc-
tor of NIBID.
The Project
24.       The objective of the proposed loan, the fifth to NIBID, is to help
meet NIBID's additional resource requirements for 1975 and 1976 and support
its continuing efforts to further regional development and .to promote export-
oriented industrial enterprises. In view of NIBID's institutional vitality
and ability to promote viable and quick disbursing sub-projects, the proposed
loan would help ameliorate the current strains on Greece's balance of payments
as well as assist in improving Greece's balance of trade over the long run.
Details regarding the proposed project are given in the Project and Loan

Summary in Annex III. An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of NIBID,
Greece" (No. 703a-GR) dated May 22, 1975 is being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
25.       Despite a decline in economic activity in Greece in 1974, NIBID
approved loans and equity participations totalling Dr 1,874 million in 1974
compared to Dr 1,772 million in 1973 and Dr 1,187 million in 1972. NIBID's
sub-projects in "developed areas" declined to 32 percent of its total opera-
tion in 1974, as against 49 percent in 1972, in line with its policy of
seeking regional dispersion of its activities and supporting the Government's
objective of developing the less developed Greek provinces. NIBID's sub-
projects were mostly in construction materials, textiles and metals subsectors,
the latter two being export-oriented. As of early 1975, NIBID's project pipe-
line already totalled over $33 million, which underlines the prospects of a
continuing high growth of operations in 1975 and 1976, despite the present
low level of economic activity. In pursuing its policy of promoting enter-
prises in less developed regions and those with an export-orientation, besides
that of encouraging agro-based industries, NIBID expects to commit about $170
million in new sub-projects over the next two years. At the end of 1974, it
had uncommitted resources of about $13. million equivalent, and will therefore
have to raise resources on the order of $160 million from domestic and foreign
resources (including internal cash generation) to cover the estimated level of
its commitments in 1975 and 1976.
26.       For a number of reasons outside NIBID's control, the expectations
at the time of the 1973 Bank loan to NIBID that it would be able to borrow
increasingly on its own from domestic and external resources, have not been
realized. NIBID did raise a loan of $5 million from a Belgian bank, besides
actively exploring loan possibilities with other European sources as well as
a middle-east government. However, market conditions, and, more importantly,
the Cyprus crisis, were factors which prevented these possibilities from
materializing. The issue of domestic bonds was precluded by the high rate of
domestic inflation, as a result of which even the Government refrained from
issuing bonds. While NIBID intends to continue efforts to diversify its
access to resources and to borrow directly on the domestic and international
capital markets, NIBID proposes to cover the aforementioned financing require-
ment of about $160 million for 1975 and 1976 in the following manner: about
$58 million will be borrowed from the National Bank of Greece (NBG) - which
is the majority owner of NIBID - and the Bank of Greece (BG); $15 million
through sale of its preferred non-voting shares (at a 200 percent premium
over par value); about $25 million from internally generated funds; about
$20 million from the European Investment rank (EIB) and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW), with both of whom discussions are continuing; and about
$15 million through borrowings from the international capital market in 1976
provided acceptable terms can be arranged. If NIBID is unable to obtain re-
sources to the extent hoped for from EIB, KFW, and the international capital
market, it will either have to increase its borrowings from NBG and BG, or
scale down its operations. Even assuming it is successful, NIBID still faces
a shortfall of about 15 percent or $25 million equivalent, in order to cover
fully the envisaged level of commitments it realistically expects to make
over the next two years. The proposed Bank loan of $25 million will meet



-9-
this shortfall and help cover NIBID's anticipated financial needs. Bank funds
would be used to finance the full cost of direct imports and the import com-
ponent of civil works and of equipment produced in Greece, estimated at 30
and 40 percent respectively.
27.       Although promotion of a few large industries is included among
NIBID's objectives, the proposed Bank loan will not in principle be utilized
for that purpose; instead, in line with the Bank's general policy of lending
to development finance companies, and in accordance with informal assurances
given by NIBID's management, the proceeds of the Bank loan will be spread
over a reasonable number of projects and individual sub-loans or investments
financed by the Bank will normally not exceed $3.0 million.
28.       Under the regime of regulated interest rates prevailing in Greece,
NIBID currently lends to its sub-borrowers at an interest rate of 10.5 per-
cent, plus a commission of 1 percent-p.a. The Government will continue to
bear the foreign exchange risk on the proposed loan, as it has done under pre-
vious Bank loans to NIBID, without payment of any fee by NIBID or its sub-
borrowers. The proposed loan will be for 12 years, including 2 years grace.
Repayment of the loan would be made according to a fixed amortization schedule,
following the practice of the last two Bank loans to NIBID, and approximating
the composite terms of that institution's sub-loans which are expected to
have a fairly narrow range of maturities. Under the 1973 Bank loan, the free
limit for NIBID was fixed at $700,000 and the aggregate free limit at $5 mil-
lion, i.e. one-third of the Bank loan amount. Given NIBID's proven competence
and refined economic appraisal techniques, the free limit under the proposed
loan, will be raised to $1 million, and the aggregate free limit will be
raised to $12.5 million.
Industrial Credit in Greece
29.       Established in 1963 by NBG and a number of foreign banks, NIBID has
served as an efficient channel for financing the development of Greek indus-
try. Despite considerable competition in investment banking, especially from
the state owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (which dominates three-
fourths of the investment banking field and which provided 20 percent of long-
term credit for industry in 1973), NIBID has consistently maintained a 20 per-
cent share of total long-term financing for industry during the past 4-5 years.
Remaining credit needs of industrial enterprises in Greece, are met by NBG,
a number of other commercial banks, and by the Investment Bank of Greece.
NIBID, Its Capital and Management Structure
30.       NIBID is a mature development finance company, with little need for
major institutional development. Its efforts to diversify its resource base
and to take an active role in the promotion of projects in less developed
regions of Greece merit further Bank support. Because of its institutional
strength, NIBID is also able to provide sound technical and managerial guid-
ance for the sub-projects it finances, and to ensure that its funds are put
in ventures which benefit the Greek economy significantly.

31.       NIBID's share capital totals Dr 450 million ($15 million).     Of this,
Dr 300 million is denominated in common voting stock, owned by NBG (55 per-
cent), 12 foreign banks (44 percent) and IFC (1 percent). IFC's original
shareholding of 7 percent was reduced in mid-1974, through sales to the said
12 foreign shareholders. The remaining capital of Dr 150 million is in the
form of preferred non-voting stock listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. It
is widely distributed among about 7,000 small private investors, with the
larger shareholders being the Credit Bank and the DELOS Mutual Fund. From
its establishment in 1963 to December 1974, NIBID had undertaken long-term
borrowings equivalent to about $253 million. Of this, BG had provided 33
percent, NBG 35 percent, the Bank 29 percent, and NIBID's foreign share-
holders 3 percent. The latter provided a loan of $2.2 million in 1972 and
helped NIBID to obtain a $5 million loan from a Belgian bank in 1974. The
Bank's loans to NIBID so far total $72.5 million: $12.5 million in 1968,
$20 million in 1970, $25 million in 1971 and $15 million in 1973. The first
three loans have been virtually fully disbursed, while the 1973 loan is almost
fully committed (except for about $1 million expected to be committed by mid-
1975), and is expected to be fully disbursed by mid-1976.
32.       NIBID is well managed and its staff of 103, including 62 profess-
ionals, is competent and experienced. Mr. George Gondicas, who has served
as Managing Director since the company was established continues in that
capacity. Since 1973, NIBID's Technical Department has increased its engi-
neering staff from three to five; in mid-1974 a new Economic Research Depart-
ment was established. Nevertheless, despite increases in staff over the past
few years, the rapid expansion of operations has resulted in some understaf-
fing, particularly in its six operations departments and the follow-up
department. NIBID is well aware of this situation and is making concerted
efforts to recruit additional staff.
33.       NIBID's Board is chaired by Professor A. Angelopoulos, who became
Governor of NBG in 1974, following the establishment of the civilian govern-
ment. The 20 member board, including a representative of IFC, meets once
a year, but has delegated authority to approve loans or investments to an
Executive Committee composed of seven Board members. This committee meets
twice a year and, in turn, has authorized a subcommittee of three members
resident in Athens to approve loans and investments up to Dr 60 million and
supplementary financing up to 30 percent. Should total exposure per company
exceed Dr 60 million, projects are circulated by mail to the full Executive
Committee for review. NIBID's management is authorized to approve all opera-
tions below Dr 25 million.
NIBID's Operations
34.       NIBID finances new and expansion projects in private industry based
on a technical, economic and financial review, and in addition provides man-
agerial and technical advice to its borrowers. Since the last Bank loan,
NIBID has been applying economic rate of return calculations for major proj-
ects. Under the proposed loan, NIBID will apply this technique to projects
exceeding the free limit of US$1 million and in addition on a sample basis to
projects financed from other sources as well.



- 11 -
35.       NIBID finances approximately 40 percent of the total cost of its
sub-projects. About 60 percent of the sub-projects which it financed during
the last two years, were under Dr 16 million (about $530,000). The average
size of each operation for the same period was about Dr 22 million (approxi-
mately $730,000). Between 1963 and the end of 1974, NIBID approved 502 loans
and equity investments amounting to Dr 9,178 million (about $306 million).
The average number of operations per year increased from over 70 for the
period 1970 through 1972 to over 80 for 1973 and 1974. Most of these opera-
tions have been in the form of loans, although equity investments have in-
creased and have reached almost 20 percent of total operations in the past
2 years. Most of the loans were made at the maximum rate of interest per-
missible by the Government, at present 10.5 percent. In addition to the 1
percent commission mentioned earlier, on certain loans, NIBID also receives
a profit-tied percentage of up to 1.5 percent, although a lower figure is
usually charged for competitive reasons. The decline in economic activity
resulted in increased arrears in 1974. Principal in arrears over three
months amounted to 1.7 percent of total loans outstanding (total principal
affected 11.4 percent). However, at the end of 1974 only 10 companies or
2.3 percent of NIBID's loan portfolio were in arrears by more than 12 months.
NIBID collects the maximum interest rate of 12.5 percent, including 1 percent
penalty on these loans. No losses are anticipated as loans are adequately
secured. In addition, NIBID has sufficient reserves against any possible
losses.
Financial Performance
36.       Due largely to increased dividend income from equity investments
and increased profits from sale of equity participations, NIBID's profits
have improved substantially in the past four years. Profits were 7 percent
of average net worth in 1968 to 1970, but increased to 16 - 17 percent in the
last three years. In 1974 NIBID's gross margin on total assets (including
earnings from equity investments) was 3.1 percent. The average spread on
lending, which was around 1.9 during the last two years, is expected to
stabilize at about 2.2 percent over the next few years. Operating expenses
are low and have been maintained at 0.7 percent of average total assets.
The loan portfolio is sound. The ratio of NIBID's term debt to equity as of
December 31, 1974, was 7.3:1 which compares with the maximum limit of 8:1
agreed with the Bank. Relative to its profits on lending, NIBID's equity
portfolio constitutes its most profitable activity, with 1974 earnings of
about Dr 41 million from dividends, Dr 31 million from realized capital
gains and Dr 16 million from stock dividends. NIBID declared dividends
between 5 to 6.6 percent from 1970 to 1973 and raised its dividend in 1974
to 7.7 percent. The book value of NIBID's preferred non-voting shares as of
December 31, 1974, was 183 percent of par value, its price/earning ratio was
15.5.
37.       This sound financial situation is expected to continue in the
coming five years (1975-79). The long-term debt is expected to grow from
about $240 million equivalent in 1975 to $433 million by 1979. The debt-
equity ratio will come close to 8:1 in 1975, but following the anticipated
increase in share capital in 1976, will decline to 5.5:1 in 1976 and remain



- 12 -
well below that limit thereafter. NIBID's debt service coverage ratio will
remain within a satisfactory range of between 1.4:1 in 1975 to 1.2:1 by 1979.
Net profits in absolute terms (excluding capital gains) are expected to show
a rising trend, and NIBID projects an increase in its dividend gradually from
around 8 percent in 1975 to about 10 percent by 1979, with the payment rates
fluctuating between 25 to 30 percent. On the basis of its envisaged dividend
policy, the book value of NIBID's shares should rise from about 200 percent
above par in 1975 to approximately 330 percent above par by 1979.
Economic Benefits
38.       NIBID financed sub-projects have contributed substantially to in-
creasing Greece's export potential. All in all, expected proceeds from exports
for all projects approved during the past two years total between Dr 3 and 4
billion ($100 million to $130 million), equivalent to about 40 percent of total
sales of these projects. NIBID's financing of agro-based industry has also
contributed to agricultural output, income and dispersion of industry. The
number of new jobs created by NIBID projects declined from an estimated 4,500
in 1973 to 3,000 for 1974. The average cost of $48,000 per job created is
rather high, reflecting the high capital intensity of a few major export-
oriented projects (such as chemicals and base metals) and the relatively low
level of unemployment. By computing the economic rate of return on major
projects, NIBID helps ensure an economic allocation of resources. NIBID's
smaller projects, on the other hand, tend to be more labor intensive.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and NIBID, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between The Hellenic State and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans for development finance com-
panies, except as indicated in the foregoing.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 711 - First Education Project; $13.8 million Loan of November 5, 1970;
Closin  Date:  December 31, 1975.
Civil works for construction of the project schools are proceeding
satisfactorily and most of thie schools should be completed by the end of 1975.
Bids for furniture and equipment have been called twice, as the first tenders
involved complex procedures which discouraged bidders. The second set of bids
has been evaluated. Despite these delays the project is expected to be com-
pleted witlhin about six months of the original schedule.
Loan 859 - Second Education Project:   $23.5 million Loan of October 2, 1972;
Closing Date: July 31, 1977.
Consultant architects for all thirty-three schools to be built under
the project have been appointed and space standards set, and preliminary de-
signs are undernay.   Bids on the first groupl of equipment and furniture con-
tracts for project schools are being evaluated. The Education Project Unit
is performing satisfactorily. The government has very recently requested the
deletion from the project of the extensions to the University of Patras, rep-
resenting 43 percent of total costs, and reallocation of the savings to other
project institutions, on which there have been considerable cost increases.
Loan No. 754 - Groundwater Development Project (Irrigation); US$25 million
Loan of June 21, 1971. Closing Date:    December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project began slowly due to delays in con-
tract awards, changes in designation of project areas prompted by the ongoing
consultants' study, and a protracted search for a satisfactory solution
(found in December 1973) to the question of farmers' contributions to the
capital cost of the project. Studies are now being made to find the most
efficient design of tertiary systems. Drilling operations are now proceed-
ing at a satisfactory rate, and the project is expected to be completed by
June 1978, about two years behind schedule.
Loan 991 - Nestos and Yannitsa Irrigation Project: $30.0 million loan of
June 3, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Because of recent political changes in Greece, not all of the con-
ditions of effectiveness of this loan have yet been fulfilled. The current
effectiveness date is June 30, 1975. Consultants to review the tertiary
