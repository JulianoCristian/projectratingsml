Program 
Development 
Objectives and 
Contribution to 
CAS 
The Program Development Objective is to support the GoR’s policy reforms on Teacher 
Development and Management, Textbooks, and Girls’ Education with the overall aim to 
improve the quality of basic education.  
The operation will support the GoR’s efforts to meet its objectives of poverty reduction 
and transitioning to an inclusive, productive, knowledge-based economy and society, 
consistent with the country’s fiscal framework and with the CAS. The operation’s DPO 
supports both CAS themes of promoting economic transformation and growth and of 
reducing social vulnerability. The CAS document explicitly identifies basic education, 
and the continued role of the Bank as administrator of the EFA FTI CF Grant, as a key 
example of an area in which the Bank has a comparative advantage and is able to help 
achieve clear policy and implementation outcomes. 
Risks and Risk 
Mitigation 
 
Rwanda’s internal security and political situation remains stable. However, instability in 
the region and particularly in eastern DRC presents an important risk. The Bank 
continues to support efforts aimed at fostering peace and security between Rwanda and 
its neighbors including through the ongoing Demobilization and Reintegration Program, 
Page  7
2
a
third phase which has been approved.  
The global economic slowdown began to affect Rwanda’s economy in early 2009, 
having adverse growth effects thereby posing a risk to GoR’s potential to reach its 
EDPRS objectives.  Economic growth is projected to decline from 11 percent in 2008 to 
just over 5 percent in 2009-10. To withstand the crisis, GoR aims to continue 
implementing prudent fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms.   
Particularly in the light of the recent global financial crisis and Rwanda’s heavy 
dependence on international assistance, the unpredictability of aid flows poses a 
significant risk which could hinder implementation of government policies. Increasing 
the proportion of international on-budget assistance, as well as allocating domestic and 
external financing towards the highest-priority activities as defined in the CPAF, 
contribute to mitigating this risk. The provision of a substantial share of financial support 
in support of the GoR Education Program through pooled sector budget support 
contributes to mitigating this risk in the education sector.
 
The GoR has committed to accelerating its implementation of reforms in the area of 
Public Financial Management (PFM). These reforms are advancing, and those areas that 
still need strengthening are being addressed through implementation of a comprehensive 
PFM strategy with support from the World Bank and other donors. A recently executed 
audit of the education sector revealed a number of weaknesses which are being addressed 
by
MINECOFIN and MINEDUC.
 
The small number of staff in MINEDUC and the weak capacity at lower administrative 
and school levels poses risks for the successful implementation of the government’s 
program. A restructuring process is ongoing that is expected to address these constraints. 
This operation aims to mitigate these risks by supporting the government in the 
development and implementation of reforms that take into account current capacity and 
by
helping to build capacity at, particularly, the central level.  
GoR faces the challenge to pursue its objectives for both basic and post-basic education 
while facing capacity and financial constraints. With the support of partners, including 
the Bank, MINEDUC is developing a costed Post-Basic Education strategy to support 
the inclusion of a well-balanced resource allocation across education sub-sectors in its 
revised Long Term Strategic and Financing Framework.

PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR AN  
EDUCATION FOR ALL 
–
FAST TRACK INITIATIVE DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT 
TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The 1994 conflict left the Rwanda education system infrastructure devastated and the 
teacher force decimated.
 The initial focus of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) in the area of 
basic education has been on increasing access to primary education.
1
These efforts have been 
largely successful. Over the last decade, gross and net enrollment rates increased from 88 to 
128 percent and 70 to 94 percent, respectively, with the share of girls comprising slightly more 
than half of the primary school level student population. The Government is now turning its 
focus on both increasing access to basic education (including lower secondary education, or 
tronc commun
)
and improving the quality of education.  
2. 
Government efforts to improve the quality of basic education aim to increase completion 
rates and reduce both repetition and drop-out rates
,
both of which are significantly lower 
than those benchmarked in the Education For All 
–
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Indicative 
Framework.
 
2
The primary completion rate, at 53 percent in 2008, is low. Repetition rates are 
around 18 percent and drop-out rates at 14 percent in primary education (2007). Transition 
rates from primary to 
tronc commun
 are about 62 percent and 55 percent for boys and girls, 
respectively (2006 data). While 48 percent of pupils participating in the exam at the end of the 
tronc commun
 are girls, they constitute only 34 percent of those who pass the exam 
successfully. The pupil to teacher ratio was 65:1 in 2008 (down from 74:1 in 2007), and the 
distribution and range of suitable textbooks and other learning materials remain variable. The 
GoR faces constrained financial resources and administrative capacity, as well as the challenge 
to manage the implementation of the Government’s decentralization strategy without distorting 
the implementation of the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP). 
3. 
The EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (CF) is a multi-donor trust fund that supports countries 
worldwide to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for education. The Government 
of Rwanda received a total of US$70 million from the EFA-FTI CF in 2007 and 2008. 
As 
of December 2008, the full amount of this grant has been disbursed: US$26 million in 2007 
and US$44 million in 2008. The CF grant equaled 23 percent of the GoR’s budgetary 
expenditures for basic-education, and was used to fund primary and lower secondary school 
Capitation Grants, basic education textbooks, the construction and rehabilitation of basic 
education classrooms and other school buildings, and teacher training. For instance, in 2008, 
the teacher-pupil ratio was significantly reduced through capitation grants by enabling schools 
to contract nearly 2,000 additional teachers, nearly 7.2 million textbooks were procured for 
primary schools, and 2,315 classrooms for basic education were constructed. 
1
Basic education in Rwanda consists of six years of primary education and three years of lower secondary, or 
tronc 
commun
.
Early childhood education is also encouraged but is not universally implemented on a national level. At 
present there are 2,370 primary schools and 643 secondary schools, of which 238 are private schools. There are 11 
teacher training colleges for primary teachers and two colleges of education for 
tronc commun
 teachers. Fee-free 
primary education was introduced in 2005, while fee-free basic education was introduced in 2007 in an attempt to 
ensure universal nine-year basic education.
 
2
The Education For All 
–
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Indicative Framework provides benchmarking guidelines for 
the development or revision of a Government’s education sector plan. The benchmark “average for some successful 
countries” at the primary level is as follows: 100 percent completion rate (male and female), 10 percent or less 
repetition rate, and 40:1 teacher-pupil ratio.   
Page  9
4
4. 
The 2007-08 CF Grant was designed within a sector-wide approach and a financing 
mechanism that transfers the CF grants to a Designated Account for the financing of the 
Government’s Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP). 
The Designated Account is a 
pooled fund providing budget support to the education sector. In addition to the EFA-FTI CF 
Grant, sector budget support was provided by the United Kingdom’s Department for 
International Development (DFID), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). While most of these 
development partners are likely to continue providing at least part of their financial assistance 
to the education sector through this Designated Account, this operation will provide funding 
through general budget support.
3
5. 
The EFA-FTI CF Grant assigns an important coordinating and monitoring role to the in-
country education sector development partner group, which in Rwanda is coordinated by 
DFID. Over the past two years, the Bank has been the Supervising Entity of the CF 
Grant.
 DFID and the World Bank have worked intensively and closely with the Government 
and other development partners to ensure the smooth and well-coordinated implementation of 
the grant agreement that has been put in place between the Bank and the GoR.  
6. 
The GoR has expressed interest in continuing to receive CF funding in 2009 and beyond 
to help fill the financing gap for its Nine Year Basic Education Program, after taking into 
account available resources from domestic and external sources. 
The Government applied 
for a one-year Bridge Grant from the EFA-FTI CF Steering Committee for 2009/2010, 
providing resources for what is considered to be the last year of a three-year program (2007-
2009).
4
The allocation of funding by the Steering Committee depends, in addition to the 
strength of GoR’s program, on the availability of sufficient funding to basic education from 
both domestic resources and other external sources. As invited by the EFA-FTI CF Steering 
Committee, Rwanda intends to apply in 2010 for a new three-year Second Grant for the period 
2010-2012. Receiving the Bridge Grant in 2009 will allow the GoR sufficient time to revise 
and update its Long Term Strategic and Financing Framework (LTSFF) and ESSP, which 
would provide a basis for the three-year Second Grant, and seek the endorsement of these 
documents from the development partners before submitting the application for the three-year 
Second Grant to the EFA-FTI CF Steering Committee. 
7. 
In response to a request from the GoR and Donor Partners, the Bank will remain the 
Supervising Entity of the EFA-FTI CF Bridge Grant for 2009. 
As a consequence, in 
addition to the documents that are required by the CF Steering Committee, the application 
package includes the current Program Document and a draft Grant Agreement between the 
GoR and the Bank. The EFA-FTI CF Steering Committee approved Rwanda’s application for 
a
Bridge Grant of US$35 million in April 2009.

CONTEXT 
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN RWANDA

Effective July 1, 2008, Recipient-Executed Trust Funds are administered under the operational policies and procedures 
that apply to Bank lending.

In this document, the terms ‘Development Policy Grant’ and ‘Bridge Grant’ are both used to describe this operation. 
The term ‘Bridge Grant’ is EFA-FTI CF terminology, describing that the operation concerns a one-year bridge grant 
between receiving the previous, two-year EFA-FTI CF grant in 2007-2008 and Rwanda’s expected application for a 
new three-year funding round for the period 2010-2012. The term ‘Development Policy Grant’ is used by the Bank to 
reflect that this concerns a budget support operation. 
Page  10

8. 
Economic growth between 2001 and 2008 has been strong, averaging 6.8 percent 
annually and peaking at 11.2 percent in 2008.
 While the services and industrial sectors 
contributed to growth, a strong recovery in agriculture in 2008 helped improve average growth 
performance significantly over the period.  Agriculture grew by about 15 percent in 2008 
largely due to crop intensification and crop disease prevention. The expansion was also partly 
attributable to an increase in roots and tubers, bananas, and to a lesser degree maize, which are 
mainly cultivated for domestic consumption and are little affected by external market 
conditions. Sustaining agricultural production will help Rwanda in efforts towards attainment 
of EDPRS
5
targets on growth and poverty reduction. Increased agriculture production will also 
help in managing inflation given that inflation averaged 15 percent in 2008 and rose to 22 
percent by the end of the year due mainly to high food and fuel prices.
 
9. 
Growth is anticipated to decline from its peak of 11.2 percent in 2008 to just over 5 
percent in 2009-10
.
Contributing to slower growth are expected declines in activity in the 
services and industrial sectors, particularly tourism and construction, as the global economy 
slows.  The agriculture sector, on the other hand, is expected to continue to perform strongly in 
2009, helping to mitigate adverse growth effects from the weakening external environment.  
With increasing activity expected in the food sub-sector, along with productivity 
improvements, agricultural output could rise by 10 percent in 2009. As Rwanda is vulnerable 
to climatic shocks and increases in global fertilizer prices, the country remains susceptible to 
the possibility of food shortages. GoR will therefore continue to implement its crop 
intensification program which is focused on providing improved inputs and training to farmers, 
particularly for food crops.  A few factors could lead to slower growth than projected. In 
particular, some large scale investments in energy and agriculture that are expected to be 
funded from external borrowing could be delayed should the global recession persist, and 
external resources become scarce.  
 
10. 
Fiscal policy would strive to support economic growth and poverty reduction efforts 
without compromising inflation objectives
.
Past fiscal expansion was driven by economic 
growth and improvements in domestic revenues, as well as increased international aid flows
.
Economic growth, improvement in regular revenue collection and one-off receipts boosted 
revenues from 13.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 15.6 percent in 2008. Revenues are projected to 
fall to about 13 percent of GDP in the 2009/10 fiscal year, and then to rebound steadily in 
subsequent years reflecting both economic recovery and further increases in tax collection 
efficiency. Grants are envisaged to remain high at about 11 percent of GDP in 2009/10. These 
cautious projections only take into account already existing donor commitments.  Since most 
donors are unable to make commitments beyond a 12-18 month period, current projections 
anticipate a reduction in grants of between 7 and 8 percent of GDP in 2011/12. However, as 
donors make firm commitments in the next 18 months, the share of grants as a percentage of 
GDP in 2011/12 is expected to increase. In the event that donor commitments remain low, the 
macroeconomic framework will be revised accordingly to avoid a financing gap for the fiscal 
years 2010/11 and 2011/12. The domestic fiscal deficit
6
was about 5.3 percent of GDP in both 
2007 and 2008, and is projected to expand to an average of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2009/10, 
with the aim of supporting growth while maintaining inflation in the single digits. The increase 
in the fiscal deficit will be financed by draw-downs on government deposits in the central bank 
accumulated through the savings from one-off revenues in previous years. Government 
5
The EDPRS is Rwand
a’s current PRSP and provides the medium-term framework for achieving the country’s long-
term development aspirations.  The strategy focuses strongly on growth.  Among its key targets are: (i) growth of about 
8
percent annually; and (ii) reduction in poverty to 46 percent. 
6
Excluding demobilization and peacekeeping spending. 
Page  11
6
investments in infrastructure will remain high in 2009/10, contributing to poverty-reduction 
efforts and providing much-needed stimulus to economy.
 
11. 
Fiscal projections for both the calendar year 2009 and fiscal year 2009/10 envisage no 
financing gap, even though there are risks that the impact of economic slowdown on the 
fiscal revenues turns out stronger than expected. 
Rwanda’s acceptance of the East African 
Community (EAC) common external tariff (CET), elimination of tax on large tracks and some 
other taxes could lead to revenue losses of up to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2009/10.  However, the 
losses from adopting the CET could be partially covered using the European Union (EU) 
facility that compensates countries for revenue losses arising from membership in regional 
trade arrangements, and remaining permanent losses from adopting CET and tax elimination 
would be largely offset by additional revenue measures contemplated by the government. 
These measures include raising fuel price levy earmarked for road maintenance, gradually 
eliminating the implicit subsidy applied to the petroleum products, and increasing taxes on cell 
phone air time.  Should revenue losses turn out to be greater than anticipated, the Bank could 
explore the possibility of bringing forward some IDA resources.  Government will also strive 
to raise grants from additional sources.  
12. 
The balance of payments projections envisage an increase in the current account deficit 
in 2009 and beyond, which would require using the international reserves accumulated in 
previous years.
 Reflecting falling world prices and shrinking demand, Rwandan export 
receipts declined sharply from early 2009. The decline in imports did not match the reduction 
in exports, leading to an expanding current account deficit leading to pressure on the official 
international reserves. As a result, the reserve coverage of imports is projected to decline from 
more than 5 months at end-2008 to about 4 months in 2012. 
13. 
Inflation is projected to return to single digits in the second half of 2009.
 Inflation is 
projected at around 11.5 percent, on an annual average basis, in 2009 and is expected to 
gradually decline to between 5 and 6 percent over the medium term, after the impact of 
international fuel and food prices has passed through.  Achievement of these objectives and 
targets also hinges on the continuation of prudent macroeconomic policies.  Table 1
 
provides 
the most recent projections of macroeconomic indicators.

The approaches to addressing a potential tightening of fiscal space will help maintain 
the overall budget envelope and ensure priority and poverty reducing areas are protected 
in the budget
.
Due to improved revenues from domestic sources and international grants, the 
GoR increased its expenditure and net lending in 2008 to nearly 27 percent of GDP. Spending 
will remain at about this level in the 2009/10 fiscal year. In 2008, capital spending was 
equivalent to 11 percent of GDP, while current spending amounted to about 15 percent of 
GDP. Projections for 2010-12 envisage keeping current expenditures at the same level of about 
15 percent of GDP, while capital expenditures are projected to conservatively decline to about 
10 percent of GDP in 2011/12.   
15. 
Monetary management remains a challenge amid slowing economic activity and 
limited choice of instruments for monetary policy.
 
The National Bank of Rwanda carried 
out liquidity injections in the face of liquidity constraints in the first quarter of 2009. Looking 
forward, the main challenge would be to support the growth of the banking sector and credit to 
the economy without compromising the medium-term inflation objectives. Should the balance 
of payments deteriorate more than currently envisaged, greater exchange rate flexibility may 
be needed to prevent the loss of foreign exchange reserves. 
16. 
Rwanda is highly aid dependent although debt relief and grants have maintained 
external debt at a sustainable level.
 
International grants and loans represent about half of 
total GoR revenue.  On-budget aid flows, including budget support, have substantially 
Page  13
8
increased in recent years.  Debt relief following the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt had 
reduced Rwanda’s external debt in 2008 to around 15 percent of GDP, which was a significant 
reduction from earlier years when debt was over 60 percent of GDP.  Rwanda’s export base 
(goods and services) is still small, which limits the country’s capacity to carry external debt.
7
The debt service reduction and trends in grants facilitated continuation of spending in key 
programs to support growth such as investments to improve agricultural productivity. The 
external current account deficit (including grants) is projected to increase to between 8 and 10 
percent of GDP over the medium term, and is to be financed largely by international donor 
flows and FDI to help keep reserves at adequate levels.  
7
It is important to note that in early 2009, the authorities adopted a revised methodology for estimating travel receipts 
that has led to an upward revision of tourism and business travel receipts in the balance of payment statistics and to a 
significant improvement in the debt sustainability analysis (DSA).

Box 1:  Likely Impact of the Global Economic Crisis in Rwanda, 2008-2010 
 
Rwanda’s economy began to experience the impact of the global economic crisis in early 2009
 when exports declined 
sharply with falling international commodity prices and external demand, and economic activity slowed particularly in the 
construction, mining and tourism sectors.  A continued global slowdown would negatively affect GDP growth through the 
impact on grants, foreign investment, remittances and the financial sector.  There would need to be a downward revision on 
spending as revenue declines, particularly if foreign aid becomes scarce.  Export receipts would also be negatively affected 
leading to a widening of the current account deficit.  Also, health and education outcomes are particularly susceptible to 
household economic conditions.  Financing of services could be adversely affected due to lower revenues, reduced household 
ability to pay user fees, and any potential reductions in grants. 
A
continued global slowdown would lead to an average annual projected growth of just over  5 percent (compared to 
11.2 percent for 2008), over the medium term
.
The lower growth trend would arise from lower tourism receipts, reduction 
in remittances and a slowdown in the construction sector.  Mineral exports would also be affected, as China and India (both 
destinations for mineral exports) cut back on production and imports.  Lower demand for Rwanda’s key exports, tea and 
coffee, could also affect export receipts and growth in agriculture.  Over the medium term, improved agricultural productivity 
–especially for food crops—in line with the Crop Intensification Program and the LWH Program could help mitigate adverse 
effects on agricultural and broader growth.     
Reflecting the sharp deterioration in the external environment, exports of goods and services are expected to decrease 
by over 30 percent in dollars terms in 2009/10 compared to 2008
.
This decline will be partially offset by a reduction of 
approximately 7 percent in imports.  Despite frontloading of foreign assistance, the current account deficit (including official 
transfers) is expected to deteriorate slightly from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 6.6 percent of GDP at end 2009.  
Foreign direct investment and other capital inflows are also expected to fall resulting in a deterioration of the overall balance 
of payments .This deficit will be funded with a draw-down of reserves. From 2010 exports are expected to recover as the 
global environment improves. However the current external shock could have a lasting impact on the reserve coverage of the 
country which could stabilize at about 4 months of imports over the medium term down from about 5.3 months at end 2008.
 
The fiscal program in 2008 remained broadly on track despite increased expenditures for the purchase of seed, 
fertilizer, and food storage
 (largely financed by grants from IDA and AfDB, and the road maintenance fund). Revenues 
outperformed their targets reflecting an increase in collections from income and consumption taxes, high inflation and GDP 
growth.  Although it is too early to get a good assessment of the overall and concrete impacts of the global financial crisis, the 
authorities are taking proactive measures to mitigate any possible negative impacts.  In its mini-budget for January to June 
2009, fiscal policy is aiming at: i) limiting contingent spending; and ii) saving higher-than-programmed revenues for future 
use.  The budget deficit is expected to remain on track for 2009 due partly to these measures. 
In terms of the financial sector, all 8 commercial banks have been in compliance with the minimum capital 
requirements of RwFr 5 billion (approx. $9.2 million); foreign exchange exposure ratios reported have been within the 
prudential BNR benchmarks; and the quality of the credit portfolio has improved
.
As of end June 2008, gross non-
performing loans (NPLs) reached RwFr 32.2 billion against RwFr 40.1 billion in December 2007 and the average ratio of 
NPLs to total loans declined to 12 percent from 18.5 percent in 2007.  Although to date there is yet no impact of the crisis on 
the level of capitalization of banks and NPLs, slower growth could result in rising credit risks 
and heighten the tight liquidity 
situation,
 
increasing the vulnerability of the banking sector. 
To manage the pressure of high resource inflows on inflation, the Central Bank has instituted measures to increase the 
flexibility of the exchange rate enabling more effective sterilization of liquidity
 (which is the Central Bank’s primary 
instrument for monetary policy).  In 2008, the real exchange rate appreciated by 22 percent following the rise in the US 
dollar—to which the Rwandan franc is closely tied—against other currencies.  It has been exacerbated by the high rate of 
domestic inflation (estimated at 22 percent in December 2008).  The result has been a rising demand for foreign exchange and 
imports.  This acceleration in imports relative to exports is a concern for the authorities even as world commodity prices 
continue to fall.  Despite higher sales of foreign currency by the authorities, foreign exchange reserves exceeded programmed 
levels due to higher than expected external budget support disbursements. The one-time TIGO license fee of US$60 million 
also contributed to an increase in foreign reserves.  As a result, the actual level of international reserves was $580.7 million at 
end September 2008, and is estimated to have increased to $596 million by end-2008.  Increasing the flexibility of the nominal 
exchange rate would help maintain external competitiveness and keep the current account at a sustainable level.  The pace of 
real appreciation has slowed in recent months, to about 15 percent currently.

ADEQUACY OF THE MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK 
 
17. 
The medium term macroeconomic framework is adequate for the purposes of the 
proposed operation and the program supported by the IMF is on-track.
 Medium-term 
policies aim at maintaining macroeconomic stability and sustaining debt at prudent levels. 
Consistent with these policy objectives, the central bank is committed to containing price 
pressures arising from fiscal expansion and scaled-up external assistance. Inflation is expected 
to be reduced to single-digits in the second half of 2009.  Fiscal policy has been prudent and 
well managed, and along with monetary policy, is expected to be implemented cautiously over 
the medium-term to achieve overall macroeconomic objectives, including easing inflation and 
possible balance of payments pressures without stifling economic growth.  In line with 
agreements reached with the IMF, the government is following policies to ensure that the 
external debt burden will remain sustainable.  External debts are limited to loans with 
minimum of 50 percent grant element and volumes are being kept consistent with debt 
sustainability analysis. A comprehensive debt management strategy has been developed which 
sets limits for loans and loan guarantees. The Bank is providing technical support in the 
implementation of the strategy. Improvements continue to be made in the financial sector with 
all financial indicators remaining within their prudential benchmarks recently. A few concerns 
relating to liquidity ratios are being addressed through IMF technical assistance to the central 
bank. Foreign exchange reserves would continue to accumulate over the medium-term, albeit 
more slowly than in recent years; reserves amounted to the equivalent of more than 5 months 
of imports at end-2008. Rwanda continues to perform well under its program with the IMF, a 
demonstration of the government’s commitment to continue to pursue prudent macroeconomic 
policies, and implement much needed structural reforms.
 
18. 
In August 2009, the IMF completed the sixth review under its three-year Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved in June 2006
.
Rwanda’s program 
performance through March 2009 was deemed broadly satisfactory. All quantitative end-
December 2008 performance criteria for the sixth review were met. However, largely due to 
external and domestic shocks in early 2009 (international commodity prices fell, external 
demand weakened, and the conflict in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo escalated), 
several indicative targets for end-March were missed. The IMF noted that the Government’s 
policy response to the shocks was broadly appropriate. Fiscal performance in 2008 was better 
than envisaged under the program, but delayed donor disbursements and external shocks 
created challenges to budget execution in early 2009.
 The macroeconomic program for the 
2009/10 fiscal year is designed to cushion the impact of the global economic crisis, 
while preserving medium-term fiscal and external sustainability. While growth is 
projected to reach about 6 percent on average over the medium term, from a little over 
5
percent during 2009-10, significant downside risks arise from the uncertain path of 
recovery in the world economy. Additional policy adjustments may be required should 
the world economic crisis or its impact on Rwanda worsen beyond current 
expectations.  Liquidity shortages or solvency problems in the banking system may 
also warrant some additional policy adjustments.
 
19. 
The sixth review of the PRGF also highlights the GoR’s continued commitment to 
implementing structural reforms
.
In the period ahead, focus will be on further reforms in the 
areas of public financial management, tax administration, financial sector development and 
improvement in the business environment.

THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 
 
20. 
The 2008-12 Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 
emphasizes economic growth and poverty alleviation, continuing to build on 
achievements in human development and basic social services, with an emphasis on 
decentralization and a greater role for the private sector.
 
The EDPRS is the country’s 
second PRSP and emphasizes accelerating progress towards the MDGs, including improving 
education outcomes and gender equality (MDGs 2 and 3).  The EDPRS encompasses three 
flagship programs: i) Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports, ii) Governance, including 
expanding decentralization and enhancing accountability; and iii) the Vision 2020 
Umurenge
 
Program (VUP), designed to alleviate rural poverty and improve productivity.  
21. 
With active support from the Bank, the development of the EDPRS has involved 
extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.
 The process was led by a National 
Steering Committee providing high level guidance, supported by a Technical Steering 
Committee made up of central and decentralized government representatives as well as 
representatives of civil society, the private sector, and development partners. Sector-specific 
and selected cross-cutting issues were discussed by the nineteen sector working groups and 
cross-cutting issues teams, which were chaired by a government representative, co-chaired by 
a
development partner, and included representatives of government, partners, the private sector 
and civil society. 
22. 
The GoR’s medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) to implement the EDPRS 
during the period 2008-12
,
including information on 2007 budget allocations, is presented in 
Table 2.  The annual budget allocation to education grew from US$179 million in 2007 to 
US$190 million in 2008 (an increase of 6 percent), and is expected to increase further to an 
average annual allocation of US$260 million during the period 2009-12.
8
23. 
Rwanda’s objectives for education are reflected in the EDPRS, the Growth Flagship, 
and Vision 2020 and support Rwanda’s overall goal to transition to an inclusive, 
productive and knowledge-based economy.
 To achieve these objectives it is essential to 
improve equitable access to quality education which should be increasingly relevant for 
making social and economic progress. This is projected to be achieved by the establishment of 
a
curriculum that imparts basic skills in traditional subjects, while also promoting social 
cohesion and making closer links between the content of education and the needs of the labour 
market. As per the EDPRS, the priority areas for the education sector in Rwanda are to 
increase the coverage and quality of nine year basic education, strengthen Technical and 
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and improve the quality of higher education.

EDUCTION SECTOR STRATEGY AND PROGRAM 
 
24. 
The education sector’s financing framework and strategy are described in the Long 
Term Strategy and Financing Framework 2006-2015 (LTSFF) and further elaborated in 
the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2006-2010 (ESSP).
 With the main goal of providing a 
foundation for increased and equitable access to education for all children, the ESSP provides 
the overarching framework for a sector-wide approach to the development and delivery of 
education services in Rwanda. The purpose is to assist the poverty reduction process by 
enhancing Rwanda’s human resources through the development of a learning society and 
provision of knowledge and skills.  The ESSP sets out objectives, policies, priorities, 
strategies, key activities and indicative targets. It is updated on a rolling basis and has been 
revised to ensure consistency with the 2008-2012 EDPRS. Both the ESSP and the sector’s 
MTEF are guided by the LTSFF. The Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) aims to develop an 
updated version of the LTSFF by the end of FY09. Both the ESSP and the LTSFF were 
endorsed by the education sector development partners in Rwanda in 2006, prior to the 
approval of the first EFA FTI CF Grant (2007-08). 
25. 
The Nine Year Basic Education Policy, adopted by Cabinet in February 2006, 
translates the objectives from the LTSFF and ESPP into more detailed and elaborate 
indicators, targets, and associated strategies for basic education.
 Implementation of the 
policy is expected to result in universal primary education both in terms of enrolment and 
completion, and a rapid increase in enrollment in 
tronc commun
 (lower secondary). In the 
implementation of the program, particular focus and resources have been directed to capitation 
grants, classroom construction, textbooks, and training. A portion of the increased amount of 
the capitation grant (from Rwandese Franc (RwFr) 2,500 per child in 2006 to about RwFr 
7,000 per child in 2008) enables primary schools to provide teachers with additional monthly 
allowances. The provision of capitation grants enabled schools to contract 1,968 teachers in 
2008, which contributed to significantly reducing the teacher-pupil ratio. GoR increased its 
targets for classroom construction from 1,500 primary and 
tronc commun
 classrooms in 2005 
to 2,500 in 2007. In 2008, more than 2,300 primary classrooms were built. Yet, due to the 
increase of new students enrolled (332,000, or 18 percent more in 2008 than in 2005), pupil to 
Page  18
13 
classroom ratio increased from 62:1 to 71:1 between 2005 and 2008. The number of textbooks 
procured for primary schools in 2008 has reached nearly 7.2 million books. Finally, 
MINEDUC provided training for district education officers in teacher management, as well as 
for pre-school and primary school classroom and head teachers in topics such as language of 
instruction, school management, and special needs education.  
26. 
Rwanda’s consistent focus on reaching the education MDGs has contributed to positive 
outcomes in primary and secondary education in the past years (see Table 3 above).
 Both 
gross and net enrollment in primary education continues to increase, reaching 128 percent and 
94 percent, respectively, in 2008. Although completion rates are on the rise (53 percent in 2008 
compared with 47 percent in 2005), they need to increase faster to keep Rwanda on track to 
reach 100 percent completion rate by 2015, as per the MDGs targets. While the increase in 
student enrollment has put pressure on the system, the pupil-teacher ratio improved in 2008 
compared with 2005, while the share of qualified teachers grew from 94 percent to 97 percent 
during the same time period. 
27. 
There is equal gender access to primary education and, although gender equality in 
access to secondary education is improving, significant gaps persists in terms of 
performance, particularly in the later years of basic education. 
There are slightly more 
girls enrolled than boys in primary education and the gender gap in transition rates to 
tronc 
commun
 decreased from 7 percentage points in 2005 to 3.9 percentage points in 2007. 
However, substantial gender disparities persist in the later years of basic education, as 
demonstrated by the share of girls among those pupils who successfully complete the 
examination at the end of 
tronc commun
,
which has hovered around one-third during the past 
years.

28. 
As access to primary education grew, GoR has increasingly focused on improving the 
quality of basic education and on increasing the transition from primary school to 
tronc 
commun
.
The need for this shift of focus, while not losing sight of improving and maintaining 
access to primary education, was acknowledged and supported by development partners during 
the Joint Review of the Education Sector (JRES) held in June 2008. Since then, the Cabinet 
adopted three strategies to accelerate the implementation of the Nine-Year Basic Education 
program with the combined aim of strengthening access and quality: (i) double shift schooling 
at the primary level, (ii) reduction of core subjects, and (iii) subject-based teaching 
specialization. For the 2009 school year, the GoR implemented double shifting for all primary 
schools.
9
The initiative is expected to expand access to primary education while limiting the 
burden on the existing supply of teachers. The reduction of core subjects
—from 9 to 4 subjects 
for Grades 1-3 and from 12 to 6 for Grades 4-6—is expected to offset the potential negative 
effect on quality of reducing class time available for pupils within the double shift schedule. 
Finally, each teacher is expected to teach a maximum of two subjects out of the reduced 
number of core subjects. The subject-based teaching specialization has resulted in teachers 
rotating from subject class to subject class while the students remain in one classroom. Since 
the three strategies have only recently been introduced, close monitoring of the impact on the 
ground is needed. 
29. 
An innovative Capacity Building Fund has been established to support the effective 
implementation of the dual goal of quickly expanding access and improving quality of 
education through managed growth. 
Institutional and human resource capacity is critical to 
ensure that expanded access does not compromise education quality in the classroom. An 
innovative Capacity Building Fund has been established, which pools funds provided by 
DFID, UNICEF and CIDA. MINEDUC has developed a rolling two year Institutional 
Development and Change Management plan targeting key priorities that will be financed 
through this fund over the next three years. 
 
Financing of the Education sector  
30. 
Total public expenditure on education as a share of GNP was 3.8 percent in 2006, 
which lags behind
 
the Sub-Saharan Africa medium of 4.4 percent and the global medium 
of 4.9 percent. 
Although the government has restricted the relative growth of the higher 
education budget allocation since 2003, the portion of tertiary education has remained around 
30 percent since 2003 and is higher than all other countries listed in the below table
10
.
In 
primary and secondary education expenditures, the country lags behind its neighbors but the 
discrepancy is particularly noticeable at the secondary level. Table 4 below compares 
education spending as a share of GDP in selected neighboring countries.

additional 6% will be allocated to TVET, which will benefit all post-primary levels.

31. 
The recurrent budget for education, expressed in real terms, has increased. This is 
particularly the case for expenditures on primary and secondary education.
11
 
As figure 1 
below illustrates, real recurrent expenditures on both primary and secondary education in 2006 
were approximately 40 percent higher than they were in 2003. Tertiary education recurrent 
expenditures increased by a moderate 7.5 percent in this period. The rise in overall recurrent 
expenditures for the education sector is the result of an increase of spending on both salaries 
and on goods and services, with an increasing share of the recurrent budget being allocated to 
goods and services. In 2007 for instance, 43 percent of recurrent expenditures were allocated to 
goods and services, compared to only 19 percent in 2004. In the same period, the share of 
recurrent expenditures allocated to salaries fell from 68 percent to 48 percent. These figures 
are somewhat misleading, however, as the salary top-ups for teachers, which are funded 
through the capitation grants, are not included in the ‘salaries’ expenditure category. The 
update of the Country Status Report for the Education Sector (CSR), which will be finalized in 
FY10, is expected to shed more light on recurrent expenditure trends and their underlying 
causes.

Education PER Report, July 2007. 
 
32. 
Rwanda made substantial achievements in the planning and decentralization of 
expenditures for the education sector. 
The move toward a results-oriented budget and MTEF 
has been accompanied by reforms in the education sector. Important actions were taken, 
including the development of an Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) aligned to the results-
oriented sector MTEF, the initiation of capitation grants for primary schools, and provision of 
grants to promote access for the most vulnerable segments of the population.  Capitation grants 
were transferred from the central government to primary schools to cover the loss in fee 
income from the introduction of the Government’s policy of fee-free primary education. Fee-
free basic education was introduced in 2007 and capitation grants are also provided to 
tronc 
commun
 classes, supporting 9 years of basic education provision. 
33. 
Decentralized budgets for districts include funding for salaries to teachers, capitation 
grants, and school feeding.
 
Since 2008, capitation grants for primary schools are divided in 
two distinct components: learning support and teacher support. For example, the capitation 
grants provide bonuses of 12,500 RwFr per teacher/month, 3,500 RwFr
 
per pupil/month and an 
11

additional supplement for hiring contract teachers to improve teacher-student ratios and reduce 
the burden of double shifts for teachers. 
 
34. 
Rwanda’s government resources for education represent a mix of both external and 
domestic funds, which supports one comprehensive education plan. A well-established 
coordination mechanism is in place overseen by DFID on the development partners’ side
.
In 2006, several partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with GoR to provide 
sector budget support (SBS) for implementation of the ESSP through government systems. 
The current SBS donors include DFID, AfDB, the, Netherlands, Belgium, and Canadian 
CIDA. A significant step to improve donor coordination and proper and timely funding for the 
sector is Rwanda’s acceptance into the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) to 
help the sector meet its MDG.  The US$70 million that the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund Steering 
Committee granted in 2007 and 2008 provided a substantial contribution to MINEDUC for the 
implementation of the basic-education aspects of its ESSP and LTSFF. The first EFA-FTI CF 
Grant has had a very positive effect on access to free primary education (and now free nine-
year basic education) by assisting in the provision of capitation grants to schools, classroom 
construction, teacher education, and textbooks.  
35. 
The GoR now faces the challenge of improving the quality of basic education
,
which 
requires several reforms, such as better qualified and equitably deployed teaching staff, 
increased access to appropriate learning equipment, an improved learning environment for 
girls, monitoring of learning achievement, and a more focused core curriculum Such reforms 
are critical both for achieving the Government’s objective of universal completion of primary 
education (e.g., repetition and dropout rates remain quite high, completion rates low) and later 
universalizing the nine-grade basic education cycle. 
 
IV. 
BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY 
 
CHOICE OF INSTRUMENT 
 
36. 
A
stand-alone Development Policy Operation (DPO) was chosen over an investment 
operation for the following reasons. First, a DPO provides a vehicle for effective support 
for the Government’s Nine Year Basic Education program
 by allowing consultations 
between the government and development partners to focus on the needed policy and 
institutional reforms better than an investment operation would.. This operation provides 
resources for what is considered to be the last year of a three-year program (2007-2009) that is 
funded by the EFA-FTI CF.  In 2007 and 2008, when the Government received EFA-FTI CF 
resources, well-coordinated stakeholder consultations focused on the implementation of the 
key aspects of the LTSFF and ESSP, rather than on specific activities that are supported by 
various donors. This is considered to be a key factor that contributed to the successful results 
of the joint education sector reviews in the past years.  
37. 
Second, a DPO is a step forward in the implementation of the Paris Declaration 
commitments
.
The US$70 million in EFA FTI CF funding that was allocated to Rwanda for 
2007 and 2008 was deposited into a designated pooled account for the financing of the 
Page  22
17 
implementation of the program of the Ministry of Education.
1
2
Both the GoR and development 
partners have considered this to have been an effective mechanism to aid the Ministry of 
Education, and a substantial share of assistance to the education sector continues to be 
provided through the designated account. Due to revised Operational Policy 14.40, the EFA 
FTI CF Grant can no longer be disbursed through this mechanism if the Bank continues to be 
the trust fund’s supervising entity. As a consequence, the operation must be either a DPO or a 
SIL. The GoR, local development partners, and the Bank have expressed a strong preference 
for general budget support over investment operations in Rwanda. Stakeholders have indicated 
that disbursing EFA FTI CF funds through an investment operation would be considered as a 
step backwards vis-à-vis Paris Declaration commitments. Many of the other development 
partners provide the bulk of their financing through sector budget support.  
38. 
Finally, inclusion of EFA FTI CF funds into either the Fifth Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Grant (PRSG V) or the First Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG-I), 
was rejected 
principally because the availability of EFA FTI CF funds will remain uncertain 
until the EFA FTI CF Steering Committee decides whether to approve Rwanda’s current 
application at the end of April 2009. It was deemed unacceptable by the Country Management 
Unit to delay the development of the PRSG V or CLSG-I to allow the inclusion of EFA-FTI 
CF funds. In addition, the program document for this operation constitutes one of the main 
documents that will be used by the EFA FTI CF Steering Committee to determine whether 
funding will be allocated to Rwanda. From the perspective of the Committee, it would be 
preferable to propose a self-standing operation where the objective is explicitly aligned with 
government’s EFA-FTI program rather than proposing an operation of which basic education 
objectives are merely one among many that the operation supports. 
 
LINK TO CAS 
 
39. 
The operation will support the 
GoR’s objectives of poverty reduction and transitioning 
to an inclusive, productive, knowledge-based economy and society, consistent with the 
country’s fiscal framework and with the new CAS. 
The CAS document explicitly identifies 
basic education, and the continued role of the Bank as administrator of EFA FTI CF funding, 
as a key example of an area in which the Bank has a comparative advantage and is able to help 
achieve clear policy and implementation outcomes.  
40. 
The operations development objective of supporting the GoR’s policy reforms on 
Textbooks, Teacher Development and Management, and Girls’ Education with the 
overall aim to improve the quality of basic education, supports both CAS themes of 
promoting economic transformation and growth, and of reducing social vulnerability. 
Concerning the former, growth diagnostics demonstrate that low human capital and lack of 
skills result in low returns on economic activity which are one of the main causes of 
insufficient growth. Low skills levels are higher obstacles to economic growth than, for 
example, the high costs of finance or governance constraints.
13
 Improvements in the quality 
basic education will address this constraint by increasing the productivity of those who enter 
the labor market after completing basic education. It will also boost both the number and 
preparedness of those pupils who will pursue post-basic education. Concerning the latter, 
quality basic education has a demonstrated positive impact on reducing poverty and social 
vulnerability. In particular, improving access to and quality of basic education for girls has

shown to affect positively the age at which they have their first child, their fertility rate, and

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS 
 
41. 
The Bank’s PRSG in Rwanda has been prepared in parallel with the IMF’s Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) review.  
The IMF leads the macroeconomic 
dialogue in Rwanda and recently completed its sixth review of Rwanda’s economic 
performance under its PRGF arrangements. The completion of the review brings total 
disbursements under the arrangement to a total of SDR 8.01 million (about US$12.4 million).
14
 
The IMF’s work complements the PRSG’s focus on structural and institutional reforms. The 
proposed EFA-FTI CF Bridge Grant will work closely to align objectives, resources and 
dialogue with that of the IMF primarily through its close collaboration with the PRSG IV Bank 
operation.
 
42. 
This operation is consistent with the other documents of the Bridge Grant application 
package as prepared by the government and endorsed by the education sector 
development partners. 
In particular, the education sector development partners will provide 
guidance to the Bank as Supervising Entity on whether the prior actions are met and use their 
coordination and monitoring mechanisms to track progress of performance and monitoring 
indicators. 
43. 
Within the framework of the EFA-FTI CF operation in Rwanda, the Bank has 
responsibilities both as one of the partners in the education sector development partners 
group, and as the Supervising Entity. 
As a member of the education sector development 
partners group, the Bank consults with the government on the implementation of the ESSP. It 
also shares responsibility with the other partners in endorsing MINEDUC’s progress and 
implementation plans of the Nine Year Basic Education program. As administrator of the CF 
Bridge Grant, the Bank’s fiduciary framework will apply in the implementation of the Grant.

Human Resources and Development Project (HRDP, P045091). 
The HRDP was 
approved in June 6, 2000 and is expected to close on December 31, 2009. The HRDP’s 
objective is to assist Rwanda in its efforts to develop and implement a sustained program of 
capacity building through education and skills development in order to develop a critical mass 
of trained human resources.  The Development Project Objectives of the HRDP are: (i) 
improve access to basic education by increasing its intake capacity through community 
participation in rehabilitating, constructing and equipping schools; (ii) improve the quality of 
inputs (teaching, instructional materials, methods of supervision) in primary and secondary 
education; (iii) heighten awareness and train students, parents and educators to combat the 
AIDS epidemic; and (iv) build institutional capacity and improve efficiency in the 
management of the education system through focused training, studies and policy 
development, and initiation of a Sector-Wide Investment Program. The principal remaining 
activity under the HRDP is the construction of a secondary school for girls.

Lessons drawn from PRSG operations 
 
45. 
The Bank’s budget support experience has demonstrated that substantial outcomes can 
be achieved with strong commitment on the part of GoR and with Bank support designed 
to develop the needed capacity for implementation.  
Key lessons drawn from the first 
PRSC/G series in Rwanda highlighted the importance of (i) cross-sector linkages and 
synergies; (ii) strong stakeholder commitment; (iii) sound joint analytical work to inform 
policy dialogue and reforms; and (iv) a common harmonized accountability framework aligned 
around policy objectives to lessen transaction costs and enhance ownership. As indicated 
below, these principles have been largely taken into account during the implementation of the 
sector budget support to the education sector.
 
Lessons drawn from supporting the education sector  
46. 
A
variety of lessons has been drawn from the implementation of the ESSP and the 
cooperation between GoR and development partners in the education sector in recent 
years. 
These lessons have been incorporated in the design of this operation, have helped 
identify reform priorities within the ESSP, and have helped shape the current coordination 
mechanism among stakeholders. In particular: 
-
The sector budget support modality through which development partners, including the EFA-FTI CF 
Grant, pooled funds for the implementation of (basic) education objectives, reduces transaction costs 
and allows consultations between the government and the education sector development partners to 
focus on essential policy and institutional reforms;  
-
A
well-functioning education sector development partners group greatly contributes to the effective 
provision of external support, both financially and in terms of policy discussions with the government.  
-
A
continuous and transparent consultative process between the government and development 
partners is essential to inspire sufficient confidence among partners to be willing to rely on the 
domestic quality assurance and fiduciary systems. This requires among others a rigorous monitoring 
and evaluation process based on jointly agreed, measurable objectives and targets, as well as a 
communication process that is satisfactorily open and extensive to all stakeholders involved.
 
For 
example, consultations initiated by MINEDUC on the accelerated implementation of the Nine Year 
Basic Education program have improved the common understanding and commitment of the 
program’s objectives by key stakeholders.  
-
The Joint Review of the Education Sector, conducted by MINEDUC, and the Joint Sector Budget 
Reviews conducted with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) are important 
tools for monitoring budget execution and sector performance.  
-
The incorporation of a Capacity Building and Institution Development Fund in MINEDUC’s 
organizational structure is considered to contribute to a strengthened implementation of the ESSP by 
providing pooled funding for capacity building and enabling MINEDUC to plan and manage the 
overall capacity building process. In the past two years, the Fund has supported among others the 
improvement of capacity for school management of both school directors and parent-teacher 
associations (all primary and secondary school directors received in-service training), and the 
development by the Inspectorate of Minimum Quality Standards for primary and secondary education 
and Guidelines for School Effectiveness. 
-
The pace at which appropriate reforms can be developed and successfully implemented is in great 
part determined by the capacity at central and decentralized administrations and educational 
institutions. In line with the EDPRS and ESSP, there is a strong drive within the government to gain 
Page  25
20 
fast and strong results in improving access to and quality of both basic and post-basic education. 
However, staffing numbers in MINEDUC and District Education Units are low and capacity at lower 
administrative levels and in schools are weak and need to be strengthened.
15
 A restructuring process is 
ongoing that is expected to assist in addressing capacity and administrative constraints. In addition, the 
Capacity Building and Institution Development Fund (see above) provides resources for capacity 
building at schools as well as decentralized and central administrative levels.  
 
ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS 
 
47. 
The analytical work that the GoR and partners have undertaken in recent years 
reflects the progress that has been made toward reaching basic education objectives, 
supports the shift in focus to the quality of basic education, and forms the basis for 
selecting teacher co
mpetencies, textbooks, and girls’ education as the policy areas which 
this operation supports.
 This research base has also helped identify the areas that require 
further analytical work in the short to medium term. The update of the education sector’s 
Country Status Report (CSR), which will be completed in FY10, is expected to provide further 
insights into relevant areas such as teacher supply and demand, the transition from primary 
school to 
tronc commun
,
and the impact of decentralization on decision-making and resource 
allocation.

Distribution is uneven, there are shortages in key subject areas, and procurement is 
monopolistic and costly. Distribution and quality is constrained by inadequate planning, 
time-consuming procurement processes, and inadequate distribution and stock 
management. There is a need for greater competition, strengthened local publishing and 
printing industry, decentralized procurement, commercial distribution, and school-level 
selection of textbooks.  
Analysis in preparation of the Girls’ Education Strategic Plan 2008-2010, MINEDUC 2008, 
presentation to partners 
Girls’ Education 
Gender imbalances particularly relate to academic performance, as evidenced by girls’ 
low scores at end-of-primary and end-of-
tronc commun
 examinations. Constraints to 
gender equitable education relate to performance rather than access, and are both 
demand and supply based. They include socio-cultural dimensions, such as the private 
costs to education and school related factors, such as infrastructure facilities, 
curriculum, the share of female teachers, and gender-insensitive teaching. 
48. 
Rwanda’s progress in increasing enrollment, albeit from a low-base post-conflict 
situation, was already signaled in the Country Status Report in 2003.
 Five years after the 
genocide, enrollment rates at primary level exceeded those of the average low-income African 
country, and the number of students at secondary level had increased by 20 percent a year 
since 1996. As a consequence of this quick recovery in access, Rwanda’s education challenges 
have shifted from re-establishing the education system after the conflict to charting an 
appropriate and sustainable course for the sector’s long-term development. Mobilization of 
resources and their efficient use, balancing of school accessibility against considerations of 
economies of scale
16
,
and increasing access of vulnerable groups were mentioned in the 2003 
report as main concerns. In the area of gender imbalances, the CSR noted that while girls are 
about as likely as boys to be in primary school, they perform consistently worse than boys in 
both primary school and 
tronc commun
,
and that these persistent inferior scores take their toll 
in the competition for places in higher education.
17
 Finally, the CSR highlighted the expected 
increased pressure on primary completion rates as access expanded, as well as the need to 
16
 This relates to trade-offs between having a larger number of small schools (accessibility) and fewer but larger schools 
(economies of scale). 
17
 The share of girls in primary school scoring above the cut-off mark for promotion to 
tronc commun
 was 18 percent, 
compared to 29 percent for boys. At the end of tronc commun, 29 percent scored above the cut-off level, compared to 
56 percent for boys (2002 data).   
Page  27

manage classroom conditions and processes 
–
including the number and competencies of 
teachers and the availability of textbooks - to enhance student learning. 
49. 
The 2007 Public Expenditure Review of the Education Sector in Rwanda (PER), while 
recognizing a number of achievements and strengths in the education sector, identifies 
the need for increased in-service teacher training.
 The PER describes Rwanda’s successful 
expansion of primary and secondary education, the increased resources for these sub-sectors, 
the decentralization of education administration and management to promote a more efficient 
use of resources, the introduction of performance contracts for district and school staff, and the 
generally high quality of school management. It also highlights a number of required changes, 
some of which were at the time already incorporated in policy and strategy documents but 
were not yet being implemented. Recommended changes include support to districts and sector 
for improved service delivery and a substantial increase in the provision of in-service training 
across the country, supported by strengthened teacher training centers. The PER also notes the 
long time it takes to procure textbooks (up to several years) and the rapid improvement in 
procurement capacity needed to achieve textbook-pupil objectives, and suggests that Rwanda 
could benefit from international professional support in procurement methodology (similar to 
that provided in 2003).   
50. 
Teacher competencies need to be improved through the provision of better pre-service 
and in-service training.
 Most teachers are formally qualified according to national 
qualification standards (in 2008, 97 percent of primary school teachers were qualified, 
according to MINEDUC data). However, within the existing challenging context (e.g., large 
classrooms, new curricula, double shifting, languages of instruction and decentralized school 
management), GoR has not yet been able to ensure that teachers have the necessary 
competencies to successfully operate in the taxing school environment.
18
 There are widespread 
concerns that pre-service education in Rwanda is too academic and theoretical with the bulk of 
lecturers having little or no direct experience of the day to day challenges of classroom 
teaching. The study “Teacher Motivation and Incentives in Rwanda: A Situational Analysis 
and Recommended Priority Actions” (2008), highlights the importance of teacher motivation 
and satisfaction to attract and retain high-quality teachers across the country. The study 
concludes that, as prospects of sizeable pay increases are unlikely in the near future, it is 
important to improve non-salary material benefits and enhance more intrinsic, non-material 
motivators such as pre-service teacher education, in-service training to facilitate continuous 
professional development, and improved teacher management. The study emphasizes the 
importance of providing regular, high-quality in-service training to attain consistently high 
teaching standards. However, the provision is ineffective because it is largely supply-driven, 
ad hoc and one-off, with little or no reinforcement. The provision of in-service training varies 
widely across regions, and a large majority of teachers consider the availability of in-service 
training to be poor or very poor.
19
 The study recommends the creation of a more effective 
system of continuous professional development, institutionalized at both the central and district 
level.
 
51. Recent initiatives of the government to address the above issues include the adoption of 
student-centered learning approach under the national qualification framework in several 
institutions and efforts to improve non-salary incentives for teachers. Efforts to improve 
teacher training include the establishment of two new colleges of education (in Rukaru and 
18
 There are three teacher qualification levels.  Level A2 (certificate received after three years of post-basic education) 
qualifies for teaching in primary schools; A1 (diploma received after two years of post-secondary education) qualifies 
for teaching up to 
tronc commun
;
A0 (university degree) qualifies for teaching up to upper secondary school.  
19
 The results from a survey among teachers in June-July 2008 indicate that the availability of in-service training is 
considered to be poor to very poor by 60 percent of surveyed A0-qualified teachers, 59 percent of A1-qualified teachers, 
and 75 of A2-qualitified teachers.

Kavumu), activities to strengthen the existing teacher training colleges as well as the Kigali 
Institute of Education, and the earmarking of 15 percent of capitation grants for school-based 
training.  
 
52. 
There exist several constraints affect the distribution and quality of textbooks. 
After the 
approval of a comprehensive Textbook Policy in 2003, textbook availability increased 
substantially. However, this occurred at a high cost and resulted in an unequal distribution of 
books of varying quality. In 2007, MINEDUC initiated a DFID-supported series of textbook 
studies to build the analytical foundation for developing further reforms, particularly to draft a 
strategy to achieve its objective of providing every pupil with a textbook in core subjects at the 
primary and secondary levels (see table 5 for reference to these studies). These studies, based 
on extensive field research, reveal several constraints that have affected the distribution and 
quality of textbooks in Rwanda: (i) Textbook distribution is heavily dependent on availability 
of funds, lacks adequate planning, and does not take into account supply and demand data; (ii) 
Textbook bid evaluation takes a long time; (iii) Teachers voiced dissatisfaction with textbook 
choices; (iv) Textbooks are often damaged due to poor distribution and stock management, 
resulting in discrepancies in pupil-to-textbook ratios between individual schools and within 
districts; and (v) Supplementary reading materials to encourage early literacy in all languages 
are lacking, particularly at lower levels of primary school. 
 
53. 
The academic underperformance of girls is linked to various aspects of the school-
based learning environment. 
The underperformance of girls that was highlighted in the CSR 
is assessed in more detail in an analysis conducted in 2008 by MINEDUC. While slightly more 
girls than boys are enrolled in primary education, fewer of them still make the transition to 
tronc commun
,
even though the gender gap in transition rate has decreased in the past years 
(from 7 percentage points in 2005 to 3.9 percentage points in 2007). Although Rwanda 
currently has no system to assess student learning from year to year, the results of 
examinations at the end of primary school and 
tronc commun
 do shed light on gender 
disparities in learning outcomes. For instance, although girls constituted more than half of 
those who took the primary school leaving examination in 2006, they represented only 38 
percent of those who passed it. While there is no significant gender difference in average test 
scores on languages, girls score lower on mathematics (21 percent for girls compared to 25 
percent for boys) and particularly on sciences (26 percent and 33 percent for girls and boys, 
respectively). Similarly, in examinations at the end of 
tronc commun
,
only around one third of 
those who passed were girls, even though girls made up 48 percent of those who participated 
in the examination. MINEDUC’s analysis highlights a variety of causes of these gender 
disparities, which can be both socio-cultural and related to the learning environment. As for the 
learning environment, school facilities and the curriculum are identified as factors that need to 
be addressed. Also, the low share of female teachers (25.5% of secondary school teachers) and 
their uneven distribution, as well as gender-insensitive teaching are considered to contribute to 
persistent gender imbalances. MINEDUC is currently carrying out further analyses of the 
school-based causes of underperformance of girls to provide a sound basis for the Girls 
Education Strategic Plan which is being developed.

THE PROPOSED EDUCATION FOR ALL 
–
FAST TRACK INITIATIVE CATALYTIC 
FUND DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT 
OPERATION DESCRIPTION  
 
54. 
The Program Development Objective is to support the GoR’s policy reforms on 
Teacher Development and Management, Textbooks, and Girls’ Education, with the 
overall aim to improve the quality of basic education. 
Improving the quality of basic 
Page  29
24 
education is one of the key objectives of the Nine Year Basic Education Policy and Strategy 
(February 2006). The 2008 Joint Review of the Education Sector (JRES) identified improving 
the quality of basic education as a key priority, requiring that quality factors related to among 
others teacher supply and qualification, textbook procurement and distribution, and gender 
imbalances be addressed.  
55. 
Anticipated benefits from the Grant include substantial progress on policy reforms that 
contribute to the acceleration of the Nine Year Basic Education Policy and Strategy. The 
reforms are expected to lead to improved coordination and management of the in-service 
teacher education structure; decentralization of textbook procurement with enhanced 
school-level decision-making to ensure that textbook distribution and choice are adapted 
to local conditions; and  school environments t
hat are more conducive to girls’ further 
success in school. 
These will in turn contribute to several objectives of the Nine Year Basic 
Education Policy and Strategy, including improved primary completion rates, reduced primary 
school repetition and drop-out rates, and improved transition rates to 
tronc commun
.
Core 
aspects of UNICEF’s child-friendly program, including improved school management, 
structured community participation, school based in-service teacher training, and specific 
support to rural girls, will be scaled up in 2009/10 to support these policy actions. There has 
already been considerable success in the 70 schools targeted by UNICEF in improved learning 
outcomes, teacher motivation, and school/community collaboration.  
56. 
The Operation is aligned to the Common Performance Assessment Framework 
(CPAF), which the Government prepared in consultation with development partners. 
The 
prior actions for this Operation have been agreed with GoR and the education sector 
development partners. This one-year Operation consists of a single tranche disbursement, after 
which Rwanda will apply for a new three-year Second Grant from the EFA-FTI CF Steering 
Committee with an updated analytical foundation. Consequently, no prior actions for the next 
operation are identified.   
57. 
The prior actions are (i) 
Adoption of a Teacher Development and Management Policy 
(TDMP) establishing an entity for the oversight of teacher services professionalization; 
(ii)
 
Adoption of a cost-calculated strategic plan for the establishment of a framework for 
coordinated in-service teacher training; 
(iii)
 Adoption of a framework and procedures for the 
implementation of decentralized procurement and school-level selection of textbooks, as set 
out in the Textbook Policy; (
iv
)
Issuance of an invitation to publishers for the submission of 
proposals of teaching and learning materials for inclusion in the national approved list of such 
materials; (
v
)
Adoption of a Girls’ Education Policy including measures for improved gender-
disaggregated data collection and analysis; and (
vi
)
Adoption of a cost-calculated strategic plan 
for the implementation of said girls’ education policy. All actions were endorsed by 
MINEDUC and donor partners and formally submitted to MINECOFIN for inclusion in the 
revised CPAF. (See also the
 
Policy Matrix, Annex 2). The first two prior actions would 
contribute to the CPAF Indicator of improving the primary pupil per qualified teacher ratio, 
while the other four would help improve primary school completion rates, disaggregated by 
sex.   
58. 
The following box describes the application of good practice principles of conditionality
 
to reinforce ownership and accountability of policy reforms that will contribute to the 
successful results of this operation.   
Page  30
25 
Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality 
Principle 1. Reinforce Ownership 
This operation supports government reforms aimed at improving quality in basic education, an objective which is 
incorporated in the EDPRS and education sector strategies reflected in the LTSFF and ESSP, and which was reiterated 
as being an education sector priority by both government and partner representatives during the JRES of June 2008. 
The GoR has a strong track record in committing to and implementing reforms, both in general and in the education 
sector. With active support from the Bank, the EDPRS was developed in a participatory manner involving extensive 
consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. The process was led by a National Steering Committee providing high 
level guidance. The GoR articulates its vision for improved aid management and policies in the formal Aid Policy.  
The ‘Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Rwanda and Development Partners Regarding 
Partnership Principles for Support to the Rwanda Education Sector’ stipulates that the ESSP provides the overarching 
framework for a sector-wide approach to the development and delivery of education services, and establishes 
harmonization and alignment principles consistent with the overall Framework for Aid Coordination in Rwanda (2002, 
MINECOFIN). Development partners endorsed the ESSP in 2006, as a prerequisite for approval of the first EFA-FTI 
CF Grant (2007-08). The ESSP explicitly recognizes the importance of partnership and continuous consultation between 
the GoR, parents, communities, development partners, the private sector, NGOs and civil society. There exist various 
regular forums to facilitate these consultations, among others the annual JRES, during which key indicators and 
expenditure performance are evaluated and forward looking discussions on policy issues and development take place.   
Principle 2. Agree up front with the GoR and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework 
The GoR and budget support donors have agreed on a common assessment framework for public financial management 
(PEFA). The GoR, together with donors, also developed a Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) 
which is aligned with the EDPRS. The CPAF is one of the three complementary monitoring and performance 
management frameworks under the newly signed MoU between budget support donors (including the Bank) and GoR. 
The MoU stipulates the intent of all parties to base budget support operations to the extent possible on policy actions 
and indicators that are incorporated in the CPAF. Government and partners in the education sector have agreed to 
sector-specific mechanisms, including a SWAp MoU and a sector matrix, and a pooled sector budget support financing 
mechanism is in place. The GoR also passed an Accountants Bill in December 2007 and adopted and gazetted the 
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) and appointed its Board of Directors in March, 2008.  
This operation was developed at the same time that the CPAF for all sectors was being updated. The prior actions for 
this operation build upon the prior actions that were incorporated in the existing CPAF, were agreed upon by GoR and 
partners during the JRES that was held in March 2009 and further revised during the appraisal mission of May 2009, 
and have been incorporated in the CPAF’s revised version that has been submitted to MINECOFIN for approval. The 
revised version of the CPAF will also include the indicators for this operation. 
Principle 3. Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances 
The EFA-FTI process, with its large role for the education sector development partners group, is the main umbrella for 
consultations on access to and quality of basic education between the government and the development partners. The 
DPO modality is considered to be well-fitted to the country context and in support of the Paris Declaration 
commitments. (See also Section IV - Choice of Lending Instrument of this program document.) 
Principle 4. Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement 
The EFA-FTI CF Bridge Grant focuses on six prior actions, each representing a critical step for implementing the 
GoR’s program for basic education, and identified through dialogue with the GoR and other relevant stakeholders. 
Principle 5. Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support 
A
full review of the program will take place in line with the review agreed in the MOU governing the provision of 
budget support in the implementation of Rwanda’s EDPRS.  Joint budget reviews and joint sector reviews take place 
twice a year, aligned with the budget cycle. A Joint Review of the Education Sector takes place annually. (See also 
Section VI - Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation of this program document.)

26 
POLICY AREAS COVERED BY THE OPERATION   
 
59. 
The EFA-FTI CF Bridge Grant supports GoR efforts to incorporate good international 
practice into the design and implementation of reforms that are critical for improving the 
quality of basic education. 
These critical reform areas are the improvement of teacher 
competencies, the effective and efficient procurement and distribution of textbooks, and the 
improvement of girls’ academic performance. 
 
60. 
The Cabinet will approve a Teacher Development and Management Policy (TDMP).  
The implementation steps will be outlined in a strategic plan, which will include a section 
that describes the institutional reforms to be undertaken to develop a coordinated in-
service teacher education structure.  
MINEDUC’s ability to improve the in-service teacher 
education structure is a key policy challenge under the Nine Year Basic Education Policy and 
Strategy and a clear priority area for the sector in Rwanda. Teachers’ access to systematic and 
tailored opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge is essential to enable them to 
provide pupils with an appropriate learning environment. Reforms in this area are expected to 
have a substantial positive impact on quality-related outcome indicators. 
 
61. The prior actions for this operation are for the Cabinet to adopt the Teacher Development 
and Management Policy, which foresees the establishment of an entity to oversee the 
professionalization of teacher services, and for MINEDUC to adopt a cost-calculated strategic 
plan for establishing a coordinated in-service teacher education structure. The TDMP is a 
broad strategic policy that encompasses a range of reforms to improve the pre- and in-service 
teacher training system, as well as the management of the supply and demand of teachers.
20
 
The Government foresees a key institutional reform, which will provide the institutional 
structure for the provision, monitoring and evaluation of the development and management of 
teachers, with the aim of improving teacher knowledge, skills, competencies, and 
qualifications
.
In-service teacher education programs have been implemented in an ad hoc 
manner, with MINEDUC and several donor partners operating programs without centralized 
oversight or monitoring and evaluation. The Government intends to put in place a well-
structured program of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for teachers that will 
enhance synergy among currently implemented programs, avoid duplication of efforts among 
the various programs, and provide a strategic framework for the GoR to develop the right 
skills-mix within its teaching force. The reform is expected to enhance the quality of basic 
education, as well as address the teacher shortage problem by allowing teachers to gain 
professional qualifications while remaining in the teaching force.
 
62. At the time that the policy was written, it was envisaged that the Teacher Services 
Commission (TSC) would be given this mandate. Due to the Government-wide effort to reduce 
the number of public entities, Cabinet adopted plans to establish the semi-autonomous Rwanda 
Education Board (REB) at the national level, with various education-related entities subsumed 
under its umbrella. Current plans for the REB include the appointment of a Deputy CEO with a 
mandate to oversee the development and management of teachers, thereby transferring the 
roles and functions of the TSC to the newly appointed Deputy CEO (see Results Indicators in 
the Policy Matrix in Annex 2).
 
63. 
The Government will refine its textbook policy by adopting a more decentralized 
approach to textbook provision. 
The 2003 Textbook Policy determines the standards, roles, 
and responsibilities for all stakeholders in textbook provision, within the framework of overall 
20
 For instance, MINEDUC will develop a unified regulatory framework to govern and monitor the various institutions 
that provide pre-service teacher training. MINEDUC will incorporate into its financial framework separate budget lines 
for pre-service teacher training for primary, lower secondary and upper secondary levels. 
Page  32
27 
coordination by MINEDUC.
2
1
The Policy stipulates that MINEDUC is the main purchaser of 
textbooks, but also acknowledges the intention to work towards devolving the process to lower 
levels of government. Recent analyses have highlighted weaknesses in the current centralized 
process for textbook provision, thus GoR is adopting a new approach to ensure the more timely 
and efficient provision of appropriate textbooks, teacher guides, and related learning materials 
in every subject for Grades 1-6 (177 titles in total)
22
.
This new approach concerns the 
decentralization of both the selection and procurement of textbooks to the school-level. 
Publishers will submit bids with partial textbook manuscripts, of which up to four manuscripts 
per subject will be selected by the Textbook Approval Committee, comprising of 
representatives of MINEDUC, the National Examinations Commission, and the Inspectorate. 
Publishers on the “awarded textbook status” list will have the opportunity to market their 
textbooks to schools and possibly provide training to teachers
23
.
Schools will then select one 
textbook per subject from the list developed by the Textbook Approval Committee. The 
process is expected to provide up to four textbook choices per subject from which schools can 
choose, thereby enhancing the relevance and quality of textbooks. The price of textbooks is 
expected to decrease considerably as a result of increased competition among publishers. 
Distribution of the textbooks will no longer be done by the National Curriculum Development 
Center through the districts, but carried out directly by the publishers to schools and local 
booksellers. Responsibilities for selection, choice of pedagogical materials, procurement, and 
distribution will be progressively devolved to individual schools. This process will start with 
the provision of training to textbook evaluators and the establishment of Textbook Selection 
Committees in primary and secondary schools (see Results Indicators in the Policy Matrix in 
Annex 2).  
64. As a prior action to this operation, GoR will establish an implementation framework and 
procedures for the Textbook Policy with the aim to decentralize procurement and allow 
school-level selection
 
and begin the tender process by issuing an invitation to publishers to 
submit manuscripts for evaluation and inclusion on the approved list of learning and teaching 
materials. Enhanced school-level decision-making is expected to better align the selection of 
textbooks with the local needs of students and teachers, improve the utilization of learning 
materials, and enhance ownership by schools and teachers. The decentralized procurement 
process, in alignment with international good policy practice, should ensure the better and 
more timely delivery of textbooks and other learning materials to improve the general learning 
environment, which in turn is expected to improve retention and completion rates in both 
primary school and 
tronc commun
 and encourage a more effective engagement of students in 
the learning process. Cooperation between MINEDUC and the publishers is also expected to 
enhance the public-private partnership in the sector.  
65. 
The Government will develop and approve a Girls’ Education Policy (GEP) and 
finalize a costed Strategic Plan for its implementation.
 The Girls’ Education Policy and the 
parallel Strategic Plan will target institutional and school-based constraints to gender equity 
that have been identified by MINEDUC. The GEP will mainstream the practice of 
disaggregating data and analysis for key education indicators of access and achievement. The 
GEP will also address gender disparity among school administrators by fast tracking women 
into entry level and middle management positions. The Government intends to build more all-
girls boarding schools and establish them as centers of academic excellence. The GEP will also 
include the development of laws and codes of conduct for teachers and pupils to protect all

22
 Both DfID and the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) provided technical assistance for developing the procedures 
for decentralizing the procurement of textbooks and other learning materials.  The Capacity Building Fund will provide 
funding to cover the cost of the Textbook Approval Committee to evaluate manuscripts submitted by publishers.   
23
 Publishers will retain the copyright for the learning materials.

children, but especially girls, against sexual, physical, and mental abuse. The GEP will be 
disseminated in each District through awareness raising workshops with relevant stakeholders 
including NGOs, faith-based organizations, and school administrators (see Results Indicators 
in the Policy Matrix in Annex 2). The Strategic Plan, for the period 2009-2013, will clarify the 
role of central and local levels of Government with respect to implementing the Girls’ 
Education Policy, and will support the alignment of the sector policy with the GoR’s National 
Gender Policy. 
 
66. As prior actions for this operation, GoR will adopt a Girls’ Education Policy as well as a 
cost-calculated strategic plan for its implementation. GoR’s efforts to address gender 
imbalances in basic education will include a number of institutional measures at both the 
central and the district level. At the central level, a Girls’ Education Task Force (GETF) will 
be established to provide strategic leadership on the issue of girls’ education and coordinate 
collaboration among stakeholders relevant for implementing the Girls’ Education Policy. A 
Girls’ Education Professional Officer will be appointed to lead this task force, who will be 
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the reforms described above. At the district 
level, the Government will establish a Joint Action Forum for Girls’ Education (JAFGE), 
comprised of Vice-Mayors in charge of Social Affairs, to ensure the integration of girls’ 
education issues and indicators into district development plans.
 
JAGFE will report to the 
GETF at the end of every term. Finally, the National Youth Council will establish the Girls’ 
Education Alliance in Rwanda (GEAR), which will be a member of the GETF at the central 
level. At the district level, GEAR will support JAFGE to evaluate and implement activities 
stipulated in the costed strategic plan. The strategic plan will be presented to relevant 
stakeholders (including the Forum for African Women Educationalists [FAWE] and other 
local and international NGOs, foundations, faith-based organizations, schools, and directors of 
education at the district level) and revised accordingly, before submission for adoption by the 
MINEDUC management.  
 
VI. OPERATION 
IMPLEMENTATION 
POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT 
 
67. 
Overall, the reforms and measures to be supported under this operation are geared 
toward improving the quality of basic education, which is expected to have a positive 
socio-economic impact on those who benefit from increased and extended access to high-
quality basic education.
 Therefore, no adverse poverty or social impacts are foreseen. In the 
medium term, the GoR’s efforts to improve the quality of basic education is expected to lead to 
both higher completion rates, as well as an increased skills level of those who complete 
primary or basic education. While the positive impact of increased skills levels due to 
increased quality of education is hard to quantify with available data, the economic benefits of 
completing primary and basic education are illustrated in a forthcoming Bank study on the 
linkages between poverty, economic growth, and labor.
24
 Analyses conducted for this report 
show that median earnings of those who completed primary education are 38 percent higher 
than of those who entered but did not complete primary school. Similarly, median earnings of 
those who completed 
tronc commun
 exceed earnings of those who completed only primary by 
42 percent. In addition, the likelihood that a person is employed in the private waged or public 
sector (i.e. jobs that are generally considered to be of ‘high quality’) increases substantially 
with educational attainment. 
24
 ‘Making Work Pay in Rwanda: Employment Growth and Poverty Reduction’, World Bank, forthcoming (2009). 
Page  34
29 
68. 
Distributional impacts are expected to be pro-poor and support gender equity.
 Pupils 
who currently do not complete primary school and, particularly, 
tronc commun
 tend to reside 
disproportionally in poorer households. An across-the-board increase in basic education 
quality will therefore be particularly beneficial for these households. In addition, the particular 
policy reforms that are supported by this operation are expected to particularly benefit those in 
rural areas and girls: (i) reforms in the area of in-service teacher training aim to improve 
teacher motivation and satisfaction and thus attract and retain high-quality teachers across the 
country; (ii) textbook reforms intend to address deficiencies in distribution and stock 
management which are more likely to affect remote areas; and (iii) the girl’s education policy 
explicitly aims to improve school-based constraints to girls’ academic performance.  
 
69. 
Negative distributional impacts in terms of a reduction of the skills premium may exist 
for 
tronc commun
 but is considered to be beneficial for the economy as a whole.
 An 
increase in the relative supply of workers with a certain educational attainment may result in a 
fall of the skills premium of this group of workers in case demand for these skills does not 
increase at a similar or higher rate. While this effect may be positive for the economy as a 
whole, it would reduce the earnings capacity of individual workers in this group. Over the past 
period, however, the increase in demand for those who completed primary education seems to 
have kept pace or even exceeded the increase in supply, as their skills premium slightly 
widened over that of unskilled workers between 2000 and 2006.
25
 In the same period, the 
premium of skilled workers (defined as those who completed 
tronc commun
,
TVET, upper 
secondary and higher education) fell by approximately 19 percent.
26
 Nevertheless, as the 
premium does remain very large, with the earnings of the skilled typically being more than 
triple those of the unskilled, this reduction can be considered a logical result of an increased 
skills base of the labor force that benefits the investment climate by reducing the costs of 
skilled labor. Any (adverse) distributional impacts directly related to the specific policy 
reforms supported by this operation are expected to be non-existent or marginal. Textbook 
policy reforms may result in a redistribution of the size of textbook orders between the various 
providers and an increase in orders from local (rather than foreign) booksellers. The girls’ 
education policy may result in an increased preference of hiring female teachers. 
70. 
Improvements in the education sector’s monitoring and evaluation framework will 
enable MINEDUC to better track pro-poor spending and the distributional impacts of its 
policies. 
In particular, the Education Management Information System (EMIS) is expected to 
be operational and a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey is planned to be carried out in the 
course of 2009 (see also below). 
 
IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
 
Implementation 
71. 
In September 2008 all budget support donors and the GoR signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding governing the provision of direct budget support in the implementation of 
Rwanda’s EDPRS.
 
The MoU, which replaces the 2003 Partnership Framework, outlines 
monitoring and performance management responsibilities and guidelines. Under this MoU, 
25
 Unskilled workers are those who never enrolled in primary school or dropped out before completion. 
26
 The analysis does not provide the calculation of trends in the skills premium of 
tronc commun 
separately.  
Page  35
30 
monitoring and performance management will be undertaken according to the Harmonization 
Calendar in the context of three complementary frameworks: 
i. The 
Common Performance Assessment Framework
 (CPAF) summarizes the GoR’s 
performance in the implementation of the EDPRS; 
ii. The 
Donor Performance Assessment Framework
 (DPAF) summarizes donor 
performance in adhering to the various commitments related to the aid effectiveness agenda; 
iii. The 
Joint Governance Assessment 
(JGA), which will be revised and agreed upon 
annually by the GoR and the development partners, summarizes GoR’s performance in the 
implementation of governance reforms. 
72. 
The Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG) brings together GoR and donors 
who provide budget support for the implementation of the EDPRS and its related 
flagship programs.
27
 The dialogue in the bi-annual Joint Budget Support Reviews (JBSR) is 
based on the joint assessment of EDPRS implementation progress, including governance 
indicators and PFM reform, using the CPAF as the single framework. For governance topics 
not covered in the CPAF, an assessment of underlying principles is based on the Joint 
Governance Assessment annual review.  Policy actions and targets of the CPAF are to be 
revised on an annual basis during the forward-looking Joint Budget Support Review. Under 
exceptional circumstances, indicators may be changed as long as they remain consistent with 
the EDPRS and ongoing GoR policies and programs.  
73. 
The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning is responsible for the implementation 
of the EFA FTI CF Bridge Grant operation.
 
74. 
The Policy Matrix (Annex 2) for the proposed operation presents a results framework 
that describes the critical reforms that this operation addresses, the prior actions, as well 
as the results indicators and targets to measure implementation progress. 
The matrix and 
indicators are consistent with the CPAF and the sector-specific framework.   
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework  
75. 
Monitoring of all education sector targets takes place through a number of mechanisms 
that bring Government, development partners and civil society representatives together 
in open and transparent processes.
 Some of these are specific to the education sector; others 
are part of a broader economic framework of planning and monitoring performance including 
the national budget allocation, execution and review process. The main mechanisms for the 
education sector are as follows:   
-
The Annual Joint Review of the Education Sector (JRES) brings together donors, ministries, districts, 
education institutions and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to discuss expenditure, 
development priorities and progress on agreed action areas;  
-
The annual Joint Budget Sector Reviews by the Government of Rwanda (GoR) provides summaries of 
expenditure, budget execution performance, targets and allocation percentages for discussion with 
budget support donors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); 
-
Bi-monthly Education Sector Cluster Group meetings monitor education policies, program priorities 
and progress on JRES Action Points. Members include the main development partners, one Civil 
Society Organization (CSO) and one United Nations (UN) representative, and the Ministries of 
Education (MINEDUC), Local Government, and Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN);  
27
 Membership of the BSHG in a given year is restricted to partners contributing a minimum of US$10 million per year 
 of (general or sector) budget support.

Periodic Public Expenditure Reviews: MINEDUC conducted its most recent review in 2007 and is 
planning a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey for 2009; and  
-
A
Public Expenditure tracking survey is planned for the second half of 2009, as recommended in the 
2008 Joint Annual Review. 
 
76. 
The Education Management Information System (EMIS) is being rolled out and is 
expected to be operational by 2009.
 The EMIS collects all school and college-based data 
relating to pupils, teachers, equipment and infrastructure in public and private institutions, and 
support semi-autonomous agencies such as TSC, NEC and NCD.  
77. 
The below table presents the operation’s key performance and monitoring indicators as 
well as their base and target values.
 The indicators have been agreed by MINEDUC and 
partners and included in the new CPAF. All indicators will be tracked by the JRES monitoring 
and evaluation system.

In the medium term, the reforms that are supported by this operation are expected to 
contribute positively to the basic-education related medium term indicators from the 
CPAF (table 8).
 It is not expected that the implementation of the reforms supported by this 
operation will result in a measurable positive impact on these indicators within the 
implementation period of this operation.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS 
 
79. 
Operational Policy (OP) 8.60, 
Development Policy Lending, 
requires the determination 
whether specific country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause 
significant effects on the country’s environment, and, in the event of such likely effects, 
assess country systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive 
effects.
 In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, 
the Bank is required to identify how such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or 
during program implementation, as appropriate. This operation is not subject to OP 4.01, 
Environmental Assessment
.
80. 
The proposed operation is expected to have 
no significant adverse effects
 on Rwanda’s 
environment, natural resources, and forestry. 
The operation will provide general budget 
support to the GoR. 
Implementation of the Girls’ Education Policy may result in changes in 
school infrastructure, such as the addition or expansion of latrines for girls. In the long term, 
implementation of reforms in textbook procurement and distribution may result in an increase 
in locally produced textbooks. At this stage it seems likely that in this case production inputs 
(paper) would be imported.   
Page  38
33 
81. 
Country systems have adequate capacity to safeguard the environmental aspects of this 
operation. 
The framework for environmental management in Rwanda has steadily evolved 
over the last decade resulting in noticeable improvements in the institutional framework during 
the last five years. The Ministry of Natural Resources, responsible for environment, mines, 
land, forest, and water resources, secured the adoption of several pieces of legislation by the 
national assembly over the past four years that will improve the management of natural 
resources. Rwanda’s Environmental Management Authority (REMA) is responsible for 
reviewing the Terms of References for Environmental Assessments that must take place on all 
proposed projects in the country (GoR, donor or private). They also then review the assessment 
and provide the certificate without which no one can proceed. At district level, Environmental 
Officers are charged with supervising implementation of the environment policy 
commensurate with the legal framework established. In 2007, UNDP and GoR developed 
guidelines to help mainstream environmental issues in all sectors during the EDPRS process 
Furthermore, in collaboration with sector ministries, REMA is moving towards developing 
more custom-made environmental guidelines for each of the ministries to replace the general 
guidelines. However, capacity constraints are severe, particularly at the district level where 
most of the responsibilities for sector policy implementation are located. Sufficient resources 
and well-targeted capacity building are needed to address these constraints. MINIRENA seeks 
to mainstream improved environmental stewardship into its medium-term expenditure 
framework, focusing on long-term sustained support to building capacity to address 
environmental concerns in the implementation of the EDPRS.  
82. 
In the education sector, UNICEF supported MINEDUC in the development of new 
school construction norms.
 UNICEF also provides assistance in the roll-out of the Child-
Friendly Schools framework, which includes ensuring a healthy and hygienic school 
environment.  
 
FIDUCIARY ASPECTS  
 
83. 
The legal text to establish the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA), which is 
in line with international good practice, was adopted and its Board of Directors was 
appointed in March 2008
.
The text includes all functions belonging to a modern 
procurement regulatory and oversight body.  In addition, procurement audits were completed 
in 66 procuring entities.  Independent review panels have been established and made 
operational at the national and district levels (according to the law, five members are from the 
private sector and civil society organizations).  Bidders on public procurement contracts have 
recourse to independent appeal.  Finally, the National Tender Board (NTB) website now 
publishes a list of debarred firms. 
84. 
Parliament also passed the Accountants Bill in December 2007.  
The Bill now requires 
all financial institutions and large companies and public companies to comply with 
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS).   
 
85. 
Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment 
was completed in 2007 
and confirmed that while the PFM system performs strongly in some 
areas, others still require considerable strengthening. In particular, the areas of accounting, 
reporting, external audit and oversight require attention. Reporting at decentralized levels is 
weak and in need of capacity support, thus posing an area of risk. However, PFM reforms have 
advanced considerably: a sound procurement legal framework has been put in place and a 
Public Procurement Agency to regulate and oversee public procurement is now operational. 
Page  39

District budget reports are now published on the GoR’s website. MIFOTRA, the Ministry of 
Public Service and Labor, has completed the functional audit of 6 ministries.  The results of the 
review will be used to develop an action plan for each ministry to address identified 
weaknesses in their structure, staffing and procedures. A monitoring framework for the 
EDPRS has also been developed along with a CPAF adopted by all budget support donors to 
focus and align their fiduciary requirements. Further, the Governance flagship program under 
the EDPRS seeks to strengthen political governance, economic governance, and build 
institutions and capacity of the state.  It envisages, 
inter alia
,
a
wide range of reforms to 
strengthen public sector institutions and capacity, including further decentralization, enhancing 
accountability at all levels of GoR, strengthening public financial management at all levels and 
increasing the predictability and transparency of policy-making.    
86. 
Rwanda is widely recognized for low levels of corruption compared to the rest of Sub-
Saharan Africa
.
Strong political commitment to fighting corruption is evident by the 
following: (i) there is vigorous prosecution of corruption cases; (ii) the Ombudsman Office 
effectively coordinates an annual exercise of assets declaration by public officials involved in 
the management of public funds – together with the Office of the Auditor General, it exposes 
corrupt behaviors and makes recommendations for action by the Prosecutor General; and  (iii) 
following the new 2003 Constitution, the judicial sector was reformed to give independence to 
the Prosecution Office – this office with the help of other institutions like the National Police is 
able to independently and systematically prosecute all cases of misappropriation of public 
funds. 
 
87. 
The fifth review of the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF), completed in 
November 2008, noted that under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National 
Bank of Rwanda (NBR) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF 
arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. 
The updated assessment was completed on 
January 26, 2007 and considered the results of the previous 2003 assessment. It proposed 
recommendations to address continuing vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial 
reporting areas. The implementation of these measures is being monitored by IMF staff. In 
addition, the Bank coordinates with the Fund and other donors to provide support toward 
strengthening the audit and reporting functions of the PFM system, drawing from the results of 
the PEFA. The overall fiduciary framework for monitoring of the grant is therefore adequate. 
 
88. 
A
recent audit of MINEDUC activities revealed a number of weaknesses, which the 
government is currently addressing.
 MINEDUC has received a qualified audit opinion from 
the Auditor-general on its financial statements for the year ending December 3, 2007. The 
audit opinion indicates that proper books of accounts have been kept and the financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the state of financial affairs of MINEDUC.  
Notwithstanding, there are significant lapses of compliance to laws and prescribed procedures, 
certain weaknesses in controls over payments, bank accounts and assets and lapses in 
implementation of prior year audit recommendations. MINEDUC is subject to the general 
PFM reform program of the Government of Rwanda that aims to improve these cross cutting 
matters 
 
DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING  
 
89. 
The grant will be disbursed as a single tranche of US$35 million upon effectiveness. 
The 
proposed grant will foll
ow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for development policy 
operations.  The grant will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the 
development policy and not tied to any specific purchases. Subsequent to grant effectiveness 
and at the request of the Recipient, the Bank will disburse the proceeds of the grant into an 
Page  40
35 
account designated by the Recipient at the central bank of Rwanda 
(National Bank of Rwanda) 
and forming part of Rwanda’s foreign exchange reserves. The Recipient will ensure that upon 
deposit of the grant proceeds into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the 
Recipient’s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the IDA, with an indication 
of the exchange rate applied, where applicable. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of 
such account. If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the 
Grant Agreement, the Recipient will be requested to refund to IDA, an amount equal to the 
amount of said payment, promptly upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon 
such request shall be cancelled.
 
90. 
Within two business days, the National Bank of Rwanda will credit the Rwanda Franc 
equivalent of the grant proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf of the 
GoR, which finances budgeted expenditures.
 The Accountant General will be notified 
accordingly. The NBR will not impose any charges or commissions on the GoR for these 
transactions. The conversion from USD to Rwanda Franc will be based on the prevailing 
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. The GoR, 
through the MINECOFIN, will (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days to the Bank 
that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds from the Bank has been credited to the 
consolidated account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence 
that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the grant proceeds was recorded as financing for GoR 
budget; and (iii) ensure that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the grant proceeds are subject to 
controls to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only. 
 
RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION 
 
91. 
There are four main risks potentially associated with the program: 
i) political risk; (ii) 
macroeconomic and financial sector risk (including risk related to the global financial crisis); 
(iii) aid provision and predictability risk; and iv) program risks.  
92. 
Political Risk.  
Currently, Rwanda’s internal security and political situation remains stable 
but continued effort is needed to address the remaining political effects of the 1994 genocide. 
To address constraints surrounding the Gacaca system, the law on Non-Governmental 
Organizations (NGOs) is being revised in line with international good practice. Though 
international and regional efforts to mitigate instability in the Great Lakes sub-region are 
continuing, there is a substantial risk of flare-ups in the 
parts of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (
DRC). Continued international support from the United Nations, the African Union 
for peace efforts, and the Tripartite Plus Joint Commission, work toward identifying measures 
to counter the negative forces operating in the region. The governments of Rwanda and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo are also collaborating to increase regional stability.  
93. 
Macroeconomic and Financial Risk (including risk related to the global financial 
crisis)
.
Given the GoR’s record in macroeconomic management and its overall satisfactory 
rating as evidenced by reviews under the PRGF, the last few years’ economic reforms, and 
experience with budget support under the first PRSC/G series, the rating of this risk is low. 
Fiscal revenues rose from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 15.6 percent of GDP in 2008. This 
was largely attributable to one-off receipts and revenue collection efforts. Nonetheless, with 
high aid dependency and a low tax base, managing injections of liquidity into the economy 
may present dilemmas. While external aid doubles, the extent to which aid dependency falls 
depends a great deal on realization of very high GDP growth rates, not easily given 
considering the ongoing global economic crisis.  Even if high GDP growth rates are realized, 
in the medium-term the country remains highly aid dependent with a low tax base and the GoR 
may consider concessional loans, on a selective basis, to enable the necessary investments to 
Page  41
36 
generate growth.  To mitigate these risks, the Bank and the IMF will continue to provide 
support to the GoR for macroeconomic reforms and commitment to use market-based 
instruments to contain inflation and exchange rate appreciations.   
94. 
The global economic crisis began to affect Rwanda’s economy from early 2009
,
resulting in lower demands for exports, a slowdown in construction, deterioration in the 
balance of payments, in addition to reduced remittances, FDI, and foreign aid levels. This has 
adversely affected growth prospects for 2009-10 and can red
uce GoR’s potential to reach its 
EDPRS objectives. To mitigate this risk, GoR aims to continue implementing prudent and 
coordinated fiscal and monetary policies as well as structural reforms to improve private and 
financial sector performance and diversify the product and export base.   
 
95. 
Aid Provision and Predictability Risk. 
Given the high dependency on international 
assistance, particularly in the area of education, there is a risk that reduced or unpredictable aid 
flows could hinder the implementation of GoR policies and reduce the extent to which it can 
achieve its EDPRS objectives. The recent financial crisis poses a real threat to the global 
economy and could lead to a reduction in aid flow from developed countries. Nonetheless, 
improved coordination between GoR and donors and efforts of the GOR to prioritize on-
budget resources are examples of efforts to mitigate this risk. Although firm donor 
commitments to predictable aid flows are not forthcoming, donor attitudes are encouraging. 
Both budget support donors and GoR demonstrated their commitments by signing a MoU in 
September 2008 governing the provision of direct budget support in the implementation of 
Rwanda’s EDPRS. The potential non-approval of the proposed EFA-FTI CF Bridge Grant 
(representing roughly one percent of GDP and four percent of expenditures and net lending)
28
 
would leave Rwanda without essential resources to implement its programs and might 
discourage other development partners, particularly those providing support to the education 
sector, from allocating additional resources. Strong government commitment, GoR’s good 
performance with respect to improving access to education, and close donor coordination and 
harmonization mechanisms mitigate this risk. Local development partners have endorsed the 
application package for the Bridge Grant, and there is agreement on the general direction of the 
GoR education policies.  
96. 
Program Risks (1).
 Risks also relate to the implementation of the ESSP. First, the small 
number of staff in MINEDUC poses constraints to carry out the necessary policy formulation, 
capacity building, supervision, technical advice, and monitoring and evaluation functions that 
are required to implement the ESSP. The weak capacity at lower administrative and school 
levels also poses risks for the successful implementation of the government’s program. 
MINEDUC’s donor-funded Capacity Building and Institution Development Fund provides 
funding for essential capacity building activities based on a long-term capacity building plan 
and shorter-term implementation action plan for the sector, in the context of the ESSP. In 
2009-2010, the fund is likely to support capacity building activities in the areas of among 
others the decentralization of service delivery, the roll-out of child-friendly schools including 
improved teacher training, textbook provision and distribution reforms, and improved 
monitoring and evaluation through EMIS and the establishment of a Monitoring Learning 
Achievement system. This operation aims to support the government in the development and 
implementation of reforms that take into account capacity constraints and to help build 
capacity particularly at the central level. The government’s capacity to design reforms and 
guide their implementation is likely to be a central component of discussion between the 
government and development partners in the framework of the government’s application for 
the next three-year round of funding from the EFA-FTI CF.  
28
 Based on a US$3.3 billion economy expenditures and net lending of approximately one quarter of GDP.

97. 
Program Risks (2). 
Second, the GoR’s drive to improve the skills base of its labor force to 
facilitate economic growth and Rwanda’s transition to a knowledge-based value-added export 
economy has resulted in an increased focus on post-basic education. The government faces the 
challenge to pursue its objectives for both basic and post-basic education while facing capacity 
and financial constraints. One key challenge is determining the appropriate balance of 
resources allocated to basic and post-basic education, in particular TVET. With the support of 
development partners, including in particular the Bank, DFID and Germany’s Agency for 
Technical Cooperation (GTZ).  This is being done by developing a costed Post-Basic 
Education strategy which will feed into GOR’s revised Long Term Strategic Financing 
Framework by the end of the 2009 fiscal year. Both documents should serve to determine the 
most cost-efficient approaches to delivering post-basic education services, including TVET, 
and will help define an appropriate balance of financing between the various sub-sectors of the 
education system.

ANNEX 3: FUND RELATIONS NOTE  
 
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/14
 
February 6, 2009
 
On January 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
concluded the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.
1
Background
 
Over the past decade, Rwanda's economic performance has been strong, backed by sound 
macroeconomic and structural policies and substantial donor assistance. During this 
period, real GDP growth has been robust at 7 percent on average and inflation has been 
generally low. Rising revenues and assistance from international donors created fiscal 
space to scale up public spending, including on pro-poor initiatives. Rwanda qualified for 
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in 2005 and 
benefited from Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006, which significantly 
reduced its external debt. Rwanda's external position has strengthened with the aid flows, 
allowing an adequate reserve coverage of imports. 
Rwanda is advancing toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has made 
significant progress in achieving the objectives on universal primary education, gender 
equality and empowering of women, and reducing child mortality. Nonetheless, poverty 
remains pervasive. 
The Rwanda's macroeconomic policies have been supported by a three-year Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which was approved in June 2006. 
The program is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for 
stronger growth and poverty reduction. 
Policy implementation under the PRGF-supported program in 2008 has been satisfactory. 
Growth is expected to reach 8.5 percent, reflecting buoyant activity in the agriculture, 
manufacturing, construction, and services sectors. Nevertheless, inflation accelerated to 
double digits in the second half of the year, reflecting the impact of international 
commodity prices and expansion of domestic demand. The fiscal stance was tighter than 
envisaged in the first half of the year, largely reflecting strong revenue performance. The 
monetary program also remained broadly in line with the program. 
The authorities made good progress in implementing the structural reforms agenda. In 
particular, in the second half of 2008 the authorities finalized a medium-term action plan 
for the public financial management reform, the national payments strategy, designed to 
improve the payments infrastructure and address the development of basic payment 
services in Rwanda, and the debt management strategy, which sets the limits for external 
debt accumulation consistent with the medium-term fiscal policy objectives. 
Executive Board Assessment
 
Executive Directors commended the Rwandan authorities for implementing sound 
macroeconomic policies and important structural reforms over the past years. These 
policies and reforms helped achieve high economic growth, keep inflation relatively stable, 
and improve debt sustainability. 
Downside risks to the near-term economic outlook have increased because of the global 
financial crisis and economic slowdown. Also, poverty remains widespread, and social 
indicators lag behind those of many other African countries, despite high economic growth 
rates. Over the medium term, Directors emphasized that the main challenge will be to 
maintain high and broad-based economic growth and reduce persistent poverty, while 
pursuing macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. 
Directors considered the authorities' macroeconomic policy framework and structural 
reform agenda to be appropriate for tackling these challenges. They encouraged the 
authorities to implement cautious fiscal and monetary policies that would ease inflation 
and possible balance of payments pressures without stifling economic growth. Continued 
determined implementation of structural reforms will be important to raise investment 
rates, expand the private sector, deepen the financial sector, and diversify the production 
and export base. 
Page  51

Directors commended the authorities' prudent fiscal stance, which focuses on priority 
spending while containing inflationary pressures and keeping debt at a sustainable level. 
They observed that while Rwanda's revenue collection has improved, it is still relatively 
low. They encouraged the authorities to monitor revenue developments carefully, and to 
further enlarge the tax base and strengthen tax administration in order to reduce over 
time Rwanda's substantial aid dependence. Directors underscored the importance of 
improving public financial management and, in this regard, welcomed the efforts to 
improve the institutional framework for formulating and executing the public investment 
program. 
Executive Directors supported a scaling up of public investment in view of Rwanda's 
substantial development needs. They encouraged the authorities to rely on grants and 
highly-concessional loans for its financing in order to safeguard debt sustainability gains. 
In this respect, Directors welcomed the authorities' development of a comprehensive debt 
management strategy, which sets limits for loans and loan guarantees. They 
recommended that the debt strategy incorporate the fiscal risks associated with contingent 
liabilities, particularly those relating to planned public-private partnerships. Directors 
stressed that the financing of infrastructure projects should be consistent with a well-
prioritized medium-term expenditure framework. 
Directors noted that domestic demand pressures and higher world food and fuel prices led 
to an acceleration of inflation in the second half of 2008. Although recent signs of easing 
core inflation are encouraging, Directors supported the authorities' tight monetary stance 
to contain the second-round effects of the commodity price shocks. They recommended 
that steps be taken to raise interest rates to positive levels in real terms. They encouraged 
efforts to improve liquidity forecasting and management, particularly through better 
coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. 
Directors noted the staff assessment that the real exchange rate of the Rwandan franc is 
broadly in line with economic fundamentals, although rising inflation led to real 
appreciation pressures toward the end of 2008. In this context, they welcomed the 
authorities' commitment to increase nominal exchange rate flexibility and subordinate the 
foreign currency sales to monetary policy objectives. Directors underscored the importance 
of structural reforms and of the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks to safeguard 
Rwanda's external competitiveness. 
Directors commended the measures taken in recent years to strengthen the banking 
sector, including the passage of legislation in October 2008 to counter money laundering 
and terrorism financing. Noting that credit and operational risks remain high, Directors 
welcomed the central bank's intention to improve banking regulation and supervision. 
They looked forward to the timely implementation of the financial sector development 
plan. 
Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to promote private sector-led diversified 
growth and employment generation. They supported the reforms to improve the 
investment climate, and attached high priority to measures aimed at addressing land use 
and other structural problems that hinder agricultural development. They encouraged 
further trade integration with the East African Community. Given Rwanda's financing and 
capacity constraints, Directors underlined the importance of properly calibrating the scope, 
timing, and pace of reforms.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions 
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and 
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and 
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for 
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing 
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this 
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.
