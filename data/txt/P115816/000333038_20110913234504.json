This\n            led to a very short period for preparation although\n            government knew that a financing gap will occur, but the\n            Government did not know if it will be possible to get the\n            funds from FTI and under which rules.  Bank procedures which\n            are applied to trust-funded operations are almost similar to\n            those applied to fully Bank-funded operations, but their\n            weaknesses do become more evident when they are closely\n            scrutinized by third parties such as the trust fund\n            financiers or other development partners.
