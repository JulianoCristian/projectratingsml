INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Central African Republic (C.A.R.) for the equivalent
of US$3.9 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an education
project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.          Following a Bank reconnaissance mission in December 1969, a
UNESCO mission reviewed the educational objectives and priority needs of
the Central African Republic in June 1970. In February 1971, the Govern-
ment requested IDA assistance for an education project prepared in con-
junction with UNESCO. During appraisal in May 1971, it was found necessary
to modify the Governmentls original proposals, largely because of the
increase in current expenditures entailed. WflJith the Government's agreement,
the project was modified in order to limit the claim on the Government's
budget while still providing assistance for priority needs. Negotiations
with a delegation led by Mr. Frangois Pehoua, then Minister of Planning,
International Cooperation and Statistics, were completed on September 24,
1971. Presentation of the credit to the Board, originally scheduled for
late 1971, was deferred pending the outcome of consultations wibh the
Government on its deteriorating financial and budgetary situation and the
adoption of a stabilization program in agreement with the IMF.
3.          The proposed credit -ould be the first Bank Group assistance
for education and the third IDA operation in the C.A.R. (Annex I contains
a summary of IDA credits to C.A.R.). A $4.2 million credit (Credit 146-CA)
for the reconstruction of the Bangui - M?Balki road and a $4.3 million
credit (Credit 199-CA) for highway maintenance were signed in April 1969
and June 1970, respectively. Construction of the Bangui - MtBaili road is
on schedule,although there was some initial delay caused mainly by the
need to re-tender the work,following the devaluation of the French and
CFA francs in 1969. The Government has sometimes delayed in paying the
contractor, but payments are now being made regularly. It is expected
that construction will be completed by August 1972, wiell in advance of
the Closing Date of March 31, 1973. Considerable delay was experienced
in starting work on the Highway Maintenance project, because of tardiness
in establishing a Road Fund required under the Credit Agreement. 'When the
project was last supervised (October 1971), these problems had been
resolved, the maintenance contract had been awarded and progress was
satisfactory. To ensure successful implementation of the project, per-
formance and future planning under the highway maintenance program will be



reviewed dwring semi-anual meetings of a Coordinating Comndttee of represen-
tatives of the 3overrment, the consultants and the Association.
4.         'MThe main developnent potential in the C.A.R. lies in cotton,
coffee, live3tock, forestry and diAmond production. The main development
constraints lie in transportation and human resources.
5.          For a landlocked country of the size of the C.A.R., internal
road transportation and road and river transport links to the sea will
have to be expanded to exploit the country1 s potential to the fullest.
Accordingly, the most recent IDA credit (199-4A) contains funds for a
feasibility study and detailed engineering for the improvement of the
Bossembele - Bangui road; the consultantst feasibility report is nearing
completion. Increases in the capacity of the river fleet will be necessary
in line with improvements in river, port and rail facilities planned by
ATC (Agence Transcongolaise des Comnum.nications), the national transport
agency of the People's Republic of the Congo.
6.          The shortage of trained mnpower is a fundamental obstacle
to develo7ent in all fields and the C.A.R. is heaJvily dependent on expatriate
personnel in both the private and public sectors. The proposed education
project will support the Government's long-term objective of reducing this
dependence and in so doing will make an important contribution to overcoming
the human resource constraint on development.
7.          Following the two credits for road development and the current
education project, the Bank Groupts activities will Locus increasingly on
agriculture anda livestock. In agriculture, a start has been made in the
identification of a cotton project, a ranch project, and a project aimed
at improving stock routes between the C.A.R. and Chad. The Bank is also
considering a Government request for assistance in developing a second
power plant on the N'Bali River, in view of the anticipated shortages of
electric power in Bangui, the capital. The pace of future IDA lending will
be determined from time to time in the light of the Government's progress
in restoring the public finance   situation (see para 10).
8.          The C.A.R. Governxent has undertaken a series of nationalizations.
The dates of nationalization and status of settlement are as follows:
(a) SociAtS Equatoriale drEnergie Electrigue (SEEE) in 1967.
An agreement has been reached;
(b) Union Electriqu.e dTOutre Her (UNELCO) in 1967.
The Government recognized the principle of compensation, but
settlement has not been reached on the evaluation of the
assets; we understand that the Government has recently con-
tacted UBIMWO;
(c) Aence Trans6auatoriale des Communications (ATEC) in 1969.
The Government withdrew from the convention establishing
the ATEC, a multi-national trwnsport agency jointly established



with the Congo, Gabon, and Chad. The Government took over ATEC Is
transport facilities located on its territory and set up a
national agency, Agence Centrafricaine des Communications
Fluviales (ACCF), to run them. ACCF is continuing transport
services to the former ATEC partners under a series of bilateral
agreements which have led to satisfactory cooperation;
(d) Compagnie Generale des Transports en Afrique Equatoriale (CGTAE)
in 1969.
4iile withdrawing from ATEC, the Governments of the C.A.R.
and Congo nationalized CGTAE. Agreement was reached in December
1971;
(e) Diamond Distributors Incorporated in 1969.
All diamond mines in the C.A.R. were closed by the Government
following a dispute over mining rights. Agreement was reached
in March 1972 between the Government and Diamond Distributors
Incorporated resulting in the formation of a joint company.
The Bank will continue to follow closely progress in the settlement of the
outstanding dispute.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
9.          The last economic mission visited the C.A.R. in 1969, and report
AW16a, "The Economy of the Central African Republic", was distributed to
the Board on May 22, 1970. Since then, we have monitored the economic and
financial situation with the help of several short missions, the latest
being in March 1972 when, at our initiative and including Bank participation,
a special IWF mission visited the country (see para 12).
10.         Our main concern recently has been with the growing deterioration
in the C.A.R.'s financial and budgetary condition. This reached a point
where, by late 1971, we felt the need for a full review of public finances
and assurances about improvements before we could process further IDA credits,
including the education credit now prcposed.
11.         Between 1967 and 1970, revenues rose at a 6% annual rate,
probably in excess of the growth in GDP. In 1971, the Government had some
success in stepping up tax collections, but revenues grew by only 5% , and
expenditures, mainly for personnel and for purposes not closely related to
development, rose by over 16%, compared to an annual increase of 10 in
1967/70. The result has been a continuously growing deficit. Thus, for
1971, the overall deficit amounted to CFAF 3.0 billion, equivalent to 27%
of budgetary receipts, By the end of 1971 accumulated arrears in payments
amounted to some CFAF 8 billion. If no reform had taken place in 1972,
the consolidated deficit of the Government and state enterprises might
have reached some CFAF 6 billion in FY-72. This situation was in large part
due to the system of budgetary management under which Government agencies
frequently placed orders without proper authorization.



- 4 -
12.         The Government had introduced a program of austerity measures
in 1970, including a freeze on new personnel recruitment (with some excep-
tions), reductions in scholarships, limitation on expenditures for repre-
sentation abroad and elimination of official cars. However, this decree,
still valid in 1971, was not always enforced and did not produce the
expected results. By October 1971, the Treasury had virtually exhausted its
liquid resources. Borrowing from the Central Bank had reached the statutory
limit. In an effort to meet its monthly wage bill, the Government stopped
payment on all non-personnel expenditures. The Government subsequently
requested that an fMF mission visit the C.A.R. to draw up a financial
rehabilitation program. This mission, with which we cooperated closely,
has now produced a stabilization program (described below), which has the
approval of the Government. Measures are currently underway to implement
the program.
13.         Under the new stabilization program decided upon by the
Government, receipts in the current fiscal year are to be increased by
CFAF 1.9 billion, and expenditures are to be cut by CFAF 1.3 billion. The
main increases in receipts are expected from a doubling of the average
additional tax on imports,which is expected to yield CFAF 700 million
more in revenues, a doubling of the turnover tax on enterprises,to yield
another OFAF 450 million,and improved collection of arrears,to yield
CFAF 500 million over the budgeted figure.
14.         Expenditures are to be reduced for state employees, embassies,
and government construction. The deficit of the state enterprises is to be
eliminated by terminating an airplane lease, cancelling the order for a
hospital ship and increasing prices charged by state transport and marke-
ting agencies. As a result of these measures, the current budget is
expected to show a surplus of CFAF 1.1 billion, and the overall treasury
position, excluding debt payments, will be in balance.
15.         Arrangements have been made for the payment of current debts
and for funding part of the arrears, in the amount of some CFAF 1.6 billion
during 1972, compared with payments of OFAF 530 million in 1971.
16.         Negotiations are underway with the French Caisse Centrale
de Cooperation Economique for payment of some CFAF 250 million of arrears
and CFAF 348 million falling due in 1972. The Central Bank has been asked
to raise the ceiling on advances to the Government temporarily from 10
to 15% of the previous yearts budget receipts, which would yield about
CFAF 500 million. Foreign budgetary assistance is to be requested for the
remaining CFAF 1.1 billion of financing needed in 1972. Local private
suppliers are to receive negotiable 3% treasury bonds payable in 3 yearly
tranches for the amounts owed them.
17.         These first steps are to be followed by a review of the tax
system, the budgetary procedures and control mechanisms, and financial
administration. The Government has requested the services of a financial
adviser and a tax expert from the DIF to assist in carrying out the
policies and measures contained in the program.



18.         Now that measures are under,zay to restore the C.A.R.'s
public finances, a new effort can be made to exploit the country's develop-
ment potential. The C.A.R. has fairly good natural resources. Ecological
conditions are favorable to the development of agriculture and, to some
extent, of livestock. Forestry and mining, especially diamonds, offer
good possibilities for export diversification. Agriculture continues to
be the most important activity, contributing some 30% of the gross domestic
product. The lack of direct access to the sea is a serious handicap. The
sole practical route is the 1,800 km river and rail route (Transequatorial
Route) from Bangui, the capital, to Pointe Noire in the Congo.
19.         The money economy is small, providing wage earning employment
for less than 5% of the population. The bulk of the population still lives
in the subsistence sector, although some of them are also engaged in dia-
mond digging. Cotton and coffee are tbhe main cash crops,accounting for
about 23% each of foreign exchange earnings. Diamond exports account for
about 40% of total exports, but production has declined in recent years
because of calflicts with the mining companies, wshich have however been
settled recently. Large areas have been reserved for diamond exploration
by the joint company (see para 8) and the outlook for diamonds is once
again promising. Timber exports provide 5% of foreign exchange earnings
and prospects are favorable. Timber output rose from 280,000 m3 in 1970
to 309,000 mv in 1971, and a further rise may be expected, assuming
improvements are made in the road and river transport systems.
20.         In 1969-1970 a real growth rate in GDP of 3 - 4% was recorded.
However, due in part to a drought, coffee and cotton output declined in
1971, and economic growth in that year was negligible. Coffee production
in the 1970/71 season was probably about 10,000 tons compared to soine
12,000 tons harvested in 1969/70, and is expected to decline to some 6,000
to 8,000 tons in 1971/72. Cotton production fell to 54,000 tons in 1970/71
from a high of 59,000 tons in 1969/70 and is expected to fall further to
about 50,000 tons in 1971/72. Shortages of meat and foodstuffs were reported
last year.
21.         Management deficiencies are an important reason for these
declines in production, particularly since the departure of large numbers
of expatriate personnel late in 1970. Progress in cotton, coffee and
livestock will therefore depend, in part, on the ability of the Government
to provide competent staff in sufficient numbers for extension services,
research and administration.
22.         The 1971-1975 development plan, now in the process of prepara-
tion, foresees investment outlays of CFAF 78 billion, of which 68% are
to be public and 32% private. The financing plan for public investment
assumes that CFAF 17 billion will come from budgetary surpluses and public
institution funds, including the Development Bank and the Stabilization
Funds, CFAF 12 billion from external public loans and CFAF 19 billion
from external public grants, leaving about 5 billion remaining to be found
from external sources. The planned sectoral distribution of investment
outlays is as follows: production (65%), transport and communications (20%),
administrative and social equipment (14%) and general studies and statistics
(1%).

23.         In view of the Government's tight financial position and
past experience on foreign aid commitments and disbursements, this plan
appears to be too ambitious. It is unlikely that public savings can reach
CFAF 17 billion over the next four years and foreign aid commitments
would probably not exceed CFAF 2 to 3 billion annually, although the
plans of major aid sources are not known. Furthermore, the absorptive
capacity of certain key sectors, such as agriculture and animal husbandry,
is now limited by the absence of technical personnel. Further, private
investment will probably fall short of the planned CFAF 25 billion in
view of excess capacity in the industrial sector.
24.         The C.A.R.ts balance of payments has deteriorated since 1967.
Despite the recorded increase in agricultural production and exports, the
current account has always been in deficit, reflecting the rise in imports
and the fall in diamond exports. Up to 1968, this deficit was offset
largely by a net inflnow of public and private capital. In recent years,
because of the deterioration of the financial and economic situation,
private companies have shown a strong tendency to transfer funds abroad.
As a result, the balance of payments had a deficit of CFAF 1.68 billion
in 1969 and CFAF 0.77 billion in 1970, not-withstanding an SDR allocation
equivalent to CFAF 0.44 billion. Data on the 197. balance of payments
is not yet available but, in view of the improvement in the net foreign
asset position, there are reasons to believe that it will show a surplus.
This reversal is explained by a sharp decline in imports and an increase
in export receipts, mostly from timber exports, the run-down of cotton
stocks during the second half of 1971, and the utilization in February
1971 of the IMF gold tranche equivalent to CFAF 0.37 billion. The measures
adopted for the financial rehabilitation program are also expected to
help to gradually improve   the negative net external asset position.
25.         During the period 1964 - 1970,the C.A.R. received a total of
CFAF 15.0 billion in external aid of which 80% or CFAF 12.0 billion was
in the form of grants. This does not include French technical assistance,
which is estimated at COAF 1.3 billion annually. The largest sources of
aid were France and the European Development Fund, which accounted for
50% and 35g, respectively, of the total aid extended to the C.A.R. over
the seven-year period. 14ost of tlhe aid was used for financing agricultural
development, infrastructure and education.
26.         The C.A.R. external public debt outstanding as of December 31,
1969, amounted to US$29.1 million. The ratio of debt service payments to
export of goods and services was 3.9% in 1969 and 4.3% in 1970. In addition,
the country has not paid part of its debt service in recent years. These
debt arrears will be paid in the next couple of years, and will thus
increase the debt service ratio. 3ecause of the country3s poverty and
public finance limitations, the Government should seek to obtain future
assistance,so far as possible,on concessionary terms, covering a high
proportion of total project costs.



- 7 -
PART III - THE SECTOR
27.         As stated above (para 6), human resource development con-
stitutes a major constraint. The population of about 1.6 million is in-
creasing by about 2.4% per annum. About 70% of the economically active
population is in the subsistence sector, mainly agriculture, and wage
employment in the modern sector is estimated at only about 50,000. The
training of Central African extension workers is a condition for the
improvement of extension services and the successful implementation of
projects in agriculture and animal husbandry.
28.         Industry, which contributes about 16% of GDP, relies heavily
on expatriate management and skills; about 75% of professional and techni-
cal positions, 2VS of middle-level supervisory posts, and 17% of semi-skil-
led posts are filled by expatriates. As mary as half of the small indus-
trial enterprises (employing 10-20 people) and almost all enterprises
employing more than 20 workers are foreign-owined. Because of the relative-
ly high cost of expatriate manpower and the low interest rates, industrial
investment tends to be capital-intensive. The Government's objective is
to replace all foreigners occupying middle-level positions in industry
and commerce by 1980.
29.         In recent years the quantitative grouth of the education
system has been very rapid at the primary level, where erfrollment now
covrers about 73%t of the relevant age group. This growTth has had an adverse
effect on the quality of education and has substantially increased the
claims of the education sector on Government resources. Secondary school
enrollment represents 4% of the relevant age group. Most of the curriculum
development and planning is carried out by expatriates. Only about 23%
of the primary school teachers are qualified according to the GovernmentTs
standards. In secondary and technical education, almost all teachers are
expatriate.
30.         The principal aim of the educational system should be to
provide trained manpower for economic development and the replacement of
expatriates at a cost within the financial capacity of the country. To
achieve this goal, the expansion of the primary school enrollment should
be restrained while enrollment in secondary education should increase and
more emphasis should be put on science and practical subjects.
31.         The Government intends to prepare a long-term educational
plan. It has already made the following decisions:
(a) to limit primary enrollment expansion to 3% a year;
(b) to rationalize secondary education by introducing a
broader curriculum in the lower cycle;
(c) to strengthen science teaching by concentrating the
upper cycle courses in certain lyc6es;
(d) to improve technical and commercial training;



- 8 -
(e) to replace the expatriate teachers gradually, starting
with the costly contract teachers;
(f) to establish a National Institute of Pedagogy, mainly by
merging existing institutions; and
(g) to start schools of engineering and medicine in the
university.
\,lhile the plans for the National Institute of Pedagogy and for the
university need further study, the policy decisions concerning primary,
secondary, technical and teacher education are sound; when implemented
they would improve the quality of education and help to meet manpower
needs with minimum additional expenditure.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.         A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in the
Central African Republic" (PE-34a),dated Nlarch 27, 1972, is being distri-
buted separately. A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III
to this report. The main objective of the proposed project is to assist
the Government in the implementation of its educational policy (described
in para 31 above), by preparing a long-term educational development plan,
providing lowier secondary school facilities for a broader curriculum,
adding facilities for science and practical subjects to the existing
lycees, improving facilities for technical and commercial courses, and
establishing a college to train secondary school teachers.
33.         The project comprises the following items:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of four new low^Jer
secondary schools and extension of an existing one -- for
2,850 additional students, including the provision of
boarding facilities and staff housing;
(b) provision of additional facilities for science and
practical subjects in four lyce4es -- to increase their
capacity by about 380 students;
(c) extension of the technical lyc6e -- to accommodate an
additional 150 students;
(d) construction of a new secondary teacher training college
for about 150 students;
(e) provision of technical assistance for project implementatiox
and the preparation of a long-term educational development
plan.
34.         Project cost is estimated at about $5.4 million, including
$1.1 million in duties and taxes. The estimated foreign exchange component
is $2.8 million, or 52%, of the total cost. The proposed credit of $3.9
million would cover foreign exchange costs plus about $1.1 million of



- 9 -
local costs, i.e. 72% of the total costs or 89% of total costs net of
duties and taxes. The Government contribution of $1.5 million, or 26%
of the $5.4 million total, would cover local expenses, including duties
and taxes; in addition, the Government would carry increased recurrent
costs of about $0.7 million annually after completion of the proposed
project.
35.         The cost of construction could be substantially lower if
it proved practicable to use local timber instead of brick and concrete.
However, the use of timber for school buildings in the C.A.R. is still
in tlle experimental stage. Assurances have been given by the Government
that the project architect will review the possibilities of using timber
for civil works and his report will be sent to the Association for comments
within six months of his appointment.
36.         The new facilities to be provided in the lower secondary
schools would allow the introduc-bion of a well-balanced curriculum with
practical subjects, including home economics, commerce, elements of
agriculture and "technology", that is simple metalwork, woodwork, and
electricity, with some teclnical drawing based, as far as possible, on
everyday objects within tlhe pupilts own experience. The Government wished
to give a practical orientation to the new courses but the technology
course it proposed appeared to be too theoretical. The Government has
therefore agreed to revise the syllabus of the technology courses and
to submitG itto the Association for review wiithin one year of signing the
Credit Agreement.
37.         The additional facilities for science and practical subjects
in the lycees -.rould enable the education system to offer the curriculum,
mentioned in para 36 in the lowxTer cycle. In the upper cycle, the project
would reduce the present imbalance between the arts and science streams by
properly equipping the lycee Boganda in Bangui and the lycees at Bambari
and Berberati for science teaching. In these three institutions, where
the upper secondary science streams are to be concentrated, two science
(natural and physical) baccalaur4ats would be established.
38.         The technical lycee would be expanded and provided with
additional equipment to conduct terminal courses for mechanical, electrical.
and civil engineering technicians and for accountants and secretaries.
The project would re-equip the existing workshops and construct new
facilities.
39.         The Secondary School Teachers Training College (Ecole Normale
Superieure - ENS) with a total capacity of 150 students, would provide
a three-year training course for the lowrer level secondary schoolteachers.
4hen an adequate number of entrants with a baccalaureat degree became
available, the course would be reduced to two years and the output would
increase from 40 to 50.per annum. In cooperation erith the technical lycge,
the ENS would then also train teachers in practical subjects. A lower
cycle secondary school, C.E.G. (College d'Enseignement General), for 400
students would be built on the campus of the EN' to serve as a teaching



- 10 -
practice school. The projected output of the ENS would permit the
complete replacement of expatriate teachers in the lower secondary
school cycle in the early 1980s. The Government has agreed to finalize
a plan for the training of teachlers of practical, technical, and commercial
subjects within one year of signing the Credit Agreemenit and send it to
the Association for comment.
40.         For the proper operation of the upper secondary cycle, most
of the teachers required would be provided under bilateral technical
assistance programs. As more qualified Central African teachers become
available, expatriates would be replaced.
41.         For the proper operation of the ENS, 13 teachers would be
required by 1975. These would be recruited from Central Africans studying
abroad. The Government has given assurances that more qualified Central
Africans would be appointed as they became available. An adequate number
of qualified and experienced teachers covering all disciplines (at least
15 persons, including the principal) would be made available to ensure
the proper functioning of the ENS.
42.         To assist in the preparation of a long-term educational plan,
the project would provide for the services of an education economist for
one year to advise the Government on the financing of education and on
cost-saving measures.
43.         A project unit would be established in the Ministry of
Education to provide overall supervision of the project and liaison with
the Association. A project director, an architect and a procurement
officer, all acceptable to the Association, would be appointed on a
full-time basis. Establishment of the project unit and the appointment of
the project director and architect would be a condition of effectiveness
of the Credit Agreement. The project unit would be provided with adequate
supporting staff, including an accountant. The salaries of the project
unit personnel and the operational expenditures of the unit would be
included in the estimated project cost.
44.         Design and supervision of civil works would be the responsibi-
lity of a consulting firm of architects selected and commissioned on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association. Contracts for civil works,
furniture and equipment would be awarded in accordance with the Bank/IDA
Guidelines for Procurement. In the C.A.R. there are a few large and
competitive construction firms, mostly headed by foreigners, capable of
carrying out the project. It is unlikely that contractors not already
operating in the country would bid for civil works. It is expected that
instructional equipment would be procured abroad and furniture in the
C.A.R. or other member countries of the Central African Customs Union
(UDEAC). Manufacturers of furniture' in these countries would be allowed
