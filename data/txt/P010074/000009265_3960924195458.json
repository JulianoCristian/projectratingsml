The International\n            Development Association (IDA) must be commended for its\n            significant contribution to the sector outside the two\n            projects through its assistance and support to the Nepal\n            Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) in resisting a proposal\n            by a well known private telecommunications operating company\n            for take over of international telecommunications operations\n            in Nepal from NTC. The completion of both projects was\n            substantially delayed by about four years. In general, the\n            two projects achieved the basic objective of establishing an\n            integrated modern telecommunications network in Nepal on\n            which NTC could further develop adequate and efficient\n            telecommunications services to meet the national needs, both\n            for the \"plain old telephone service\" for the\n            general public and enhanced voice and non voice services by\n            its business and government customers."}, "docdt": "1989-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
