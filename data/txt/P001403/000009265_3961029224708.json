economic growth and the government's poverty\n            reduction strategy through: 1) developing the government\n            capacity to regularly maintain the whole classified road\n            network by the year 2000, and upgrade priority roads to\n            improved serviceability standards; 2) improving access to\n            isolated areas and basic services in district centers by\n            facilitating road traffic, and lowering transport costs; 3)\n            further developing the emerging private local road\n            construction and maintenance industry, using mainly\n            labor-based methods to generate productive employment; and\n            4) strengthening the planning, implementation and management\n            capacity of the Road Sector agencies, through policy and\n            institutional reforms and capacity building support. The\n            project will finance three major components over the July\n            1996 to March 2001 period: 1) a civil works program focusing\n            on maintenance, and including the rehabilitation of sections\n            of the roads branch and labor construction unit network, and\n            selected upgrading of selected priority roads; 2) design\n            engineering and supervision services in support of the\n            program; and 3) sector institutional reform and capacity\n            building, including logistical support to the Ministry of Works."}, "docdt": "1996-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
