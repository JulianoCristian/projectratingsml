Education Sector\n            Development Policy Credit will be the first in a second\n            series of three development policy credits to support the\n            Government of Punjab's Education Sector Reform Program\n            (PESRP) which has entered its second phase. The operation\n            will provide continued support to an ongoing reform program\n            which is being deepened and carried forward by a government\n            that has demonstrated its commitment, ownership, and a good\n            track record. The objectives of the Project are to improve\n            performance and quality of school education to improve\n            student learning outcomes; improve school participation and\n            retention rates; and reduce gender and regional disparities\n            (grades 1 - 10). The operation is based on the reform\n            program's three pillars: a) enhance fiscal\n            sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i)\n            ensure that public expenditure continues to be increased for\n            education at both provincial and district levels in\n            accordance with sector needs; (ii) strengthen the\n            districts' financing capacity and ensure that adequate\n            resources are transferred to districts to meet education\n            needs; (iii) increase transparency of financial management\n            and procurement processes and practices; and (iv) strengthen\n            provincial and district capacities to monitor financial\n            flows; b) increase equitable access to education and improve\n            the quality and relevance of education. Access agenda\n            focuses on programs to: (i) increase participation,\n            retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and\n            (ii) encourage the participation of private sector. The\n            quality agenda seeks to: (i) improve school performance and\n            student learning outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of\n            learning through better teaching practices, better textbooks\n            and a credible examination system; and c) improve public\n            education sector governance and management to: (i)\n            strengthen sector planning and policy development capacity\n            of the provincial education department; (ii) strengthen\n            district education departments' management and\n            monitoring capacity; (iii) strengthen monitoring and\n            evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv)\n            enhance school based management, and monitoring of school\n            performance by communities."}, "docdt": "2007-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
