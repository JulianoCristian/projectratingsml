"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fourth Punjab Education\n            Development Policy Credit (PEDPC) Project for Pakistan were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: sustained\n            sector improvement requires higher level alignment at both\n            political and bureaucratic levels and overall enabling\n            fiscal and fiduciary frameworks. Lessons from PEDPC have\n            confirmed that leadership and political championship are\n            critical for successful implementation of sustainable\n            reforms. Complementary non-lending analytical and advisory\n            support and sustained dialogue is essential. Bank engagement\n            at the highest political levels played a key role in\n            supporting the new government in implementing improvements\n            in sector governance. At the same time, technical inputs\n            from Bank staff through, for example, analytical reports and\n            a variety of just-in-time policy and technical assistance\n            notes supported design and implementation. Given the\n            educational context in Pakistan, it is important to\n            simultaneously address the issues of school access and\n            quality. Without quality, access may start showing a\n            downward trend over time. There is deeper coordination\n            required between putting children in schools and ensuring\n            that schools are the learning places that can contribute to\n            children's development. Systematic communication can\n            play a key role in ensuring wider understanding and\n            ownership. Strategic communications can increase\n            understanding among the general public, media and civil\n            society, local communities as well as internal stakeholders\n            such as teachers or other employees. This involves two way\n            communications and extensive consultations. An outcome of\n            such communication and creation of wide ownership was the\n            continuation of Punjab Education Sector Reform Program\n            (PESRP) when the leadership and government of the province\n            underwent a change. Focused and consistent messages in the\n            government and World Bank dialogue can be critical to\n            ensuring continued implementation progress even after\n            project preparation and approval."}, "docdt": "2009-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
