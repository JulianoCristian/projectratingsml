MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on India
Rihand Power Transmission Prolect (Loan 2555-IN)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on India - Rihand Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2555-IN)" prepared by the South Asia Region. Part II
was prepared by the Borrower.
The US$250.0 million loan increased the transmission grid between the
National Thermal Power Company (NTPC) and the regional power companies.
Disbursements reached US$185.9 million and the balance was canceled after three
extensions.  In 1991 a power transmission company took over the fixed assets
created under the project.
After revision in scope, all project components were implemented
albeit with substantial delays. The re-estimated economic rate of return was 111
(not directly comparable with the initial figure because of the change in scope).
The project generated additional benefits (i.e., transfer of technology,
industrial production of high-voltage equipments, streamlining of procurement
procedures,  spin off of transmission activities  to a new company).   NTPC
maintained its good financial health in spite of persistent problems in bill
collection from the State Electricity Boards.
The PCR gives a thorough account of project preparation and
implementation which was mostly uneventful except for the initial delays.
Overall, the project is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and
its institutional impact as substantial.
A recent audit of five NTPC projects (OED Report No. 10854) postponed
the need to audit this project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2555-IN)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rihand Power
Transmission Project, for which Loan 2555-IN in the amount of US$250.0 million
was approved on May 28, 1985. The loan was made to India, acting by its
President, for on-lending to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).
The original loan closing date of December 31, 1989, was extended three times
and the loan was closed on December 31, 1992. On December 5, 1991, an amount
of US$48 million of savings was cancelled from the loan account. The loan was
closed on December 31, 1992; disbursements were completed on May 12, 1993. On
July 15, 1993, US$7,279,424.78 (the balance in the Special Account) were
refunded by the Government of India (GOI). Then US$16,090,946.84 remaining
undisbursed in the loan account were cancelled effective July 15, 1993. Thus
disbursements under the Loan were US$185,909,053.16.
On August 16, 1991, the management of the project (operation and
maintenance of the assets in service and implementation of those still under
construction) was transferred from NTPC to the National Power Transmission
Corporation (NPTC), the newly established utility responsible for transmission
and grid operations, under a Management Contract signed between the two
Corporations. NPTC was later named Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.
(POWERGRID). On January 8, 1993, an Ordinance providing for all the rights,
titles and other interests related to the transmission systems of NTPC and two
other centrally-owned utilities , to be transferred to POWERGRID, with
effect from April 1, 1992, was promulgated by the President of India. At the
time of preparation of this PCR, the Bank was in the process of finalizing the
modifications on the Development Credit, Loan and Project Agreements to
formalize the transfer of the Bank loans and IDA credits from NTPC and NHPC to
POWERGRID retroactively with effect from April 1, 1992. With regard to Loan
2555-IN, assets and liabilities for about US$6.2 million remained with NTPC
and assets and liabilities for about US$179.7 million have been transferred to
POWERGRID. The amounts will be finalized after accounts between NTPC and
POWERGRID are settled.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Operations Division of the
Country Department II (India) of the South Asia Regional Office, and by NTPC
and POWERGRID. The former prepared the Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts
I and III of the PCR, while the implementing agencies prepared Part II.
Preparation of Parts I and III of the PCR was based on information
in the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements, and material
on the project in Bank files and that provided by NTPC and POWERGRID. The
preparation was also based on discussions with some of the Bank staff who were
involved with the project and the officials of the Government of India (GOI),
NTPC, POWERGRID and the project beneficiaries (i.e., State Electricity Boards)
during a PCR mission to India in February 1993.

RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2555-IN)
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
The objectives of the project were: (a) to meet the electricity
demand in the Northern Region by providing the transmission linkage between
the thermal power generation plants in the Singrauli-Rihand complex in the
south east of the region and the main load centers of the western parts of the
region; and (b) to ensure the evacuation of power from these plants at least
cost to the economy. The project was also to serve as a vehicle for the
introduction of a new technology (long distance HVDC links) needed for the
expansion and reinforcement of EHV transmission grid. As in the previous
Bank-financed projects with NTPC, another objective was to improve, in the
long run, the operational, institutional and financial performance of the
State Electricity Boards (SEBs), by assisting in the development of a
financially sound, and technically and institutionally competent centrally-
owned power utility which would serve as a model to SEBs (Part I, para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
NTPC (and since August 1991, POWERGRID) successfully implemented
the project, albeit with substantial delays. Implementation of the HVDC
components took over a year and half longer than that envisaged because of
delays in obtaining environmental clearance for a section of the transmission
line which had to pass through a forest and fire damage (and subsequent
replacement of damaged parts) to HVDC terminal at Rihand during the testing of
the terminal. Implementation of the 400 kV transmission lines and substations
was completed generally some nine months later than envisaged because of
project revision, slow mobilization of one of the contractors, and long time
taken to evaluate the bids. Construction of the transmission line extension
from Panipat to Malerkotla and the associated substation (which were
subsequently added to the project) were completed in July 1992. At appraisal,
all the project components were scheduled to be commissioned by December 1988.
At the time the Bank closed the loan on December 31, 1992, the project was not
completed. Supplies and works amounting to US$7.6 million remained - these
expenditures are being funded under Loan 3577-IN (Part I, paras. 5.2, 5.3 and
5.10).
Results
Overall, the project achieved its objectives. The project has
been a major component in the establishment of centrally owned regional grids
and intra-regional connections. The power transmission capacity from the
Singrauli-Rihand-Vindhyachal complex to the western parts of the Northern



- iii -
Region has been increased in a manner which helps optimal utilization of the
installed thermal capacity in the said coal-fired power plants complex, by
transmitting over a very long distance large amounts of power with minimum
transmission losses. The project also helped NTPC (since August 1991,
POWERGRID) to get acquainted with the HVDC technology (Part I, para. 7.1).
The project contributed in making NTPC an efficient utility but
failed in its sectoral objective in inducing improvements in the operational,
institutional and financial performance of SEBs (Part I, para. 7.1).
NTPC's financial rate of return on historically valued net fixed
assets declined from a high 171 in FY86 and FY87 to 15% in FY92 against the
covenanted rate of return of 9.5%. The IERR for the project as implemented
was estimated at 8.2% (Part I, paras. 8.1 and 10.2).
Sustainability
The project is sustainable, even though at present its main
component (i.e., the Rihand-Delhi Area HVDC link) is not yet being fully
utilized. Sustainability will be assured with the strengthening of the
transmission ring around metropolitan Delhi and growth in power demand. It is
certainly assured for the future, as the facilities built under the project
are integral components of POWERGRID'S system development program (Part I,
para. 10.1).
However, insufficient generation and transmission tariffs and an
unchecked increase of NTPC's and POWERGRID's accounts receivable could
endanger such sustainability. The Bank, GOI, NTPC and POWERGRID have been
taking actions to avoid such occurrence (paras. 8.1 - 8.7).
Findings and Lessons Learned
Major findings are as follows:
a) The project was not completely finalized when the Bank approved
it. This fact is clearly demonstrated by the subsequent revision
of the description (Part I, paras. 5.1 and 5.2);
b) The project contributed to the enhancement of NTPC's (later
POWERGRID's) expertise in the area of high voltage transmission,
created employment of local labor and helped to the development of
local manufacturing industry (Part I, paras. 5.5 and 5.6);
c) The average time taken from bid opening to the award of the
contract (including Bank acceptance of the proposed award) was
about ten months, in some cases over a year. In an effort to
speed up procurement, standard bidding documents will in future be
used by NTPC and POWERGRID. They would also give further emphasis
to finishing promptly the payments for the contracts, so that the
closing dates of new loan(s) would not need to be extended (Part
I, para. 5.7);



- iv -
d)  In addition to the conventional financial rate of return (ROR) on
average historic fixed assets in operation, a covenant about
NTPC's accounts receivable was introduced for the first time under
the project. This covenant immediately focussed on NTPC's
principal difficulties and poor bill collection was the only area
where NTPC's performance fell considerably short of expectations
(Part I, paras. 8.2, 8.6 and 12.2);
e)  GOI interventions through the central appropriations helped NTPC
resolve, albeit for limited periods, its accounts receivable
problem. These interventions aimed at having NTPC operate
efficiently, thus keep the electric energy supply in the country
at an adequate level. It is doubtful that GOI's actions have led
to SEBs improving their operational efficiency and their billing
and collection procedures and practices. What is equally
important, but so far received little attention, is the need for
energy conservation on the customer (SEBs) side through adoption
of appropriate tariffs and tariff structure at SEBs and through
end-use efficiencies (Part I, para. 8.4);
f)  Another appropriate covenant would have been a cash generation
covenant, e.g. "contribution towards investment" which would have
also highlighted the deterioration in NTPC's performance (Part I,
para. 8.6); and
g)  Bank's position (only partially shared by GOI) is that electricity
industry provides a service which has to be fully paid through
user-charges. The perception of the State Governments and SEBs,
perhaps for political reasons, is that provision of electricity is
partly a social service. The transfer of funds to NTPC through
central appropriations is but another subsidy (whether it comes
from GOI or from SEB), and not a direct payment through tariffs
(Part I, para. 12.4).
Major lessons learned from this project are summarized below:
a)  As a precondition for further Bank loans, more emphasis should be
given to improving the commercial arrangements between NTPC and
its clients. However, this has proved to be difficult to achieve
in practice unless the financial performance of the SEBs is
improved (Part I, para. 12.4);
b)  To enable NTPC to operate on a purely commercial basis, GOI should
allow NTPC to sell to other customers the allocated shares of the
SEBs which do not comply with their agreements with NTPC. In
cases where technical reallocation (by limiting availability of
power to a particular SEB) cannot be implemented, commercial
reallocation can be done. This can be done by limiting
allocations to a defaulting SEB and charging a stiff penalty for
drawals exceeding the reduced allocation (Part I, para. 12.2); and



- v -
c) As a result of the changes in the overall economic policy
environment within which NTPC is operating, its financial policies
need orientation. Under the circumstances, it would be
appropriate to change the existing rate of return covenant into a
self financing ratio covenant, because it would not only provide a
better monitoring mechanism for NTPC's financial performance, but
also provide better support to NTPC towards meeting its
development challenges (Part I, para. 8.6).
The lessons drawn from this and previous projects implemented by
NTPC have been used in the preparation, appraisal and negotiations of the NTPC
Power Generation Project, which was approved on June 29, 1993:
a) GOI has adopted new investment and commercial policies and
electricity tariffs allowing NTPC to shut-off or restrict power
supply if its clients are in default with their bulk supply
agreements. These policies are designed to introduce better
commercial discipline at SEBs, along with improving NTPC's own
operational and financial performance, including improving revenue
collection (para. 12.3);
b)  NTPC has agreed with the Bank on an internal cash generation
covenant (para. 8.6);
c) GOI established POWERGRID to: (i) improve the efficiency in power
transmission and systems operations, through an extensive
restructuring of the transmission sector; and (ii) complement its
policy initiatives to encourage private generation and competition
in power generation (para. 2.6); and
d) The Bank and NTPC agreed on standard bidding documents whose use
would curtail the procurement period (para. 5.7).
The last two points were also taken into account under Loan 3577-
IN for the POWERGRID System Development Project.

2.  Pro-ect Background
2.1         In India, the responsibility for electricity supply is shared
constitutionally between the Government of India (GOI) and the states. In
addition, India is one of the few developing countries with a vibrant, if
small, private sector presence in public power supply. At independence,
private utilities and licensed local authorities, located in urban areas,
provided about 80% of public electricity supply. GOI opted to embark on an
ambitious electrification program to support the development of power-
intensive industries for a rapid industrial development and expansion of
irrigation. The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 (the Act) created the state
electricity boards (SEBs) and entrusted the state governments and the boards
with primary responsibility for public power supply. The coordination of
SEBs' activities within the national power development policy, and the
formulation of longer-term plans for power development is the responsibility
of Central Electricity Authority (CEA), established in 1950.
2.2         Between 1960 and 1980, power demand grew twice as fast as the
economy, and the generating capacity increased almost five-fold from about
5,600 MW to about 32,000 MW. Yet, for the entire period the country faced
power shortages, frequent power interruptions, wide variations in system
frequency, and large drops in voltage at the consumer level because SEBs could
not fulfill their responsibilities. Though set up as autonomous bodies, SEBs
have been under the stringent control of their state governments in vital
matters such as changes to tariffs and tariff structure, with the result that
they have not developed commercial and financial disciplines, and their
financial performance generally has been poor, to the extent of depending on
the state governments for operational subsidies.
2.3         In mid-1970s, GOI reoriented its strategy in order to supplement
efforts of SEBs in increasing installed capacity and establishing high voltage
transmission networks. Emphasis was put on: (a) accelerating the development
of the hydro power potential and large coal-fired power plants both at pithead
and in the proximity of load centers; (b) improving the efficiency of thermal
power plants and reducing losses in the transmission and distribution
networks; (c) expanding the rural electrification program; and (d)
strengthening the organizational and management capabilities of the SEBs.



-2-
2.4         GOI established in 1975 two power generating companies, the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and the National Hydroelectric
Power Corporation (NHPC) to construct and operate large thermal and hydro
power stations and associated transmission systems. The rapid increase in
generation necessitated to expand the transmission networks and also to
increase the voltage level to handle the transfer of large blocks of power
from generating stations to load centers. Simultaneously, for the first time
in India a need was felt for power planning and development on a regional
basis to ensure the optimum utilization of natural resources which are rather
unevenly distributed over the country and also for enhancing the reliability
and security of the power transmission systems. The country was divided into
five contiguous regions (Northern, North Eastern, Eastern, Western and
Southern) with a view to build regional integrated grids. Regional
Electricity Boards (REB) were established to integrate the operations of each
grid through regional load dispatch centers and to improve collaboration among
the SEBs.
2.5         By the time the Rihand Power Transmission Project was approved in
May 1985, IDA/Bank had financed 11 operations implemented by NTPC. Ten were
for the construction of an aggregate of 7,800 MW of pithead coal-fired thermal
power plant (TPP) capacity in four sites (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka) and associated transmission lines to evacuate the power generated at
these power stations into the networks owned and operated by SEBs. The
eleventh project was the Central Power Transmission project (Loan 2283-IN;
FY83) whose primary objective was to support GOI's strategy to extend and
improve power supply through the establishment of centrally owned regional
grids and intra-regional connections leading to the promotion of a national
grid. The project was the 38th Bank/IDA operation in the sector, and 12th
operation with NTPC. As in the previous NTPC projects, India, acting by its
President, was the borrower and NTPC the implementing agency. The project was
developed from studies conducted by CEA and NTPC with assistance by Hydro
Quebec International, consultants from Canada.
2.6         In 1989, GOI established the National Power Transmission
Corporation Ltd. (NPTC), to improve the efficiency in power transmission and
systems operations, through an extensive restructuring of the transmission
sector, and complement its policy initiatives to encourage private generation
and competition in power generation. On August 16, 1991, the management of
the transmission assets (operation and maintenance of the assets in service
and implementation of those still under construction) of NTPC, including the
Project, was transferred to NPTC, under a Management Contract signed between
the two Corporations. Subsequently, two other GOI-owned utilities (NHPC and
the North-Eastern Electric Power Corporation - NEEPCO) which had transmission
lines and substations in operation or under construction, signed similar
management contracts with NPTC. NPTC was later named Power Grid Corporation
of India Ltd. (POWERGRID). On January 8, 1993, an Ordinance providing for all
the rights, titles and other interests related to the transmission systems of
NTPC, NHPC and NEEPCO, to be transferred to POWERGRID, with effect from April
1, 1992, was promulgated by the President of India. The Bank supports the
establishment and development of POWERGRID under the US$350 million Loan No.
3577-IN for the POWERGRID System Development Project, approved on March 23,
1993. At the time of preparation of this PCR, the Bank was working on the
finalizing of the modifications on the Development Credit, Loan and Project
Agreements to formalize the transfer of the Bank loans and IDA credits from
NTPC and NHPC to POWERGRID, retroactively with effect from April 1, 1992.
With regard to Loan 2555-IN, assets and liabilities for about US$6.2 million
remained with NTPC and assets and liabilities for about US$179.7 million have



been transferred to POWERGRID. The amounts will be finalized after accounts
between NTPC and POWERGRID are settled.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1         Project Obiectives.  The objectives of the project were: (a) to
meet the electricity demand in the Northern Region by providing the
transmission linkage between the thermal power generation plants in the
Singrauli-Rihand complex in the south east of the region and the main load
centers of the western parts of the region; and (b) to ensure the evacuation
of power from these plants at least cost to the economy. The project was also
to serve as a vehicle for the introduction of a new technology (long distance
HVDC links) needed for the expansion and reinforcement of EHV transmission
grid. As in the previous Bank-financed projects with NTPC, another objective
was to improve, in the long run, the operational, institutional and financial
performance of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), by assisting in the
development of a financially sound, and technically and institutionally
competent centrally-owned power utility which would serve as a model to SEBs.
3.2         Original Project Description.  The project, as approved by the
Board on May 28, 1985, is detailed in Annex 1 and comprised:
(a)   installation of a 500 kV HVDC bi-polar transmission line of about
910 km, connecting Rihand and Karawalnagar near Delhi, associated
AC/DC converting stations for an initial capacity of 1,000 MW, and
related auxiliary equipment at Rihand and Delhi;
(b)   construction of about 1,350 km of 400 kV single circuit (s/c) and
87 km of 400 kV double circuit (d/c) AC lines (total 1,437 km)
connecting Rihand and Singrauli power stations with Kanpur, Delhi,
Panipat and Jaipur;
(c)   construction of three new and extension of four existing
substations with their auxiliaries; and
(d)   technical assistance for engineering, testing and commissioning of
the project.
The project cost was estimated at about Rs 6.9 billion (about US$579 million
equivalent) with the Loan providing $250 million (Table 1 for details on
estimated and actual costs). It was assumed that GOI would secure co-
financing of about US$135 million equivalent for equipment for HVDC terminals.
3.3         Revised Project Description.  After the appraisal of the project,
NTPC found necessary to introduce three modifications to the project
description: (i) changes of grid configuration around the Delhi area caused by
environmental constraints - the most important was the relocation of the HVDC
terminal from Karawalnagar to Dadri, resulting in a shorter line; (ii)
redesign of the HVDC line to take into account longer-term capacity demand
growth and higher efficiency; and (iii) an extension by about 250 km of the
400 kV Delhi Area-Panipat line from Panipat to Malerkotla in Punjab to meet
NTPC's contractual obligations with the Punjab State Electricity Board. The
first two changes were a consequence of a change in location of the 4x210 MW
coal-fired National Capital Thermal Power Project of NTPC from Muradnagar to
Dadri, and of detailed design of the transmission system. The project, as



- 4 -
modified, was found by the Bank to remain consistent with the Bank's strategy
in the power sector which had been encouraging integrated planning and
coordinated operation of the country's electricity systems to satisfy long
term demand projections and regional demand patterns in a context of maximum
system reliability and minimum cost. The Bank agreed on the new scheme on
June 5, 1987. The revised project was then expected to be completed by June
30, 1991. Its description is detailed in Annex 2 and summarized as follows:
(a) installation of a 1,500 MW capacity 500 kV HVDC bi-polar
transmission line of about 814 km", connecting Rihand and Dadri
(near Delhi), and associated AC/DC converting stations and related
auxiliary equipment at Rihand and Dadri;
(b) construction of about 1,509 km of 400 kV single circuit (s/c) and
185 km of 400 kV double circuit (d/c) AC lines (total 1,711 km)
connecting Rihand and Singrauli power stations with Kanpur, Delhi,
Panipat, Malerkotla and Jaipur;
(c) construction of five new and extension of one existing substations
with their auxiliaries; and
(d) technical assistance for engineering, testing and commissioning of
the project (this component was not modified).
The total cost of the project was estimated to be increased. The
new project description was still within the overall objectives of the project
as originally approved by the Board. Thus the Management considered that the
approval of the Board for the said changes was not necessary.
4.  Pro-ect Desicrn and Organization
4.1         Proiect Desiqn.  The project was the second Bank operation with
NTPC solely to strengthen the transmission systemn.  NTPC had already
acquired adequate experience in the area of 400 kV transmission line and
substation design and engineering during the construction of the transmission
lines and substations associated with the Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka power plant projects<. The basic and detailed engineering work for
the 400 kV lines and substations was thus carried out by NTPC in-house. As
the long distance HVDC link technology was new to India and NTPC2, the
2/    originally the length of the HVDC line from Rihand to Karawalnagar in
the Delhi area was 910 km.
3/    The first such transmission project was the Central Power Transmission
Project (Ln. 2283-IN) approved on May 19, 1983.
4/    All these coal-fired power plant projects were partly funded under IDA
credits and Bank loans.
5/    The Central Power Transmission project included the construction of
various 400 kV transmission lines and substations and that of a back-to-
back HVDC system at Vindhyachal, in the Singrauli-Rihand-Vindhyachal
complex. At the time NTPC initiated the Rihand Power Transmission
Project, it had not yet obtained full experience in HVDC technology.



preliminary engineering of HVDC line, its conductor and voltage optimization,
etc., were carried out by Hydro Quebec International, Canada. Teshmont Inc.,
Canada, were appointed as consultants responsible for work related to HVDC
terminals. NTPC was responsible for the preparation of all specifications,
bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and construction supervision.
4.2         Proiect Organization".  At the time of appraisal, NTPC had
already adopted its current three-tier organizational structure at corporate,
regional and project levels. The Corporation is headed by a Chairman and
Managing Director (CMD), who is assisted by five full time functional
directors, namely, Director (Projects), Director (Operations), Director
(Technical), Director (Finance) and Director (Personnel). At the Corporate
Office, corporate planning and central procurement functions are headed by
Executive Directors reporting to the CMD. For the purpose of the
administration and execution of work at the sites, the Corporation is divided
into five regions (Northern, Western, Eastern, Southern and National Capital
Regions) with headquarters at present located at Allahabad, Nagpur, Patna,
Hyderabad and Delhi, respectively. These regions are under the control of
Regional Executive Directors who are responsible for the implementation,
operation and maintenance of power plants in their respective regions. Each
power plant is headed by a General Managerx.  The structure has shown the
advantage of optimizing the span of control of the CMD and provided for the
decentralization of line responsibility while retaining centralized systems in
areas such as long-term planning, basic engineering, procurement of critical
equipment and spares, quality assurance, co-ordination with the World Bank and
other financing agencies and inspection. Parts of the Project were located in
the Northern Region and were thus managed by the Executive Director for this
Region.
5. Prolect ImDlementation
5.1         Loan Effectiveness.  Loan 2555-IN was approved on May 28, 1985;
the Loan and Project Agreements were signed on September 16, 1985. It was
expected that the loan would be declared effective by December 16, 1985.
Signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and NTPC, satisfactory to
the Bank, was the condition for loan effectiveness. The loan was declared
effective on February 20, 1986, a delay of two months from the date of
effectiveness originally determined at signing.
5.2         Prolect Start-uD and Implementation Schedule.  At appraisal, the
project was expected to be completed by December 1988.  At the time the Bank
agreed on the revisions to the project (para. 3.3), it was expected that,
because of the extension of the 400 kV line to Malerkotla, the project
completion date would be delayed by one year to December 1989. Quarterly
Progress Reports and other communications in Bank files show that NTPC
proceeded with the procurement of equipment for the project components while
61    As NTPC was the legal implementing agency of the project during the life
of Ln. 2283-IN, NTPC's project organization and management is reviewed
in this section.
7/    Until August 16, 1991, NTPC's regional transmission units were also
headed by a General Manager (para. 2.6).

the Loan Documents were being processed - the first contract was awarded on
June 14, 1985.
5.3         Implementation Process.  The HVDC transmission line and terminal
stations which were projected at appraisal to be commissioned in December
1988, were put into service in September 1991. Implementation of the HVDC
components took over a year and half longer than that envisaged because of:
(a) delays in obtaining environmental clearance for a section of the
transmission line which had to pass through a forest; (b) collapse of one of
the transmission towers which was sited in a river bed; (c) and fire damage
(and subsequent replacement of damaged parts) to HVDC terminal at Rihand
during the testing of the terminal. Modifications were subsequently
introduced by the manufacturer of the HVDC terminals8. Implementation of
the 400 kV transmission lines and substations was completed generally some
nine months later than envisaged because of project revision, slow
mobilization of one of the contractors, and long time taken to evaluate the
bids. Construction of the transmission line extension from Panipat to
Malerkotla and the associated substation (which were subsequently added to the
project; para. 3.3) were completed in July 1992.
5.4         Extensions of the ClosinQ Date.  The loan was scheduled to be
closed on December 31, 1989. While agreeing to GOI's request to revise the
project, the Bank recognized that extension of the loan closing date to
December 31, 1990, would be required. Because of the reasons mentioned above,
implementation of the project was substantially delayed. The Bank reviewed
progress of implementation annually and agreed extending the closing date by
one year each time, for a total of 36 months to December 31, 1992. The Bank
did not extend the closing date of the loan beyond December 31, 1992, but
informed GOI that it would be willing to consider to include funding the
completion of the ongoing contracts retroactively under the then-proposed
POWERGRID System Development Project. The latter project was approved by the
Board on March 23, 1993 (Loan 3577-IN; para. 2.6) and includes US$7.6 million
for the completion of the contracts of the Rihand Power Transmission Project.
Disbursements for these expenditures under Loan 3577-IN would be completed
during FY94.
5.5         Procurement.  The equipment and materials financed under the loan
were split into 61 packages, most of which were procured under international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Contractors who supplied transmission line tower structure were in charge of
the erection of the towers, insulators and hardware, and stringing of the line
conductors, on a supply and erect basis. Suppliers of main equipment for the
substations and the HVDC terminals were also in charge of the erection of the
substations. NTPC procured, always under ICB, the conductors, line material
such as insulators and hardware and the electrical equipment including
metering and instrumentation and had these equipment erected by the above
mentioned contractors. The relatively large number of contracts and the above
forms of packaging created a significant workload on NTPC as well as Bank
staff to monitor and supervise these contracts. However, the above two
8/    These modifications which were installed in other such projects on other
parts of the world as well, included the introduction of highly
sensitive smoke detection system and creation of compartments in the
system in order to contain fire - should one occur.



- 7 -
characteristics helped NTPC staff to acquire valuable experience in preparing
contract documentation, reviewing and evaluating bids, and in managing the
engineering of the project, since they were responsible for proper interfacing
of project materials and equipment from different suppliers. Most of the said
NTPC staff have been transferred to POWERGRID.  However, it is noted that the
above procurement system applied by NTPC, which required drawing up of
specifications for tenders, preparation of bidding documents and carrying out
of bid evaluations swamped NTPC staff who at one point had to handle some
1,200 contracts valued at over US$1 billion.  On the other hand, dividing the
project material/equipment into numerous contract packages, promoted
participation from a range of large and medium sized local manufacturers/
suppliers which, in turn, has contributed to the development of local
manufacturing industry.
5.6         Of the 61 contracts (total value: US$197 million equivalent) put
out for ICB, 10 contracts (valued at US$59 million or about 30% of the total)
were awarded to foreign manufacturers/suppliers. Of the two highest value
contracts (one for the supply of conductors and the other for the supply of
insulators) were awarded to a local and to a foreign manufacturer/supplier,
respectively. The local industry was fairly competitive where the size of
contract packages was within its manufacturing and/or supply capability. NTPC
followed its practice of specifying the qualification requirements of the
prospective suppliers on the bidding documents; this was not objected to by
the Bank and worked reasonably.
5.7         For all contracts estimated to cost over US$3.5 million
equivalent, NTPC submitted for Bank's review and comments the bidding
documents and evaluation reports. Bank files show that there were long delays
in procurement. On some occasions, there was need to amend the bid documents,
and also to re-bid in some cases. Based on the available documentation, the
average time taken from bid opening to the award of the contract (including
Bank acceptance of the proposed award) was about ten months, though the said
period for six contracts took over a year. The Bank brought to NTPC's
attention the long delays in procurement, particularly in bid evaluation. In
an effort to speed up procurement, standard bidding documents will in the
future be used by NTPC and POWERGRID. Under the NTPC Power Generation
Project9 and Loan 3577-IN for the POWERGRID System Development Project, NTPC
and POWERGRID respectively agreed on standard bidding documents, whose use
would reduce the procurement period substantially. They would also give
further emphasis to finishing promptly the payments for the contracts, so that
the closing dates of new loan(s) would not need to be extended.
5.8         Proiect Costs (Part III, Table E).  The total cost of the original
project, including contingencies, taxes and duties, was estimated in the SAR
at about Rs. 8,315 million (US$666.0 million equivalent). The actual cost of
the revised project was Rs. 13,440 million (US$734.6 million equivalent). In
US dollar equivalent and in Rupee terms, respectively, the actual project cost
was 10% and 621 higher than the appraisal estimate. The difference between
the two increases was due to substantial devaluation of the Rupee from
Rs.12/US$ at appraisal to Rs.30/US$ in December 1992, when the loan was
closed. During the implementation period, the weighted average rate for this
project was Rs 18.3/US$. While inflation increased project costs in local
9/    This project was approved on June 29, 1993.



currency, the devaluation resulted in the loan proceeds generating a
substantially larger amount in local currency than had been expected.
Although a detailed and realistic cost comparison between the appraisal
estimates and the actual costs is not possible due to the major changes to
some of the transmission lines and the associated substations, it is concluded
that costs at appraisal were underestimated.
5.9         Proiect Financinq.  The financing plan was changed substantially.
That estimated at appraisal and the actual plan are summarized in the
following table.

5.10        Disbursements.  The estimated and actual disbursements, and the
original and revised allocation of the loan proceeds are given in Part III,
Tables E and F, respectively. By the time of the original closing date
(December 31, 1989), cumulative disbursements were US$133.6 million, 53% of
the original loan amount. The closing date of the loan was extended three
times by one year each, to December 31, 1992 (para. 5.4). In December 1991,
US$48 million of savings were cancelled from the loan amount. The loan was
closed on December 31, 1992; disbursements were completed on May 12, 1993. On
July 15, 1993, US$7,279,424.78 (the balance in the Special Account) were
refunded by GOI. Then US$16,090,946.84 remaining undisbursed in the loan
account were cancelled effective July 15, 1993. Thus disbursements under the
Loan were US$185,909,053.16. India began repaying the proceeds of the loan on
January 15, 1991, and will continue to do so until July 15, 2005. It is noted
that by the time disbursements were completed, India had already repaid
US$38,118.600, about 21% of the loan amount utilized.

6. Environment. Resettlement and Rehabilitation
6.1         While project implementation was delayed awaiting the clearance of
the Ministry of Environment and Forests of GOI, and in the meantime, in
parallel with the re-siting of the proposed coal-fired NCTPP project its
description had to be amended (para. 3.3), the project itself did not create
any significant environmental and resettlement and rehabilitation problems.
NTPC selected the line routings so as to minimize infringement on forest land.
Where trees had to be felled in order to provide access to the lines, trees of
a corresponding number were planted in the vicinity. The question of
relocation of people affected by the project did not arise because
transmission line routes and substation sites were selected in un-inhabitated
areas remote from the population centers.
7. Physical Results
7.1         Project Obiectives.  Overall, the project has achieved its
objectives (para. 3.1).  The project has been the second component'' in the
establishment of centrally owned regional grids and intra-regional
connections. The power transmission capacity from the Singrauli-Rihand-
Vindhyachal complex to the western parts of the Northern Region has been
increased in a manner which helps optimal utilization of the installed thermal
capacity in the said coal-fired power plants complex, by transmitting over a
very long distance large amounts of power with minimum transmission losses.
The project also helped NTPC (since August 1991, POWERGRID; para. 2.6) to get
acquainted with the HVDC technology. The project contributed in making NTPC
an efficient utility but failed in its sectoral objective in inducing
improvements in the operational, institutional and financial performance of
SEBs, as seen in the disappointing operational, financial and institutional
performances of many SEBs. It is not clear how, if any, NTPC's institutional
development helped those performing SEBs, such as the Maharashtra and Andhra
Pradesh SEBs. The failure in obtaining improvements at SEBs while supporting
the development of NTPC as a model utility can be traced to the fact that the
Bank had not fully appreciated the extent of the interference by the state
governments in the affairs of SEBs (para. 12.4).
7.2         Physical Results.  The individual components of the revised
project were commissioned at various dates given in Part III, Table D. Since
their commissioning, the project components have in general functioned
satisfactorily. The problems which did arise were invariably of a minor
nature and were resolved without seriously affecting the transmission of
power. The availability of the individual components has been almost 100l in
1992 (Annex 3). Furthermore, the daily power amounts transmitted through the
400 kV lines are well in line with the design capacity of the lines. Annex 4
shows the maximum power flow and energy transmitted in 1992, on a monthly
basis, under the Rihand system. Each line of the HVDC system has been
successfully operated at 750 MW + 10%, and the maximum load on the entire line
has been around 1,100 MW, which was injected to the western parts of the
Northern region and helped improving voltage problems in this part of the
Region. However, until the 400 kV transmission ring around Delhi is
constructed, the power transmitted through the HVDC line would be limited to
10/   In addition to the HVDC back-to-back system built at Vindhyachal under
the Central Power Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN).



- 10 -
about 1,000-1,100 MW. Other reasons for the underutilization of the link are:
(i) suboptimal operation of generating plant on a regional basis; and (ii)
indifferent or unresponsive power generation tariff structure. Generation
plants are not operated optimally because individual SEBs do not observe cost
merit order in power generation. The power generation tariff structure of
NTPC in effect up to November 1992 did not encourage merit-order plant
dispatch in the regional grids. The actual NTPC tariff in application since
November 1992 is on two part basis as per the recommendations of GOI's K.P.
Rao Committee. This tariff is conducive to the introduction of merit order
operation. POWERGRID is pursuing further tariff improvements in transmission.
Assistance is being provided under Loan 3577-IN.
8. NTPC's Financial Performance
8.1          From 1982 when NTPC started its commercial operation to the
present, NTPC's financial performance has been satisfactory, except for the
large accounts receivable (para. 8.2). NTPC's financial statements for the
period FY85 to FY92 are given in Annexes 5.1-5.3 and a summary for the last
five years is given in the Table 8.1 below. NTPC's operating data reflect the
growth the Corporation experienced since 1982. Key financial parameters,
e.g., assets in operation, revenue from electricity sales, total operating
revenues, and operating income before interest, increased some five-fold since
1987. The rate of return on net average fixed assets (historically valued)
for this period was high, generally around 15% (between 13t and 171), well in
excess of the 8* between FY85-FY90 and 9.51 starting from FY91, as was
stipulated in the project agreement.

8.2         Bill collection and accounts receivable have been persistent
problems for NTPC, because of the poor financial situation of many SEBs.
NTPC's accounts receivable increased at a far greater pace than its revenues
and operating income in successive years. The receivables, which represented
some 5.2 months of billing in 1987, steadily increased to 7.5 months in 1991,
compared to less than one month (27 days) projected in the SAR for the entire
period. A covenant specifying the level of accounts receivable not to exceed
an amount equivalent to the proceeds of its sales of power for the two
preceding months, was first introduced for NTPC under this Loan, with effect
from the end of FY86. The covenant immediately pointed out to the large
arrears accumulated by SEBs. The covenant was repeated in three subsequent
Bank loans"/, but NTPC has never been able to comply. In 1991, the increase
in accounts receivable (over 1990) was some Rs 3.53 billion, while the
corresponding increases in electricity sales revenue and in total operating
revenues were Rs 2.88 billion and Rs 3.63 billion respectively; in practical
terms, NTPC collected virtually no additional revenue in FY91, even though it
sold an additional 4,800 GWh of energy. In 1986, NTPC internal cash
generation barely met its debt service requirements and the increase in
working capital (Annex 5.2). A liquidity crisis was averted by the cash
received by NTPC from its first issue of medium-term bonds. Since then NTPC
has been issuing such medium-term bonds every year, mostly to help finance the
expansion of its facilities. The levels of its accounts receivable have also
been increasing every year in absolute terms as well as a percentage of its
annual billings. The funds raised from these bonds have helped NTPC to bridge
finance its increasing working capital requirements.
8.3         Increasing bill collection and accounts receivable problems led to
several interventions by GOI on behalf of NTPC during the period FY88 to FY92.
At each of these interventions, GOI assumed the responsibility to clear some
of the arrears from SEBs by transferring to NTPC corresponding amounts from
its allocations to the respective states. Such payments are carried out over
a period of four years. In February 1992, NTPC acquired the Unchahar power
station in lieu of arrears of the Uttar Pradesh SEB. As indicated in the
Table 8.1 above, NTPC has received over Rs 11 billion from the transfers
through the central appropriations from 1988 to January 1993. Combined with
other bill collection efforts, NTPC was able to reduce its level of accounts
receivable despite the rapid increase in sales. At the end of FY93, the
overall level of accounts receivable was 3.3 months of sales equivalent, but
excluding the amount still to be paid through the central appropriations, it
was 1.4 months of sales equivalent. More encouraging is that during the last
three months of FY93, 93% of billing was realized directly from the SEBs.
During the negotiations of the NTPC Power Generation Project, agreement was
reached that NTPC would maintain the level of its accounts receivable at two
months of sales equivalent excluding the amount still to be paid through the
central appropriations for which a specific payment schedule was also agreed.
8.4          GOI's interventions through the central appropriations helped
NTPC avert financial crises and resolve, for limited periods, its accounts
receivable problem. These interventions aimed at having NTPC operate
efficiently, thus keep the electric energy supply in the country at an
11/   Loan 2674-IN for the Gas-Based Combined Cycle Project (FY86);
Loan 2844-IN for the National Capital Power Project (FY87); and
Loan 2845-IN for the Talcher Thermal Power Project (FY87).



- 13 -
adequate level. It is doubtful that GOI's actions have resulted in SEBs
improving their operational efficiency as well as their billing and collection
practices from their own customers. What is equally important, but so far
received little attention, is the need for energy conservation on the customer
(SEBs) side through adoption of appropriate tariffs and tariff structure at
SEBs and through end-use efficiencies.
8.5         The accounts receivable as of March 1990 were about Rs 11.5
billion (some US$500 million equivalent, and represented over six months of
current billings). It was around the same time that the Bank took the
exceptional step of cancelling the processing of a loan of US$375 million to
NTPC for a project which had already been negotiated, primarily because of the
inability of NTpc to reduce its accounts receivable. Since October 1992, GOI
adopted new investment and commercial policies and electricity tariffs for
NTPC. They are designed to introduce better commercial discipline at SEBs,
along with improving NTPC's own operational and financial performance,
including revenue collection. New two part bulk supply tariffs for NTPC coal
fired stations became effective in November 1992. Further reforms in bulk
power and transmission tariffs will be studied and implemented under Loan
3577-IN. The process of establishing commercial contracts between the SEBs
and the central utilities is cumbersome, but progress is being made with
strong Bank support under Loan 3577-IN and the NTPC Power Generation Project.
The new commercial policies and bulk power supply agreements should enable
NTPC to reach a level of bill collection close to 100% during FY94.
8.6         The legal documents of the Loan also adopted the conventional rate
of return (ROR) on average historic fixed assets in operation. An important
objective of this conventional ROR indicator is to serve as a measure of the
adequacy of revenues compared to the cost of capital. Therefore, it has more
appropriate application with mature utilities, and where the investment, which
is not included in the rate base, is a fraction of the utility's net fixed
assets in operation (or the rate base). Table 8.1 indicates that throughout
the entire project implementation period i.e., FY86-FY92, the projected "Works
in Progress" (WIP) was a substantially high proportion of the rate base;
through 1987, WIP was higher than the Gross Assets in Operation; for practical
purposes the rate base was insignificant relative to the annual investment.
A utility could well have a very high rate of return performance but be faced
with liquidity crisis, and the computation of other standard financial
indicators such as operating ratio would not provide meaningful information.
One could therefore conclude that such a performance indicator was not
appropriate for NTPC at the time. A more appropriate financial indicator
under such circumstances is the "contribution to investment", because it
targets at generating from internal sources a pre-determined level of funds
towards the on-going investment after taking into account debt service and
working capital requirements. Under the NTPC Power Generation Project, NTPC
agreed that it would produce, starting from FY95, funds from its internal cash
generation equivalent to not less than 20% of its capital expenditures on a
three-year moving average. The amount for FY94 would be 15% of the average of
NTPC's capital expenditures for the FY93-FY95 period1'.
12/   The most recent analysis of NTPC's finances is given in the SAR for the
NTPC Power Generation Project (Report No. 11827-IN; Dated June 4, 1993).

9. Compliance with Loan Covenants
9.1         The key institutional and cost recovery covenants introduced in
the Loan and the Project Agreements and the extent they were complied with are
listed in Part III, Table H. NTPC was not in compliance with the accounts
receivable covenant (para. 11.2).
10. Sustainability and Internal Economic Rate of Return
10.1        The project is sustainable, even though at present its main
component (i.e., the Rihand-Delhi Area HVDC link) is not yet being fully
utilized (para. 7.2). Sustainability will be assured with the strengthening
of the transmission ring around metropolitan Delhi and growth in power demand.
It is certainly assured for the future, as the facilities built under the
project are integral components of POWERGRID's system development program.
However, insufficient generation and transmission tariffs and an unchecked
increase of NTPC's and POWERGRID's accounts receivable could endanger such
sustainability. The Bank, GOI, NTPC and POWERGRID have been taking actions to
avoid such occurrence (paras. 8.5 and 8.6).
10.2        Because of the changes agreed by the parties on the project
description, it is not possible to make a reasonable comparison between the
internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the original and revised project
scopes. The IERR for NTPC/POWERGRID's time-slice investments for the FY84-
FY92 period has been estimated at 111. Under Loan 3577-IN, the IERR for
POWERGRID's time-slice investments during the FY93-FY2002 period was estimated
at 22%. The difference is explained by improvements in tariff setting
parameters v and the unusually high inflation encountered in India in late
1980s and early 1990s, which brought down tariff revenues in real terms
(Part I, Table G).
11. Bank Performance
11.1        It is difficult to provide a judgement for a project whose
description was substantially amended, albeit within its original objectives,
and its completion was delayed by about 3 1/2 years. Instead of agreeing to
the revision of the project description, the Bank might have cancelled Loan
2555-IN. It might also have cancelled Loan 2283-IN for the Central Power
Transmission Project during the hiatus of this project in 1984-1987"'.  But
it might thus have lost an opportunity to influence transmission development
in India. Instead the Bank opted to continue its dialogue with GOI, CEA, NTPC
and POWERGRID on transmission system development and operations. The dialogue
has culminated with the recent approval of Loan 3577-IN (para. 2.6).
11.2        On another front, the Bank opted not to suspend disbursements
under this Loan and other loans to NTPC, when NTPC fell into default of the
accounts receivable covenant and substantial arrears from SEBs began creating
problems for this Corporation's financial and overall future (para. 8.2). The
13/   The return on equity for projects started before FY90 was 10; for those
projects started in FY91 and FY92 it was 121. The return has since been
adjusted to 16% for future projects. Depreciation was also increased.
14/   See the PCR for the Central Power Transmission Project.



- i5 -
Bank decided to continue its dialogue to encourage GOI to adopt for NTPC new
investment and commercial policies, and electricity tariffs. It alerted GOI
and NTPC that the Bank's continued funding for their projects would no longer
be possible unless actions to correct NTPC's finances are taken. In 1990, the
Bank decided not to present to the Board the then-negotiated Regional Power
Systems Project, because GOI and NTPC were unable to fulfill the conditions
for Board presentation within a reasonable time period. Other multilateral
and bilateral agencies followed the Bank in limiting their financing of NTPC
projects. All these actions helped GOI to initiate reforms in the power
sector and adopt new investment and commercial policies for NTPC. If the Bank
had suspended disbursements, it might have lost another opportunity, this time
to influence reforms in power generation. In view of GOI's, POWERGRID's and
NTPC's recent actions prior to the approval of Loan 3577-IN and negotiations
of the NTPC Power Generation Project, the Bank's above decisions bore their
fruits.
11.3        Bank's supervision effort was concentrated mainly on the
procurement issues as well as other important areas such as physical progress
including problems in implementation, in disbursements performance, etc. The
Bank provided valuable help to NTPC. However, visits to the work sites by
each mission could not be undertaken because each mission covered supervision
of all Bank funded NTPC projects. It is concluded that the Bank's performance
under the project was satisfactory.
12. Borrower Performance
12.1        The performance of NTPC in the technical and managerial activities
was satisfactory. Bank missions have reported delays in preparation of
specifications, bidding documents and bid evaluations, and in preparing its
quarterly progress reports in a timely manner; these shortcomings, however,
have been mainly due to the large workload of NTPC at the time and because the
information needs to be collected from various sites which are located in
remote placesl.  The project provided continuing opportunity for NTPC to
enlarge its skills and experience in procurement under ICB procedures, in
designing the transmission systems and in supervising their implementation and
construction. The PCR mission was advised that the services of NTPC staff,
involved in implementation of the HVDC substation, were subsequently used by
the supplier, on a consultancy basis, in the installation of HVDC substation
in another country.
12.2        The only area where NTPC's performance fell considerably short of
expectations was in bill recovery. The accounts receivables condition was
first introduced under this Loan and immediately focussed on the substantial
arrears by SEBs. These large arrears affected NTPC's financial position
adversely. NTPC maintained it had little recourse against the defaulting
SEBs, because of its understanding that it could not cut off the power supply
to the defaulting SEBs even if it wanted to. At present NTPC is carrying out
more systematic and aggressive efforts at all levels of the organization (from
the regional managers to the CMD) to obtain letters of credit from SEBs for
15/   Furthermore, after the transfer of the management of NTPC's transmission
assets to POWERGRID, the information relating to the transmission system
are collected from this Corporation. Stabilization of a proper
coordination system between the two Corporations has taken some time.

the appropriate amounts of energy sales. These actions include seeking the
intervention of the Minister of Power in order to collect dues from SEBs.
GOI's new commercial policies and revised bulk power supply agreements should
enable NTPC to reach a level of bill collection close to 100% during FY94.
12.3        GOI has recently adopted new investment and commercial policies
and electricity tariffs allowing NTPC to shut-off or restrict power supply if
its clients are in default with their bulk supply agreements. These policies
are designed to introduce better commercial discipline at SEBs, along with
improving NTPC's own operational and financial performance, including
improving revenue collection (para. 8.5).
12.4        There appears to be a difference in the positions of the Bank, GOI
and the State Governments. The Bank's position is that the electricity
industry provides a service which has to be fully paid for by each customer
category (cross-subsidization permitted) through user charges. GOI seems to
be moving towards the Bank's position shown by the measures and incentives
taken in recent years including recommendations to the state governments to
increase tariffs. The states appear to perceive (sometimes for political
purposes) the provision of electricity as a social service. Furthermore, in
an economy, where the public perception of a public utility often is to
provide primarily a social service, the use of a profit criterion as the sole
measure of the utility's financial performance is not generating adequate
public support.
13. Performance of Consultants and Contractors
13.1        The performance of consultants engaged in the design and
construction of HVDC and 400 kV facilities was satisfactory. There was a
positive transfer of technical know-how from these consultants to NTPC staff.
Barring a few problems and some minor delays, overall the performance of the
contractors/suppliers was also satisfactory. The packaging of contracts in
appropriate sizes promoted participation from local manufacturing industry,
and the Bank's and NTPC's involvements resulted in improvement in the quality
of the product.
14. Proiect Relationship
14.1        A good working relationship was maintained between the Bank and
GOI and NTPC, and later also with POWERGRID.
15. Project Documentation and Data
15.1        The project's legal agreements adequately reflected the objectives
of the project and the Bank's interests. The staff appraisal report provided
a relatively useful framework for the Bank and NTPC during project
implementation. Bank supervision missions appear to have been adequate in
terms of their frequency. However, most of the missions had to supervise
and/or prepare other projects. It is therefore likely that the missions were
not able to make visits to some of project sites. Some of the important
project documentation (e.g. supervision mission reports, aide-memoires),
project progress reports and annual financial statements was not found in the
Bank files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2555-IN)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Comments by NTPC and Endorsed by the Government of India
A. Preface
1.          The loan was made to India in May 1985 for on-lending to the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The objectives of the project
were: (a) to meet the electricity demand in the Northern Region by providing
the transmission linkage between the thermal power generation plants in the
Singrauli-Rihand complex in the south-east of the region and the main load
centers of the western parts of the region; and (b) to ensure the evacuation
of power from these plants at least cost to the economy. The project was also
to serve as a vehicle for the introduction of a new technology (long distance
HVDC links) needed for the expansion and reinforcement of EHV transmission
grid. Another objective was: (c) to improve, in the long run, the
operational, institutional and financial performance of the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs), by assisting in the development of a financially sound, and
technically and institutionally competent centrally-owned power utility which
would serve as a model to SEBs. On August 16, 1991, the management of the
project was transferred from NTPC to National Power Transmission Corporation
Ltd., under a Management contract signed between the two corporations. On
January 8, 1993, an ordinance providing for all the rights, titles and other
interests related to the transmission systems of NTPC to be transferred to
POWERGRID (NPTC was later renamed as Power Grid Corporation of India) was
promulgated by the President of India.
B. Comments on the Analysis in Part-I
2.          The analysis made by the Bank under Part-I is comprehensive and
has covered the important aspects. The analysis is generally in order.
Nevertheless, there are certain issues which need to be further examined
keeping in view the background of developments as they took place to better
appreciate the events. These are as follows:
Preface (reference para. 1)
3.          It may be mentioned here that savings of US$48 million has arisen
mainly on account of the exchange rate variations.
Procurement (reference para. 5.7 of Part-I)
4.1         In an effort to speed up procurement and after having extensive
discussions, NTPC had finalized with the World Bank a standard bidding
document in April 1992. However, the Bank withdrew its "No-Objection" to this
standard bidding document in December 1992 and wanted certain modifications to
be included. NTPC has now finalized standard bidding documents with the Bank
based on the suggested modifications and further discussions. NTPC will use
this document for procurement under the recently negotiated loan for NTPC



- 18 -
Power Generation Project. This is expected to reduce the procurement time.
Further, the proposed NTPC Power Generation Project, negotiated with the Bank
in May 1993 would be under time slice concept which would help in bringing
about timely disbursements.
4.2         NTPC has started giving further emphasis to finishing promptly the
payments to the contractors.
Physical Results - Project Oblectives (reference para. 7)
5.          Under NTPC's new commercial and investment policies:  (a) NTPC has
been permitted to shut-off or restrict power supply from its concerned power
stations, whenever physically and technically feasible, in case of non-
compliance with the agreed terms, including appropriate payment coverage by
letters of credit (LCs), of the bulk power supply agreements (BPSA) with the
SEBs; (b) if the above is not possible, the defaulting state(s) would be
charged penal rates for drawals (power imports) exceeding LC coverage; (c) for
new power stations, NTPC and POWERGRID have been instructed to design the
system in such a way that it would allow the shut off or diversion of supplies
in case of non-compliance with the BPSA; (d) NTPC would delay new investments
in a state if that state is not in compliance with the BPSA; and (e) NTPC is
permitted to undertake projects in one region with a substantial part of the
output to be allocated to other regions. In addition, NTPC was authorized in
January 1993 to enter into joint ventures with foreign and local private
partners and to develop with those partners power projects either from its own
investment program or those offered by others.
Financial Performance (reference paras. 8.2 to 8.5 of Part-I)
6.          In the discussions on accounts receivable presented in Section 8
of the Part I, the Bank has included the amount due to NTPC by way of Central
Appropriation in the accounts receivable. GOI has in the past ordered Central
Appropriation of plan assistance funds to State sectors for offsetting their
dues to Central sector agencies like NTPC. Such amounts are being paid to
N'TPC as per agreed schedules and the Bank had been kept informed about the
arrangement since August 1990. Considering that these were committed payments
from GOI, the amounts were set off against the dues of the SEBs and NTPC's
accounts receivable reduced by the total amount of Central appropriation.
As has been mentioned in para. 8.3, during the negotiations of the
proposed NTPC Power Generation Project, agreement was reached that NTPC would
maintain the level of its accounts receivable at two months of sales
equivalent excluding the amount still to be paid through the Central
appropriations for which a specific payment schedule was also agreed.
7.          The Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank conducted
the performance audit of few Bank-funded projects, namely Korba (Credit 793-
IN), Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN), Singrauli-II (Credit 1027-
IN) and Farakka (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN). In its report No. 10854
published in February 1993, the Audit Mission has summed up NTPC's financial
policy in a paragraph as below:
"NTPC has reached its large size (it is India's largest corporate entity
in terms of fixed assets) in a record time without jeopardizing or
compromising its financial viability, even in spite of the accounts



- 19 -
receivable issue. This is a performance that very few utilities in the
same situation are able to achieve. The performance is even more
impressive since NTPC is still in a major investment mode. A good part
of NTPC's above-par performance is to be credited to GOI's original
design (e.g., debt-equity ratio set at a conservative 1:1; tariff
formula to pass on all investment, operation, and financial costs.)"
8.          As is common practice in transaction of a commodity like
electricity, the agreements allow the beneficiary of its energy supply a
period of 30 days from issue of the bills for making payments. Therefore,
outstanding should be reckoned after expiry of this period of 30 days.
Sustainability (reference Para. 10.1)
9.          Regarding transfer of assets from NTPC to POWERGRID, GOI has
informed World Bank vide letter dated January 12, 1993 that all transmission
assets shall be transferred to POWERGRID and while it had been decided to
transfer the Rihand-Dadri HVDC link with terminals, because of contractual
matters, the terminals would be transferred a little later. It was also
informed that the Vindhyachal HVDC back to back system would be transferred
straightway being quite clearly a part of the transmission system. It was
also clarified that switchyards of existing NTPC power stations will not be
transferred and all new stations will be designed to have switchyards owned
and operated by POWERGRID.
Bank Performance (reference vara. 11.2 of Part-I)
10.         It has been stated that the Bank's decision not to present to the
Board the then proposed Regional Power System Project because of GOI and
NTPC's inability to fulfil the conditions for Board presentation within a
reasonable time period, has helped GOI to promote reforms in the power sector.
It is worth mentioning that the sectoral reforms are brought about gradually
with time. It is easier to bring out such changes when they are accompanied
by large development programmes such as the proposed US$1.2 billion time slice
loan operation of World Bank for NTPC Power Generation Project.
Comments by POWERGRID and Endorsed by the Government of India
Environment, Resettlement and Rehabilitation
11.1        In the context of transmission projects there is no significant
impact on environment except in the cases where the transmission lines involve
any forest area. The impact of transmission line projects on environment is
not considered as severe as in case of thermal, hydel, nuclear power projects.
This is primarily because the effect on forest due to laying of transmission
lines is reversible and can be nullified by planting more trees.
11.2        With the worldwide concern over the fast depleting forest
reserves, due consideration is given to these aspects at the planning and
designing stage itself. While identifying the transmission system for Rihand-
I, detailed surveys were conducted by the executing agency in association with
the state forest authorities to identify most suitable route having minimum
infringement on forest land. Where trees had to be felled in order to provide
access to the lines, trees of a corresponding number were planted in the
vicinity as per guidelines from Ministry of Environment and Forest.



- 20 -
11.3        Sites for construction of the sub-stations were generally selected
in uninhabitated areas remote from the population centers. Hence, the
resettlement and rehabilitation of people did not arise.

12.         The loan was originally scheduled to be closed on December 31,
1989. But as a consequence of a change in location of the 4x210 MW coal fired
NCTPP project of NTPC from Muradnagar to Dadri, the project configuration
underwent major revision. After appraising the revised scheme, Bank decided
to extend the loan closing date by one year each time, for a total of 36
months to December 31, 1992. The total disbursement of loan till March 1992
was US$191.5 million. Further, Bank has included funding the balance portion
of the on-going contracts amounting to US$7.6 million retroactively under the
new POWERGRID System Development Project (Loan No. 3577-IN).
Procurement
13.         It generally takes 3 to 4 months before the bids are invited are
opened for evaluation. Further, all major packages were awarded within a
period ranging from 5 to 7 months. Therefore, a total procurement period
varied from 8 months to 11 months. Keeping in view the complexities involved
in some of the contract packages, the time taken seems to be reasonable.
Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance
14.1        The project has overall achieved its objectives.  The project has
been a major component in the establishment of centrally owned regional grids
and intra-regional connections. With the satisfactory completion of the
project the power transmission capacity, security and reliability in the
Northern Region has increased.
14.2        Since NTPC had already acquired sufficient experience in the area
of design and engineering of 400 kV transmission lines and substations, entire
basic and detailed engineering work for the 400 kV transmission lines and
substations was carried out by NTPC/POWERGRID in-house.
14.3        This project also provided an opportunity for NTPC/POWERGRID to
gain valuable experience in procurement under ICB procedures, which was later
used for other Bank financed projects. Also the introduction of HVDC
technology helped NTPC staff to enlarge its skills and to gain valuable
experience in the execution of HVDC substation, which was later used, on a
consultancy basis, in the installation of HVDC stations in other countries.

RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.         The project consists of the following major physical components.
I . 400-kV Transmission Lines
The expansion of the 400-Kv network would be comprised of:
(a)   Rihand-Singrauli, single circuit: 40 km;
(b)   Rihand-Kanpur, single circuit: 450 km;
(c)   Kanpur-Ballabgarh, single circuit: 450 km;
(d)   Ballabgarh-Jaipur, single circuit: 310 km;
(e)   Ballabgarh-Muradnagar, double circuit: 20 km;
(f)   Muradnagar-Karwalnager, double circuit: 17 km;
(g)   Muradnagar-Panipat, single circuit: 100 km;
(h)   Muradnagar (NTPC)-Muradnagar (UPSEB): 10 km;
(i)   Jaipur (NTPC)-Jaipur (RSEB), double circuit: 20 km;
(j)   Kanpur (NTPC)-Kanpur (UPSEB), double circuit: 20 km.
II . 400-kV AC Substation
Rihand:          Modifications to the already ordered substation of NTPC to make it compatible
with requirements of the HVDC terminal
Sinprauli:       Extension of the existing substation located at the site of Singrauli power plant
to allow for connection of the Rihand-Singrauli line at the substation.
Kanpur:          New substation to connect the Rihand-Kanpur-Ballabgarh lines as well as the
Singrauli-Kanpur-Agra-Jaipur lines of NTPC. This substation would also be
connected to the existing 400-kV Kanpur substation of UPSEB. Provision for a
reactance would also be made at this substation.
Muradnapar:            Extension to the proposed 400/200-kV substation to connect the
Ballabgarh, Muradnagar (UPSEB) and Panipat line and accommodate off
take from Delhi HVDC terminal as well as a new substation being created
to feed power from HVDC bipole to the Delhi grid. Provision has been
made for 2 x 31 5 MVA 400/220-kV transformers.
Ballabqarh:      Extension to the proposed 400/200-kV substation at Ballabgarh to connect the
Muradnagar, Jaipur and Kanpur lines.
KarwalnaQar:     Extension to the proposed 400/220-kV substation at Karwalnagar to connect
the Muradnagar line.
JaiDur:          New substation to connect NTPC's Ballabgarh and Kanpur-Agra lines. This
substation would be connected to the RSEB's 400-kV substation at Jaipur.
PaniDat:         Extension to the existing Panipat 400-kV substation of BBMB to terminate the
Muradnagar line.

III . HVDC Transmission Line
Voltaqe Selection
2.         The voltage in HVDC links ranges between + 450-kV and + 600-kV. Voltages above
or below these figures would require multi-conductor bundles either because of excessive losses
(below + 450-kV) or excessive corona (above + 600-kV). The voltage selected for the project is
+ 500-kV.
HVDC Terminals
3.         The terminal at Rihand would be connected by two 400-kV AC feeders to the 400-kV
AC substation at Rihand power station and the terminal at Delhi by two 400-kV AC feeders to the
400-kV AC substation at Muradnagar. The salient details of the HVDC terminal equipment are
given below:
Converter Transformers
4.         The converter transformers would be three phases or single phase units appropriately
connected. They would be designed to withstand the combined DC and AC stresses that would be
subjected to while in operation. They would have appropriate number of taps we well as an
adequate tap range so as to ensure desired flexibility in the operation of the bipole.
Thyristor Valves
The HVDC converter stations would comprise one 12 pulse valve group per pole
which would be initially equipped for a nominal continuous rating of 1000 MW in bipolar operation
but which would be upgradable at a later date to 1500 MW. The multiple valve units would be
water-cooled and will be the indoor air insulated type. They would be of modular design
comprising different thyristor levels of identical construction. They will be triggered by optically
instigated electrical firing, separately light triggered thyristor firing or direct optical firing. Each
valve would be protected against overload, over voltage, and other variations in current and
voltage.
