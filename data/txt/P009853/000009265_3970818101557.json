It will furthermore ensure the evacuation of power\n            from these plants at least cost to the economy.  The project\n            comprises the installation of about 910 km of 500-kV direct\n            current (DC) power transmission lines between Rihand and\n            Delhi, and the associated converting stations.  It also\n            provides for approximately 1,450 km of 400-kV alternating\n            current (AC) line connecting Singrauli-Rihand with the main\n            load centers at Kanpur, Delhi, Panipat, and Jaipur and\n            related substations in the Northern Region.  The project\n            aims to introduce long-distance, high-voltage, direct\n            current (HVDC) power transmission technology in India."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
