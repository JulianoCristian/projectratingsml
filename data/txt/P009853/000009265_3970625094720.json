to\n            help meet the demand for electricity in the Northern Region\n            of India by providing transmission linkage between the\n            thermal power plants at Singrauli-Rihand in the State of\n            Uttar Pradesh and the main load centers in the Northern\n            Region.  It will furthermore ensure the evacuation of power\n            from these plants at least cost to the economy.  The project\n            comprises the installation of about 910 km of 500-kV direct\n            current (DC) power transmission lines between Rihand and\n            Delhi, and the associated converting stations.  It also\n            provides for approximately 1,450 km of 400-kV alternating\n            current (AC) line connecting Singrauli-Rihand with the main\n            load centers at Kanpur, Delhi, Panipat, and Jaipur and\n            related substations in the Northern Region.  The project\n            aims to introduce long-distance, high-voltage, direct\n            current (HVDC) power transmission technology in India."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
