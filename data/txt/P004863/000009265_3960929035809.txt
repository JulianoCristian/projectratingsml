MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A CREDIT
OF SDR 10.9 MILLION (US$14.0 MILLION ZQUIVALENT)
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF WESTERN SAMOA
FOR AN EMERGENCY ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed emergency
credit to the Independent State of Western Samoa for SDR 10.9 million
(US$14.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It would help to
finance an emergency road rehabilitation project. The Australian Government
is providing a cofinancing grant of US$0.5 million equivalent for technical
assistance.
2.       Background.  Western Samoa is a small country in the central South
Pacific consisting mainly of two volcanic islands. The population of 160,000
is concentrated on the coastal fringes of these islands and reliant for
transportation on each island's circumferential road. While basic indicators
such as health and literacY are high by developing country standards, the
economy is fragile, reliant on substantial inflows of assistance and
remittances and very susceptible to external shocks. Agricuiture dominates
the economy, both in terms of subsistence farming and of thq value of exports.
3.       The Cyclone.  From February 1 to 4, 1990, Western Samoa was struck by
Cyclone Ofa. The South Western Pacific is an area which is susceptible to
cyclones, however those equalling the intensity of Ofa are very infrequent.
In Samoa's case, the worst cyclone previously recorded this century was the
hurricane of 1966 in which winds of 82 knots (94 mileslhour, 43 meters/sec)
were experienced; the last cyclone to strike Samoa. Gina in January 1989,
recorded maximum wind speeds of 42 knots for one day and caused damage
estimated at US$8 million. By comparison, Cyclone Ofa lasted for four days
with maximum wind speeds of 97 knots, seas 2 meters higher than normal, and
caused damage estimated at US$140 million - a figure substantially in excess
of Samoa's eutimated 1989 GDP of US$100 million.
4.       Western Samoa's infrastructure and productive capacity were both
severely damaged. On both main islands, Upolu and Savai'i, damage to
buildings was extensive with schools and hospitals badly hit; water and
electricity supplies were also affected. Although traditional housing offers
some resistance to the effects of high winds, 25,000 people were rendered
homeless and several villages completely destroyed; in addition, eleven people
lost their lives. The cyclone has devastated the agriculture sector: tree
crops and forestry plantations on the north coasts of both islands have been
badly affected; foodcrops in the major agricultural areas have been almost
totally destroyed and 5OS of livestock has been lost. Overall, 70Z of Samoa's
food production capacity was destroyed.
5.       Damage to the Transport Sector.  The transport sector was severely
affected by the cyclone with damage estimated at about US$40 million. Inter
island transport has been disrupted with one of Western Samoa's two ferries
grounded and unlikely to be salvaged, while the Asau airstrip on Savai'i has
been washed away. Port facilities and ongoing improvement works in Apia
harbor were damaged by the cyclone. However, the road network suffered the
most extensive damage with key links of the circumferential roads on both



-2-
islands being destroyed. Of the country's 225km of paved roads, about a
quarter has been destroyed or requires major reconstruction; in addition
unpaved elements of the circumferential road on Savai'i have been washed away.
6.       Respose. by Government and Donors. The Government has handled the
cyclone emergency impressively. The Disaster Coordinating Committee,
established by the Government in 1988 to supervise operations in the event of
a cyclone or other natural disaster, has coordinated relief efforts with the
assistaw-e of the disaster preparedness organizations of Australia and New
Zealand, and with USA military operating out of American Samoa, as well as
with other bilateral and multilateral donors. The Government is now moving
rapidly to initiate a reconstruction program which includes an extensive
agriculture replanting scheme as well as the reconstruction of key
infrastructure facilities. Hrwever the Government's own resources are limited
and it is therefore seeking further assistance from its major donors.
Additional financing for its longer term reconstruction program will be sought
at a previously scheduled UNDP Round Table meeting in Geneva on May 30, 1990.
7.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  The cyclone has severely disrupted
Western Samoa's already fragile economy. Costs of reconstruction apart,
export earnings are expected to fall by 30 per cent in 1990 and, similarly,
growth in GDP is to fall from an earlier projection of two and a half percent,
to zero at best. Reconstruction efforts in other sectors of the Western
Samoan economy which have suffered damage are being assisted by donors already
active in those sectors. Donors have fully committed their available
resources to these sectors and are unable to provide any substantial
additional assistance for the restoration of roads. The main rationale for
TDA involvement in this sector would therefore be, in the absence of other
sources of donor assistance, to assist with the restoration of essential
infrastructure; support extraordinary maintenance requirements; and to help
ensure that maintenance needs elsewhere in the road network are not neglected
during reconstruction and thereafter.
8.       Prosect Obiectives. The proposed project is intended to assist the
Government in carrying out an emergency rehabilitation program to alleviate
the severe disruption in the transportatio- sector. It would also help
restore economic activities along the cyclone affected north coasts of both
Upolu and Savai'i by rehabilitating portions of the main circumferential roads
and by providing assistance for extraordinary maintenance requirements of the
road network in areas exposed to erosion by wave action.
9.       The Proposed Project.  The proposed project consists of priority
elements of the Government's overall program to rehabilitate cyclone-damaged
as well as other badly deteriorated road infrastructure. The project covers
about one half of the damage suffered by the road sector. The project would
be executed by the Public Works Department (PWD) and includes (a)
extraordinary maintenance works mostly to protect stretches of the main
circumferential roads from further erosion by wave action and to keep the
roads passable by vehicles; (b) rehabilitation of priority links of the Upolu
and Savai'i circumferential roads; (c) technical assistance and consulting
services for designs and construction supervision and also for project
management; (d) procurement of (i) navigation lights and beacons to restore
cyclone-damaged navigation facilities and (ii) road maintenance equipmentt and
(e) short-term overseas training for PWD staff and the carrying out of a brief
institutional strengthening study. Design studies for the road rehabilitation



- 3 -
in Savail'i have already started and are being carried out by consultants who
have been employed with IDA approval on a sole source basis. They are the
same consultants (Snowy Mountains Engineering Consultants of Australia) who
had carried out feasibility studies for road rehabilitation in 1989. All
rehabilitation works will be carried out through contracts awarded under
liaited international competitive bidding. PWD will carry out the
extraordinary maintenance by force account. Bank/IDA guidelines will be
followed for procuremeut of services and goods and for the use of consultants.
Implementation of the project is expected neither to result in any adverse
environmental impacts nor require any resettlement of people.
10.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated to be
US$16.26 million in May 1990 prices, including foreign exchange costs of
US$11.47 million. Details of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The proposed TDA credit of SDR 10.9 million (US$14.0 million
equivalent) would finance about 90t of the total project costs, net of taxes
and duties. The Government will provide US$1.76 million in counterpart funds
and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) will
provide up to US$0.50 million of grant technical assistance for one expatriate
engineer (Project Manager). Retroactive financing, in an amount not exceeding
SDR 1.1 million, is proposed for expenditures incurred on emergency
maintenance, consultant services and advances to contractors after March 7,
1990.
11.      Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Western Samoa,
are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A technical annex is attached in
lieu of a staff appraisal report. A map is also attached.
12.       areed Actions.  At negotiations the Government agreed to: a)
annually provide adequate budgetary allocations for routine road maintenance
as agreed with the Association. These are estimated to be at least
US$0.9 million in CY1991, US$1.2 million in CY1992 and US$1.5 million in real
terms annually thereafter; and b) as a condition of credit effectiveness,
appoint and retain a project manager, to be assisted by a suitable PVD staff,
both with experience and qualifications acceptable to the Association.
13.      Benefits.  Internal transport communications on both main islaols in
Western Samoa are dependent on its circumferential roads, key links of wvLch
have been badly damaged.   Restoration of the network is therefore essential
to the resumption of agricultural activity, particularly on Savai'i, and also
to enable normal transport movements to resume. Rehabilitation will also
result in economic benefits through savings on vehicle operating costs. The
project will provide appropriate shore protection as well as other measures
which will help mitigate the effects of future cyclones. Also by its design,
the project will allow the PWD to concentrate its own resources on essential
maintenance rather than dissipate them in a program of reconstruction beyond
its capacity to Implement.
14.      BLsk8. The main risk relates to further damage the network may
sustain during the period before rehabilitation commences. The extraordinary
maintenance component is intended to address this risk. Another risk would be
the PRD's limited capacity to implement the project within the agreed period.
The provision of the project manager and the use of consultants for



- 4 -
supervision and contractors for carrying out most rehabilitation works should
alleviate this risk. Delays in the acquisition of land could also affect
project implementation. Rowever, the Government has already started to
acquire the necessary land, which is minimal in extent, and has agreements in
principle with v-illagers for any further land requirements. In the unlikely
event of protracted difficulties in acquiring these last few tracts of land,
the Government still has the option of reconstructing the road along the
existing alignment. Finally, once the project is completed, a lack of
adequate funds and of procedures for maintenance could lead to deterioration
in the network.  The Government's commitment to increased maintenuice
provisions in future budgets will mitigate this risk.
15.      Recoendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed c--edit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

WESTERN SAMOA
R4ERGEICY ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
TECHNICAL AME
A. BACKGROMND
1.       Western Samoa has a land area of 2,934 square km and a population of
about 160,000. Both of its main islands have central volcanic peaks, the
highest being Mt. Mata'aga on Savai'i, and narrow, fertile, coastal plains.
Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism are the country's principal
economic activities. GDP growth has been slow at about 1.5Z p.a. but it
exceeded the 0.6Z p.a. net growth rate of the population during the 1980's.
The population is concentrated on the coastal fringes of these islands and is
reliant for communications on the circumferential roads on both islands.
There was an extensive road network on the two main Islands of Savai'i and
Upolu, totalling about 2,000 km of which 225 km were sealed. However, the
network had previously been considered inadequate because several key links
had not yet been improved to appropriate standards and also because of poor
overall condition due to the lAck of adequate maintenance.
2.       The Recent Cyclone.  Cyclone Ofa struck Western Samoa continuously
for four days from February 1 - 4, 1990. Wind speeds of 97 knots were
recorded, with reports of gusts of 105 knots, while wave heights in excess of
2 metres above normal persisted for one and a half days. Rainfall was
minimal, however coastal areas were flooded and severely damaged by storm
surges. The cyclone is now the worst on record, comparable only to that of
1889 which wreaked severe damage on Apia and washed the ships of the British,
American and German navies, in harbor at the time, onshore. The duration of
the cyclone, four days, meant that substantially more damage was inflicted
than is normally expected: the cyclone of 1966, previously the worst in
memory lasted one day Which is the typical cyclone duration. Damage would
have been catastrophic but for the fact that the cyclone was unaccompanied by
the heavy rain usually a feature of severe cyclones.
3.       The eye of the cyclone was located to the north of Samoa and damage
was most severe on the northern coasts of its two main islands where up to 40Z
of western style buildings suffered damage, in particular loss of roofing and
glass, while traditional buildings, based on the open Ofalem style of
construction, survived better. However, some villages located near the coast,
particularly on Savai'i, were virtually destroyed. Village schools and
hospitals suffered particularly badly, partly because of non-traditional
construction methods. Eleven people died, up to 25,000 people were rendered
homeless, water and electricity supplies cut off and telephone services
disrupted.
This kimex is based on the findings of a mission to Western Samoa
from March 7 tc 17, 1990, composed of Messrs. Emmanuel James, John Kerr-
Stevens and Sigfus 0. Sigfusson (Bank) and Mr. Edward Vowles (Consultant).

4.       Damage Caused by the Cyclone.  The most serious effects of the
cyclone were in the agriculture and transport sectors, but the entire country
was affected and total damages were estimated at US$140 million. Both the
subsistence and export sectors of agriculture were devastated. It is
estimated that local food production will take about a year to recover to 80S
of capacity. Breadfruit and banana crops were totally destroyed; taro and
other root crops 702; other vegetables 100X; and 50 of livestock were lost.
The deficit of local production against normal food consumption will be 55S
until crop production begins to be restored in the second half of 1990. The
impact on exports has been equally severe and these are expected to drop from
US$14 million to US$10 million this year. The Government has felt forced to
halt the expert of taro, the only crop of which substantial reserves remain,
in order to conserve local food resources.
5.       Damage to Transport Infrastructure.  The transport sector has been
severely affected. Preliminary estimates place the damage to the transport
sector at about US$40.0 million, or about one third of the total damage to the
economy. Although, on Upolu, the international airport at Falelo and the
airstrip at Pagalii escaped damage, the Asau airstrip on Savai'i was washed
away: no decision as to its reconstruction has yet been made by the
Government. Wharves and other port facilities and navigation aids in Apia and
other minor ports sustained damage and both inter island ferries were also
damaged: the Queen Salamasina, the ferry which operated the Apia - Pago Pago
(American Samoa) run was beached and is unlikely to be salvaged.
6.       By far the most extensive damage was sustained in the roads
subsector. By nature of its topography, Western Samoa is heavily reliant on
its two circumferential coastal roads and these have been extensively damaged.
Of the network of 225 km of sealed roads, together with the unsealed section
of the north coast road on Savai'i, 23 km no longer exist, while a further 25
km have suffered major damage such that reconstruction will be necessary.
7.       Response of the Government and the Donors.  The Government has
handled the cyclone emergency impressively. In 1988, the Government
established the framework for a Disaster Coordinating Committee to supervise
operations in the event of a cyclone or other natural disasters. Immediate
relief efforts were coordinated by the Committee with the assistance of the
disaster preparedness organizations of Australia and New Zealand, and with the
USA military operating out of American Samoa. Overall, donors are assisting
with the recovery effort in their traditional areas of emphasis, for example:
Japan (ports and quarry equipment); Australia (infrastructure); and New
Zealand (agriculture, education).
8.       As for multilateral agencies, the ADB has provided an emergency
grant of US$0.5 million to be used for the purchase of two electric generators
and is also reviewing its assistance program in the agricultural sector.
Also, ADB and IDA are jointly providing assistance under an ongoing
multiproject (C-1657 WSO) for the upgrading of a road on Upolu (para 22). The
reallocation of funds from this project for partial financing of the proposed
emergency works was explored but was not found feasible.
9.       The Government is now moving rapidly to initiate a reconstruction
program: funds from the Government budget have been made available through
the Development Bank for school reconstruction; and the Department of
Agriculture is developing a replanting program. However, the Government's own



- 12 -
resources are limited and it is therefore seeking further assistance from its
major donors. Additional financing for its long-term reconstruction needs
will be sought at a previously scheduled UNDP Round Table meeting in Geneva on
May 30, 1990.
B. IDA'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
10.      At the Government's request, a Bank mission visited Western Samoa
from March 6 - 17, 1990 to assess damages and recommend an IDA response. The
timing of the mission was rrranged to overlap with similar missions from
Australia and New Zealand. Prior to the mission's departure, an advisory
group had been established under Bank procedures for emergency operations to
consider the possibilities for an IDA response. In view of preliminary damage
reports from Western Samoa, the group endorsed the recommendation that the
mission be constituted so as to be able to undertake preparation and appraisal
of a transport infrastructure project.
11.      The roads sector was found to be the only area in which prospective
donor involvement was insufficient to satisfy extra-ordinary maintenance and
subsequent reconstruction needs. It was also the sector in which IDA had
previously extended assistance to Western Samoa (para. 21). The mission
therefore recommended a credit aimed at expediting the road reconstruction
effort. This credit will largely finance a two and a half year program of
road maintenance and rehabilitation which is focused on restoring the most
vital links of the network. The project has been designed so that it will not
place undue demands on the PWD and will also support and be closely
coordinated with current efforts by Government to develop its maintenance
capacity. The only bilateral donor active in the roads area, Australia, is
providing assistance to develop and execute a substantial maintenance program
but is also committed to other sectors; it therefore cannot allocate the
resources needed to undertake additional major works but will provide a small
amount of cofinancing for the proposed project.
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
12.      Objectives.  By the mission's arrival, Government and key donors had
completed a detailed damage assessment and had started to prioritize road
rehabilitation needs; project components were based on these needs. The
project is, therefore, intended to: (i) provide for the extra-ordinary
maintenance needs caused by cyclone damage; (ii) help finance the first two
and a half years of priority reconstruction and rehabilitation works; and
(iii) strengthen the PWD's planning, implementation, and management capacity
especially for maintenance.
13.      Compoents.  The proposed project, estimated at US$16.26 million, is
intended to support specific elements of the road program to be carried out
during 1990-92 and would include: (a) extra-ordinary maintenance of badly
damaged and destroyed sections of coastal roads in order to restore and
maintain temporary access and to prevent further damage while planning and
detailed designs are proceeding; (b) civil works for the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of three key sections of coastal roads (totalling 49 km), two
being on Savai'i and one on Upolu; (c) procurement of maintenance equipment;
(d) procurement of navigation equipment to restore full operation of the



- 13 -
country's ports and navigation channels; (e) consultancy services to provide
the detailed designs of the coastal roads on Upolu and Savai'i, and for
supervision of civil works, and for a brief institutional study; (f)
assistance to manage the proposed project, and (g) short-term overseas
training of senior PWD managers.
14.      Rxtra-ordizary Maintenance.  Basic access on most of the country's
road network was restored soon after the cyclone. Full reconstruction/
rehabilitation of the most damaged section- will take 2-3 years. Extra-
ordinary maintenance will be required for these sections to remain open to
traffic and safe during the period of planning, designs and tendering.
Contractors will subsequently take the roads over (most works will be on
existing alignments) and maintain them during construction. Extra-ordinary
maintenance of the following sections is included in the project:
(a) Coastal roads in Apia town (about 8 km) including pothole and curb
repa rs, restoration of walkways and stabilizing of shore
protection (1.2 km);
(b) several badly damaged sections (totalling about 8 km) on Upolu's
East Coast Road between Fagalii and Falefa;
(c) three sections on Savaili's east and north coast where the whole
road formation was lost: Tuasivi-Saipipi (5 km), Saleaula-Sasina
(7 km) and Salaua-Asau (3 km); and
(d) plantation access roads that were blocked and damaged by trees and
other debris.
15.     RiconstructionlRehabilitation.  Works would include reconstruction/
rehabilitation of three key coastal road sections:
(a) from Salelologa to Puapua (21 km) on the east coast of Savai'i
linking the major villages of the island. The most exposed 5 kn
of this road section, located on top of, or on the seaward side of
coastal sand dunes, were destroyed; another less exposed 5 km of
the section, located further from the sea and often on the
landward side of the dunes, are badly damaged, while the remaining
9 km sustained only minor damage. Destroyed sections would be
relocated on higher ground, as the coastal dunes on which they
were previously located have disappeared in many cases, and to
prevent or mitigate future cyclone damage. The other sections
would be reconstructed/rehabilitated on the old alignment but
shore protection will be provided where required for some of the
badly damaged sections;
(b) between the villages of Satau and Asau (9 km) on the north coast
of Savai'i. Some 4 km were destroyed, another 3 km badly damaged
and the remainder sustained only minor damage; the location of
this section is similar to the one discussed under (a) above and
remedial and mitigating measures would also be similar; and
(c) the east coast road on Upolu from Moataa at the eastern end of
Apia to Falefa (19.1 km). Some 3.5 km were destroyed, another 5.0
km were badly damaged and the remainder sustained minor damage.



- 14 -
Nearly all of this road is located on the shore, the destroyed
sections on top of the seaward side of sand dunes (or ridges) or
on rocky bluffs highly exposed to wave action; the badly damaged
sections are further away from the sea and the least damaged
sections are outside the reach of the sea.   Very little
relocation of the destroyed and badly damaged sections is possible
and the road will be reconstructed on or close to the old
alignment, with significantly Improved shore protection to
mitigate future cyclone damage.
The roads will be rebuilt to a two-lane standard, appropriate to expected
traffic volumes, with a crushed stone base and double bituminous surface
dressing. As indicated above, some relocation is desirable and by the end of
the appraisal mission, Government had acquired most of the land required or
had agreements in principle with villagers for the remainder.
16.      goiPmnt.
(a) Given the assistance from AIDAB, PWD can be considered to have the
capacity required for normal maintenance activities (para. 22).
However, restoration and extra-ordinary maintenance of roads after
the cyclone will place heavy demands on the existing equipment
fleet and thus there will be a need for equipment replacement.
The project, therefore, provides for an amount of about US$0.80
million for the procurement of maintenance equipment; and
(b) navigation facilities (lights, beacons, markers) in four ports
(Apia, Mulifanua, Salelologa and Asau) and their channels as well
as in three lighthouses (Faleula, Apolima and Aleipata) were
either destroyed or severely damaged during the cyclone. The
project will finance replacement and repairs of these facilities.
17.      Consultancy Services.  Detailed design is requiret for the east and
north coast roads of Savai'i (95 km) and the east coast road of Upolu (19 km).
The design of the Savai'i roads will require some 22 staffmonths of foreign
and 12 staffmonths of local consultancy services while the design of the Upol'i
road would require some 12 staffmonths of foreign and 6 staffmonths of local
consultancy services. Supervision of construction would require some 90
staffmonths of foreign and 40 staffmonths of local consultancy services.   In
addition, a brief study of the institutional capacity for overall transport
planning in Western Samoa will be carried out and would require some 8
ftaffmonths of foreign experts. Furthermore, the project manager will be
required for some 42 staffmonths during the project period.
18.      Overseas Trainin .  A small sum has been included in the project to
provide for short-term overseas training of about three PWD managers. This
training will mostly consist of attendance by high-level managers at major
international road maintenance seminars. It is directly relevant to enabling
PWD to better plan and implement maintenance of the road network.
19.      Project Cost.  The basis for the estimates for civil works is the
feasibility studies, which were carried out in 1988, updated to May 1990 price
levels and adjusted by the consultants after field visits to assess damages
shortly after Cyclone Ofa. Physical contingencies of 25S have been added for
civil works because of the preliminary nature of the assessments. Costs of



- 15 -
the consultancy services are estimated on the basis of lengths of roads to be
designed and constructed. Price contingencies are included on the basis of 5t
per annUm for local cost, and of 5.4X for 1990 and 4.3Z per annum thereafter
for foreign costs. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Table 1 and are
summarized below.

The proposed IDA credit of US$14.00 million would finance 86.1Z of total
project cost (90.O of total cost net of taxes and duties) while AIDAB would
finance up to US$0.5 million or 3.12 (3.2Z net of taxes and duties). The
Government would finance the remaining US$1.76 or about 10.8? of the total
estimated cost.
D. IMPLEMENTATION AND ORGATIU&ION
21.      Previous Experience.  IDA has been involved directly in two previous
transport sector operations. The First Highway Project (FY75, C-535 WSO)
provided for the upgrade and sealing of the East Coast and Central Cross
Island roads, both in Upolu. The second IDA involvement was the sealing of
the South Coast Savai'i road under an agricultural credit (FY79, C-951 WSO).
Both projects were completed satisfactorily. However, it appears that there
was insufficient maintenance activity subsequent to completion as the road
network had deteriorated extensively in the recent past. The current
activities in the road sector, complemented by the proposed project, have
benefitted from lessons learned. When taken together, they are expected to
fulfill the needs for reconstruction and upgrading as well as for maintenance.
22.      Activities in the Road Sector.  The Government currently has ongoing
now or is about to starti (i) rehabilitation of about a 19 km stretch
(estimated at US$4.1 million) of a main road on Upolu under the ADBIIDA
multiproject (C-1657 WSM); (ii) a partly AIDAB-financed resealing program
(approximately US$4.8 million) for some key links of the Upolu main road; and
(iii) an also partly AIDAB-financed mechanical workshop upgrading and training
program (approximately US$7.5 million). The implementation arrangements for
all of these projects were reviewed and found to be satisfactory. Details of
PWD's organization for project implementation are shown in Chart 1.
23.      Maintenance.  AIDAB's two closely related projects are aimed at
improving and increasing PWD's maintenance capabilities as required to meet
its medium-term needs. However, in order to assure adequate maintenance,
there is a further need for: (a) additional equipment, which is being
provided under the proposed project (para. 16 (b)]; and (b) a commitment from~
Government for adequate funding of maintenance. Therefore, at negotiations
the Government agreed to provide adequate annual budgetary allocations for
routine road maintenance. These are estimated to be at least US$0.9 million
in 1991, US$1.2 million in 1992 and US$1.5 million in real terms annually
thereafter.
24.      Project Manatement.  The project would be executed by PWD with the
assistance of a project manager specifically employed for this purpose in
order not to divert PWD's limited managerial resources. As implementation of
the project needs to be closely coordinated with the two ongoing AIDAB
financed projects which are aimed at building up PWD's road maintenance
capabilities, AIDAB has agreed in principle to finance the project manager's
position under joint financing and terms of reference have been agreed between
the Government, AIDAB and IDA. The Government agreed at negotiations that, as
a condition of credit effectiveness, the project manager will be appointed,
and be assisted by a suitable PWD staff, both with experience and
qualifications acceptable to the Association. An implementation schedule for
the project was prepared in consultation with GWS at appraisal and is shown in
Chart 2.

1/ Procurement by international shopping.
2/ To be financed by AIDAB.
26.      The emergency maintenance will be carried out by PWD's own forces,
while civil works for road rehabilitation will be carried out under three
contracts tendered and awarded on the basis of limited ICB procedures by firms
that have had experience in Western Samoa or have participated in previous
prequalification exercises there. A list of such firms was agreed with
Government at appraisal (see Project File). The three contracts will be
subject to prior review by the Bank.
27.      Because of the small size of equipment procurement and since
standardization is of high priority for small equipment fleets such as those
of PND and the port authority, project financed equipment will be procured on
the basis of international and local shopping by obtaining at least three
quotations from foreign suppliers and/or local agents. Items should be



- 18 -
grouped to the extent possible. Contracts for procurement of equipment
amounting to US$200,000 or more will be subject to prior IDA review.
28.      The consultants will be employed on the basis of principles and
procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of Bank Group guidelines.
Overseas training will be carried out under procedures, terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA. Contracts will be subject to prior IDA review.
29.      Disbursements.  Disbursements from the credit will be made against
applications as follows:
(a) Civil Works:
(i)   502 of the total expenditures for extra-ordinary
maintenance;
(ii) 902 of total expenditures for reconstruction/rehabilitation
contracts;
(b) Equipment: 1002 of foreign expenditures for directly imported
items; 1002 of local expenditures (ex-factory, net of taxes) of
locally manufactured items; and 652 of local expenditures for
other locally procured items;
Cc) Consulting Services: 100 2 of total expenditures; and
(d) Overseas Training: 1002 of total expenditures.
In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened in the
Central Bank of Samoa for the purposes of the project by the Ministry of
Finance. The use of the Special Account would be in accordance with
prevailing Government procedures. The account would be maintained in US
dollars and an initial deposit of US$1.5 million would be made as about the
average expenditures for a four-month period. Applications for replenishment
of the Special Account would be made quarterly or whenever the account is
drawn down to 502 of the initial deposit, whichever comes first. A schedule
of estimated disbursements is given in Table 2. The schedule differs
substantially from the disbursement profile of a standard highway project
because of the emergency nature of the project and its limited timeframe of
about three years. Disbursements are expected to be completed in less than
four years. The Closing Date of the credit will be December 31, 1994.
30.      Disbursements for items (a)ii, (b) for contracts over US$200,000, and
(c) would be made against full documentation of expenditures, while disburse-
ments for other items would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs). Disbursements for items (a)(i) at 502 represent the major part of the
cost of equipment operation such as spares, fuel, and other imported
materials. Withdrawal applications would be aggregated as required to conform
to the following minimum thresholds: reimbursement -- US$50,000 equivalent,
direct payment -- US$50,000 equivalent in local currency; letter of credit --
US$50,000 equivalent.
31.      Retroactive Pinancing.  Retroactive financing, not to exceed SDR 1.1
million, would be provided for expenditures incurred after March 7, 1990 and
before the date of the Credit Agreement. This financing will include: (i)



- 19 _
the extra-ordinary maintenance; (ii) the consultancy contract for Savai'i. road
detailed engineering; and (iii) advances to contractors.
32.      hnvironvmnt.  Implementation of the project is neither expected to
generate any adverse environmental impacts nor require any resettlement of
people. Adherence to normal GWS environmental guidelines during construction
will suffice. No formal environmental assessment is needed.
33.      Monitoring and Auditing.  The agreed project implementation schedule
is shown in Chart 2. As the executing agency of the project, FWD would keep
records of all procurement documents (including bids and proposals and their
evaluation and contract awards), and official decisions on each project
element showing accumulated expenditures, monthly payments and other
administrative data. With the assistance of the project manager, the FWD will
prepare quarterly reports with the above information in accordance with a
format acceptable to the Government and the Association.
34.      Monitoring and supervision of the project would focus generally on
the status of the road network and the effectiveness of its maintenance and,
in particular on the progress and quality of implementation of the project.
The Government gave assurances at negotiations that:
(a) the executing agency would keep separate accounts for the proposed
project;
(b) the project accounts, including documentation for SOEs, would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the
Association; and
(c) the detailed audit reports would be submitted to the Association
within nine months after the end of each fiscal year. In
addition, PND will prepare and furnish to the Association, within
nine months of the final disbursement from the IDA credit, a
completion report on the execution and initial operation of the
project.
B. AGREDENS RE&CUE
35.      At negotiations, the GWS agreed to the followings
(a) to provide adequate annual budgetary allocations for routine road
maintenance (para. 23); and
(b) as a condition of credit effectiveness to appoint and retain a
project manager who is to be assisted by a PWD staff member (para.
24).
