This will\n            be accomplished by:  (i) establishing priority research\n            programs to focus on those agricultural activities which are\n            economically important; (ii) establishing multi-disciplinary\n            research teams to work on those programs; (iii)\n            strengthening linkages between research, extension and the\n            farming community; and (iv) establishing a national\n            extension service.  The project components include:  (a)\n            strengthening the Department of Research and Extension; (b)\n            strengthening research activities; and (c) establishing an\n            extension service.
