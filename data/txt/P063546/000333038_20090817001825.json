System\n            Investment Project for Croatia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            is important to thoroughly assess commitment by all the\n            institutions involved as the absence of a full buy-in by all\n            the institutions may negatively affect the achievement of\n            project objectives. Consensus building among the\n            stakeholders is critical to the success and sustainability\n            of any pension reform. It is important to correctly assess\n            the capacity of the institutions to implement reforms\n            identified in the project. Project teams should agree on a\n            set of well-defined relevant indicators and carefully\n            monitor them during project implementation. A well planned\n            institutional strategy can support the creation of well\n            functioning institutions."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
