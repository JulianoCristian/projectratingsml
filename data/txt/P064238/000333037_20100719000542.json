the Northern Restructuring\n            Project for Russian Federation were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: both the\n            federal and local restructuring components provided support\n            to develop or amend federal and municipal reforms in housing\n            and utility services management as an integral part of\n            increased management capacity of the federal and municipal\n            level. The comprehensive approach to voluntary out-migration\n            was essential in the effective demonstration of the\n            cost-effective interventions supported by the project. The\n            out-migration supported included essential elements such as\n            voluntary outmigration, choice of recipient location, local\n            restructuring plans, comprehensive information, and public\n            relations campaigns. Projects' design should build\n            flexibility to adjust on the basis of experience during\n            implementation; project legal documentation should reflect\n            this flexibility and implementation particularities should\n            be included in the operational manual. Selection of a\n            limited number of participating municipalities and using a\n            pilot as the vehicle was the right instrument to test\n            measures to support and expand outmigration."}, "docdt": "2010-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
