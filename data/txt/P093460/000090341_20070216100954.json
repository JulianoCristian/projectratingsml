to support policy and institutional\n            reforms in furtherance of the Government's Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSCs focus on four\n            critical reform themes: (i) consolidating macroeconomic\n            discipline and strengthening of governance; (ii) sharpening\n            competition and entrenching property rights; (iii)\n            mitigating social and environmental risks; and (iv)\n            modernizing the rural economy. The first and the second\n            PRSCs were extended in November 2004 and January 2006,\n            respectively. PRSC-III is now being presented for Board\n            approval and PRSC-IV will be extended on the basis of policy\n            and institutional reform actions taken as agreed with IDA."}, "docdt": "2007-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
