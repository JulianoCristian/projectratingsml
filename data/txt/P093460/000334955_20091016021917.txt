1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Political background. Armenia's birth from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 took
place at a time of severe economic difficulty exacerbated by natural disasters and energy
shortages as well as by an armed conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. Over the past decade, Armenia has maintained political stability. Presidential
and national assembly elections took place about a year before credit appraisal in early 2003 with
the emergence of a coalition government. However, opposition parties boycotted parliament
following the 2003 elections, alleging electoral fraud. Since 2002, Armenia's rating on political
rights by Freedom House has declined somewhat. Surveys indicated that corruption remained
and remains a serious problem.
Economic background. Following a period of hyperinflation, fiscal crisis and severe economic
contraction after independence in 1991-93, the Armenian authorities carried out a successful
stabilization and structural reform program. Trade and prices were liberalized, the legal
framework for a market economy was established, most small- and medium-sized enterprises
were privatized, and the government intervention in the economy was considerably reduced.
Economic growth averaged 5.5% per year during 1994-2000, one of the highest among the CIS
countries. Growth accelerated to an annual average of 12% in the 2001-03 period, driven by
export expansion and significant contributions from the construction, industry and service sectors.
While the diaspora and official donors financed much of the construction through grants,
investment in tradable goods contributed increasingly to growth during this period. Fiscal deficits
fell in the early years of the decade, and inflation was confined to 2-3% in 2001-02 but flared to
8.6% in 2003. Aided by rapid growth, strong inflow of remittances, and an expanding social
assistance program, the rate of poverty had begun to fall sharply, but the overall level of poverty
remained high and there was particular concern at the concentration of poverty in urban centers
outside the capital.
Other developments prior to appraisal of the first PRSC. In late 2003, the Armenian authorities
published an ambitious Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), laying out a comprehensive
program stretched over a decade for sustaining high rates of growth and directing public
resources sharply towards fighting poverty. From the range of interventions proposed in the PRSP,
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), endorsed by the Bank's Board of Executive
Directors in June 2004, focused on three areas that best fit the Group's comparative advantage
and complement the activities of other donors: (i) promotion of private sector led growth, through
increased efficiency in public services and strengthened competition; (ii) re-orientation of growth
to fighting poverty, through accelerated job creation in the private economy, modernization of the
rural economy, and effective social protection systems; and (iii) reduction of non-income poverty,
through education, health and infrastructure reforms. The PRSC series followed a set of five
Structural Adjustment Credits that had supported the initiation of deep market-oriented reforms in
the country over the 1996-2003 period and which had been strikingly successful in its broad
objectives.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
Program Development Objectives. Within the framework of the country's PRSP and the Bank's
CAS, the Program Document of PRSC I outlined the overall development objectives for the
proposed series of PRSCs in terms of four themes as follows:
      1. Consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening governance. The first theme
      of consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening governance recognizes that a



                                                1
      continuation of Armenia's exemplary macroeconomic performance over the past five years
      is necessary to underpin high rates of growth. Moreover, governance reforms that cut
      across budget, fiduciary, revenue raising (customs and tax), and public administration
      institutions and sectors will improve the climate for private sector investment, remove
      important opportunities for corruption, and enhance revenue mobilization.
      2. Sharpening competition and entrenching property rights. The second theme of
      sharpening competition and entrenching property rights - -cutting across trade, utilities
      regulation, property and contract law, banking and capital markets, and rural sectors --
      addresses the key weaknesses in the competition environment. Armenia needs to reduce
      costs and sharpen its competitive edge by complementing its highly liberal regime in trade
      in goods with liberalization in key services and by consolidating its impressive reforms in
      state owned utilities. In addition, entrenching property rights through provision of a legal
      framework for secured transactions, by instilling confidence in the banking sector, and by
      developing insurance markets is essential to secure growing rates of private investment.
     3. Mitigating social and environmental risks. Social and environmental risks - the third
     theme - that cuts across education, health, social risk management and environmental
     protection sectors - are designed to be mitigated by a program of reforms directed at raising
     both the share of public spending devoted to these sectors and the quality of spending
     through changes in their composition and institutional reforms, notably in the private
     provision of health and pension services. The resulting strengthening of human capital and
     reduced risks for sustainable livelihoods in natural resource use will greatly assist in the
     reduction of poverty.
     4. Modernizing the rural economy. Interventions in the rural economy -- the final theme -
     that cut across the agriculture, non-farm incomes, and infrastructure sectors - are intended
     to modernize a lagging sector of the economy and one in which the impact of growth on
     poverty needs to be further strengthened. Greater predictability and sustainability in public
     services in rural Armenia is expected to strongly benefit the fight against poverty.

Specific Measures and Key Indicators. The specific measures associated with each of these
themes are described in sections 2.1 and 3.2 below. The expected outcomes associated with these
program development objectives are presented in Annex 1.

1.3 Revised Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The original Program Development Objectives within these four themes were maintained
throughout the first three PRSCs of the series with only marginal changes in program elements.
Specifically, under the theme of Consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening
governance, (i) measures to improve external auditing were dropped after PRSC I because the
government decided to give priority to internal auditing; (ii) measures to introduce a system of
staff performance appraisal for the civil service were added in PRSC III; and (iii) measures to
strengthen corporate governance by requiring public disclosure of beneficial owners of traded
companies were added to PRSC III. The latter two measures were introduced following Bank-
supported analytical work and the government's interest in implementing some of the associated
recommendations. Key indicators associated with these new PDOs are presented in Annex 1. In
the PRSC IV, the scope of the Policy Matrix was somewhat reduced, and the themes were
refocused to Strengthening Public and Corporate Governance, Strengthening Competition, and
Mitigating Environmental Risks.

1.4 Original Design and Revisions
The PRSC series was initially designed in mid-2004 as a series of three single tranche credits of
US$20 million equivalent each that would support the government's reform program and provide
predictable budget support on an annual cycle. Based on the 2004 CAS, the financing provided
through the PRSCs amounted to about 33% of the total lending program to Armenia during this
period. This design was implemented as planned except that, following approval by Bank
Management and Board: (a) the credit amount for PRSC III was increased to US$28 million
equivalent in order to provide financial resources for the government to procure equipment
needed for the reform of its customs and tax administration; (b) approval of PRSC III was
somewhat delayed from late 2006 to early 2007 so that the government had additional time to
complete agreed measures; (c) beginning with PRSC III, the final maturity of the IDA credit was
reduced from 40 years to 20 years in light of Armenia's increasing per capita income and
improving external position; and (d) prior to approval of PRSC III, given Armenia's continued
strong reform performance, which qualified it for the CAS "high case," it was agreed that the
series would be extended to include a PRSC IV, for which the credit amount was set at US$18.5
million within the overall IDA allocation to Armenia.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance
Over the PRSC period, macroeconomic stability was maintained with fiscal deficits being small
in relation to GDP, a flexible exchange rate policy led to substantial nominal and real
appreciation of the dram, monetary policy was geared to securing low inflation, and highly
cautious external borrowing policy led to a sharp fall in the debt to GDP ratio. Growth averaged
double digit rates annually and poverty plunged.
Impressive progress was achieved across the structural reform agenda. Improvements in customs
and tax administration helped to raise the tax to GDP ratio ­ a critical objective in light of the
need to enhance revenue mobilization. Public management reforms centered on budget
decentralization, progress towards program budgeting, and the implementation of devolved
authority to schools, hospitals and other public entities. Business conditions were improved
through legal improvements in secured transactions and in corporate governance. Regulatory
reforms led to improvements in the quality of utility services, notably telecommunications and
some liberalization in civil aviation was achieved. The social sectors saw a re-dimensioning of
the teaching force and of hospitals to better reflect needs and improvements in social protection.
The rural economy benefitted from strengthened extension services and environmental protection.
The PRSC framework helped discipline the budget to the MTEF and PRSP priorities. It also
fostered closer cooperation between the ministry of finance and the line ministries in allocating
resources as well as reaching decisions on reform priorities.
The following table lists the Prior Actions, as specified in the associated financing or credit
agreements that were taken by the government as the basis for the approval of each of the four
credits in the series. Given the nature of programmatic operations, these actions were by
definition fulfilled by the time of Board approval.

These Prior Actions were consistent with the Triggers that had been specified in the preceding
operation. However, in some areas, the time period for implementing desired reforms was
extended. As detailed in section 3.2 below, these areas were: reforms in tax and customs
administration, liberalization of air services, development of a multi-pillar pension system,
development of a private health insurance system, and monitoring and control over illegal
logging. In these areas, it was a common pattern that the Prior Actions were less specific than the
corresponding Triggers. For example, PRSC II included a Trigger for PRSC III indicating that the
government would "implement a more liberal civil aviation regime in line with policy statement
and market potential;" but the formal Prior Action for PRSC III involved only publication by the
government of a declaration of developments and intentions. Similarly, the PRSC II Policy
Matrix envisioned that, as a Trigger for PRSC III, the government would "adopt the law on
private pension insurance," but the formal Prior Action for PRSC III was "satisfactory progress in
determining the overall structure of the reformed pension system."
In two cases, there was no Prior Action corresponding to a Trigger in the preceding PRSC,
indicating that no significant action had been taken in that domain. Specifically:
        A PRSC II Trigger related to customs administration required the government to
        "complete and implement intelligence-based system based on risk assessment in line with
        program agreed with IDA." For PRSC III, this measure was changed to a milestone and
        not listed as a Prior Action. This action took place in the context of a re-programming of
        the reforms.
        The Trigger in PRSC II with respect to illegal logging was "Control illegal logging and
        forest removals within targets to be agreed by IDA by March 2006." However, the
        formal Prior Actions for PRSC III did not include any measures related to illegal logging.
        Instead, the Policy Matrix in PRSC III included a milestone "Developed plan for
        implementation of the illegal monitoring system." The complete fulfillment of this
        reform action was delayed to PRSC IV given the complexity of the institutional
        arrangements necessary, and it was achieved a year later than originally intended.   
The Policy Matrices for PRSC I, II, and III included a large number of "milestones" that were
fully consistent with the overall program development objectives. (For PRSC IV, the Policy
Matrix included only measures related to the Triggers specified at the time of PRSC III.) In some
cases, these milestones involved details that were directly associated with the reform measures
that were Triggers and subsequent Prior Actions, but other milestones expanded the scope of
measures into areas that were not covered by Triggers/Prior Actions. In particular, milestones
were established related to the management of irrigation and drainage, the budget management
system, internal auditing, procurement, bank regulations, insurance markets, early childhood
education, higher education, prevention of non-communicable diseases, private health insurance,
seed certification, and food safety and phytosanitary standards. Achievements with respect to
these milestones are discussed in section 3.2.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
The implementation of the program of policy and institutional reforms supported by this  PRSC 
series benefited from these factors:
        Since the late-1990s, the Armenian government has had a strikingly constructive and
        successful relationship with the World Bank. Even before the PRSC series, the country's
        economic reform programs had received substantial support from the Bank and had been
        successful at triggering rapid economic growth and significant poverty reduction. Hence,
        the Bank now enjoys substantial credibility in Armenia, and the Bank's overt



                                                6
   endorsement of any particular reform, ceteris paribus, is likely to be politically helpful to
   domestic champions of that reform. Furthermore, the Bank had provided a series of five
   Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs) (spanning 1996-2003) prior to the PRSCs, and the
   government was familiar and comfortable with this modality of engagement with the
   Bank. In addition, several components of the PRSC program were continuations of
   reform efforts that had started under SAC IV and V.
    The Armenian government has been seriously reformist in orientation. Throughout the
   PRSC period, Armenia stood at the top of CPIA ratings for IDA countries. The
   government took the PRSP process and product seriously and invested considerable
   effort in the associated analysis, policy formulation and public consultation. The PRSP
   in 2003 set broad priorities for the reform agenda, which were captured in a medium-term
   program for public expenditures, and then translated by the government into a Medium-
   Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF was a critical determinant of over
   subsequent annual budget decisions. In short, country ownership of the PRSP was high,
   and, to the extent that the PRSC program was grounded in the PRSP, it also enjoyed
   substantial country ownership.
   The authorities took the objectives and the specific reform programs of the PRSP as
   constituting the government's overall reform program in a disciplined way; thus, only
   economic and social priorities that had been specified in the PRSP were allowed to be
   financed by the budget. The medium term expenditure framework was derived
   exclusively from the PRSP and the annual budgets were, in turn, based on the MTEF. In
   this way, the government exercised firm control over the reform and budget processes;
   and the ministry of finance imposed discipline on the line ministries. This observation
   does not apply to those expenditures not covered by the PRSP, chiefly security related
   expenditures.
   In part because of their experience with SACs and because of their PRSP and associated
   planning processes, senior government officials had become more confident in their
   relationship with the Bank and in their use of development policy operations. In
   particular, senior officials perceived the PRSCs as useful vehicles for making
   commitments within the government and setting deadlines. For example, line ministers
   sought to include their reform agendas within the PRSCs in order to ensure that these
   agendas would receive adequate support from the prime minister and the finance
   minister. In turn, the ministry of finance regarded the PRSCs as means to exercise
   discipline on line ministries to undertake reforms and live within spending allocations.
   Throughout PRSC implementation, there was a single government in place; moreover,
   there was stability among ministers and senior government officials involved with the
   PRSCs. At the beginning of the series, the government created a committee to oversee
   the process, headed by the Deputy Minister of Finance, who had been deeply involved in
   the PRSP process. That committee remained in place throughout the PRSC series. In
   addition, the senior economic adviser to the president, who was also the Governor of
   Armenia for the Bank, throughout this period was a former Bank staff, and his
   involvement contributed substantially to achieving understandings between the Bank and
   the government. This continuity contributed in large measure to both the seriousness of
   purpose within the government and to the high quality of dialogue between the
   government and the Bank related to the PRSCs.
   During the PRSCs, there was also substantial continuity among the Bank staff involved.
   The Task Manager for the PRSCs (also the lead economist for Armenia) and the Country
   Director remained unchanged throughout the PRSC series; the Country Manager in


                                            7
        Armenia at the beginning of the series continued in that role through PRSC III; and there
        was substantial continuity among the key sector staff both in Washington and in the
        Armenian office. The PRSC team was concurrently responsible for analytical and policy
        advisory work and produced three major policy-oriented reports: The Caucasian Tiger:
        Sustaining Economic Growth in Armenia, annual Poverty Assessments and annual
        Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews. These factors contributed significantly both
        to the quality of the analytical work underpinning the PRSCs and to the richness of the
        dialogue with the government.
        Armenia enjoyed rapid economic growth during the period of the PRSCs, building upon
        its earlier reforms and benefiting substantially from accelerating inflows of private capital
        from the Armenian diaspora, including Armenian workers in Russia during that country's
        oil boom in the middle of this decade. This rapid economic growth generated increasing
        fiscal resources and made it relatively easy for the government to carry through with
        many of the policy directions set forth in the PRSP.
        In parallel with the PRSCs, the Bank had a wide-ranging program of investment
        operations and AAA in Armenia that complemented strongly the areas covered by the
        PRSC policy matrices. Furthermore, the Bank had access to large trust fund resources,
        especially from PHRD, that could be used to finance consultants to do technical
        assistance and analytical work associated with the PRSC-supported reforms.
Taken together, these factors created unusually favorable circumstances for the design and
implementation of the PRSC-supported program. There were, nevertheless, some factors that
worked against the PRSC program. In particular, there has been increasing concern that a small
set of business groups have expanded their influence within the government, including in the
parliament, and that they have been able to use this influence to maintain favorable, discretionary
treatment in many domains of public policy. Furthermore, there is still a widespread realization
within Armenia that corruption within the government, and even at the lowest level of public
service delivery, is not being reduced. The failure to resolve the dispute with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh resulted in large budget outlays for defense as well as the continuation of the
closure of borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey. Thus, economic growth was being constrained
and fiscal resources diverted from high return activities, which dampened the impact of reforms.
The possible impacts of these negative factors on implementation of some elements of the
program are discussed in section 3.2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Building on the very extensive set of monitoring indicators in the 2003 Armenian PRSP, the
PRSC documents included a broad set of outcome indicators. The set of monitoring indicators
initially set forth in Annex III of PRSC I (and included as Annex 1 in this document) was
maintained with some changes throughout the series.
The choice of indicators was, for the most part, reasonable. In a few cases the causal linkages
between policy measures to be taken and the indicators chosen to monitor their impacts was
conceptually weak. For example, the overall indicator of progress on "sharpening competition"
was the share of the private sector in GDP. In a few cases, the quantitative targets associated with
indicators lacked clarity. For example, the target for the share of rural households with gas was
defined in terms of a percentage increase from the base year but the value for that base year is not
provided. In some cases, such as education spending, indicators were defined as a share of GDP,
and the associated targets became questionable or inadequate because GDP growth was so much
faster than projected. Finally, there were a few instances in which there was inconsistency
between indicators and targets cited in the policy matrices and those included in the annex tables


                                                 8
on monitoring indicators. For example, with respect to the hospital rationalization program, the
matrix refers to targets for beds and physicians, but these indicators are not included in the table
of monitoring indicators.
For the most part, data on the selected indicators could be gathered by relevant agencies. The
National Statistical Service, which had become an increasingly engaged partner of the Bank and
whose capacity had been much strengthened by joint work on poverty and social monitoring and
analysis, conducted an annual household survey (the Integrated Living Conditions Survey) that
provided much of the information about poverty and utilization of social services. However, data
on outcome indicators tend to be less willingly supplied from the two agencies that were reluctant
reformers: the civil aviation department and customs and tax administration. Data was supplied
but with delays.
A key instrument for monitoring progress with respect to the PRSP was the annual report on the
PRSP produced by the government; and as the PRSC program content was derived as a selective
sub-set of the PRSP, these reports provided monitoring of the PRSC itself. The Bank provided
Trust Fund resources to help the government improve its M&E capacities and program within this
context. Capacity to undertake this task has grown steadily, in part as a result of the dialogue with
the Bank. The government's move toward program budgeting will likely encourage it to further
improve M&E.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation
Subsequent to the government's completion of its second PRSP, entitled its Sustainable
Development Program (SDP), in autumn 2008, the government and the Bank began to work on a
new series of development policy operations. The onset of the international economic crisis lent
urgency to this joint work, but also shifted its orientation towards reassertion of growth and
fighting the social effects if the crisis. The government began a process of revision of its SDP to
take account of the new international economic realities, whilst reaffirming the medium term
structural reformist thrust of its approach. The new development policy operation series was built
upon providing urgent budget support to finance counter-cyclical fiscal spending, support output
and employment and tilt expenditures towards social protection; at the same time, the program
sought to consolidate the reform gains of the PRSC series (such as in advancing reforms in
customs and tax administrations or in social protection or telecommunications regulation) and to
initiate reforms in new areas (such as in the fiscal regime for mining operations). The first of
such operations was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors in July 2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Even in retrospect, the overall reform program supported by the PRSCs was highly relevant to
the development challenges facing Armenia during this period. Having substantially completed
the first generation reforms for a transition economy during the 1990s, the PRSCs appropriately
focused on further improvements in public sector management, in the environment for private
sector development, in the social sectors and social safety nets, and in the rural economy. The
elements of the PRSC program were consistent with the 2003 PRSP, enjoyed country ownership,
and were largely oriented toward poverty reduction.
Furthermore, the broad agenda of the PRSCs was consistent with and supportive of the Bank's
wide-ranging Country Assistance Strategy. It took advantage of synergies across the Bank's
program. The complementarity of the PRSCs and investment operations was notable: in many
areas such as education, health, irrigation, utilities, the PRSCs provided support for policy


                                                 9
changes and institution building, whilst the investment operations in these areas provided
financing for infrastructure and technical assistance. The design of the series of four annual
single-tranche operations was well suited to the political circumstances because they spanned the
tenure of a single administration. Finally, given that the Bank had opportunities for financing
well-designed investment operations in a number of sectors, the amounts of IDA resources
committed to the PRSCs seems appropriate: sufficiently large to attract the serious attention of
the government but not so large as to crowd out other good uses of Armenia's IDA allocation.
However, there were several elements of the PRSCs that were driven by the Bank's diagnostics of
the binding constraints to growth in Armenia and enjoyed ambiguous support within the
government. First, reform of tax and customs administration. This was recognized by the
government to be important for attaining the priority medium term goal of raising the tax to GDP
ratio and for fighting corruption, thereby improving the conditions for business investment,
domestic and foreign. However, there were clearly powerful vested interests within the oligarchs
as well as within the revenue agencies that resisted reforms and the government's preferred
approach tended to be gradualistic and weak. Bank staff spent large efforts in fortifying the
content and pace of reforms in this area and the reform program adopted by the government
eventually was reasonable, but implementation continued to face opposition.
Second, the liberalization of air services. Bank analysis (detailed in the Caucasian Tiger) showed
convincingly the large costs imposed on a landlocked economy such as Armenia's and one that
faced closed borders with its two important neighbors of restricting competition in international
civil aviation. Reforms in civil aviation were not a part of the PRSP but Bank staff insisted that a
beginning be made with the PRSC series. Again the dominance of vested interests in maintaining
a monopoly in air services influenced the government.
Finally, in two other areas, institutional complexities and the need to coordinate closely across a
range of ministries and agencies ­ with mechanisms and the political will for coordination being
weak ­ meant that reforms had to be re-programmed to take place with one additional year:
controlling illegal logging and introducing food safety and phyto-sanitary standards. There were
areas where coordination across a number of ministries and agencies was required. In each of
these areas, the pace of implementation was slower than initially programmed, as discussed in
section 3.2 below. Bank staff responded with commendable flexibility to the institutional
constraints observed in the implementation of these reforms and re-programmed the pace of
implementation.
The PRSC series provided focused support to the government's efforts to combat corruption.
The IEG's Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) for Armenia in 2002 recommended that the
Bank should help Armenia formulate and implement an anti-corruption strategy. In response to
the CAE, the Regional Management noted that the government just published an anti-corruption
strategy with support from the Bank and that the Bank would attempt to do support its
implementation through the forthcoming PRSCs. The PRSC team judged that the client interest
in and commitment to implementing a broad-based reform effort was weak and, moreover, there
was little institutional capacity to undertake a broad-based agenda. No implementing body could
be expected to enjoy the independence and the support necessary for success at this stage. In
agreement with the government, the Bank team judged it important to proceed in a modular
fashion, focusing on key reform elements. Given the comparative advantage of the Bank, it was
decided to orient the PRSCs to reforms of the tax and customs administration, with the purpose of
fighting corruption, whilst improving the business climate. It was expected that with
demonstrated success with a modular approach, a holistic approach could be taken over a future
CAS period. In view of the difficulty encountered with this reform step, it appears appropriate to
have eschewed a more ambitious reform agenda in governance.



                                                10
Overall, the relevance of the PRSCs is rated as highly satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Overall achievement of objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
On balance, the achievement of objectives of the PRSC program was satisfactory. In each of the
four thematic areas, Armenia made substantial progress. As detailed in Annex 1 and in the
discussion below, most of the specific PRSC objectives and expected outcomes were
substantially and a few were partially achieved. Probably the most noteworthy successes were
improving telecommunication services, consolidating reforms in the management of public
utilities, improving property rights and taking other measures to strengthen financial
intermediation, greatly expanding real spending while improving efficiency in the education and
health sectors, increasing pension payments, and expanding agriculture extension services. By
any standards, this is a large and impressive body of reforms to have achieved in a four year
period.

 Significant progress was also made in various aspects of budget management, financial
accountability and procurement, corporate governance, tertiary education, rural infrastructure,
and in railway services and early childhood education. Areas in which there was progress but
achievements fell below initial expectations were: reforms in tax and customs administrative and
the liberalization of air services, programs to control non-communicable diseases, development of
private health insurance, and monitoring and control of illegal logging. On balance, an overall
rating of satisfactory is justified.

Consolidating Macroeconomic Discipline and Strengthening Governance

1.1        Maintaining macroeconomic stability.
During the period of the PRSCs (2004-2007), economic growth averaged about 13% per annum,
fiscal deficits were less than 3 percent of GDP, annual inflation averaged 3.4%, and foreign
reserves were maintained above the equivalent of 3 months of imports. The very rapid economic
growth--well above the 6% per annum rate anticipated at the time of PRSC Iwas driven in
large measure by a dramatic increase in remittances: recorded remittances (which probably
understate actual remittances) grew from about US$220 m (about 8% of GDP) in 2003 to over
US$1,200 m. (13% of GDP) in 2007. 1 This large inflow financed a major expansion of new
construction of both residential and commercial property, and the construction sector contributed
at least one third of total GDP growth over the period.2
During this construction boom, the government was able to increase tax revenue as a share of
GDP (from 14% in 2003 to 17% in 2008) and thereby to increase real public sector expenditures
significantly while keeping the fiscal deficits below 3% of GDP and reducing the external debt-
to-GDP ratio. Financed by the significant capital inflows mentioned above, the current account
deficit grew sharply from under 1% of GDP in 2003 to about 8% in 2008. Inflation accelerated
modestly from 2% in 2004 to over 5% in 2006, 2007 and 2008--above the PRSC target of less
than 3% per annum.

                                                  11
Overall, Armenia maintained adequate macroeconomic discipline during this period that was
dominated by an externally-financed construction boom. It met the targets of the IMF's PRGF
covering 2005-08.

As noted, the economy went through several structural transformations throughout the PRSC
period. One of the most pronounced changes was the dramatic shift in the growth structure
driven by a dramatic increase in the share of non-tradable sectors, namely by the construction
sector, moving out resources from tradable sectors of the economy. The construction sector had
nearly doubled its share in GDP generating almost 40 percent of the above mentioned average 13
percent annual growth in 2004-07 period. However, the rapid increase in externally-financed
housing construction contributed to structural vulnerabilities of the Armenian economy and led to
a disappointing export performance.

Economic growth was driven by productivity gains and accompanied with structural changes in
the sectoral composition of employment, but with weak job creation until the middle of the PRSC
period. However starting from 2006 the employment response to growth became positive, led to
a net job creation in the economy and reduction in unemployment rates both in rural and urban
settlements.

1.2 Public administration reforms.
Although the overall target for increasing the tax revenue/GDP ratio from 14% to 16% by 2008
has been achieved, the efforts to strengthen tax administration (which the Bank had initially
supported beginning with SAC IV in 2001) have proceeded slowly and with partial success.
Regarding the introduction of self-assessment systems, since mid-2006, taxpayers have been
provided the option to send tax declarations by post. The process of accepting returns has been
simplified, returns may be accepted through mail boxes placed in tax offices and the basis for
implementing electronic filing is being put in place. However, implementation of this measure
has not been encouraging mainly because administrative practices, such as the examination of
declarations by the recording commissions, had not been improved. 3 Most returns are still
submitted manually.
The Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) has taken some positive steps, such as periodic publication of
the list of 300 large taxpayers, but its organization remains inefficient and the share of total
revenues contributed by large taxpayers has declined.4 From 2009 steps have been taken to
improve LTU administration: there has been a pooling of efforts within one office, and selection
criteria have been strengthened. The goal of accelerating VAT refunds has been somewhat
thwarted by the continuing prevalence of apparently bogus invoices that require careful review.5
Clearing the backlog of VAT refund claims therefore has been retained as a structural measure in
the new IMF PRGF for 2008-09.6  
Overall, the common perception is that tax administration has improvedbut not significantly. In
the 2009 World Bank's Doing Business Report, Armenia's score on "ease of paying taxes" was

unchanged between 2005 and 2008.7 New results from the Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (BEEPS)--which indicated in 2005 that 63% of firms reported that tax
administration was a problem in doing business in Armenia--are not yet available. Tax
administration will benefit from the adoption of a three year integrated strategic reform program
adopted in 2008, which is the basis for continued Bank policy support.
Sound progress was made with reforms intended to strengthen customs administration (which the
Bank had also initially supported beginning with SAC IV in 2001), though implementation was
slower than initially programmed. A modern system for Direct Trader Input was established,
thereby reducing the interaction between importers and customs agents and hence opportunities
for corruption; this system is available in customs houses and offices, but not as yet in customs
warehouses. Moreover, the use of "green channels" based on risk assessment systems has
significantly increased.     However, the imposition of revenue targets on the Customs
Administration by the government led to a cautious attitude on the part of Customs in
implementing reforms. Reportedly one element of the agreed reform program--reducing the role
of reference prices in valuing imports--was pursued briefly in order to win approved of the next
PRSC but was subsequently reversed. Overall, during the period of the PRSCs, the customs
administration has greatly improved its technical capacities for better, less corrupt performance,
using funds for computers and software provided indirectly through PRSC III, and the political
will to eliminate discretionary behavior has been fortified, but implementation will continue to
require strong political support.8 Recent BEEPS data (August 2009) show that complaints about
unofficial payments to customs have fallen significantly; however, overall customs regulations
continue to pose a serious barrier to businesses.
Prior actions for PRSC I and II included merging responsibilities for irrigation and drainage
under the Water Resources Management Committee (WRMC). This was a step toward a
medium-term goal of increasing irrigation cost recovery. The lead responsibility for supporting
institutional reforms was taken by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) from 2006 and
the Bank team assisted the MCC in this area.

1.3 Public Management Reforms.
The measures designed to advance the budget management system and financial reporting during
the period of the PRSCs have been largely implemented, although the quality of that
implementation must still be substantially improved. The budget in all ministries is prepared on
the basis of GFS 2001 classifications, program budgeting is used in 14 state budget agencies; an
internal audit office has been set up in all ministries ad in the majority of central government
entities;9 IPSAS cash basis standard have been implemented in all ministries; and all State Non-
Commercial Organizations are submitting financial reports. The quality standards achieved so far
are uncertain and likely to be low. In particular, internal audit offices are quite new: pilots in two
agencies were started a few years ago and the expansion to all ministries took place only in 2008.
Hence, their technical capacities and authority (vis a vis other financial review offices from the
Soviet days that still exist) have yet to be developed, and their audits do not conform to
international standards.10 With respect to SNCO reporting, under current legislation, there is no

requirement for auditing SNCO statements, and information on receipt and use of funds is thus
not effectively verified.11 In short, positive steps have been taken during the PRSC period, and
the government has demonstrated serious intent to improve public expenditure management, but
sustained attention to improving capacities and standards is still needed.
With respect to external audit, PRSC I had included measures to create a new system. But, prior
to PRSC II, the Bank Government decided that this was too ambitious and dropped any reference
to external audit functions. Nevertheless, the Armenian government did begin to move forward to
strengthen its external audit function in 2007.12
On procurement, work began in 2004 on introducing an electronic system, and the government
approved a "Strategy for Introducing the System of Electronic Procurement" in January 2006.
However, the implementation of system has been delayed, mainly due to political change, lack of
capacity, an overambitious implementation approach, and the absence of a detailed action plan.13
Although data on the use of the Single Source method of procurement in Armenia is not
available, it appears that it has been reduced but is still higher than the international norms (5% of
the total procurement expenditure).14
Following initial work under the IDA Public Sector Modernization Project, a milestone was
introduced in PRSC III calling for the preparation of a strategy to introduce a system of staff
performance appraisal to support a merit based basic wage and bonus system. As expected, by
2008, this staff performance appraisal system is being piloted in three key ministries.
Following implementation of surveys in Armenia during 2006 under the Reports on Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC), the government became interested in taking steps to improve
corporate governance, especially with respect to disclosure of the ultimate beneficial
shareholders of banks and public access to key company records. In response, milestones were
included in PRSC III and IV regarding necessary revisions in the banking law and registration
law. These steps were completed. As very imperfect indicator on confidence in publicly-listed
companies, market capitalization of quoted companies has increased from 0.8% of GDP in 2005
to 1.5% of GDP in 2008. This is well below the target outcome of 12% due largely to various
changes in securities laws.

Sharpening Competition and Entrenching Property Rights

2.1 (a) Liberalization of key services.

The PRSC goal of establishing a competitive telecommunication sector has been achieved. The
PRSC supported the modernizing of the telecommunications law and the expansion of
telecommunications services. In conjunction with its privatization of the telephone company in
the 1990s, the government had granted a 15 year monopoly to the private investor, Armentel.
However, without changing that monopoly over land lines, the government passed a new
telecommunications law in 2005 that opened mobile telephony and internet services to
competition. Based on that law, the government defined a new regulatory policy and has since
licensed three mobile telephone companies and about 40 Internet service providers. The number

and Internet services are now widely available. Also, as a milestone for PRSC IV, the government
has taken steps to modernize its procedures for allocating radio frequencies among commercial
uses, although the transparency and efficacy of these new procedures have not yet been
established.

The policy and legal regime governing air services, and the price and quality of those services,
have not improved to the extent expected under the PRSCs, though there has been a substantial
rise in the range and quality of air services (passenger and cargo) to the country. Before PRSC I,
the government had given exclusive rights through 2013 to Armenia's international air services to
a private airline, Armavia, in exchange for an up-front payment and an annual payment of US$1
million for the life of the agreement. Beginning with PRSC I, the government announced its
intention to liberalize the air services regime--but always with the caveat that this must be
"without prejudice to the implementation of already existing commercial agreements with private
carriers." In December 2006, the government issued a policy note stating: "The government
considers it appropriate to work with Armavia to achieve a more normal and flexible relationship
between the government as policy maker and Armavia as a private airline. The aim would be the
earliest possible negotiated removal of contractual limitations on the government's ability to
make and implement air services policy in the overall interest of the nation, customers and
airlines."
Two important reform steps were taken by the authorities with the support of the PRSCs.
Armenia concluded on "Open Skies" agreement with the US, which made possible direct flights
to the US without any restrictions and under conditions of liberal competition. Second, Armenia
negotiated a horizontal air services agreement with the European Union that permits the
designation of any EU carrier ­ this is a first step towards a fully liberal regime for the future. To
date, however, no modification of the contract with Armavia has been negotiated, and Armavia
retains an effective veto on any additional airline services. As a consequence, the flight
frequencies continue to be at sub-optimal levels, connections limited, and the services prices are
high,15 despite the entrance of new carriers to the market, especially on routes to central and
Western Europe.
With respect to railway services, the PRSC objective was to ensure that the Armenia Railways
would operate on a commercial basis with transparent rate setting. PRSCs I and II supported the
objective of setting up effective public regulation of an autonomous state-owned railway. At the
same time, the Bank provided technical assistance to the government on the design of a private
sector partnership. This came to fruition in 2006 with the government decision to concession the
railway operation and infrastructure through an international tender to a private operator. The
Bank provided technical assistance to prepare that tender. The concession agreement establishes
levels of investments and provides a framework for performance monitoring. But performance
standards and the rules and regulations to govern the relations between the government and the
concessionaire and for tariff setting are yet to be defined.16 The concession agreement requires
the railways--now renamed the South Caucasus Railway (SCR) -- to be run on a commercial
basis with transparent rate setting.

The broad objective of the PRSCs was to further strengthen the regulation of public utilities
(energy, irrigation, drinking water, and telecommunications) by the Armenia Public Services
Regulatory Commission (PSRC) and to raise the quality of service provision. This involved
implementation of an Integrated Financial Rehabilitation Plan and improved monitoring of
performance data. The PSRC, which was established in 1998 and with whom the Bank has
worked closely through a number of investment projects, has proven to be a very capable
organization and has kept the reform agenda on track. The envisioned reforms associated with
the PRSCs, including improvements in the operation of the electricity markets, have been
completed. The newly established monitoring system is functional and indicates that
performance standards for electricity and drinking water have improved steadily, as indicated in
Annex 1.

2.2 Entrenching property rights
Under the leadership of the Armenian Central Bank and in cooperation with private banks, the
regulatory and institutional arrangements for secured transactions were significantly improved
during the PRSC period. In order to enhance confidence in the banking system, the Central Bank
also modernized corporate governance laws for banking and established a unified supervision
regime for the banking sector. Finally, the government improved regulation and supervision of
the insurance industry. These reforms almost certainly contributed to a rapid increase in bank
loans to the private sector, an increase in private sector deposits relative to GDP, and an
expansion of the insurance industry. As detailed in Annex 1, all of the 2008 expected outcomes
for these indicators have been realized. Much of the expansion of lending was probably
associated with the real estate boom during these years. Furthermore, Armenia's score on the
"Ease of getting credit" as measured by the World Bank Doing Business Report 2009 improved
significantly between 2005 and 2008.17

Mitigating Social and Environmental Risks
3.1 Improving social protection and social risk management.
Important objectives of the PRSCs were to increase the share of poor families who receive
support under the family benefit program, which had been initiated in 1999, to differentiate the
amount of the benefit according to family characteristics, and to decrease leakage of funds to non-
poor families (i.e. to improve targeting). Based on the latest available data from the 2006 and
2007 Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS),18 there were substantial improvements in these
dimensions. The data for 2006 show significant improvements; the data for 2007 less so, but
there are reasons to believe that distortions are reflected in the 2007 data that understate the
improvement.
In evaluating the impacts of social protection programs, it is important to keep in mind that
poverty has fallen significantly in Armenia in recent years. The share of the population living
below the official poverty line fell from 34.6% in 2004 to 25.0% in 2007, and the share of the
very poor fell from 6.4% to 3.8% over the same period.19 The impressive reduction in poverty
was achieved by high rates of sustained economic growth the led to increases in labor income and

growth in remittances also played an important role.20 Pension payments and social assistance
payments (mostly from the family benefit program) also made a significant contribution.
Pensions have kept poverty headcount much lower than what it would have been without the
social transfers. The family benefit, which is targeted at the very poor, has less of an impact on
the headcount but has a large effect on decreasing the poverty gap and poverty severity. There is
firm and robust empirical evidence on this.
Given the significant decline in the absolute number of poor, the number of individuals that
receive payments under the family benefit program has fallen slightly in absolute terms (from
476,495 in 2004 to 470,078 in 2007).21 However, the share of the poor that have received
payments from the family benefit program has fluctuated in the range of 25-30%, as shown in the
table below. The share of the very poor receiving such benefits increased steadily from 40.6% to
64.6% over the same period; hence, in terms of errors of exclusion of the very poor, targeting
have improved impressively. This is important because the benefit targets the very poor. Even
though there was a very significant movement out of poverty, the coverage of the poor remained
constant over time, indicating a good targeting performance (obviously, those who moved out of
poverty were excluded from the benefit).
Finally, a comment on the original target of 70 percent coverage of the overall poor. This can be
judged to have been overambitious as resources allocated would have to be 2.5-fold higher. This
would be fiscally unaffordable and unsustainable.

                                received family benefit payments22

      Very Poor                40.6             50.8                   60.2                    64.6



In terms of errors of inclusion, performance remained impressive by international standards, even
if the ambitious goals set by the government for itself were not reached. The share of the bottom
two quintiles remained consistent over time at 70 per cent.
With regard to pensions, the objectives of the PRSCs were to increase the average pension paid
under the pre-existing pension system and to develop and begin to put in place the foundations for
a new multi-pillar pension system. These objectives were achieved.
The existing pension system is the broadest social protection program in Armenia: during 2004-
2007 about 48% of Armenian households reported receiving pension payments.23 The average
pension payment has been increased significantly: it almost doubled in real terms between 2003

and 2006,24 increased slightly in 2007,25 and then increased 62% for 2008 and 16% for 2009.26
Cumulatively, this will achieve the target of a three-fold increase over 2003 as established in
PRSC IV.27 Within the government's rapidly growing budget, the share allocated for pensions
remained flat at around 14% during 2005-2007 and then jumped to over 19% in 2008.28 Despite
the fact that average pension payments still remain low relative to average salaries, pension
payments have contributed significantly to poverty reduction: in the absence of pension
payments, the share of poor households in 2007 would have been 31.2% compared to the actual
25%, and the share of very poor households would have been 11.7% compared to the actual
3.8%.29
While increasing payments under the pre-existing pension system, the government has also
moved forward in designing a new, multi-pillar system. It has set a target date of January 2010 to
begin implementation. However, the feasibility of the new system in terms of fiscal resources and
institutional capacity is uncertain, especially in light of the current economic downturn, and
merits further consideration.30
Overall, the social transfers have played an important role in poverty reduction and keeping living
standards of the poor and vulnerable improved. The table below illustrates what will happen to
poverty among pension recipients and beneficiaries of family benefit, if they were reduced or
eliminated. The rate of extreme poverty among the FPB recipients would go up from 8.5 to 28
percent.
Finally, without the constant support of the PRSCs series, it would have been difficult to protect
the allocation of resources to FPB (and to pensions) as the government had shown clear intentions
to reduce outlays. The clear empirical evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in fighting
poverty helped to convince the government as to their value.

  In PRSC I, the target was defined as a pension/average wage ratio of 27.5%. Given the significant
increase in average salaries during the period of rapid economic growth, the average pension relative to
average salary fell from 21% in 2002 to 17% in 2006.27 By 2007 this ratio remained below the target of
27.5% established in PRSC I.

3.2 Raising the quality of education

Within the framework of increasing budget allocations to the education sector, the specific goals
under the PRSCs were: (a) to increase the efficiency and quality of education by decreasing the
number of teachers and increasing average teacher salaries; and (b) to define a strategy for early
childhood education and initiate pilot programs. Other goals were to consolidate high schools,
improve the per capita financing formula, and begin implementation of selected reforms in higher
education. All of these goals have been substantially achieved. Moreover, Armenia implemented
a radical decentralization in education, whereby authority was shifted from the line ministry to be
devolved to schools through the allocation of block grants and greater authority for school
administrations and boards. Schools were established as state non-commercial entities following
the New Zealand model.
Recognizing that the existing educational establishment was over-dimensioned, the government
initiated its program to enhance system efficiency by reducing the ratio of students to teachers (on
a full-time equivalent basis) in 1998, when the ratio was about 8. At the time of PRSC I, the ratio
was about 14, and the goal was to increase that ratio to over 16 by 2007 by dismissing over 6,000
teachers. Over this period, the government did take the politically difficult step of dismissing
teachers. The total number of teachers (not full-time equivalents) fell from 60,000 in 2000 to 42,
000 in 2008. However, as of 2007, the ratio of student to full-time equivalent teachers remained
at 14.0, and the plan for 2008 was to increase this ratio to 14.8. This is below the original target
for several valid reasons. In 2006, the government increased the standard program from 10 to 12
years of schooling, and this necessarily involved lower student-teacher ratios in the newly added
grades. Also, the original target had not taken into account either the need to have lower student-
teacher ratios in relatively isolated rural schools or the absolute decline in the number of the
student population.
Given its increased budget allocations to the sector (from 2.0% of GDP in 2002 to about 3% in
2007 and 2008) and the decreasing number of teachers, the government was able to increase
average teacher salaries steadily from Dr50,500 in 2005 to Dr90,000 in 2008 (in nominal terms),
thus substantially exceeding the annual targets initially established in PRSC I.
For early childhood education (ECE), the milestones included in the PRSC matrices were rather
modest: initiating and then adopting a strategy for ECE and then launching pilot programs
consistent with that strategy. Despite a slow start, the government did put forward a strategy,
embodied in a law approved by Parliament, during 2006, but this was more of a wish list than a
well-articulated strategy. Despite prodding from the Ministry of Education, UNICEF and the
Bank, the Ministry of Finance has not allocated any significant funding for an ECE program.
Twenty pilot projects involving about 500 children have been launched primarily with funding
from IDA, UNICEF, and local communities, and it is intended to expand these pilots to about 150
students soon. However, the targets for significantly increasing the proportion of poor children
participating in pre-school institutions, which were put forward in the PRSC policy matrices and
tables of expected outcomes, were unrealistic in light of the measures contemplated in the policy
matrices and have not be realized.
All of the other objectives for education envisioned in the PRSCs have been achieved. In
particular, as part of the strategy to improve higher education and consistent with Armenia's
undertakings in the 2005 Bologna Declaration, more than two state-run universities have met the




                                                20
standards so that their courses will be credited throughout the European system. However, the
amount of financing for stipends and scholarships remains extremely limited.31
3.3 Controlling health risks
The primary objectives for the health sector associated with the PRSCs were: (a) to improve
efficiency in the hospital sector by implementation of a hospital rationalization program; (b) to
increase the share of the health budget allocated to of Primary Health Care (PHC); (c) to develop
and put in place a framework for private health insurance; and (d) to develop and implement a
program for control of non-communicable diseases. These goals were to be pursued within the
context of increased budget allocations to the health sector. The measures taken under the PRSC
were expected to contribute to reductions in infant and maternal mortality and to higher
utilization rates for hospitals and PHC by the poor. Hospitals were transformed into state non-
commercial entities along a decentralized reform model.
During the period of the PRSCs, the budget allocations to the health sector increased substantially
from Dr16 b. (1.2% of GDP) in 2002 32 to about DR54 b. (1.5% of GDP) in 2008. 33 This
represents a high rate of increase in real terms ­ about 15 per cent per year ­ or what could be
absorbed by the health sector efficiently. The PRSC targets were, however, set as shares of GDP
and on the assumption of GDP growth of 6 per cent annually. With real growth being nearly
twice the target, and despite a strong real rise in health spending, PRSC targets of 1.8% and 1.9%
of health expenditures as a share of GDP as set forth in PRSC I and II proved to be no longer
relevant. Within this sharply expanding real budget, the share allocation to Primary Health Care
services increased from 33.4% in 200334 to 35.6% in 2007.35 This fell somewhat below the target
for the PHC share of 38.5% first set in PRSC II and remains below the target of 45% for 2009 as
set in PRSC III and IV ­ again in line with the absorptive capacity of the PHC sector. In the 2008
Sustainable Development Program, the government indicates that the allocation to primary health
care through 2015 will be in the range of 40-45%.36
The hospital rationalization plan has moved substantially forward in Yerevan, although more
slowly than anticipated as measured by the number of hospital contracts issued by the State
Health Agency. This figure had been reduced to only 115 in 2006 compared to the initial target
of 100.37 For the regional hospitals, by the time of PRSC IV, the government had prepared
rationalization plans, and the 2008 SDP indicates that these plans would be implemented over a
7-8 year period.38 Although all of the PRSC Policy Matrices (but not the Expected Outcome
tables) stated that progress in the hospital rationalization program would be measured by bed and
physician ratios, it was subsequently decided that these would not be appropriate indicators for
measuring efficiency in the system and, in the context of the IDA-financed Health System
Modernization Project, other indicators have been used.

The goal of developing and putting in place a framework for private health insurance, which had
been first included in PRSC I as a trigger for PRSC III, was overtaken by government decision to
institute ambitious reforms in pension insurance and, hence, the concentration of government
capacity on these reforms meant that private health insurance reforms were to be worked on at a
later stage.
As the government focused its reform efforts and capacity on hospital rationalization and PHC
reforms, the objective to develop and implement a program for control of non-communicable
diseases (NCD), was postponed. In 2007, the State Health Agency provided the Bank with a
strategy for NCD-related activities.39 In 2008 the SDP states that "the government in the long and
medium term perspective intends to...develop and continuously improve the national policy and
plan for prevention and control over non-communicable diseases."40
Among the health indicators included the PRSC Expected Outcome tables, the infant mortality
rate has improved modestly from 12.1 per 1000 live births in 2002 to 10.8 in 2008 but remains far
above the target of OECD rate of 5-6. Despite substantial improvements during the 1990s, the
maternal mortality rate has not improved on a sustained basis in recent years, as shown in Annex
1. Although it is better than in most CIS countries, it remains far above the OECD average of
about 9. Finally, the utilization rate of health care services (PHC) by the bottom two quintiles
was targeted to increase from 3.5% in 2003 to 10% by 2007 and 15% by 2009.41 As shown in
Annex 1, the actual rate increased initially in 2004 but fell back to 3.5% in 2006.42 In January
2006 the government eliminated fees on PHC services and so this utilization rate has probably
increased in 2007 and 2008.

3.4 Reducing risks in natural resource management for sustainable livelihoods
In the realm of environmental management, the primary objective of the PRSCs was to establish a
national forestry policy and the institutions required to monitor and control illegal logging. This
plan included the establishment of community-managed forest areas. PRSC I had also
established the goal of expanding the use of Environmental Impact Assessments, but this was
abandoned by the time of PRSC II due to lack of government commitment.
During the course of the PRSCs, the government adopted a National Forestry Action Plan and a
National Action Plan to combat illegal logging, and, after much internal debate about its location
within the government and its responsibilities, it established the multi-agency State Forest
Monitoring Center to monitor and control illegal logging, a highly profitable activity, involving
not only poor villagers but also well-organized and politically connected groups. Through this
process, the public awareness of the issues of forestry management and illegal logging was
increased. The monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of a senior minister, has
representation from various ministries and agencies (such as customs and tax and the police) and
the political authority to monitor illegal logging. In addition, the legal basis has been put in place


39
  The November 2008 Results Matrix from the supervision mission for the health project indicates that a
baseline budget for NCD activities has yet to be established but will be estimated by the Bank in the course
of its PER work in the sector. See footnote 7, p. 31.

   These are the targets indicated in PRSC, Annex III, p. 2. These utilization targets were expressed in two
ways: number of users as a percentage of total number of individuals in the bottom two quintiles (which is
cited here), and number of users as a percentage of the estimated number of ill individuals in the bottom
two quintiles. Recent data on the latter is not available.

for community forest management, which will likely lead to better control over use of forest
resources. But such community forest management is only in the pilot stage, and the authority
and capacities of this system remain to be established. It will likely take several years, at least,
for these positive steps to bear fruit in terms of better forest management.

Modernizing the Rural Economy

4.1 Stimulating farm incomes
As part of a broader program to increase agricultural sector production and incomes, the PRSC
objectives were: (a) to strengthen and expand use of the agricultural extension services; (b)
approve a new legal regime for the production of certified seeds and increase their use; and (c)
establish and stimulate the use of modern food safety and phytosanitary standards. The first two
of these objectivesexpanding extension services and producing certified seedswhich were
core conditions have been achieved, but there has been limited progress on the third objective
regarding food safety and phytosanitary standards, which were milestones in the PRSC program.
The national agricultural service had been established with IDA and USAID support in 1996, but
it had not received financing from the government budget and its capacity was limited. With
strong leadership from the Ministry of Agriculture, the government began to expand financing for
the service in 2006. Based on an independent survey, the percentage of farmers using the
advisory services grew from 29% in 2004 to 61% in 2008. Cost recovery from users of the
agriculture extension services has increased significantly, although in 2008 the 22% cost recovery
rate remained somewhat below the target of 30%.
At the beginning of the PRSCs, Armenia had no legal or institutional system for certification of
seed quality. Before PRSC II, a new seeds law was approved by Parliament, and procedures for
seed certification are now in force. Implementation has been good but somewhat slower than
anticipated, in part to allow existing seed producers to adjust to the new requirements. By 2008,
only 10% of seeds sold were certified, compared to the PRSC target of 30%, but this percentage
is expected to increase sharply in the coming years.
Progress toward putting in place new food safety and phytosanitary standards consistent with
international norms has been slow for several reasons. There had been no rigorous analytical
work on these issues prior to PRSC I; there has been lack of clarity within the government about
the relative importance of food safety standards for the sake of public health and phytosanitary
standards for the sake of promoting exports; and progress requires collaboration among three
ministries--Health, Agriculture, and Trade and Economic Development. The government was
able to mobilize technical assistance on these issues from the US Department of Agriculture,
FAO, the EC, as well as the Bank. Work toward approval and implementation of these standards
is continuing. The targets established in the PRSCs for a significant increase in the share of
agricultural products being tested and certified by 2008 was never realistic in light of the
challenges involved in setting up such a system.

4.2 Developing rural infrastructure.
The PRSCs supported completion of a diagnostic study covering all rural infrastructure services,
the establishment of an inter-ministerial working group to define and pursue an action plan for
improving these services, and the creation and monitoring by PSRC of rural infrastructure service
standards. Priority within the PRSCs was given to (a) clarifying responsibility for each part of
the rural road infrastructure in order to accelerate rural road reconstruction and (b) expanding use
of natural gas by rural households.




                                                23
The diagnostic and planning work has been done, including clarification of responsibilities for
roads, and an ambitious reconstruction/rehabilitation of the rural road system is under
implementation. The Bank has stepped up investment support in this area, partly as an
emergency response to the global economic crisis. The government had also relied on financing
from the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for its rural roads program, but the MCC
financing has been put on hold due to MCC's re-evaluation of Armenia's eligibility. The
weighted average of over 60% of roads needing reconstruction falls short of the PRSC target of
below 50% by 2008.43 In 2009, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have approved
an investment project that will finance rural road reconstruction.
The share of rural households using gas has increased steadily from about 35% in 2005 to 49% in
2007. Gas distribution is provided by private companies, but the government has subsidized
construction of supply lines to villages. This expansion of gas service is only slightly below the
pace envisioned by the PRSCs: the target was defined as a 50% increase in the share of rural
households using gas between 2005 and 2008; and the actual increase through 2007 was 40%
(49/35).
With some technical assistance from the Bank, PSRC has defined rural infrastructure service
standards and is also monitoring those services.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Given that relevance of the program supported by the PRSCs is rated as highly satisfactory and
the achievement of program development objectives is rated as satisfactory, the overall outcome
rating is rated as satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The rapid reduction in poverty in Armenia in recent years has been driven primarily by increased
wages reflecting the productivity gains in the economy against a background of rapid and
sustained economic growth ­ clearly, the PRSC-supported reforms contributed to this result.
Poverty assessments prepared jointly by the Bank and the authorities show a marked
disproportionate rise in the income of the bottom quintile and the bottom two quintiles as a result
of growth. The PRSC-supported program contributed in several other important ways:
supporting the design and the focusing of family benefit payments to the very poor; increasing
pension payments; and stimulating the farm economy on which many poor people depend.
Conditions for increased investment and job creation were clearly greatly enhanced. Over a
longer time horizon, the expansion and improvements in the public education and health systems
should lead to other improvements in social indicators. None of the PRSC-supported programs
were specifically directed toward gender issues.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening 
The PRSC program included many elements of far-reaching institutional reform and
strengthening, as detailed above, in areas of budget management, civil service management, tax
and customs administration, financial accountability, procurement, establishment of schools and
hospitals as highly decentralized and autonomous non-commercial entities following the New


43
  Republican roads include 4087 kms and local roads, 1962 kms, according to data in the Bank's 2008
Transport Policy Note. On this basis, the weighted average of the share of roads needing reconstruction is
60% compared to the target of 50%.



                                                   24
Zealand model, regulation of banks and other financial institutions, regulation of public utilities,
and corporate governance, creation of forest management and illegal logging bodies. These deep
institutional changes have to be followed up with sustained implementation and supporting
reforms for them to take root.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Armenia's prospects for sustained economic growth and further poverty reduction face increased
risk due to the unfolding global economic crisis, the emergence of political tensions as a result of
electoral unfairness (as noted by the OSCE), and the continued strength of dominant business
groups that distort competition seriously.
Already the sharp reduction in remittances and other capital inflows from late 2008 to date has
led to a dramatic slowdown in the construction sector. Prices of and demand for Armenia's
mineral exports have declined sharply, leading to some mine closures. The economy is projected
to contract by 15 per cent in 2009, and this will likely reverse temporarily the decline in poverty
rates. The fiscal resources that the government has counted on to continue expansion and
improvements in the education and health sectors and in its social safety nets have come under
severe pressure.
Coping with these economic challenges might be complicated by on-going struggles between the
major political parties, which became more intense following the disputed elections and related
protests in early 2008. The consequent issues regarding political rights have already led to delays
in financial support from major donors and could potentially lead to significant reductions in
bilateral development assistance.
Finally, further consolidation of influence by major business groups, which have extensive ties
within the government, might stall reforms that are designed to reduce discretion and increase the
rules-based character in public policies and strengthen competition in key sectors and services.
However, the government has responded with vigor to the economic downturn through counter-
cyclical policies aided by greatly increased external support. It is adhering to the underlying
philosophy and thrust of its reform program, even if specific reform measures have to be re-
programmed in the light of new fiscal realities.
In summary, the near-term risk to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction in Armenia
is rated as "significant." However, the medium and long-term risk is judged to be "low", given
the capacity within the country in the public and private sectors, the record of sustaining a reform
program over more than a decade, political stability and a clear vision for reform aided by
specific reform programs and measures, and the growing integration via trade, investment,
technology and above all in the realm of ideas and experiences with the rest of the world.
Highly responsible macroeconomic policies over the past decade have created the fiscal and debt
space for counter-cyclical policies that are now being pursued to support output and employment.
Moreover, the authorities have mobilized large scale external support from the Bank and the Fund
as well as bilateral. They are adhering to the reform course, maintaining an open trade and
investment system, and have redoubled efforts to build a knowledge-based economy. With an
equal effort on liberalizing air services and reforming customs and tax agency, the country would
be well placed to seize opportunities as the international economy recovers. The priority in
Armenia in the near-term must lie in maintaining the strong policy framework that it has put in
place and consolidating institutional reforms already started.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry  
In the initial design of the PRSC series, the Bank's performance was satisfactory in terms of
adjusting its own behaviors to the new guidelines for development policy operations within the
framework of the PRSP approach. The Bank made a serious effort to "put the country in the
driver's seat." Whereas previous SACs had primarily been designed by the Bank staff and
presented to the government, at the beginning of the PRSC series the Bank invited the
government to present its own program as the basis for dialogue and negotiation. In that spirit, the
Bank also tried to align the PRSC with the priorities established in the 2003 PRSP, recognizing
that the government had taken the PRSP process seriously and regarded it as a relevant strategic
document.
However, as noted, the Bank staff pressed for a vigorous approach to customs and tax reforms
than envisaged by the authorities and for a high priority for reforms in certain areas that went
beyond the PRSP: the liberalization of the air services and telecommunications regimes, the
expansion of early childhood education, and monitoring and control of illegal logging. Bank
analysis showed the criticality of these reforms for sustaining growth and staff believed that their
inclusion in the PRSCs would provide a vehicle for building country ownership over time.
The Bank's performance was also satisfactory in terms of aligning components of the PRSC with
its broader country assistance program in order to maximize synergies and complementarities.
The coverage of PRSCs I-III was quite broad, and the Bank's active engagement on so many
policy areas would not have been feasible in the absence of complementary activities in its
investment lending and AAA program. In this context, the Bank also ensured engagement by
sectoral staff in the PRSCs, which had not always been the case for the earlier SACs.
The Bank performed well in terms of synchronizing its appraisal and approval of the PRSCs with
the government's budget cycle so that the flow of Bank's resources could be taken into account in
the government's fiscal plans. However, from the government's perspective, it might have been
even better if appraisals had been consistently undertaken prior to September in each year, when
the government sets its budget for the following year.
(b) Quality of Supervision  
Throughout PRSC implementation, the quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory in two
respects. First, the Bank maintained an active dialogue with the government on all key
dimensions of the PRSC, and that dialogue was conducted not only with the Ministry of Finance
by the PRSC team but also with line ministries by the Bank's sectoral staff. The integrated
approach taken by PREM and sectoral staff was impressive. The concluding statements of Bank
supervision missions and follow-up technical notes provided to the authorities was succinct,
strategic and provided clear guidance as to resolving implementation problems.
Second, the Bank mobilized substantial resources through its administrative budget, trust funds
(especially PHRD), and other sources to provide analytic work and technical assistance as needed
during implementation. These inputs, including numerous "just-in-time" activities, were greatly
appreciated by government staff involved. Examples of the Bank's efforts in this way include
financing for study tours by government officials in tax administration and in bank supervision to
Estonia and elsewhere, and mobilizing financial support from the FIRST International program in
London to provide technical assistance to the superintendency of financial institutions within the
Central Bank.




                                                26
Third, the Bank undertook significant AAA work, especially the 2003 PER and subsequent
sectoral PERs, that directly or indirectly supported the objectives of the PRSC. The PERs, and
some other AAA, were undertaken jointly with the government, which proved effective. Finally,
the Bank maintained a high degree of continuity among staff engaged on the PRSCs, especially
among the core PREM and country office staff, although there may have been exceptions to this
continuity in the education sector.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Given the ways in which the Bank conducted the dialogue regarding the design and
implementation of the PRSCs and mobilized support for implementation, its performance is
evaluated as satisfactory. Senior officials within the government commented that they regarded
the Bank as fast and responsive and that they certainly had the feeling that the Bank was
"working for us and the interests of the country."
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Overall the government's performance was satisfactory. Prior to PRSC design, the government
had taken the PRSP process very seriously. That process was conducted under the responsibility
of an inter-agency committee that reported to the Prime Minister, and on occasion to the
President, and that was managed strategically by the Finance Minister (who held frequent
meetings with the PRSC team) and on a day-to-day-basis by the Deputy Minister of Finance and
Economy. At the beginning of the PRSC, the government established a similar inter-agency
committee, and the same Deputy Minister was the operative head of that committee. This helped
to ensure that the PRSC was regarded within the government as serving implementation of the
country's PRSP strategy. It also ensured high level and inter-agency attention to PRSC
implementation.
The government also made significant efforts to identify its needs for analytical work and
technical assistance and to work with the Bank, and in many instances with other donor agencies,
to mobilize that support.
The government's supervision might have been strengthened by greater attention to monitoring of
outcome indicators, as discussed above under Monitoring and Evaluation.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
There is no reason to distinguish between overall government performance and the performance
of the implementing agency.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
In light of its excellent internal organization for designing and implementing the PRSCs and its
willingness to use the PRSC process as a means for mutual accountability and deadline setting
within the government, the borrower's performance is evaluated as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
The experience with the Armenia PRSC series suggests the following lessons that should be taken
into consideration in designing future development policy operations in Armenia and elsewhere:
   1. A sound PRSP with supporting MTEF and a set of government-determined priorities
      were crucial to success. The broad coverage of policy issues and sectors within a DPO
      series, given the right circumstances, can be appropriate and useful. The first three PRSCs
      had such broad coverage, while the fourth PRSC focused on a narrow set of critical



                                              27
   reforms towards the end of a parliamentary period. Factors behind the successful PRSCs
   were: a long-standing relationship of trust between the government and the Bank; strong
   country ownership of most of the elements of the PRSC program; substantial
   complementarity between the PRSC program and the Bank's on-going investment
   operations and its AAA; and ample Bank resources, through the administrative budget and
   trust funds, to provide technical assistance as needed during PRSC implementation. In
   particular, the availability of Japanese financed PHRD grants for policy analysis and
   design, proved to be invaluable and essential to the success of the PRSC-supported
   reforms. When most or all these factors are present, broad coverage of DPOs can work; to
   the extent that they are not, coverage should be reduced.
   In this connection, as a country's own processes for strategic planning improve, future
   DPOs should continue to be based on the country's own strategy, but reflect rapidly
   changing world economic conditions. In the case of Armenia, the second PRSP that was
   drawn up just before the global economic crisis ­ the SDP -- and, perhaps more
   importantly, the MTEFs reflect increasingly strong government policy formulation and
   analysis processes. However, one problem in using the existing SDP and MTEF for
   designing new DPOs is that the global economic crisis has compelled major changes in the
   government's fiscal program and in the pacing of its reform agenda. With this in mind,
   the Bank will need to help the government revise its strategy in response to rapidly
   changing circumstances. Depending on the severity of Armenia's economic problems in
   the coming year, it may be appropriate to focus DPOs on maintenance of the policy
   framework already in place and fuller implementation of institutional changes already
   taken than to pursue new reforms.
2. The Armenia experience shows the value of including measures in the PRSC where the
   support of the government is nascent or mixed and where the potential exists to build
   support through the PRSC. Such support can be built through demonstrated persistence,
   the importance of careful underlying analysis, the use of international best practice
   examples and the importance of trust in relations with the client. The Armenia example
   shows that (i) such measures should be limited to those that have been demonstrated
   through robust analysis to be critical for sustained growth; (ii) inclusion of such measures
   should help build support while providing lessons; (iii) and implementation will be
   difficult and will have to be flexibly tailored in the light of experience. In view of
   Armenia's weakness in governance and severe problems with corruption and anti-
   competitive behavior, the Bank insisted on a strong program of reforms in customs and tax
   administration. Similarly, reforms towards liberalization of civil aviation had a sound
   analytical basis. The intellectual case for such reforms was easy to establish, and the Bank
   engaged in intensive advocacy, but implementation proved to be difficult and re-
   programming of sequenced reform steps had to be undertaken. Today it can be
   confidently said that the awareness of the need for customs and tax reforms is widespread,
   deeper measures are being taken, and initial important steps towards aviation reforms have
   been agreed. Thus, nascent ownership within important parts of the government for
   reforms that the Bank believes are critically important for the country was strengthened ­
   and in this connection, the high degree of trust between the Bank and its client played a
   vital role. In building support for reforms, the Bank should routinely undertake major
   AAA work that underpins DPOs as joint exercises with the government and, whenever
   possible, give the government the leading role in such exercises. In the case of Armenia,
   this was done, inter alia, for PERs and the PEFA, and this contributed both to the quality
   of the analysis and the ownership of the results within the government.




                                            28
    3. The PRSC experience also illustrated well the long term nature of implementation efforts,
       especially in complex second generation reform areas, the need to re-prioritize in the light
       of implementation experiences, the need for the Bank to be flexible with policy advice,
       whilst assisting the government to keep its focus on key PRSP goals. Pragmatic re-
       programming of steps in customs reforms or in health reforms proved to be necessary and
       wise. The PRSC proved to be a sound instrument for cross-sector work with the
       government as well as the Bank. Flexibility should extend to willingness to introduce new
       elements when doing so will likely facilitate their implementation. In the case of the
       Armenian PRSCs, analytical work on corporate governance and on a performance
       appraisal system, completed after the initial design of the series, gave rise to milestones
       included in PRSC III and IV. This proved useful in bringing broader attention to these
       measures across and the government and setting deadlines for implementation. Similarly,
       the Bank and the government should be flexible and willing to drop measures that no
       longer seem appropriate.
    4. The amount of a DPO need not be large relative to the fiscal program of the government
       in order for it to provide a useful vehicle for the dialogue between the Bank and the
       government and for facilitating implementation of the government's program. In the case
       of the Armenian PRSCs, they were very useful for these purposes even though the credit
       amounts were only about 2% of overall government expenditures. Indeed, some
       Armenian observers of the PRSC process commented that the dialogue related to the
       PRSC was more "honest and productive" than the previous SAC dialogue simply because
       the government had much less need for the money. Hence, the amounts of DPOs should be
       based on judgments about the relative efficacy of this form of budget support versus
       investment lending by the Bank.
    5. The Bank should encourage governments to assume full responsibility for M&E for DPO
       outcomes as an integrated part of its overall M&E system. This would enhance the
       understanding that the DPOs are the government's program, not the Bank's. In the case of
       the Armenia PRSCs, the Bank did this to some extent but perhaps could have done so
       more effectively.
    6. The timing of DPO appraisals and approvals need to be usefully synchronized with the
       government's budget cycle. In the case of Armenia, this means appraisal before
       September, when the government needs to know its likely revenues.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies
The Armenian authorities provided written comments of a factual nature largely to update data,
clarify the language in several places and to add explanations in several other places. Bank staff
found these comments to be helpful and fully acceptable and have reflected them in the text of the
ICR.

   These expected outcome indicators are a combination of those included in Annex III in each of the
PRSC Program Documents and those included in the four policy matrices. When expected outcome varied
among the four PRSCs, the corresponding target is denoted by I, II, III, or IV to indicate in which PRSC
that target appeared.
