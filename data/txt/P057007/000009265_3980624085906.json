Project aims at providing emergency recovery assistance to\n            the Government of Uganda for the restoration/rehabilitation\n            of key road and bridge facilities severely damaged by the\n            flooding, associated with the El Nino weather pattern. The\n            project will contribute to : i) decreasing\n            infrastructure-related market and distribution costs\n            countrywide; ii) securing the timely delivery of social\n            services to the affected population; iii) facilitating the\n            productive settlement of war refugees in Northern Uganda;\n            and iv) stabilizing the eco-system near the affected roads.\n            The project consists of four components. First, repair of\n            damaged road sections will support repairs and replacement\n            of pipe culverts on 96 identified sections of road\n            countrywide. Second, rehabilitation and regravelling of\n            Atiak-Moyo Road will comprise rehabilitation/regravelling of\n            90 kilometers of gravel road as well as repairs of five\n            bridges and two ferry landings. The third component will\n            repair or replace box culverts and about 120 bridges. The\n            fourth component is the procurement of pipe culverts and\n            Bailey Bridge sections. Finally, the fifth component will\n            finance consultant services for engineering studies and\n            civil work supervision."}, "docdt": "1998-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
