Three main lessons are\n            drawn from the project: 1) The design, and implementation\n            arrangements of an emergency project should demonstrate\n            realism, and should thus be simple, straight forward, with\n            strong focus on addressing the urgency of the emergency.\n            But, such a project should not be designed to address issues\n            unrelated to the emergency situation. In this respect, the\n            inclusion of the Atiak - Moyo road, could be seen as a\n            distraction, for both the Government and the Bank's\n            implementation teams, and should not have been included in\n            an emergency project. Moreover, to stress the importance of\n            institutional reforms - such as was the case of this project\n            anticipating the eventual transfer of functions from the\n            Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications (MOWHC) to the\n            Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) and a future road\n            authority - may also be seen as a distraction from the tasks\n            of organizing, and motivating assigned staff to focus on the\n            urgency of the task. 2) The case of this project suggest the\n            importance of ensuring that Bank procurement guidelines -\n            and how they are applied in an emergency situation - be\n            tailored to the need for a speedy implementation. Even with\n            fast tracking in preparation and appraisal, the response\n            time proved to be too long for the client. The Bank should,\n            as part of its operations reform process, examine this\n            constraint, and provide particularly, simplified procurement\n            guidelines and procedures to be followed for eligible\n            expenditures in emergency operations. 3) Appropriate\n            institutional arrangements are key to successfully handling\n            emergency situations. Most countries prone to natural\n            disasters, do not have institutional arrangements in place\n            to make a rapid response when disaster hits. However in the\n            case of this particular project, some interesting\n            developments did take place in terms of policy, and\n            emergency institutional arrangements, e.g. on preventive\n            bridge maintenance. The Bank should, as a general rule,\n            identify the risks of disaster prone, developing countries,\n            and help governments institutionalize arrangements, to\n            manage recurrent disasters."}, "docdt": "2004-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
