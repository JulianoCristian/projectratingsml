the Infrastructure\n            Development Policy Loan (IDPL) series has rapidly assumed\n            central importance in the dialogue between the Government of\n            Indonesia and the World Bank concerning the\n            Government's infrastructure reform program. The program\n            is built around four areas of engagement: national\n            infrastructure (e.g. electricity and roads); subnational\n            infrastructure (e.g. water); public-private partnerships;\n            and cross-cutting governance issues including land\n            acquisition, environment, and procurement. The common theme\n            in each of these areas is to increase the amount and\n            effectiveness of infrastructure spending, in order to\n            contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The\n            program is primarily grounded in areas of influence of\n            central ministries - the Ministry of Finance, the\n            Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, and Bappenas\n            (the planning ministry). For national infrastructure, the\n            emphasis is on increasing the level of government investment\n            and improving planning and budgeting processes to improve\n            the effectiveness of government spending. For sub-national\n            infrastructure, the reforms are centered on\n            intergovernmental fiscal relations and the incentives for\n            sub-national governments to deliver infrastructure services.\n            For public-private partnerships the emphasis is on\n            establishing a policy framework, institutions, and financing\n            mechanisms to encourage greater private sector interest in\n            Indonesia's infrastructure. And finally, in the\n            cross-cutting governance areas, which typically fall outside\n            the direct influence of the central ministries, the approach\n            taken is either to build on the relevant line\n            ministries' existing reform programs, or to develop\n            progressively greater engagement with these ministries\n            commencing with development of their own action plans for reform."}, "docdt": "2008-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
