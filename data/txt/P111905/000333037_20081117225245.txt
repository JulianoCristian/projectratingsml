                                      I.INTRODUCTION

1.      Commencing in 2007, the Infrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) series has
rapidly assumed central importance inthe dialogue between the Government o f Indonesia and
the World Bank concerning the Government's infrastructure reform program. The program is
built around four areas o f engagement: national infrastructure (eg electricity and roads); sub-
national infrastructure (eg water); public-private partnerships; and cross-cutting governance
issues including land acquisition, environment, and procurement. The common theme ineach
o f these areas is to increase the amount and effectiveness o f infrastructure spending, in order
to contribute to economic growth andpoverty reduction.

2.      The program i s primarily grounded in areas o f influence o f central ministries - the
Ministry o f Finance, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, and Bappenas (the
planning ministry).     For national infrastructure, the emphasis i s on increasing the level o f
government investment and improving planning and budgeting processes to improve the
effectiveness o f government spending. For sub-national infrastructure, the reforms are
centered on intergovernmental fiscal relations and the incentives for sub-national governments
to deliver infrastructure services. For public-private partnerships the emphasis is on
establishing a policy framework, institutions, and financing mechanisms to encourage greater
private sector interest in Indonesia's infrastructure. And finally, in the cross-cutting
governance areas, which typically fall outside the direct influence o f the central ministries, the
approach taken i s either to build on the relevant line ministries' existing reform programs, or
to develop progressively greater engagement with these ministries commencing with
development o ftheir own action plans for reform.

3.      The infrastructure challenges which the IDPL series seeks to address were set out in
the IDPL 1 Program Document. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, infrastructure
investment fell from over 7% o f GDP to just over 2% in 2001 (see Figure 1). Since then,
infrastructure investment has risen to over 3% o f GDP, but this level o f investment has been
insufficient to meet the growing demand from existing infrastructure users, or to address the
needs o f the large parts o f the population who do not have access to basic infrastructure
services. The decline ininvestment was particularly dramatic inthe energy sector, and is now
resulting in widespread blackouts and load-shedding. Investment in water and sanitation has
long been insufficient to expand access to piped water or to begin to develop sewerage
systems.    Transport investment has held relatively steady as a proportion o f GDP, but
realizing the potential benefits o f an expanded expressways network and urbanmass transport
systems is likely to require significant additional resources beyond current investment levels.

4.      The Government's infrastructure program addresses all o f these challenges, and the
IDPL program recognizes the most significant elements o f the Government's program. The
IDPL policy matrix is set out at Annex 9. The current operation focuses on nine o f the most
important infrastructure reform achievements o f the past year, "prior actions" which are
critical for the objectives o f the program:

        The Government is restructuring debts o f sub-nationalgovernments andtheir water
        utilities (PDAMs), thereby removing a practical barrier to investment inthe water and
        sanitation sector.
        The level o f infrastructure investment bykey Government ministries has been
        substantially increased, providing an important foundation for higher economic
        growth.
        The Government i s improving the accuracy andtransparency o f electricity subsidy
        forecasts, providing greater impetus towards ultimately reducing the subsidy.
        The Government i s making progress inpreparation o fpublic-private partnerships
        including the tendering o f several toll-roads;
        The Government is taking enhanced measures to achieve financial closure o f
        outstandingtoll-road PPP transactions, through a new mechanism for sharingcost
        increases for land acquisition.
        The Government has prepared an action planto improve the efficiency o fland
        acquisition processes.
        A new law onmunicipal waste management will promote sanitary landfills insteado f
        existingunsortedopen dumps.
        Biddocuments for all national roads contracts are now available online, an important
        measure inpromoting competition inroad construction.
        The Inspectorate-General o f the Ministryo fPublic Works has preparedan action plan
        aimed at addressing keyprocurement and expenditure risks.

        A broader subset o f the Government's program is supported by a parallel series o f
policy loans by the ADB and the Government o f Japan. The policy matrix adopted by the
ADB and Japan (set out at Annex 3) gives explicit recognition to a broad range o f the
Government's reforms. The separate series complement each other, with the World Bank's
loan series ensuring heightened attention to the most critical reforms, and the ADB and


                                                     4

Japanese series assisting to maintain momentum across the breadth o f the Government's
program. There is close coordinationbetweenthe agencies to ensure consistent messages.

6.      The current single-tranche operation, for a proposed US$ 200 million, i s the second
loan o fthe IDPL series. This year it i s proposed to restructure the series inseveral respects:

    0   Itisproposedto move to a four loanseries (2007,2008,2009, and2010), instead o f
        the three loans initiallyproposed (2007,2008,2010).        The introduction o f an
        additional operation in2009 will permit greater continuity inthe infrastructure reform
        dialogue between the Government andthe Bank.The ADB and Government o fJapan
        will not have an operationin2009, but their operations areplannedto coincide with
        the IDPLprogramwith loans at the end o f 2008 and 2010. The Government supports
        these arrangements.
    0   The indicative triggers initiallyproposed for 2008 have been streamlined, reducing the
        number o f triggers from 16 to 9. Ingeneral, it i s intended to use the 2009 operation to
        recognize reform actions embodied intriggers that are postponedfrom 2008. The
        change intiming o frecognition o f these reforms does not impinge on the achievement
        o fthe program's objectives. The proposed loan size takes into account the extent o f
        policy achievements during2008.
    0   Revisions are proposedto the program's monitoring indicators concerning access to
        electricity and water services. The proposedelectricity indicator reflects a realignment
        o f the Government's reforms beingsupported through the program, as well as the fact
        that the initially selected indicator has already been achieved. The revisedwater sector
        indicator reflects a more realistic appraisal o f the likely transmission speed from
        sectoral reform through to increased financing and eventual improvements inaccess to
        services.

7.      The restructuring responds to a Government request for annual operations, but it i s
also partly motivated by the fact that progress against the indicative triggers set out inIDPL 1
has been slower than initially envisaged. The Government's overall reform program is wide-
ranging, and progress in the broad program is significant. But when attention turns to the
specific matters set as triggers for the current operation, only 10 o f 16 will be satisfied this
year, in3 cases with significantly revised wording.

8.      The new Country Partnership Strategy, approved in September 2008, provides that
DPL loan amounts will be related to the extent o f policy progress. Although not all o f the
indicative triggers set out a year ago have been achieved, there is already evidence o f
significant progress towards achievement o f the overall program's objectives for 2010, as set
out in Annex 7. The Bank considers that the policy achievements which have occurred over
the past year justify a loan size o f $200 million: the PDAM debt restructuring is particularly
important and appears to embody a turningpoint inthe national government's attention to the
sector; the strategy o f publishing information on who benefits from electricity subsidies is
generating public comment and preparingpublic opinion for desirable tariff reforms; the PPP
program i s beginning to show results; the new waste management law is an important
response to a serious problem; and the IDPL series is generating new areas o f engagement
beyond the central line ministries.

                                    11.COUNTRYCONTEXT

9.      Indonesia has continued to recover and strengthen from the economic and political
shocks and natural catastrophes o f the past decade. In the first half o f 2008 its economy
accelerated to the fastest growth rate since the crisis o f the late 1990s, despite unstable global
financial markets and a slowing world economy. The World Bank's (and IMF's) most recent
assessments were that Indonesia would weather a moderate global slowdown relatively well,
due to its size, robust domestic demand, the diversity o f exports and export destinations, as
well as a record of prudent fiscal management. In addition, Indonesia's political system is
maturing into one o f the most stable andvibrant democracies inthe region.

10.      The turmoil in global markets since mid-September has, not surprisingly, adversely
affected Indonesia's macroeconomic outlook and introduced considerable uncertainty. With
the emergence o f a consensus that the advanced economies are headed towards a prolonged
recession, a much more pronounced growth slowdown in Indonesia in 2009 is expected as
well. Current projections, based on a rapidly changing global outlook, are for, as o f early
November, growth to slow from near 6.0 percent in 2008 to 4.4 percent in 2009 before
recovering to near 6 percent in2010. These projections assume zero growth inthe economies
o f Indonesia's major trading partners in2009 and correspondingly lower commodity prices.

11.      Indonesian financial markets have now been significantly affected by the global
turmoil and the risk o f a sudden stop type o f financial crisis has also become more
pronounced. Because o f its relatively open capital account, the significant foreign presence in
its stock and bond markets, and the legacy o f the 1998 crisis (which left Indonesian investors
sensitive to exchange rate movements and prone to capital flight) Indonesia i s more exposed
to "externally mobile capital" than other countries in East Asia. This has already manifested
itself ina falling stock market, dramatically higher domestic and internationalbondyields and
credit default swaps and a depreciating exchange rate. In the current context o f the global
liquidity crisis and spikes in global risk aversion and volatility in financial markets, this
exposure continues to leave Indonesiavulnerable to sudden capital outflows.

12.      Inthe face ofthese increasedrisksIndonesia's economic management teamhasmoved
proactively. Precautionary measures have been taken to anticipate problems including
providing the necessary legal authority for the Government to intervene in financial
institutions, to raise the deposit insurance limit, and reduce budget financing pressures as well
as more immediate steps to provide needed liquidity inboth dollar and rupiah markets. Thus
Indonesia's macroeconomic performance continues to provide the requisite stability for
Indonesia to continue its structural and institutional reform efforts including those supported
bythe DPLprogram.

INDONESIA'SECONOMYENTERINGTHE FINALQUARTEROF2008
13.      Indonesia's macroeconomic prospects entering the final quarter o f 2008 were
relatively favorable. The expectation was o f a moderate global slowdown in 2009 and for
commodity prices to decline from recent peaks but remain highinhistorical terms. The shared
assessment o f the World Bank and the IMF was that Indonesia's size, robust domestic
demand, record o fprudent fiscal management and diversity o f exports and export destinations
would provide protection against the global slowdown. The assessment was reflected in the
IMF WE0 October projection for Indonesia where Indonesia, though experiencing a growth

                                                 6

slowdown, was projected to have the second highest growth rates in 2009 and 2010 amongst
the major economies o f East Asia.

14.        Inthe year anda halfto mid-2008, Indonesia achieved its best economic performance
since the crisis o f the late 1990s. GDP, inreal terms, increased by 6.4 percent inthe first half
o f 2008, following 2007's 6.3 percent increase. Indonesiawas the only significant economy in
the region to not experience a growth slowdown over the first halfo f2008, andits growth was
broadly-based. Domestic demand, particularly private investment, was the main driver o f
growth, with net exports contributing into 2008. While still below pre-crisis levels, investment
rose to almost 26 percent o f GDP.

15.        Indonesia's balance o f payments continued to be in surplus for a third consecutive
year, contributing to a steady increase ininternational reserves. Indonesia enjoyed abalance o f
payments surplus o f 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2007, and 1.7 percent o f GDP inthe first half o f
2008. The current account recorded a small surplus over the first half o f the year, although
highoil prices led to a deficit inthe second quarter. And Indonesiacontinued to accumulate
foreign reserves, which hit USD 60 billion in mid-2008, while total external debt fell, most
likelyto near 30 percent o fGDPin2008.

16.        Risingcommodity prices and strong investment growth fueled Indonesia's strong trade
performance in 2007 and the first half o f 2008. Exportsjumped more than 29.2 percent inthe
first seven months of 2008 compared to a year earlier, driven as much by larger export
volumes as by higher prices. Commodity exports benefited the most, with export values for

                                                                        7

some items (for example, animal and vegetable oil) as much as twice the levels o f a year ago.
Even oil and gas exports have started to recover from the weakness o f recent years, with
export volumes 4.5 percent higher in the first five months o f 2008. Manufactured goods
exports increased by 14.2 percent inthe seven months to July. Imports also grew strongly-by
57.4 percent inthe first seven months o f 2008 relative to the same period in2007.

17.      The structure and destination o f Indonesia's exports sheltered Indonesia`from the
export slowdown some other East Asian economies began to experience early on in 2008.
Indonesia's exports have been increasingly moving towards emerging economies, especially
those inAsia, with the large developed economies driving less o f Indonesia's trade growth in
recent years. For example, China's share o f Indonesia's exports has doubled this decade,
while India's has tripled, although from a low base. In addition, almost two-thirds o f
Indonesia's exports are primary products, and despite the sharply lower outlook for these
prices, fiuther volume growth for these exports may result from the lagged response o f
production to price rises of 2007-mid-2008.

18.      Indonesia has maintained its overall budget deficit at levels that are low by
international standards. The central government realized a budget deficit o f just under
1.3 percent o f GDP in 2007, slightly smaller than projected. Infiscal 2008, the government's
latest projections suggest a deficit remaining at 1.3 percent o f GDP, compared with the
2.1 percent deficit projected earlier in the year, and recent declines in oil prices suggest the
realized deficit may be slightly smaller still. The government's proposed budget for fiscal year
2009 projects a deficit o f 1.0 percent o f GDP as the government seeks to minimize its
financing needs (discussed below).

19.      The improvement in Indonesia's public finances in part reflects policy moves to
address energy subsidies. In May 2008 the government raised subsidized fie1 prices by an
average of 29 percent, relieving some o f the budgetary burden o f soaring oil prices. Part o f the
resulting savings funded a cash transfer program designed to offset higher fuel and food costs
for 70 million o f the country's poor and near-poor. Nevertheless Indonesia's regulated retail
fuel prices (kerosene, low octane gas and transport diesel) were among the most subsidized in
the region.

20.      The budget for 2009 shares the cost o f energy subsidies with sub-national governments
reducing risks and improving incentives. A new measure next year reduces the effective base
for regional transfers by the total amount o f subsidies being provided effectively reducing the
energy subsidy cost by 26 percent for the central government, while aligning the incentives o f
regional governments, who will now share in the revenue gained from hture reductions in
fuel andother subsidies.

21.      Significant growth in government revenue collection since late 2007 has also
strengthened Indonesia's fiscal position. Total tax revenues in the first eight months o f 2008
are over 50 percent higher than duringthe equivalent period in2007 and this increase appears
to be broadly based. Anecdotal evidence attributes this remarkable growth to a range of
specific factors, including the tax office targeting tax payers in highly profitable commodity
sectors and improving its internal personnel management, and artificially low VAT revenues
in 2007 as the government resolved a backlog of GST refunds. This rapid growth in tax
revenues i s also consistent with higheconomic growth.

22.      The low deficits, and the budget discipline and prudent fiscal policy they reflect, have
enabled Indonesia to reduce its public debt burden significantly. At the start o f the DPL
program in 2004, Indonesia's public debt-to-GDP ratio was over 55 percent. By the end o f
2007 it had fallen to 34.9 percent o f GDP and World Bank projections suggest that by the end
of 2008 Indonesian public debt could near 30 percent o f GDP. This improvement in

Indonesia's debt position stands out among the economies inthe region. Infact it has achieved
the most dramatic decline indebt-to-GDP o f any major economy inthe region.

23.        Projected deficits are consistent with even further reductions in the debt levels and
Indonesia's debt position remains sustainable. Debt sustainability analysis conducted both by
the IMF inpreparation for its Article IV mission and World Bank staff (see Annex 8) suggests
that even under the more extreme shocks Indonesia's debt levels and servicing obligations
would remain within most thresholds for concern. For example, a 30 percent real depreciation
o f the rupiah would increase debt levels by a little over 10 percent o f GDP, while plausible

25.      From May 2008, BI moved to manage accelerating credit growth and inflation
expectations by shifting monetary policy to a contractionary footing. BI increased its policy
rate insix 25 basis points (bps) monthly installments, from 8.00 to 9.50 percent, and its public
statements linked the rate increases to concerns over demand-driven inflationary pressures.
While this year's inflation rate will exceed BI's target, the bank indicates that it remains
focused on a longer-tern target of 3.5 percent inflation by 2013. Inflation expectations have
returned to moderate late-2007 levels, with commodity prices, upstreamproducer prices and
growth inthe moneysupply all suggest inflationary pressures have slackened.

26.      Indonesia's poverty rate, measured with reference to the national poverty line fell from
16.6 percent inMarch 2007 to 15.4 percent inMarch 2008. The decrease continued the trend
o f gradually declining poverty rates. Both urban and rural poverty rates declined over the
course o f 2007 and the decline was spatially quite uniform as well, with even the poorest
provinces registering decreases in their poverty rates. Simulations suggest that given the
robust underlying growth in2007/2008, poverty would have fallen even further, perhaps by as
much as an additional two percentage points had it not been for the nearly 16 percent rise in
food prices between April 2007 andApril 2008.

27.      Indonesia's labor market also appeared to be turning the corner and the phenomenon
o f "jobless growth" to be easing. The employment numbers from the latest (February 2008)
national labor force survey indicated improvements in labor market outcomes, continuing an
improving trend since 2005. The employment rate, the share o f the labor force in non-farm
employment, as well as the share o f the labor force jobs in the formal sector have all been
rising, while openunemployment has beenfalling.

HOW THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL TURMOIL SINCE MID-SEPTEMBER HAS
AFFECTED INDONESIA'S FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
28.      The global financial turmoil since mid-September has adversely affected Indonesia's
financial markets, though except for bond markets, not markedly more so than in other
countries. By the end o f October 2008, the Indonesian stock exchange had fallen 57 percent
since the start o f the year, typical o f other markets in the region. Mining and agricultural
stocks have fallen sharply since the start o f 2008 reflecting declining expectations for
commodity prices. Financial sector stocks have, on average, fallen less than the overall
market, reflecting the limited direct exposure o f Indonesia's banks to developments especially
inU S financial markets, plus their firm capital base andmanageable levels ofnon-performing
loans (capital adequacy ratio o f 17.4percent andNPLratio o f 3.5 percent inJuly 2008).

29.      The rupiah has come under pressure since mid-September. The rupiah had tracked
broadly sideways against the U S dollar over the 12 months to August. But in September and
especially October 2008, it depreciated more rapidly, losing 13 percent o f its value against the
USD in October. Bank Indonesia has intervened in the spot market to prevent too rapid a
depreciation o f the IDR. The intervention has been driven inpart by concerns about letting the
IDR cross various thresholds (e.g., IDR 10,000 per USD) that might trigger domestic capital
flight. At this point the rupiahhas depreciated about 19%since July. Bycomparison, the Euro
has fallen by 24 percent since then, but falls across other Southeast Asia currencies, including
Malaysia and the Philippines, are near 10 percent. International reserves have fallen by about
USD8billion over this period, to about USD52billion (as o fOctober 15).

30.      The exposure o f the corporate non-financial sector to global turmoil has been limited
thus far except for a few specific cases and increasing reports about difficulties inaccessing
trade finance. Indonesian firms largely finance their investment through retained earnings,
with leverage ratios inthe corporate sector falling. Butwhen corporates do borrow, they often
chose to do so from foreign sources. In 2007 they obtained almost half o f their external
financing from foreign s0urces.l And there are some ecases o f Indonesian corporations,
especially commodity intensive ones, with much more exposure to foreign debt markets after
having pledged their shares as collateral. However, overall short-term external debt exposure
o fboththe private andpublic sector appears manageable-USD                25.7 billion due within a year
from May 2008-given          international reserves o f U S D 52 billion (as o f October 15). Another
recent concern is reports by exporters and importers that Indonesian banks are not honoring
overseas bank's Letters o f Credit, and vice versa, due to dollar liquidity problems and
perceptions o f increased counterparty risk.

31.     Government debt markets have been hit
especially hard by the widening crisis, with
yields on both IDR and USD bonds rising
sharply. The domestic IDR bond market has           bps -

been particularly susceptible to changes in        1000 -
sentiment. These tendencies were evident in
March and April, when, inthe context o f rising     800 -~

oil prices and concerns over the financing          600 -
demands o f ballooning energy subsidies, yields                         Indonesia stripped
jumped and turnover slumped. Following the                             sprea-ds7USD bonds)

government's    increase in fuel price, BI's         200
stronger anti-inflationary stance, and successful
USD bond issuance, trading returned to normal
levels through July and August, and bond
prices rose.   However, yields on Indonesian
domestic bonds remained elevated and rose even more sharply and significantly than
elsewhere with September and October 2008's global financial turmoil.


32.     Government finances have been especially vulnerable to spikes inglobal risk aversion
andcontagion from external markets because Indonesia's gross financing needs are large. The
term structure o f Indonesia's bonds sees servicing costs rise sharply in 2008, and these costs
are projected to remain at higher levels in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (assuming little change from
September 2008 exchange and interest rates). Unfortunately Indonesia's high gross financing
needs coincide with highnominal interest rates due to tighter global credit markets and this i s
resulting infinancial markets asking for higher risk premiums on Indonesian debt compared to
other economies in the region. The government has, even this year, tapped international
markets and exceeded its US dollar bond sales target, raising USD 4.4 billion by mid-June
2008, with yields inJune only slightly higher thanthose inJanuary. At this point, once World
Bank and ADB policy loans are taken into account, 2008's domestic financing requirements
are already basically fulfilled.

33.     With the consensus that the advanced economies are headed towards a prolonged
recession, a more pronounced growth slowdown inIndonesiain2009 is now expected as well.
Slower growth in Indonesia's major trading partners will feed through into falling export
values. And as commodity prices fall sharply to 2006 levels (current projections), that will
reduce the stimulus they have been provided to Indonesia's growth recently. Finally the
multiplier o f these effects plus the tight liquidity and generalized uncertainty will reduce
investment and consumer durables demand inIndonesia as elsewhere.

34.     Assuming a prolonged global recession roughly comparable to the one in 1982 (the
worst for a composite o f Indonesian trading partners from 1970s to present), Indonesia's
growth would fall from 6 percent in 2008 to approximately 4.4 percent in 2009 before
recovering towards 6 percent in 2010. The uncertainty about the global outlook, the
transmission and the local impact, make these projections far more uncertain than usual. In
particular, the materialization o f a contraction in the global economy in 2009 deeper than
duringthe 1982 recession, coupled with even sharper downturn inIndonesiawould need to be
monitored as events unfold.

35.     The risk o f a sudden stop type o f crisis has also become more pronounced. Because o f
its relatively open capital account, the significant foreign presence in its stock and bond
markets, and the legacy o f the 1998 crisis, which has left Indonesian investors sensitive to
exchange rate movements andprone to capital flight, Indonesiai s more exposed to "externally
mobile capital" than other countries in East Asia. In the aftermath o f the turmoil in U S
markets there was a "mixed" pull back of foreign investors from Indonesian stock and bond
markets (where up to 20 percent of domestic government bonds were heldby foreigners). This
withdrawal of liquidityput pressure on stock prices and especially on bond yields and then on
the exchange rate. Through September rapid credit growth (reflecting economic momentum)
had already been putting pressure on bond yields, in part as BI was contracting the money
supply. By October liquidity in rupiahbut especially inU S D was scarce and subsequently BI
has reversed course to make more liquidity in both currencies available through various
means. But the liquidity squeeze and price effects had other impacts as some, so far limited,
firms that had borrowed against the values o f their shares faced margin calls. Inaddition a
subsidiary o f Bank Indonesia, Indover, failed to make a payment on its debt and Bank
Indonesia did not honor what was perceived to be a comfort letter precipitating additional
credit worthiness concerns and feeding into higher credit default swaps.

36.     However, the Government has moved very proactively to deal with the various threats.
Quickly, as noted, monetary policy moved to accommodate liquidity issues, and the
Government raised the ceiling on deposit insurance to 2 billion rupiah (around 200,000 USD)
and passed a Government regulation-in-lieu-of-law that would allow it to intervene in
troubled financial institutions as needed (as was done elsewhere). Despite the conservative
overall fiscal position, to reduce the Government's pressure on financial markets the budget
deficit was cut back from an initial 1.9 percent to 1.0 percent o f GDP (while safeguarding
infrastructure and social spending) and more measures are expected. In addition, however,
because the Government remains quite concerned about its ability to meet its gross financing
needs, it has requested contingent financing from the World Bank inthe form o f an additional
DPL with a Deferred DrawdownOption that would be separate from the DPL series o fwhich
DPL5 is the first. The Government has firther requested the Bank's assistance in facilitating
co-financing o f this additional contingent DPL from bilateral, multilateral and other sources.
Discussions are ongoing regarding the possible design o f any such enhanced support that
would be provided separately from and inaddition to the DPLprogram being proposedhere.

THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT
37.     Political stability and the consolidation o f democracy have continued to deepen. At
the national level, while Indonesia's democracy is vibrant and the policy debate often
vigorous, political stability and the institutions that support it appear to be increasingly robust.
Furthermore, lively public debate against a backdrop o fpolitical stability is proving conducive
to improving levels o f governance and sustainable economic growth. Sub-national elections
over the past year have been largely well-run and peaceful, which bodes well for the election
year in 2009. Regional elections have often resulted in losses for incumbents, demonstrating
the electorate's political savvy and readiness to punish poor performance. Inlegislation that
strengthens democracy and curtails the control o f large political parties, the parliament (DPR)
amended the Law on Regional Governance to enable independent candidates to take part in
regional-head elections. Overall, Indonesia's governance indicators have improved markedly
inrecent years, althoughthere is stillconsiderable scope for progress.


                                                 15

38.      The government's reform program, including initiatives to improve the investment
climate, has continued. The government issued Inpres No. 5/2008, its latest economic policy
reform package in May 2008. Delayed since 2005, the DPR finally passed the amended
Income Tax Law, which will take effect in January 2009. The new law aims to make paying
taxes easier, simplify administration, emphasize self-assessment, improve legal certainty and
attract investment. The law also progressively lowers corporate tax rates from 30 to 25 percent
over 2 years. Although it took 9 years o f deliberation, the DPR also passed a Freedom o f
Information Law (No. 1412008) that enshrines in law rules for the disclosure o f public
information, however the law will only come into effect inApril 2010.

39.      Little progress has, however, been made in other areas, including the revision o f
Indonesia's labor regime. One important area in which scant progress has been made is in
revising Indonesia's restrictive Labor Law to allow for more flexibility in the country's
workforce. This i s o f particular importance inencouraging investment and enabling employers
to transfer more informal workers (where about three-quarters o f Indonesia's workforce are
employed) into the formal sector through the lowering o f severance pay conditions. Likewise,
a draft Mining Bill i s deadlocked in the DPR, creating continued uncertainty in the mining
sector and serving as a disincentive to investment.

40.      Fuel price increases and commodity inflation have eroded some o f the president's
popularity. The government took the difficult decision to raise fuel prices by an average 29
percent in May 2008 in a move aimed at cutting high levels o f public spending on subsidies
that were threatening budget stability. Coming at a time o f highcommodity inflation that was
already responsible for drivingup the cost o f staples inIndonesia, the fuel price increase was a
brave but necessary measure. Despite relatively small but widespread protests against the
price rises, large-scale social unrest was averted. Nevertheless, the president has suffered a
decline inhis popularity inthe months that have followed.

41.      Pro-poor poverty alleviation programs have helped to avoid widespread social unrest.
Repeating a scheme used successfully in 2005-06, the government simultaneously
implemented a direct cash transfer program to compensate the poor with quarterly payments
inexcess ofthe impact of inflation, including boththe fuel price rises andthe unrelated food
price inflation. This program, which runs for one year and covers some 19million households,
was a major factor inwinning acceptance o f the subsidy cuts among the general populace and
ensuringthat the initialprotests subsidedwithin a matter o fweeks.

42.      The government's anti-corruption credentials remain strong, with the efforts o f the
Anti-Comption Commission gaining momentum. Since a cabinet reshuffle in mid-2007, the
government's anti-corruption credentials have remained largely intact. The leadership o f the
Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) was replaced at the end o f 2007 and, despite initial
concerns, the new leadership team has shown itself as vigorous as its predecessor in
maintaining the momentum o f the KPK's investigations, with progress in several high-profile
cases and the arrest o f several parliamentarians. The focus o f one case involved the transfer o f
funds from the central bank (BI) to members o f the parliamentary finance commission in
order to facilitate the passage (and amendment) o f several bills, one of which could have
transferred responsibility for supervising the financial sector from BI to a new regulatory
agency under the Ministry o f Finance. Another case, which has already resulted in a 20-year


                                                16

prison sentence for a senior prosecutor and the dismissal o f other senior prosecutors at the
Attorney General's Office (AGO), has exposed bribery by those close to a large conglomerate
that was aimed at influencing the AGO to drop an investigation. Elsewhere, customs offices
have been raided and customs officials arrested for receiving suspect payments, while
successful prosecutions have beenmade against regional government officials for corruption.

43.     Albeit at a slow pace, the Government i s also introducing measures to prevent
corruption and encourage civil service reform. Senior civil servants inthe Ministryo f Finance
may no longer also hold senior positions in state-owned enterprises, avoiding conflicts o f
interest that had previously been commonplace. More generally throughout the civil service,
pay levels are gradually being brought into line with the skill and responsibility requirements
o f each positions and improving the nexus with their private sector counterparts. Civil service
rules remain overly rigid, however, and the procedures for recruitment and promotion
continue to stymie more far-reaching enhancement o fpublic sector performance.

44.      Reform o f the judiciary i s making little headway. Despite its importance for legal
certainty and investor confidence, reform o f the judiciary has made little progress over the
past year. One modest positive development has been Presidential Regulation (PP) No.
53/2008, that categorizes "fees" collected by the courts as non-tax state income, thereby
obliging the courts to pass the funds to the state treasury. Previously, the funds had been held
by the court system and court officials, including the head o f the Supreme Court, had refhed
to allow access to BPK auditors to audit the funds.

45.      Indonesia's standing as a regional policy leader has strengthened over the past year.
The Government hosted the 2007 Bali Framework Conference on Climate Change, and the
Minister o f the Environment and President Yudhoyono were instrumental in brokering the
conference's final resolution. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Nagris in
Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta in M a y 2008, the government facilitated and helped to staff an
ASEAN-led assessment and assistance mission to the otherwise largely closed region.

46.      Separatist movements and regional conflicts have remained benign. The deepening
transformation towards a decentralized model o f government administration, together with
improving levels o f local governance and direct local elections, has contributed to a lessening
o f tensions inpreviously conflict-prone regions, such as Aceh, Maluku, Sulawesi, Flores and
Papua. Religious tensions remain, however, as was witnessed in violent protests by radical
Islamic groups against the Ahmadiyya sect o f Islam that i s considered heretical by Sunni
Muslims as well as against liberal groups supporting religious tolerance and women's rights.
Incomparison with recent years the police appear to be taking a firmer stand against law-
breakers, who are now more likely to be held accountable for legal infringements.

47.     Terrorism appears to be under control, with no significant terrorist incidents inthe past
year. Indonesia continues to display an impressive track record in dealing with the threat o f
terrorism, with the government's strategy o f dissuasion rather than armed confrontation
becoming an international model for combating terrorism. Leaders o f extremist groups have
beenarrested and several plots intercepted. Inresponse to the improved security situation, the
United States has lowered its threat warning for Indonesia, and Australia has removed specific
travel wamings against visiting some o f Indonesia's more volatile regions.


                                               17

48.      As would be expected, political tensions are mounting with the start o f campaigning
for the 2009 elections. Having won 61 percent o f the vote in a second-round run-off in2004,
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono remains generally popular, although this popularity has
suffered recently from continuing high levels o f poverty and unemployment and the steep
price rises o f staple foods and fuel in 2008 inparticular. The president has continued to push
for key structural reforms and also took the politically courageous decision to cut fuel
subsidies for the third time during his administration in mid-2008. These structural reforms,
together with strengthening economic fundamentals, have supported Indonesian growth, with
the economy achieving its fastest post-crisis growth rate in2007.

49.      Inthe run-up to the elections, the pace ofreform is likely to slow over the coming
year. The more politically sensitive legislation, for example the revision o f the Labor Law,
will likelybe postponeduntilafter the electoral process is completed. The 14direct provincial
head elections that have taken place over the past year bode well for the 2009 elections, with
all but one proceeding smoothly - the exception being the gubernatorial election in North
Maluku, where a lingering dispute has arisen. While economic issues are o fkey concern to the
electorate, corruption is also an important factor as few candidates with a tarnished image
have been successful.

THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIUM-TERMSTRATEGY
50.      The Government's medium-term strategy, or RPJM, represents the country's medium-
term development vision for 2004-09. It lays out three broad and multi-pronged goals: (i)     a
safe and peaceful Indonesia; (ii)a just and democratic Indonesia; and (iii)a prosperous
Indonesia. It also incorporates the eight MDGs inorder to frame medium-term targets as part
o f international commitments to be achieved by 2015. For each o f the three broad goals are
more specific objectives ina number o f sector- or theme-specific policy areas.

51.      For the past four years, the Government has further elaborated on the RPJM through
the Annual Work Plan (RKP). Through the RKP, the Cabinet identifies priority areas and
associated targets among the 33 policy areas found inthe RPJM. The priorities o f the annual
RKP provide an umbrella guide to aggregate budget allocations to the state budget. This
represents a recent break from a long tradition o f incremental budgeting wherein allocations
typically resembled those o f the previous year and only new proposals were subjected to
scrutiny and analysis. This greatly limited the Government's ability to respond to emerging
challenges and to align spending, programs, policies, and activities to current development
needs andpriorities.

52.      Complementing the Government's broad strategy are several policy packages that drill
down to specific reform meisures to be achieved within a defined period. Economic policy
packages have been introduced in each o f the last four years (the latest in May 2008) that
indicate that the government recognizes the need to accelerate growth by improving
Indonesia's competitiveness. These policy packages have focused on priority areas such as
infrastructure, investment climate, financial sector, and SME development that are critical to
enhancing Indonesia's competitiveness bypromoting private-sector-led investment.




                                               18

53.      Public pronouncements andprogrammatic initiatives reflect the government's desire to
build a more inclusive Indonesia by making growth more broad-based, improving service
delivery, and enhancing voice. In particular, in addition to a number o f sector-specific
initiatives such as the introduction o f the ASKESKIN health insurance scheme for the poor
and the passage o fthe Teacher Certification Law to improve teacher quality, the government,
in 2007, launched a nation-wide poverty reduction program (PNPM) consolidating and
buildingupon existing models o fcomunity-driven development.

54.      The government and political leaders are also paying increasing attention to the need
for more sustainable growth and development. The 2004-2009 RPJM had three main
priorities, and within those a number o f targets, one o f which was environmental
sustainability. Climate change, inparticular, is receiving increasing attention from Indonesia's
leaders.

       111. THE GOVERNMENT'S INFRASTRUCTUREREFORMPROGRAM

55.     Infrastructure policy constitutes a.large part o f the economic policy package (Inpres
5/2008) issued bythe Coordinating Ministryo f Economic Affairs inearly 2008 (see Annex 2).
The policy package sets out key actions to be achieved during 2008 and 2009 in areas
including national roads, railways, airports, ports, information and communications
technology, flood control, water and sanitation, solid waste, community driven infrastructure
programs, public-private partnerships, landacquisition processes, infrastructure financing, and
subsidy (PSO) policy. It sets out objectives, deadlines, and responsible ministries. Compared
to previous years' policy packages this year's package has a greater focus on outputs to be
achieved (eg kilometers o f roads to be built).

ELECTRICITY
56.     The Government has placed highpriority on encouraging investment inthe electricity
sector over the past two years. Nevertheless, there i s a long lead time in contracting and
construction, and it will not be until at least 2010 that substantial new capacity will be brought
on line to address power shortages that have arisen from several previous years o f inadequate
investment. Moreover, with elections due in2009 and much political capital used inreducing
oil subsidies, the Government has been unwilling to increase electricity tariffs, hampering
efforts to attract investment financing.

57.     With electricity demand growing at over 6% per year over the past decade, and very
little system expansion over the past decade, the system now has an inadequate reserve
margin. Blackouts are occurring across the country. PLN has installed capacity o f about
24,000 MW. Since early 2006, the Government has been pursuing a "crash" program to
procure 10,000 MW o f coal-fired power plants to be operated by PLN, the Government-
owned utility. Around 3,600 MW o f capacity are expected to be commissionedby the end o f
2010, with the remainder o f the crash program expected to be delivered by 2012.
Simultaneously, PLNhas been pursuingadditional private investment inelectricity, with IPPs
expected to make an increasing contribution to capacity after 2012.

58.     The task o f raising finance for the new investment is made very difficult by the fact
that electricity tariffs have not been increased since 2003, when the average tariff was brought
to the pre-crisis level o f 6.8 cents/kWh. Because o f the significance o f oil inPLN's fuel mix,
during much o f 2008 the fuel cost alone exceeded the average tariff. To ensure PLN's
financial sustainability the Government provides a "Public Service Obligation" (PSO)
subsidy, which covers the difference between PLN's costs and the regulated tariffs for
different consumer categories.

59.     PLN's PSO amounted to more than US$ 4.2 billion in 2007. Without efforts to cut
demand, the impact o f higher fuel prices is projectedby PLNto increase the cost o f the PSO
to around US$ 6 billion in2008. While the Government has political difficulties inincreasing
the regulated tariffs, PLN has been able to increase payments by residential consumers with
the largest connection capacity (generally these are the wealthiest consumers), byrestructuring
the consumption levels at which particular tariffs apply. PLNhas also engaged innegotiations
with large industrial and commercial consumers to increase payments in return for greater
reliability inpower availability. One factor which reduces the economic impact o f PLN's load
sheddingis that manylarge industrialconsumers have installedtheir own generators.

                                                 20

60.     One o f the reasons for the current highcost o f subsidies i s reliance on expensive diesel
to meet a significant proportion o f base load, in addition to its normal role o f satisfylng peak
demand. Most o f the currently planned capacity expansion i s coal-fired power plants, which
will result in significant reductions inthe cost o f meeting base load. The Government is also
pursuingoptions for connectingnatural gas to existing plants which currently burndiesel, and
for developing geothermalpower projects.

61.     The Government has recently reorganized PLN and appointed a new Board o f
                                                                                                    e

Directors. One o f the changes is to re-establish a planning unit, which will improve the
orderly development o f investment projects and assist the government in forecasting the fiscal
burdeno fPLN's subsidies. The planning unit was fragmented inpreparation for reforms that
would have moved Indonesia to an unbundled competitive market. These reforms were
disallowed by the Constitutional Court in 2004, a result which disrupted reform momentum
andis the root cause o fmanyo f the sector's current problems. Another element o fthe recent
restructuring i s a move to regional business units. PLN's costs vary widely byregion, and it is
anticipated that this restructuring will facilitate the development o f responses to region-
specific problems.

ROADS
62.     The first priority inany roadnetwork is maintenance o f the existing network. In2006,
the national road network o f 34,628 km included 81% in good or fair condition, 10% inpoor
condition, and 9% in bad condition. The Ministry of'Public Works' Directorate General o f
Highways aims to have no roads left inpoor or bad condition by2010, an objective which will
be largely determined by budget availability.        The Ministry o f Public Works received a
substantial budget increase in 2008. To provide a more systematic link between funding and
sectoral performance targets, the Government i s working towards a medium-term expenditure
framework and performance based budgeting. The Ministry o f Public Works i s keen to act as
a pilot ministryfor these initiatives.

63.     An important national priority is the development o f an expressways network,
including toll-roads.   Development o f an expressway network would provide an important
boost to economic growth. The National Road Network Master Plan calls for the creation o f
2,885 km o f toll-road expressways. Almost 700 km o f expressways already exist, although
most o fthese were constructed prior to the 1997 financial crisis.

64.     The Government is seeking private investment to expand the toll-roads network. The
Indonesian Toll Road Authority, BPJT, was established in 2005 with regulatory powers and
the responsibility to prepare projects for private investment.       Concession agreements have
been signed for 805 km in 22 sections o f toll-roads.       Fourteen o f these agreements were
signed prior to 1997, andbecause o f difficulties inland acquisition have languished, unable to
achieve financial close. Over the past two years, the Government has taken measures to
address the land acquisition problems and to terminate projects which are still unable to
achieve financial close. The Government has also tendered several new "batches" o f toll-
roads inrecent years, and these are invarious stages o f preparation.

65.     Institutional capacity in the roads sector needs enhancement.              Heavy vehicle
overloading is prevalent, and road safety is poor. Road works are often expensive and low
quality, and collusion between contractors i s a problem. The World Bank is assisting the

                                               21

Ministry o f Public Works and Ministryo f Transport with a pilot road safety program, and
pilot testing performance-based contracts for road maintenance, including vehicle loading
control.

PIPEDWATER
66.      Approximately 18% o f the population, or about 40 million people, currently have
access to piped water. The Vice President is seeking to provide an extra 10million household
pipedwater connections over five years. This would roughly double the number o f people
with access to piped water, and would cost in the order of US$ 8 billion. Merely providing
connections is not sufficient, however. Additional investment i s needed to ensure bulk water
supply, and to improve water utility (PDAM) operations, to ensure that water is reliably
available through the existing and any new connections.

67.      Insupport ofthe Vice President's targets, the MinistryofPublic Works has ambitious
national goals for expanding water access. These goals can be contrasted with historically low
levels o f sectoral investment, the sub-national government responsibility for actually
delivering water and sanitation services, and poor operational and management performance
o f PDAMs. Sector investment has declined from an average o f US$ 400 million in 1990s to
under US$ 45 million in2005, and is about one tenth o f what is needed to achieve the 2015
MilleniumDevelopment Goals.

68.      In the absence of long-term local financing, donor support could provide the debt
necessary to underpin new investments. But donor lending to the sector has been very limited
in the past decade. A significant obstacle to the flow of funds into the sector has been
Ministryo fFinanceregulationswhich havepreventeddonor financing to PDAMswhich have
debt arrears, or which are owned by local governments (PEMDAs) which have debt arrears.

69.      This year marks the cutting o f the Gordian knot of debt arrears o f local governments
(PEMDA) and their water utilities (PDAM). A scheme has been developed for the rapid
restructuring o f debt arrears, which will remove current legal barriers to necessary financing.
The new scheme will reschedule principal arrears and write off all penalties or interest arrears
on debt o f PDAM andPEMDA, subject to a limited set o f conditions, including submission o f
audited accounts, raising tariffs to cover basic costs, and in some cases a commitment to
invest an amount corresponding to the amount o f debt arrears being written off. Inthe event
that a PDAM or PEMDA again falls into arrears, the new arrangements permit the Ministry o f
Finance to intercept fiscal transfers which would normally be made to the relevant PEMDA.

70.      Over the past year, BPPSPAM, a water sector advisory body, has assessed the
managerial, technical, and financial performance o f 306 out o f 335 PDAMs, andpublished the
results on its website. Using criteria such as operating ratio, debt-equity ratio, customer
structure, number o f employees per 1000 customers, water losses and operating hours, the
PDAMs have been classified into three categories: (i) - 79 (26%); (ii) healthy -
                                                       healthy                    less
114 (37%), and sick - 113 (37%). The mapping will be updated every year to exert pressure
on PDAMs to improve performance.

71.      Following on from the Water Resources Law 7/2004 and Government Regulation
16/2005 on Water Supply, which eliminated the need for local parliament approval o f water
tariff increases, Regulation 23/2006 on drinkingwater tariff policy was issued by the Ministry

                                              22

o f Home Affairs. This regulation introduced the principle o f cost recovery and reduced the
number o f customer categories. Most PDAMs classified as healthyhave benefited from tariff
increases. Based on BPPSPAM's ranking, the Ministry o f Public Works has sent letters to
about 50 large PDAMs in the lower categories to adjust their tariffs to reach a cost recovery
level o f Rp. 3,500 per cubic meter.

72.     The Ministryo f Public Works i s providing technical assistance to PDAMs categorized
as unhealthy (ie less healthy and sick), to assess their performance and draw up business
plans.Business plans are also requiredas part o f the debt restructuring process. As part o fthe
investments identified inthe budgetplans, the Ministry also provides capital improvements in
the headwork, intake or treatment facilities, while PDAMs find improvements in the
distribution systems.

73.     Finally, the Government is examining ways to provide positive incentives to sub-
national governments to improve the delivery o f water and sanitation services. Conditional
fiscal transfers are being considered by the Ministry o f Finance. Consultants have been
mobilized usingDutchtrust finds, and are working with the Ministryo f Finance andMinistry
o f Public Works to develop the incentive scheme, as well as identifying other ways o f
encouraging financial flows into the sector.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
74.     The Government is pursuing PPP transactions in all infrastructure sectors, including
toll roads, power plants, natural gas pipelines, rail, ports, bulk water plants, airports, and
telecommunications projects. Modest results are beginning to show. Some short sections o f
toll-roads and small bulk water treatment plants have commenced operation. Construction
has commenced on over US$ 2 billion o f new PPP projects, including power plants, toll-
roads, andwater treatment plants.

75.     Slow progress has generally been the result o f poor project preparation, with
inadequate background analysis undertaken prior to tendering, resulting in unrealistic
expectations by tendering agencies. Over the past year the Government has strengthened the
project preparationprocess, andhas placed greater reliance on external advisers. An electricity
plant in central Java is being prepared with the assistance o f an IFC advisory mandate. The
ADB has mobilized a PPP project development facility, fundedby a US$ 26.5 million loan,
anda US$ 7.56 million grant provided bythe Netherlands. The facility is currently providing
support to 20 national and sub-national PPP projects, including toll-roads, ferry terminals,
bulk water supply systems, railways, an airport, and a telecommunications project. The
emphasis o f current support i s on improving the quality o f feasibility studies prior to bidding.
The World Bank plans to review the PPP program over the coming year, to identify areas for
additional technical assistance.

76.     The Ministry o f Finance may currently authorize guarantees or direct financial support
only for PPPs which comply with Perpres 67, which requires three bids received in a
competitive tendering process. Given the infancy o f Indonesia's PPP program, the
requirement o f three bids has proven to be a practical barrier to projects for which government
support may be economically justified. Revisions to Perpres 67 are being considered which
would authorize negotiations with successful bidders in cases where fewer than three bids are


                                               23

received. This would open the way for the provision o f Government support to a wider range
o f transactions.

77.     The Government i s also takingmeasures to address landacquisition issues which have
blockedprivate toll-road development. A revolving landfund was established bythe Ministry
o f Public Works in January 2007. The fund finances land acquisition for toll-roads, and i s
reimbursed by the concessionaire when land acquisition is completed. The fund has been
accessed by eight toll-road concessionaires, o f which six have now commenced construction,
andone toll-road section is already operational.

78.     Fourteen toll-road concession contracts were awarded prior to the financial crisis in
1997, and have not moved to financial close, inpart because o f escalation inthe cost o f land
acquisition since initial contract award. The Government has developed a "land-capping"
scheme, under which the concessionaires will pay 110%o f the land costs initially envisaged,
with the Government to pay for the remaining land acquisition costs. The Government funds
available for this scheme are capped at Rp. 4.9 trillion. The criteria for allocation o f these
funds to particular concessionaires are described in the discussion o f IDPL 2 triggers.
Transactions which do not move to financial close after accessing the land-capping funds will
be terminated.

79.     Finally, the Government i s developing institutions to support infrastructure financing.
A Guarantee Fundis being prepared to ensure the availability o f government funds to honor
guarantees given to private infrastructureprojects. The amount o f money available inthe fund
will cap the level o f contingent liabilities the Government may assume. The World Bank is
providing technical assistance in the development o f the Guarantee Fund. To address
weaknesses in local capital markets, the Government is also creating the Indonesia
Infrastructure Financing Facility, which will mobilize funds inorder to provide the long-term
local currency debt which is desirable for PPP projects. Several donors are participating inthe
design and establishment o f the IFF, as described below inthe indicative triggers for IDPL 3.

LANDACQUISITION
80.     Land acquisition is a frequent source o f delays in infrastructure projects across all
sectors. A Land Working Group has been established to review issues associated with the
process o f land acquisition, with a view to removing impediments to timely land acquisition
for infrastructure development.       The Working Group is chaired by the President o f the
National Land Agency (BPN), and includes members drawn from the Coordinating Ministry
o f Economic Affairs, BAPPENAS, Ministry o f Public Works, and the Ministry o f Home
Affairs.

81.     Two sub-committees have been established, dealing with "land banking" (ineffect, the
process o f zoning land or purchasing land well in advance of potential projects) and "land
acquisition".   The sub-committee on land acquisition has proceeded over the course o f the
year to identify a set o f issues which they consider to be the major practical issues encountered
inlandacquisition, andispreparinganactionplanto address these issues. The actionplanis
discussed below, as a trigger for the current operation.




                                                24

82.     The World Bank is preparing trust-funded technical assistance which would go beyond
the sub-committee's identification o f issues, and assist inthe design o f pilot activities, such as
demonstration o frevised approaches to landvaluation.

MANAGINGENVIRONMENTALIMPACTS
83.     The Government's annual work plan includes the environmental actions to be
addressed ineach budget cycle. Some o f the items mentioned include development o f debt for
nature swaps, reducing environmental pollution, reducing smoke and haze from forest and
land fires, rehabilitation o f forests and degraded lands, conservation o f natural resources,
improving environmental management through the spatial planning process, and developing
environmental data and information. Within this program, the initiatives most relevant for
purposes o f the IDPL program are initiatives to improve solid waste management and to
improve environmental impact assessment andmanagement.

84.     The Government recognizes the problems o f solid waste (open dumping, open
burning, and mismanagement) as an increasing pollution problem and a threat to public
health. Only about 50% o f Indonesia's solid waste is actually collected, 1520% is properly
disposed, and less than 2% is treated (recycled or composted). About 85% o f small cities and
more than 50% o f medium cities dispose o f their waste in open dumps. The new Municipal
Waste Management Law, enacted in early 2008, aims to reduce the generation o f solid waste
by encouraging communities to "reduce, reuse, recycle", and also aims to improve the
handling o f solid waste, through improved separation o f types o fwaste andprocessingprior to
final treatment.

85.     Indonesia has decentralized responsibility for environmental impact assessment,
known in Indonesia as AMDAL. All 33 provincial governments and 55% o f kabupatenkota
governments have AMDAL agencies. The Ministry o f Environment has undertaken two
surveys o f the quality o f environmental assessments performed by these agencies. While
quality i s improving, the most recent survey still found that 21% o f assessments were poor
quality. The Ministryi s undertaking measures to improve the quality o f the work performed
by these agencies, including through the licensing of AMDAL commissions, the certification
o f commission members and trainers, andthe establishment o f an AMDAL training center.

86.     The Government i s also preparing revisions to the AMDAL law. These revisions
include sanctions for agencies that issue development permits without a necessary
environmental impact assessment. The potential sanctions include revocation o f the permit,
and criminal prosecution o f the responsible person. The revisions also aim to strengthen
public consultation in the AMDAL process, providing for the possibility o f representation o f
the public by technical experts.

MINISTRY OF PUBLICWORKS GOVERNANCEISSUES
87.     The Ministryo f Public Works (MPW) accounts for a considerable part o f the national
government's public infrastructure investment program, including US$ 2 billion per year
delivered through the Directorate General o f Highways. Measures to improve governance in
MPW include improvements along the length o f the project cycle from planningand design
through payments and audit.



                                               25

88.     Planning and contractingform: The Government i s moving towards a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework, with M P W one o f four government agencies selected to pilot the
reforms. The reforms will help, among other matters, to improve and guarantee the level o f
resources dedicated to maintenance.         In addition, the government is planning to pilot
performance-based contracting for maintenance, which should improve the efficiency o f the
maintenance process.

89.     Oversight: The Government is piloting a system o f contract oversight that relies on
contracted engineering firms acting as responsible agents rather than in an advisory capacity.
Inthe new arrangements, the engineer specified inFIDIC contracts as the overseer is clearly
specified by MPW to be the contracted engineering firm, rather than MPW officials. The
system provides considerably greater authority and responsibility for successful project
delivery to the engineering firm.

90.     Transparency and Disclosure: The Ministry o f Public Works website (www.pu.go.id)
provides a high standard o f information disclosure, exceeding the information availability o f
most public works ministries in developing countries. The website includes the Ministry's
budget, plannedroads and other works, the results o f all tenders including winners and losers
and bid prices, audit reports, and the quarterly financial reports for all World Bank projects
(the last is not requiredby the World Bank).

91.     Procurement: One international benchmark suggests general levels o f integrity and
transparency in public procurement in Indonesia are comparatively strongY2but this contrasts
with Transparency International's assessment o f general levels o f corruption, which ranks
Indonesia as 126tho f 180 countries in 2008 (an improvement from 143`d o f 179 countries in
2007). Certainly a number o f issues andpotential problems remain -many o f which are being
addressed by MPW. Inparticular, collusion and the related issue o f fake bid securities have
remained a significant problem in road projects in Indonesia, affecting recent donor-funded
projects. Not least for this reason, the MPW has moved to strengthen procurement systems
andprocurement support.

92.     To support the procurement process, MPW has introduced an advanced e-procurement
system. The system handled 4,000 contracts last year.           It currently allows publication o f
advertisements o fprojects, availability o f biddingdocuments on line for free download, online
clarifications and queries and notification o f contract awards on line. All DGHnational roads
contracts in all regions and all value o f contracts are processed through the system. To date
MPW has been constrained in allowing submission o f bids on-line due to the lack o f digital
signature legislation. However this has been recently enacted and DGHwill move to full e-
procurement in the near future. A team from MIT is currently analyzing the impact o f the
move to e-procurement. Early indications are that the change has resulted in a significant
increase in the number o f people obtaining bidding documents, but it i s less clear that there
has been a significant increase inthe number o fbids made.

93,     To support the multitude o fprocurement committees inMPW and improve quality and
promptness o f their reviews DGH i s establishing a Procurement team inDGH staffed, funded


2OECDiDAC procurement benchmarking ofPillar IV covering integrity andtransparency ofprocurement scored
Indonesia at 69 percent.

                                                26

and mandated to provide support to procurement committees in terms o f advice, capacity
building, review and streamlining o f procurement procedures and promotion of standardized
bidding documents. AusAID is providing technical assistance in the establishment o f the
Procurement Team. DGH is also receiving financing from donors aimed at supporting
different tasks related to the reform o f public procurement on the national, ministerial and
local levels. Particularly aimed at bidder collusion, on some projects the Government has
piloted a system which allows for no prequalification, which keeps confidential the list o f
bidders who obtained biddingdocuments andwhich avoids physicalpre-bid meetings.

94.     The Ministryis participating ina World Bank study o fways to improve competition in
the road construction industry. The studywill include a survey o fpublic works officials, local
state-owned and private construction companies, leading potential international bidders,
contractors, consultants, material suppliers, and industry associations, aimed at identifylng the
barriers to entry into the industry, and industry perceptions o f the causes and effects of
corruption. The study will also include a workshop with all stakeholders aimed at identifylng
reform recommendations.

95.    Audit:    The MPW Inspector General (IG) has a broad set o f priorities set by
management covering the minimization o f leakage, improved quality o f public works and
support for good practice in project management. The IG has recognized the need to move
towards systematic risk assessment, develop a manual for technical audits and expand
training. AusAID and the World Bank are working together to provide technical assistance in
the implementation o f its reform actionplan.

            IV. BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO THE INDONESIACOUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY
96.     A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), "Investing in Indonesia's Institutions",
was approved by the Board in September 2008.              It covers the period FY09-FY12. It
recognizes Indonesia's emergence as a more confident middle-income country andrepositions
the World Bank's modest but strategic partnership role in supporting a country-led
development strategy and the Government's own core programs and policies. Continuing and
deepening the long-standing focus o f the Indonesia program on governance, the strategy
recognizes that more effective public institutions are the key to better development outcomes
inthe future.

97.     The IDPL series addresses five o f the seven core areas o f engagement set out in the
CPS:

        The CPS aims to support central government systems to enhance public financial
        management and governance. The IDPLseries addressesprocurement processes inthe
        Ministry o f Public Works;
    0   The CPS aims to strengthen decentralized local governments andinstitutions to
        increase the impact o fpublic spending. The IDPL series seeks the development o f an
        incentive framework to improve water and sanitation.
    0   The CPS aims to enhance the environment for private sector development. The IDPL
        series embraces a range o fmeasures intended to promote infrastructure PPPs.
    0   The CPS aims to increase the level and efficiency o f public andprivate investment in
        infrastructure. All o fthe measures o f the IDPL series share this goal.
    0   The CPS aims to strengthen Indonesia's capacityto address environmental challenges.
        The IDPLseries seeks improved solid waste management and improvement in
        environmental impact assessment.

98.     The CPS envisages a flexible World Bank Group country financing envelope,
potentially varying significantly up or down around a notional annual IBRD investment o f
about US$ 2 billion. Until the new CPS was approved no indication had previously been
given concerning the size o f policy loans for FY09 and beyond. The CPS envisages greater
reliance on policy loans than in the previous CAS period. The amount o f policy lending in
any year will be driven by the extent o f policy reform undertaken. In FY09, the proposed
policy loan amounts are US$ 750 million for DPL 5 andUS$200 million for IDPL2.

99.     While progress against IDPL triggers has been slower than anticipated a year ago, the
Government has made strong progress towards the overall program objectives (see Annex 7),
and the policy achievements over the past year are significant. While all of the triggers are
important, the adoption o f decrees to achieve rapid debt restructuring for PEMDA and
PDAMs is considered particularly significant, signaling a change o f direction inthe water and
sanitation sector after a decade o f declining performance. The PLNPSO measures are a good
strategy for buildingthe political case for possible tariff reform, the PPPprogram is beginning
to yield physical investments, and important governance measures, including semi-e-
procurement, have been adopted in the Ministry o f Public Works. The Bank has taken into
account the importance o f these reforms inproposing a $200 million loan amount for IDPL2.

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
100.    InassessingIndonesia's suitability forpolicylending, the IMFandthe WorldBankin
Indonesia consult regularly on macro-economic and sectoral issues. The Bank coordinates
closely with the Fund in its regular post-program monitoring and Article IV missions. In
addition, the Bank, the Fund and development partners have worked closely on the Public
Financial Management (PFM) agenda. The Fund has provided advisors to the Ministry o f
Finance to advise them on TSA issues and tax administration reforms, and the DPL's
indicative triggers have been developed in close coordination with the work o f these advisors
and the agreements reached between the Fund and the government. The DPL has thus
provided a platform to push the reform agenda in these crucial areas where both institutions
are working. Finally, as part o f a possible future DPL agenda, the Bank i s working closely
with the Fund to assess asset, liability and cash management at Bank Indonesia and the
Ministry o f Finance.

101.    The World Bank, the ADB, and the Government o f Japan are all supporting the
Government's infrastructure reform program, andthere is close coordination between all three
development partners. The ADB and Japan have a separate but related series o f policy loans,
focused on a large subset of the Government's reforms. The reforms being recognized by the
Bank's IDPL series are a smaller subset o f the Government's reforms, focused on areas o f
highpriority to the Government, andwhere the Bank is closely involved indialogue with the
Government.

102.    The "Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program" (IRSDP) is a cluster o f
three policy-based sub-program loans, supported by the ADB and the Government o f Japan.
The ADB's planned loan timing is November 2006, November 2008, and November 2010.
The Government o f Japan's loans follow the ADB's loans with a delay o f a few months. The
World Bank was closely involved inpreparation ofthe IRSDP.

103.    The IRSDP policy matrix is set out at Annex 3. Cross-references to items in the
IRSDP policy matrix are included in the IDPL policy matrix at Annex 9, to indicate the
overlap and mutually supportive nature o f the two programs.            The IRSDP program is
organized into three themes:
        Cross-sectoral reforms, including the institutional and policy framework for private-
        sector participation, measures to mobilize long-term finance for infrastructure, and the
        delineation o f responsibilities o f national and local governments in infrastructure
        provision;
        Sector-specific reforms inroads, ports, airports, railways, electricity, oil and gas, water
        supply and sanitation, and telecommunications, addressing sector planning, cost
        recovery, competition, independent regulation, market access andprevention o f misuse
        ofmarket power, andreform o f subsidypolicies.
        Facilitation o fpreparation and execution o fwell-structured PPP transactions.

104.    As with the WorldBank's IDPLprogram, the ADB is restructuringits policymatrix to
reflect the dynamics o f policy reform. Not all o f the triggers for this year's IRSDP operation
have been achieved, but overall progress i sjudged to be significant. The initial IRSDP policy
matrix consisted of 215 outputs (63 in 2006; 99 in 2008; and 53 in 2910). The first IRSDP
"Report andRecommendation o f the President" foreshadowed a redistribution o f outputs from


                                               29

2008 to 2010, to better balance reform effort over time. This year the ADB is dropping 11
outputs, and adding 10, deferring 36 outputs from 2008 to 2010, and advancing 9 outputs
from 2010 to 2008. The revised program includes 214 outputs (63 in2006, 75 in2008, and 76
in2010).

105.    The ADB's first IRSDP loanwas for US$400million. The first IRSDP loandocument
suggested that subsequent loans would be in the range of US$ 300 million to US$ 400
million. This year, the ADB's proposed loan amount i s US$280million. The reduced amount
reflects lending envelope constraints rather than dissatisfaction with the pace o freform.

106.    The Government of Japan has adopted the ADB's policy matrix. Japan provided a
parallel policy loan inMarch 2007, and plans to follow the ADB's second loan in early 2009.
Japan's first IRSDP loan was US$ 100 million, and the second loan i s planned to be for an
unchangedamount o fUS$ 100million.

107.    The World Bank's and ADB's 2008 and 2010 operations will coincide very closely in
timing, but the ADB does not plan to provide a loan in 2009 to coincide with the World
Bank's proposed IDPL 3. The World Bank has beenrequestedbythe Government to provide
an operation in2009. Both the Government and the ADB are content with the plannedtiming
of the IRSDP operations. There i s regular dialogue between the Bank, the ADB, and the
Government of Japanto ensure consistencyo fpolicy messages. For example, the past year has
seen particular attention to the messages provided to the Government in respect of proposed
revisions to Perpres67, and concerningprogress on triggers relatedto PPPs.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS
108.    The IDPL series i s complemented by existing and proposed World Bank Group
infrastructure operations which, in addition to expanding infrastructure networks and
promoting household access to services, address high priority sector-specific institutional
issues:


    0   The Private Provision o f Infrastructure TA loan (closing in FY09) helped to support
        the institutional and social foundations to facilitate efficient and sustainable large-scale
        private investmentininfrastructure, including support for the creation of the PPP unit,
        legal andregulatory reform, and sector policy and strategy studies.
    0   The road sector i s currently supported by two ongoing investment operations. In
        addition to financing important links in the country's transport networks in eastern
        Indonesia, and Java and Sumatra, the operations address matters including
        decentralization o f planning and management for sub-national roads, quality of works
        procurement, piloting performance-basedmaintenance contracting and addressing the
        social impact of roads development. An investment project i s currently under
        preparation addressing institutionalcapacity for maintenance and budget operations in
        western Indonesia.
    0   In the water and sanitation sector a programmatic loan promotes rural household
        access to safe water, basic sanitation and improved hygiene including use o f
        community-drive approaches andcapacity-building for local government to implement
        WSS projects. Loans currently under preparation would pilot PDAM arrears
        restructuring and strengthen PDAM management; support the institutional

         environment for private operators under a design-build-lease model and pilot output-
         based approaches.     Recent and forthcoming TA support provided the Bank will
         examine constraints to water and sanitation investment at the local level,
         benchmarking PDAMs,         corporatization o f urban PDAMS and support the
         development o f WSS inputsto the MTEF exercise.
    0    In the energy sector, an investment loan focuses on the expansion of the gas
         distribution system and capacity building for the gas utility, PGN, and earlier
         institutional reform for both PGN and PLN was supported through the Java-Bali
         Power Restructuring project. The Bank i s also preparing a hydro-electricity project
         (UpperCisokanpumpedstorage) and a geothermal investment lendingproject, botho f
         which address the fuel mix o f the power system and include elements targeting PLN's
         operational andmanagement efficiency.
    0    The Bank also finances a number o f operations andtechnical assistance inthe areas o f
         support for decentralized government and community-driven development programs.
         Local government projects support strengthened governance at the regional and district
         level, and a large element of the CDD programs is associated with the delivery o f
         community-determined infrastructure.

109.     The governance reforms supported by the IDPL program will help to improve the
government's own systems, potentially lessening procurement and social and environmental
safeguards difficulties inBank investment loans.

LESSONSLEARNED
110.     The design o f the IDPL program initiated in IDPL 1 reflected general World Bank
experience in the design o f policy loans, as set out in and discussed more extensively in the
IDPL 1 Program Document. This experience includes the good practice principles on
conditionality (Box 1). The lessons learned over the past year relate to the specifics o f the
IDPL program. This experience suggests the usefulness o f the IDPL dialogue in advancing
new ideas with key policy makers. At the same time, the mixedprogress on triggers set out in
IDPL 1 underscores the importance o f regular dialogue on the triggers, both to maintain
momentum and to refine agreement on policy content.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
The analytical underpinnings o f the IDPL program were set out in the IDPL 1 Program
Document. Chief among them i s a major cross-sectoral World Bank report, "Indonesia,
Averting an Infrastructure Crisis: A Framework for Policy and Action", which was published
in2004, andwhichwas substantiallyadoptedbythe Government. The cross-sectoral analysis
o f critical infrastructure issues was updated as part o f the 2007 Public Expenditure Review.
In 2008, the Bank has commenced studies looking at issues of land acquisition and
environmental management, in support o f the IDPL program. It i s also plannedto conduct an
update o f the 2004 infrastructure review over the next year, to provide a briefing to the
incoming Government, and to provide updated analytical underpinnings for the IDPL triggers
for 2010.

                Box 1 Application of GoodPracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle I: Reinforce Ownership
The vast bulk o f the IDPL program embodies reforms which have been at the center o f the Government's own
program and where there could be no doubt o f the Government's own commitment to the reform objectives. In
such areas, the IDPL dialogue i s usedto make suggestions for improvements inthe way inwhich the Government
works towards its own objectives. In one or two areas, the IDPL dialogue has been used to advance reforms
which were not initially within the Government's main program. Insuch areas, the IDPL dialogue has been used
to convince key policy makers o f the need for action, building championship for the reforms. The agencies
directly responsible for the relevant reforms have been given the task o f identifjmg ways to address the
Government's underlying objectives. Thus, for example the Coordinating Ministry o f Economic Affairs has
championed reform o f land acquisition processes, but the national land agency, BPN, chairs the Land Working
Group, with support from the Coordinating Ministry. The Land Working Group has drawn together multiple
agencies to identifythe underlying issues and develop responsesto them.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with Government andpartners on a coordinated accountabilityframework
The policy matrix represents an agreed framework by Government and the Bank, involving considerable overlap
with an ADB budget support operation covering infrastructure. The matrix reflects considerable discussion and
agreement within government and subsequently with the Bank regarding responsible ministries and agencies
accountable for the satisfaction o f triggers.

Principle 3:       Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix entails a subset o fkey reformmeasuresthat are part ofthe Government's broader development
program. Although the Bank i s engaged indialogue across a number o f infrastructure policy issues, many policy
actions are left outside the scope o f the IDPL to take into account country circumstances and the political
economy. At the same time, trigger satisfaction has been supported by a range o f technical, analytical and
lending assistance provided by or coordinated with the World Bank Group in areas including public-private
partnerships and support for institutional development inthe MoPW.

Principle 4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving resultsas conditionsfor disbursement
Triggers for IDPL 2 have beenrefinedfrom the indicative trigger list suggested inIDPL 1. The trigger list has
been focused on areas critical for achievement this year inorder to ensure overall outcomes o f the lending series
in2010, and some triggers have been reformulated to better reflect approaches adopted towards meeting these
outcomes over the past year.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive topredictable andperformance-based Jnancial
support
Predictability o f financial support has beenenhancedbythe proposed addition o f an IDPL 3 in2009, with the
advantage o fgreater focus and increased review o f progress towards series goals by2010. IDPL preparation
missions provide periodic reports to the Government on the Bank's assessment o f the progress towards indicative
triggers.

    V. THE PROPOSED SECOND INFRASTRUCTUREDEVELOPMENT POLICY
                                                  LOAN

111.    The IDPLprogram i s intended to increase the level and effectiveness o f infrastructure
financing, addressing the backlog o f infrastructure investment that arose in the decade
following the 1997 financial crisis. Inadequate infrastructure currently acts as a constraint to
Indonesia's growth potential   - most obviously in the case o f current widespread electricity
blackouts, but also inhidden costs o f severe traffic congestion, the health costs o f inadequate
water, sanitation, and solid waste, and the opportunity cost o f a non-existent national
expressways network. The Bank's 2004 study, "Averting an Infrastructure Crisis", identified
potential infrastructure investments o fUS$4.7 billion that could boost GDPby 2.4%.

112.    To improve outcomes in infrastructure sectors, the IDPL program addresses financing
directly provided by the national government, the incentives for sub-national governments to
improve infrastructure delivery, and the policy environment for private infrastructure
investment. The principal intended benefit o f these elements o f the IDPL program i s a
contribution to economic growth andpoverty reduction.

113.    The IDPL program also supports related governance reforms, addressing risks
associated with increased infrastructure spending.        These risks include social dislocation
associated with land acquisition, environmental impacts, and corruption. The IDPL program
contributes to the policy environment in each o f these areas, encouraging the Government to
better integrate these concerns into its infrastructure reforms.

114.    The big picture o f the Government's infrastructure reforms is one o f gradual but solid
progress across a broad front, with the IDPLreforms representingjust a subset o f the entire set
o f policy reforms. Inevitably, some reforms move faster than others, and when attention is
confined to the particular indicative triggers identified in IDPL 1, several have not yet been
achieved. Strong progress can, however, be seen in each o f the IDPL program's four broad
policy areas, (national infrastructure, sub-national infrastructure, PPPs, and cross-cutting
governance issues), and the reforms associated with PDAM and PEMDA debt are particularly
significant.

115.    It is proposed to refine the structure o f the IDPL series to better reflect the
Government's achievements and priorities as well as principles o f good practice in DPL
design. The revised series would consist o f four policy loans, rather than the three initially
envisaged. The objectives o f the program remain unchanged. Two modifications are proposed
for the monitoring framework. The revised IDPLPolicy Matrix is set out inAnnex 3.

RESTRUCTURINGOF THE IDPL PROGRAM
116.    The Government has requested that the IDPL series proceed annually, rather than with
the timing initiallyproposed. Reasons include a desire to maintain regular policy dialogue on
infrastructure, as well as ensuring timing o f budget support aligned with the Government's
fiscal year. The initially proposed program consisted o f operations in 2007, 2008, and 2010.
It is now proposed to have operations in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The proposed annual
timingwill also match the new macroeconomic DPL series, which is proposed to commence
with DPL 5 in 2008, and to include DPL 6 in 2009 and DPL 7 in 2010. It is important to


                                                 33

maintain the end-point o f the IDPL series in 2010, in order to provide sufficient time to
achieve the overall program objectives.

117.    The initial timing o f the program was developed to match the ADB's three loan
program. The ADB's operations were initially planned for 18 month intervals, commencing
in late 2006 and with a second operation planned for mid 2008 and the final operation in
2010. While synchronization with the timing o f the ADB's operations would be desirable, the
Government's stated preferences, as well as the desirability o f maintaining regular policy
dialogue, are felt to be more important.

118.    A riskwith the introduction o fIDPL3 in2009 is that reform progress maybe delayed
by elections. The Minister o f Finance, the key champion for the IDPL program, considers
however, that the proposed actions in 2009 can occur prior to the transition to the new
Government in October. She further argues that it i s useful for an incoming Government to
have policy objectives and bureaucratic initiatives in place for the first several months o f
operation to ensure ongoing momentum, without impinging on the new Government's
prerogative to revise policy directions.

PROGRAMPROGRESS SINCE IDPL 1
119.   Annex 7 sets out progress made over the past year towards the IDPL program
indicators. The Government is already well on the way towards achieving the program
objectives for 2010:
    a  Public expenditures on national and sub-national infrastructure during 2007 exceeded
       the IDPLprogram targets.
    e  The condition o f the national road network has improved, and the number o f lane
       kilometers has steadily increased inrecent years.
    e  Progress i s being made on a group o f toll-road concessions, many o f which were
        signed before 1997, with four toll-roads having commenced construction phase, and
       progress being made on landacquisition, a major obstacle over the past decade.
    e  The World Bank's PPI database indicates that private sector financial commitments to
       private infrastructure projects in 2007 exceeded the IDPL program target o f 0.75% o f
        GDP.
    e   Several measures have been undertaken to improve the quality o f environmental
       impact assessment.
    e  Available measures suggest significant reduction in the prevalence o f open-dumping
       o f solid waste.
    e  Recent years have shown a steady reduction inthe average time between tendering and
       contract award for Ministry o fPublic Works national roads contracts.

120.   While there i s strong reason to believe that the IDPL program's objectives will be
achieved by 2010, the particular measures that will be put inplace to achieve those objectives
will inevitably evolve over time. Reflectingthis variation inprogress indifferent policy areas,
Table 7 summarizes the measures that were identified as indicative triggers in IDPL 1, the
Government's progress against those triggers, and the nine prior actions that have ultimately
been recognized in the current operation. Very briefly, there were 16 indicative triggers; 11
have been achieved, o f which 3 involve significantly revised wording; 4 triggers have been

POLICY AREA I:NATIONALINFRASTRUCTURE
Prior Action 1:Maintainproposed 2009 APBN allocation for national infrastructure at least
30% over 2007 level.

 121.      An important recommendation o f the World Bank's 2004 study, Averting an
Infrastructure       Crisis, was that Indonesia should substantially increase infrastructure
investment. While improving the quality and effectiveness o f spending are important, and are
addressed through other IDPL reforms, addressing the infrastructure backlog also requires an
increase inthe funds allocated to infrastructure investment. This trigger addresses the part o f
national infrastructure investment that is directly within the control o f the national
government. The APBN allocations are the amounts proposedto the Parliament, for purposes
o f the forthcoming year's Budget. The monitoring indicators examine the actual amounts
invested duringthe IDPLprogram.

 122.      For purposes o f this trigger, national infrastructure i s defined to include expenditure by
the Ministry o f Public Works and the Ministryo f Transport. Increasingbudget allocations for
these ministries i s an important element of the Government's strategy o f increasing overall
infrastructure investment. The 2009 APBN proposal represents a 48% increase in allocations
to the Ministries of Transport and Public Works, compared with the allocations approved in
2007.

Prior Action 2: Publication of breakdown of the 2007 PLN PSO by region and consumer
category; and publication of a forward 3-year PLN PSO plan, integrating electrijkation,
investment, and fuel assumptions agreed by Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of State-OwnedEnterprises, and PLN.

123.    The Government provides the state-owned electricity company, PLN, with a public
service obligation (PSO) subsidy to cover the difference between its costs and the regulated
tariffs. PLN has published on its website a breakdown o f the 2007 PSO by region and
customer category.        An important proportion o f the subsidy is received by residential
consumers who are unlikely to be poor (with connections greater than 900 VA) and by large
industrial and commercial consumers (eg, consumer categories B.2, B.3, 1.3, 1.4).             It is
anticipated that publication will assist in raising public awareness o f the scope for raising
electricity tariffs for the non-poor, facilitating measures to eventually reduce the subsidy.

124.    A three-year forecast ofthe PSOhas also beenprepared, assumingno change to tariffs.
The cost o f the subsidy i s expected to decrease in 2010 as new coal-fired generation plants
come on line, but increase again in2011as debt repayments increase. The oil price, fuel mix
(ie investment plan), and electrification assumptions underpinning the forecast have been the
subject o f consultation and agreement between the Ministryo f Finance, Ministry of Energy

                                                  37

and Mineral Resources, Ministry o f State-Owned Enterprises, and the Coordinating Ministry
for Economic Affairs. The forecast has been published on PLN's website, and it is also
intended to include it as an annex in PLN's investment plan (RUPTL). In contrast with the
previous one-year PSO forecasts made by the Ministry o f Finance, this year's three-year
forecast incorporating the views o f several ministries will help to contain future costs through
earlier consideration o fthe fiscal implications o f electrification and investment plans.

                          Table 10: PLNPSO Forecast(US$ million)
              2009                             2010                              2011

 125.   The initial drafting o f the indicative trigger (see Table 7) included an element which
envisaged new policy approaches to electrification. PLN currently connects (or formalizes
existing illegal connections) around 1 million households to the grid each year, and the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources connects around 40,000 households per year,
principally off-grid. Existing customers are experiencing blackouts, and every new connection
contributes to the load and raises the fiscal impact o f electricity subsidies. This situation i s
unlikely to change until at least 2010. The revised drafting o f the trigger reflects the
Government's intention, through improved planning, to reconcile the conflict between
measures to accelerate electrification andmeasures to limit the fiscal burden o f the PSO.

POLICYAREA 11: SUB-NATIONALINFRASTRUCTURE
Prior Action 3: MOF decrees on sub-national government and PDAM debt - writing off
arrears or swapping arrears for investment commitments - and providingfor DAU intercept
for any new arrears.

 126.   Addressing the water and sanitation crisis will require significant investment, with
financing raised by borrowing against future revenues. Commercial loans are unlikely to be
available with sufficiently long tenure, so that initially most loans are likely to be provided on
concessional terms. Very few donor loans have been made inthe sector in the past 11years,
with the existence o fdebt arrears representing a significant legal impediment to such loans.

 127.   The Minister o f Finance has issued decrees which will permit debt arrears o f local
governments and their water utilities to be written-off. Write-offs will apply to interest and
penalties - the obligation to repay debt principal will remain. In some cases, debt write-offs
will be conditional upon commitments to invest a corresponding amount over a period o f
several years. Conditions for the debt write-off for PDAMs include tariffs that cover basic
costs, and approval o f a five-year business planby the responsible governor or mayor.

128.    Inorder to ensure that debt arrears do not recur, the Minister of Finance has also
issued a decree which permits the Ministry o f Finance to intercept block grants (DAU and
bagi hasil) that would ordinarily be provided to sub-national governments, in lieu o f any
amounts inarrears. Participation in any debt write-off is conditional on a restructuring o f loan
agreements to ensure that the intercept could be applied to debt which was incurred prior to
the decree that established the debt intercept. The potential application o f the DAUintercept
provides governors or mayors an incentive to review PDAM business plans carefully, as one
o fthe steps to enroll inthe PDAM debt restructuring program.


                                                 38

 129.   Beyond their significance inopening the sector up for renewed donor involvement, the
issuance o f these decrees suggests a new willingness by national policy makers to address the
severe sectoral problems. This i s underscored by the Vice President's recent announcements
seeking 10 million newwater connections over the next 5 years.

POLICY AREA 111: PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
Prior Action 4: Initiation of pre-feasibility studiesfor 6,feasibility studiesfor 4 and tendering
for 2 PPPprojects infull compliance with Perpres 67 requirements.

 130.   The IDPL program targets for PPP transactions are deliberately modest, recognizing
international experience which suggests the difficulties in launching pioneering PPP
transactions, and the likelihood o f unanticipated delays inindividual transactions. Attempting
to force the pace o f PPP projects would run counter to the objective o f improving the quality
o f project preparation. An indicative trigger for the proposed 2010 operation is the financial
close o f just two PPP transactions by 2010. The ADB's IRSDP policy matrix shares these
triggers in respect o f progress on PPP transactions, and the Bank, ADB, and JBIC have
consulted intheir assessment o f the current trigger.

 131. Including projects which have not complied with Perpres 67, more than 200 PPPs are
at various stages o f preparation, fi-om initial concept stage, through to tendering, contracting,
and financial close. Numerous pre-feasibility studies and feasibility studies have been
prepared and these elements o f the indicative trigger have been amply hlfilled. Ensuring that
tenders comply with Perpres 67 has proven to be more difficult, because Perpres 67 stipulates
that negotiations should only be commenced ifat least three bids have beenreceived. Perpres
67 compliant tendering has been initiated for four toll-road projects: Medan-Binjai;
Palembang-Indralaya; Tegineneng-Babatan; andPandaan-Malang. An initial call for proposals
was issued early in2008, but yielded insufficient expressions o f interest; a renewed attempt i s
being made with market soundings in October 2008. These projects are being prepared with
the support o f the ADB's project development facility.

Prior Action 5: Allocation of "land-capping "financial support for land acquisition for toll-
road PPPs.

 132.   The Government has struggled with the appropriate treatment o f a group o f
transactions for which some level o f public support appears to be economically justified to
ensure financial viability, for which concession contracts that have been awarded do not
comply with Perpres 67, and for which the concessionaires have not been able to achieve
financial closure in the absence o f government support through direct subsidy or guarantee.
The Ministry o f Finance has resisted pressure to provide support which would be inconsistent
with Perpres 67, but has sought advice on ways o f encouraging these projects to reach
financial closure.

133.    Initially, the Government considered the development o f amendments to the
Perpres 67 regime which could permit the allocation o f public support to generic classes o f
problematic projects. Mechanisms considered included a second round o f bidding for project
rights with an advantage given to the incumbent concessionaire (a Swiss challenge). With
time, however, some o f the problem projects have lapsed, and re-bidding anew for these
projects is being considered (this i s the case with a proposedJakarta monorail PPP).

                                                 39

134.     The remaining problematic projects consist principally o f a group o f toll-road
concessions which were awarded prior to the financial crisis in 1997. The major cause for
delay has been difficulty in ensuring land acquisition, which i s a prerequisite for commercial
banks to commit to financing the transactions.          Over the past year, the Government has
focused on addressing this obstacle, and has indicated that concessionaires who are still not
able to reach financial close will have their contracts terminated. One o f the concessions has
already been terminated, in accordance with the regulatory framework surrounding toll-road
concessions.

135.     To address the land financing issues o f the problematic toll-roads, the Government has
prepared a "land-capping" scheme. This year's Budget has provided for a h d o f Rp. 4.9
trillion to be made available during 2008, 2009, and 2010, to assist in financing land
acquisition for the toll-roads. The scheme is set out in Ministry o f Public Works Regulation
12PRT/M/2008 o f 28 July 2008, which relies for its validity on the Roads Law. Inessence,
the concessionaires will be responsible for financing the first 110% o f the amount they would
have paid for land under the contract, and then the Government will finance an additional
sum, up to an amount which would change the project's internal rate o f return by 4%.

136.     From within the total fund, the allocation o f money to particular toll-roads is
determined having regard to various criteria: the progress already made in acquiring land for
the toll-road; whether the concessionaire has advanced its financing obligation; an estimate o f
the financing increase needed to resolve land acquisitionissues; andthe difference infinancial
viability of the project as a result o f the cost increase. Ifthis funding is insufficient to acquire
all the necessary land, the concessionaire will be given the option o f either terminating the
concession, or financing the remaining sum for land acquisition.               Land acquisition is
conducted bythe Ministryo f Public Works andthe acquired landbelongs to the Government.

137.     The land-capping scheme is a pragmatic solution to a difficult situation, balancing the
rights o f existing concessionaires and the desire to accelerate infrastructure investment against
the need to ensure due process andto limit the Government's financial outlays.

POLICY AREA IV: LANDACQUISITION, ENVIRONMENT, AND
PROCUREMENT
Prior Action 6: Adoption of an action plan by the Land Working Group to accelerate land
acquisition processes and ensurefair compensation and rehabilitation measuresfor project
affected persons.

138.     Over the past year the Government has established the Land Working Group and two
sub-committees, with membership drawn from the national land agency (BPN), the
Coordinating Ministry o f Economic Affairs, Ministry o f Housing, Ministry o f Public Works,
and BAPPENAS. The "land banking" sub-committee deals with issues o f land zoning and
purchase o f land in anticipation o f hture developments. The "land acquisition" sub-
committee has developed the actionplanthat i s targeted bythis trigger.

139.     The land acquisition sub-committee has identified a set o f issues which it considers to
be the key obstacles to timely land acquisition. The issues include, among other matters, the
methodology used for land valuation (ie assessed value for tax purposes (NJOP) or
independent appraisal), the areas in which licensed independent land appraisers operate, the

                                                   40

structure o f land procurement committees, and budget processes for allocating public funds
for land acquisition. A summary o f the actions that the Government intends to undertake over
the next year i s provided inBox 2. The full action plan allocates responsibilities to particular
agencies, andprovides a brief description o fthe problems being addressed.

        assessedtax value (NJOP).
    a   Issue technical guidelines establishing that independent appraisals o f landvalues can
        bemadepublic.
    a   Public information campaign concerningthe landacquisition negotiationprocess and
        procedure for landprice assessment.
    a   Prepare regulation setting out revisedprocedures for application o f compulsory
        acquisition.
    a   Public information campaign concerning the procedure for compulsory acquisition,
        including procedures which permit landacquisition to proceed, notwithstanding
        ongoing disputes, provided that the assessedlandvalue i s deposited into a holding
        account.
    a   MinistryofHomeAffairs guidelines to villages or sub-districts establishing that they
        should not register land transactions for landwhich is the subject o fpublic facilities
        construction.
    a   Regulation establishing a time-limit for the grantingo fproject locationpermits
        (issuance o f which i s a pre-requisite for any land acquisition negotiations).
    a   Prepare guidelines allowing multi-year budget allocations (DIPADIPDA) to pay
        compensation for land acquisition.
    a   Prepare a regulation that would permit Independent Appraisers to work anywhere in
        Indonesia.
    a   Permit licensed surveyors to work anywhere inIndonesia.
    a   Furtherreview onmeasures to accelerate the issuance o fnew landcertificates where
        existing parcels are broken up due to public projects.
    a   Further review o fprinciples for mandatory land acquisition where 75% o f affected
        landholders accept a proposal.
    a   Prepare technical guidelines coving the responsibilities o f national andprovincial land
        acquisition committees.


140.    This is a new area o f policy development inthe Government's infrastructure reforms,
and was introduced as part o fthe D P L dialogue. Development o f the action planis a critical
element inbuildingownership o f the reforms, startingwith inter-ministerial recognition o f the
problems that need to be addressed. The issue is recognized inInpres 5/2008 as one o f the key
infrastructure priorities o f the Government. The Bank will work with the Government over
the coming year, in a piece o f analytical and advisory assistance, to help strengthen
implementationo f the action plan.




                                                 41

141.    The indicative triggers for 2008 also included a proposed Ministry o f Public Works
decree on inclusion o f land acquisition costs innational road project budgets. The budgeting
issues associated with land acquisition for roads are complex, and include negotiations with
sub-national governments, timing o f budget availability for sub-national governments, and a
variety o f practical constraints in executing the budgets available for land acquisition. These
problems cannot be addressed through a Ministry o f Public Works decree. They are, however,
being tackled through the land acquisition action plan, being developed by the Land Working
Group. It i s also expected that adoption o f a medium-term expenditure framework linked to
program objectives will help to ensure realistic project budgets for land acquisition. The
trigger has been dropped since the relevant reforms are being addressed insatisfactiono f other
triggers inthe IDPLprogram.

Prior Action 7: New Law on Municipal Waste Management to reduce the generation and
improve the handling of solid waste.

142.    The Law on MunicipalWaste Management aims to reduce the generation and improve
the handlingo f solid waste inan environmentally responsible, safe andhealthy manner, based
on the principle o f "reduce, reuse, recycle." Through this law, the Government aims to create
an incentive system whereby individuals will be encouraged to reduce the generation o f solid
waste (and disincentives for poor solid waste practices/ behaviors), while local governments
and businesses will be given an incentive to improve the management and disposal o f solid
waste.    The legislation aims to move Indonesia from a solid waste culture o f "collect,
transport, dump" to a culture o f "collect, separate, process." Through sorting and processing,
inparticular, somewastes canberecycledandreused.

143.    The law lays out rights and responsibilities, both for individuals, solid waste
management groups, and local governments. The law details the functions and authorities o f
government at each level: district, province and center.             The law requires that local
governments develop closed waste management facilities (ie., sanitary landfills) and cease the
use o f open dumping within 5 years of passage o f the law. The law also governs partnerships
and creation o f user groups to improve solid waste management at the level o f district or city
government. Provisions clarify the need and methods for peoples' participation in decision
making, payment and compensation, and prohibitions on sale, import or transport o f solid
waste. Citizens groups that believe they have been harmed by poor solid waste management
practices have the right to bring a class action suit for redress and compensation. This i s one
o f the ways that the law aims to promote and provide the tools for citizens to demand better
service delivery from their local government agencies. The law includes sanctions and fines
for violation.

144.    The law requires city governments to develop solid waste management plans including
local implementing rules.     The Ministry o f Environment plans to roll out a socialization
program over the coming year to help local governments understand their roles and
responsibilities, and will produce technical guidance on actions to be taken.       Ministry o f
Public Works will provide guidelines on how to design sanitary landfills. The result should
be that wastes are better contained in sanitary landfills, some wastes are recycled, so that
landfills last longer and there i s less cost to the local governments.




                                                   42

145.    Next steps in development o f the solid waste implementation program are to develop
the regulations andMinisterial decisions called for inthe legislation. The parliamentprovides
one year for this to be achieved, so this i s a high priority for the Ministry o f Environment.
There i s an inter-departmentalreview process for the regulations, which will involve meetings
andnegotiations with lineministries, mediatedbythe Ministryo fLaw andHumanRights.

Prior Action 8: Semi-e-procurement extendedto all national roads works contracts.

146.    The Ministry o f Public Works is undertaking several initiatives to improve the
integrity and efficiency o f procurement processes (an overview is at paragraphs 87 to 95). A
key reform selected for recognition inthe IDPL program i s the introduction o f an advanced e-
procurement system. The system handled 4,000 contracts last year and it currently allows
publication o f advertisements o f projects, availability o f bidding documents on line for free
download, online clarifications and queries and notification o f contract awards on line. All
Director General o f Highways (DGH) national roads contracts in all regions and all values o f
contracts are processed through the system. To date the Ministry o f Public Works has been
constrained in allowing submission o f bids on-line due to the lack o f digital signature
legislation. However this has recently been enacted andDGHwill move to full e-procurement
inthe near future.

147.    These measures represent an important step in the promotion o f competition in road
works contracting. In the absence o f such measures it was possible to restrict knowledge o f
tendering opportunities, raising the potential for bidding cartels.     Publication of contract
awards helps to raise industry awareness o f the outcome o f particular contract processes,
increasingthe potential for complaints to be made inthe event o fbiddingcartels.

Prior Action 9: Adoption of an action plan to strengthen staff capacity at Inspectorate
General of the Ministry of Public Works, and introduce modern risk-based methodology and
practices toprovide assurance on theMinistry's internal control systems and compliance.

148.    The Ministry o f Public Works Inspectorate General (IG) i s responsible for ensuring
compliance with the Ministry's procedures, including internal auditing. Drawing from a
Public Financial Management (PFM) assessment o f DGH which included an analysis o f the
Inspectorate General's operations, the Inspectorate General has prepared an action plan to
strengthen its operations. A summary o fthe actionplanis provided inTable 11.

149.     Strengthening the Ministry o f Public Works' internal systems is an important part o f
the Bank's governance agenda, but it falls outside the direct influence o f the strongest IDPL
champions: Ministry o f Finance, Coordinating Ministry o f Economic Affairs, and Bappenas.
Accordingly, the action plan i s being used as an instrument to build ownership o f the agenda
within Ministry o f Public Works, with a view to progressively stronger engagement with the
Ministry through the IDPL dialogue. Technical assistance to the IGwill be provided using
AusAID funding, with oversight from the World Bank, to assist in implementation o f the
action plan. The technical assistance following the assessment could contribute significantly
to strengthening internal controls in the ministry, including in critical areas like procurement
and asset management.

INDICATIVETRIGGERSFORIDPL3
150.    The "indicative triggers" for IDPL 3 consist largely o f a mix o f policy actions which
were initially planned for the 2008 and 2010 operations. It i s proposed that a decision to
proceed with IDPL 3 would hinge upon achievement o f indicative triggers in each o f the four
broad policy themes o f the IDPL program, with the level o f budget support reflecting the
extent o fpolicy reform.

Indicative Trigger 1:Maintainproposed 2010 APBN allocationfor national infrastructure at
least 30% over 2007 level.

151.    Maintenance o f adequate budget allocations for infrastructure investment and
maintenance i s an ongoing policy objective for the IDPLprogram.

Indicative Trigger 2: Publication of the breakdown of the 2008 PLN PSO by region and
consumer category; and publication of a forward 3-year PLN PSO plan based upon
assumptions and a model shared and agreed by Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, and PLN.

152.    Inthe coming year, the relevant ministries intend to update the published breakdown
o f beneficiaries o f the PLN PSO, and the rolling 3-year forecast, and to improve the model
usedto generate the forecast.

Indicative Trigger 3: Definition of revised program structure, objectives and outputsfor DG
Highways.

153.    In conjunction with development of the Government's next five year plan (2010-
2014), Bappenas i s engaged in a process o f redefining program structures to improve
accountability. The Ministry o f Public Works i s one of six government agencies, from more
than 50, that have been selected to be the subject o f efforts to define objectives and outputs,
permittingmeasurement o fthe achievements o f ministerialdirectorates. The revisedprogram
architecture will be better aligned with responsibilities o f individual directorates. As part o f
IDPL 3, particular attention will be paid to the statement o f objectives and outputs for all
programs inDGHighways.

154.    This trigger was initially proposed for 2008, and referred to "adoption o f a medium-
term expenditure framework and performance based budgeting by the Ministry o f Public
Works for the national road network." The revision o fprogram structures, their objectives and
outputs is a building block towards performance-based budgeting, and is advancing well,
albeit with a delay o f a few months relative to what was expected a year ago.

155.    Movement towards a medium-term expenditure framework i s proceeding more slowly.
Governments around the world have typically taken a decade or more to introduce effective
medium-term expenditure frameworks. Adoption o f an MTEF includes (i)"top-down"
determination o f allocations for the budget year and indicative ceilings for the medium-term
(two outer-years) for each agency; and (ii) "bottom-up" prioritization o f activities by line-
                                               a
ministries. The medium-term indicative ceilings are determined having regard to the
Government's total fiscal envelope, and assessment o f overall priorities. There are concerns
that moving to this system inan election year may excessively bindthe incoming Government

                                                45

to policy priorities o f the previous government; there are technical difficulties associated with
projecting the fiscal envelope to the degree o f reliability required; and Government focus in
2009 will be on developing the next five year plan and revising the program architecture.
Accordingly, the Government now considers that the top-down elements o f the MTEF will
likely commence during or after the budget preparations in2010.

Indicative Trigger 4: Formulation of a strategy to improve piped water services through
outcome-based incentives in the intergovernmentalfiscalframework.

 156.   This item was initially included as an indicative trigger for 2008. Over the past year
the Government has focused on implementation o f the first two elements o f its three-step
approach to water sector reform, including debt restructuring, and interception o f fiscal
transfers to ensure that debt arrears do not recur. While the Minister o f Finance has indicated
strong commitment to the development o f a strategy to provide positive incentives to sub-
national governments to improve PDAMperformance, development o f a strategy i s still at an
early stage, so that a degree o f risk should be attached to the achievement o f this particular
trigger.

Indicative Trigger 5: Hiring of a privatefirm to act as a transaction adviser on a successfee
for at least onePPP transaction.

 157.   A fundamental problem plaguingthe Government's PPPprogram is lack o f experience
within Government in the preparation o f bankable projects. The World Bank and ADB have
encouraged the Government to place greater reliance on international experts, to assist in
project preparation and marketing o f transactions. The ADB has provided a technical
assistance facility, on IDA credit-like terms, to assist inproject preparation. There are enough
potential transactions to permit experimentation with different approaches to project
preparation.

158.    Hiring o ftransaction advisers acting on success fees will help to bringininternational
experience, and will provide strong incentives for the advisers to push for financial closure.
The Government has already hired IFC, acting with a success fee, to act as a transaction
advisor for a power plant incentral Java. Four firms have expressed interest ina mandate for a
proposed rail link from Jakarta airport to the city, andthe Government i s currently considering
their proposals.

Indicative Trigger 6: GuaranteeFund legally established by Government Regulation.

159.    The initial indicative triggers for 2008 called for production o f draft legal documents
to establish the Guarantee Fund. In light of the large number o f indicative triggers initially
proposed for 2008, and the relative "softness" o f the indicative trigger, a revised 2009 trigger
i s proposed which focuses on actual implementation o f the Guarantee Fund, through adoption
o fthe legal documents.

160.    A draft Government Regulation has already been prepared, and is now subject to a
period o f internal review within Government, prior to being forwarded to the President for
approval. Inorder to link the legal creation o f the Guarantee Fundto the availability o f funds
under the 2009 Budget, it is intended that Presidential approval will await the beginning-of
2009.

                                                46

Indicative Trigger 7: Mobilization of equity for the Indonesia Infrastructure Financing
Facility (IIFF)and legal establishment of the IIFF as a company.

161.    This item was initially included as an indicative trigger for 2008.         The Indonesia
Infrastructure Financing Facility i s intended to mobilize long-term finance for use in private
infrastructure projects. Using initial capital, the facility will mobilize additional funds through
market borrowing, for purposes o f investment in private infrastructure projects. Start-up
capital i s currently being mobilized from several sources, including the Government, the
World Bank, IFC, ADB, andKfW.The precise amounts mobilized will be subject to approval
by the Boards o f these various institutions. The Government envisages initial capital,
including equity, debt, and subordinated debt, will amount to around Rp. 4 trillion (roughly
US$ 400 million). A World Bank loan i s currently being prepared to contribute US$lOO
million. The Government expects that mobilization o f initial capital, and establishment o f the
IlFFunder Indonesia's company law will occur byApril 2009.

Indicative Trigger 8: Implementation of Land Working Group's action plan, including the
removal of restrictions on the areas of operation of independent appraisers.

162.    The LandWorking Group action plan sets out a range o f measures to be implemented
during 2009. One o f the key reforms is to expand the use o f independent appraisal o f land
value, rather than relying on tax assessment values o f land. This will be done by removing
legal restrictions on the areas o f operation o fthe licensed independent appraisers.

Indicative Trigger 9: Adoption of implementing regulations for the Law on Municipal Solid
WasteManagement.

163.    Implementingregulations are a critical step inenforcement o fthe new law

Indicative Trigger IO: Submission to Parliament of legislative amendments to improve the
implementation and enforceability of theAMDALprocess.

164.    This item was initially proposed as an indicative trigger for 2010. The Ministry o f
Environment has prepared draft revisions o f the Law on Environmental Management (UU
Pengelolaan Lingkungan Hidup, update o f Law 23/1997), which includes the EWAMDAL
process.    Formal introduction into Parliament should occur in the next few months.
Associated Government Regulations (Peraturan Pemerintah, PP) are also in the process o f
being revised.      It is expected that these revisions will improve the application,
implementation, and enforceability o fthe AMDAL rules.

165.    Some aspects o f the draft law strive to codify ongoing Ministryo f Environment reform
efforts to adapt the environmental impact assessment system to regional autonomy, strengthen
enforcement, clarify authority for AMDAL between national and sub-national levels, increase
bureaucratic capacity and efficiency, deepen local level transparency and accountability, and
stimulate learning and innovation. The draft law makes substantial improvements in the
disclosure and stakeholder consultation elements o f the AMDAL system. Further discussion
of the proposed amendments i s included in Annex 6, on environmental impacts o f the IDPL
program.



                                                  47

Indicative Trigger 11: Establishment of a Procurement team in DGH staffed, funded and
mandated toprovide support toprocurement committees in terms of advice, capacity building,
review and streamlining of procurement procedures and promotion of standardized bidding
documents.

166.   This itemwas initially proposed as an indicative trigger for 2008, and i s an action that
was proposed by the Ministry of Public Works. The Ministry remains committed to the
concept o f team to provide advisory support to procurement committees. A draft ministerial
decree to establish a Procurement team has been prepared, and it i s expected that it will be
approved byDecember2008.

Indicative Trigger 12: Commence implementation of the Ministry of Public Works Inspector
General's action plan including completion of (a) an audit plan for 2010 based on a
systematic risk assessment and appropriate allocation of resources; (6) a training needs
analysisfor the IG staE and (c) a stock-taking of current audit manuals and identijkation of
areas where additionalguidance is required.

167.   The implementation o f the action plan will be carried out in a phased manner. The
focus initially for the Inspectorate General would be on adopting a risk based approach to
audit, a robust analysis of internal control systems, developing a training plan for its staff and
update o f audit manuals.




                                               48

                          VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
168.   A review o f the poverty and social impacts of the IDPL program is at Aimex 5. The
IDPL program i s intended to lead to increased investment plans over the next several years,
which in turn will take several years to induce construction and delivery o f infrastructure
services. Ingeneral, the poverty and social impacts o f increased infrastructure investment will
be positive, through the benefits o f induced economic growth, and through the direct
provision o f infrastructure services.

169.    Potential negative impacts include traffic accidents associated with increased road
usage, social dislocation and inadequate compensation for land acquisition, and potential price
increases for electricity and water services. Recent years have seen increased efforts by the
police to improve reporting o f accidents; increased efforts by various cities to improve public
transport which may assist in reducing road accidents (about 60% o f which involve
motorcyclists); and World Bank roads projects included measures to promote improved
design standards, helping to reduce the cause o f accidents. The Bank is engaging with the
Government through the Land Working Group to address issues associated with land
acquisition, including social dislocation and inadequate compensation. The recept history o f
Indonesia's treatment o f fuel price increases suggests a capacity to balance the negative
impacts o f price increases against other social benefits through democratic processes, and to
introduce compensation where appropriate.

170.    Focusing on the current operation, which constitutes one element o f the four-loan
program, the measures include:
    Facilitation o f PPPS, increasing public spending on infrastructure, and improving the
    governance o f the Ministry o f Public Works will have generally positive effects on growth
    and poverty reduction, but may lead to some o f the negative consequences identified inthe
    previous paragraph.
    Publication o f P L N PSO information o f itself has no poverty or social impact, but may
    eventually lead to electricity tariff changes. The potential impacts o f this are discussed in
    Annex 5.
    MOF decrees on debt restructuring for PDAMs and PEMDAs will by themselves have no
    impact on poverty or social impact, but should eventually lead to improved water and
    sanitation outcomes with positive social consequences.
    The new Law on Municipal Waste Management will improve solid waste management,
    with positive social consequences.
    The Land Working Group action plan o f itself has no poverty or social impact, but i s
    intended to lead to improved compensation standards through the use o f Independent
    Appraisers for land acquisition.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
171.    Successful implementation o f the IDPL program i s likely to lead to increased and
improved infrastructure services,         with both positive and negative environmental
consequences. Annex 5 describes the nature o f these potential effects, and reviews the
Government's capacity to deal with these effects, and the measures being put in place to
strengthen this capacity.

172.    Many o f the reforms supported by the IDPL program will help to improve
environmental outcomes. Increased sanitation, potentially higher electricity prices to promote
energy conservation, promotion o f recycling and sanitary landfills, and improved AMDAL
processes are all reforms which would help to improve the environment. On the negative
side, the IDPL program seeks increased infrastructure investment, which carries risks o f
negative environmental effects. These potential effects include greenhouse gases and other
emissions from increased electricity generation capacity, air pollution associated with traffic
on increased road capacity, and local environmental impacts associated with construction
works for all forms o f infrastructure facilities. Among the latter, the most significant effects
would arise from road construction inenvironmentally sensitive areas.

173.    Measures are underway to address all o f these classes o f negative effects. Following
on from its successhl hosting o f the 2007 Bali Climate Change Convention, the Government
has developed several initiatives demonstrating high-level commitment to addressing climate
change. An important step to improve air quality was taken with the elimination o f leaded
petrol in 2007 and individual cities are taking measures to promote public transport. The
Ministry of Environment is taking measures to strengthen the capacity of sub-national
governments to manage local environmental impacts, and the Ministry o f Public Works has
recently enhanced its environmental standards relatedto road development.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION
174.    The IDPL 1 Program Document set out the monitoring and evaluation framework for
the IDPLProgram. Notwithstandingthe restructuring o f the loan series, and timingo f triggers,
the overall evaluation framework remains broadly unchanged.            However, in two respects
Board approval i s sought to modify the evaluation framework.              The proposed revised
monitoring and evaluation framework i s set out in Table 12, with amendments in bold text.
The latest information onprogress towards the target indicators is set out inAnnex 7.

175.    The IDPL 1 evaluation framework specified a target indicator o f 60% o f the
population with access to electricity by2010, compared with 55% in2003. Under the existing
electrification program PLN provides connections,              or formalizes existing informal
connections, for over 1 million households per year. The Ministry o f Energy and Mineral
Resources reports that the level o f access to electricity i s currently 64% o f the population, so
that the IDPL 1target indicator has already been achieved. The revised IDPLprogram triggers
focus on reducing the PSO subsidy by improving its targeting o f lower income households,
reflecting the Government's priorities inthe sector. Accordingly, it is proposedto replace the
existing target indicator with a new indicator, aiming for an increase in the proportion o f the
P L NPSO receivedbyresidential consumers with connections o f less than 900 VA.

176.    The IDPL 1evaluation framework also specified a target indicator     O f  35% o f the urban
population with access to piped water by 2010, compared with 31% in 2006. While the
Government i s beginning to address policy blockages to investment inthe water sector, it will
take time for these policy reforms to have effect, and even longer for the policy reforms to
induce construction works which lead to increased access to piped water services. Whatever
the level of access to water services in 2010, any change is unlikely to be attributable to
reforms embodied in the IDPL program. A replacement indicator i s proposed, targeting $300
million o f new PDAMinvestment,with the evaluation period commencing at the beginning o f

loan o f US$200 million that would be made available upon loan effectiveness, as all policy
actions supported by the loadcredit would have been completed prior to Board presentation.
For the IBRD loan, the Government has confirmed that Indonesia would borrow this amount
as a Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) in US$ currency with annuity repayment schedule linked to
commitments.

179.     Loan disbursement will follow standard Bank procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account o f the Borrower
at Bank Indonesia that forms part o f Indonesia's official foreign exchange reserves. The
equivalent Rupiah amount will immediately be transferred to the General Operational
Treasury (SBUN) account o f the Borrower that i s used to finance budget expenditures, as the
loan i s intended to be used to support the general government budget. The Borrower will
provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and provide
to the Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank may
reasonably request. Disbursements o f the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases
andno procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to
comply with the standardnegative list o f excluded items that may not be financed with Bank
loan proceeds. Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform program in
the infrastructure being supported by this DPL will form the basis for reporting on substantive
policy issues.

R I S K S AND RISKMITIGATION
Corruption (highrisk)

180.     Infrastructure investment is vulnerable to corruption at all stages o f the project cycle.
Potential corruption in Indonesia poses risks that the full development potential o f the
increased infrastructure investment sought by the IDPL series will not be realized. It also
poses reputational risks for the Bank, in being associated with all forms o f infrastructure
through the IDPL series.

181. There is no simple mitigation strategy. The Bank i s pursuingmultiple anti-corruption
initiatives in Indonesia, including in respect o f infrastructure. There are anti-corruption
initiatives in multiple Bank infrastructure projects, and the procurement reforms included as
triggers are part o f the anti-corruption effort. More generally, IDPL triggers support greater
transparency and accountability through improved planning process, and greater competition
andtransparency inthe development o fPPPs.




                                                52

Government Capacity (high risk)

182.    While the Government may be committed to reform objectives, the ability to translate
that commitment into practical reform achievements i s limited by the capacity o f the
bureaucracy. In several areas o f the IDPL program, reform has been slower over the past
twelve months than anticipated by the Government at the time the program was agreed. This
has typically been the result o f low capacity, and weak bureaucratic coordination across
ministries,

183.    Mitigation strategies include realism o f triggers, based on likely reform progress, and
the provision o f technical assistance. A wide range o f donors are supporting the Government's
infrastructure reforms, across all areas o f the IDPLprogram.

Government commitment (moderate risk)

184.    Government commitment could waver, either because o f internal disagreements over
policy directions, or because the entire Government may change following the 2009 elections.
The possibility o f a change o f direction from the current Government is considered low risk.
While there are many voices within the current Government, not all in agreement, overall the
Government appears strongly committed to the reform program embodied inthe IDPL series.
Moreover, the Minister of Finance considers that the Bank's support strengthens the ability to
sustain a consistent course o f infrastructure reform and to resist political pressures to
backtrack.

185.    The 2009 elections pose a moderate risk o f weakened Government commitment.
While reform momentum could be expected to slow leading into the 2009 elections, the
indicative triggers chosen for 2009 are reforms which are in most instances already well
advanced and which can be achieved prior to any change o f Government.              More risky,
however, are the indicative triggers for 2010 when a new Government with different reform
priorities could be inplace. The mitigation strategy for this risk is inherent in the nature o f a
DPL series: if the new Government is not committed to maintaining reform momentum, the
2010operation could be delayed or cancelled.

Macroeconomic Stability (moderate risk)

186.    In recent    years   there have been significant improvements in Indonesian
macroeconomic indicators which translate into improved resilience to external shocks. But
risks nevertheless remain high, especially during a period o f global financial turmoil. The
current account remained in surplus in the first semester, although negative in the second
quarter. Foreign exchange reserves rose from Rp. 42 billion in September 2006 to Rp. 57
billion in September 2008 (down slightly their higho f Rp. 60 billion) and while they could be
a bit higher they were assessed by the Fund to be close to the appropriate level. Bothe
government and external debt/GDP ratios have declined to the 30 to 35 percent range and
BankandFunddebt sustainability analyses indicatethat Indonesiashould be able to withstand
various crises, measured as a shock to the exchange rate or interest rate while sustaining debt
payments.




                                                  53

187.    However, Indonesia is a financially open economy and there are significant foreign
holdings especially inthe stock market and Government bonds. Indonesiais thus vulnerable to
suddenreversals o f capital flows. Indonesian corporates are believed to have reasonably well
diversified finance and not to be significantly leveraged, but domestic capital markets are
quite volatile. Foreigners are estimated to hold around 20% o f the stock o f Government
bonds, posing a risk that significant hnds could be pulled back due to liquidity demands in
the U S and elsewhere andor due to rising emerging market risk pressure on interest and
exchange rates rises.

188.    Inadditionwhile domestic financing for 2008 hasbeenmet, the Government has large
gross financing needs in the next few years. The availability and cost o f this gross financing
poses risks despite the generally strong fiscal position. Mitigating these risks will require
cooperation between the Central Bank and the Economic Ministries to reassure bond holders
that their investments are safe (fiom inflation and exchange rate movements) while crowding
inprivate investmentthroughthe sorts ofstructuralreforms supportedbytheDPLprograms.

     [PEMDAs) and their water utilities (PDAMs) have failed,to provide sufficient funding
    to maintain supplies, let alone expand access. This is due in part to debt service
    'arrearson loans froin the center prechding new borrowing, To overcomethis probleln
     and facilitate achievenientof MDG targets, Government has adopted a three-pronged
    resolution strategy that.involves: (a) restructuringPEMDAand PDAMdebts throughp .
    conbinationof write-offs and debt-investmentswapsfor the accumulated.interestand
    penalties; (b) enabling use of the 'intercept mechmisin' to recover any future krnar~,     .

 '  on PEMDA debt service payments from block grants (DAU) or revenue,,sharing
    transfers (DBH); m'd (c) oflcring.'outcome-based incentives through the inter-
   'goveminentalfiscal framework to stimulate,incr,wedlocal investment.
        '    The MinisterofF&ce       willhas rtccntlysoonissued:he needed regulations on .
    debt restructuring and use of the intercept mechanism, and is now formulating a
     strategy for providing outcome-besed incentives for those PEMDN rhat achieve

             Indonesia's medium-term infrastructure inve,stnienr needs are massive and
    cannot be met by the public sector alone. On taking office, the Government moved
    quic,kly to estsblish an improved legal framework (Perpres 67/2005 and PMK
  - 380.006) for preparing and tenderhig PPP projects and for uroviding direct and
    conringent ,Governinentsupport. .It also adopted ambitious project transaction targets
    for key subsectors and initiatedthe preparationof aset p f'model' PPP'imjjecb and the

             Achievements to datwas measuredby numbers of PPP projects securing first
    drawn-down on long-term debt-have          fallen well short of expectations for various
    reasons., Moreover, most projects in the current PPP pipeline have not complied fully
    with the preparation,and tendering requirements stipulated' in Perpres C7. The issues
    here-arecomplex and differ from sector to sector. Land acquisition has posed the most
    critical piobleins for toll roadcand especially for the stalled concessions awarded
     prior to the monetary crisis-although       prospective investors have also expressed .
    concerns regardbig project preparation quality,' rendering processes, ar.d the scope of

comp!etioii by November 2008 m d the latter in 2009. The revised regulations will
incorporate significant improvements whi!e still kdhering rlrrn!y to the fundamental
principles o f project quality, transparency, and competition. AAer a slow narr-up, the

projects are now in prwss of preparation. IFC is advising on the preparation of the
Central Java coal-fxe power geqeration project, which is expected to serve as.a
model for similar IPP projects, and specialist transaction advisors will be engaged to
progress to other major projects. Concession agreements for four stailed toll. road
projects have been tendered, however they failed to satisfy the kompetirive bidding
principle 'mentioned in the Perpres 67/2005; these will shortly be rctendered. As part

            In addition to the above measures, the Govarnnent is also proceeding with
    broader reforms that are directly relevant to strengthening governance in the      '
    hfras'acture agencies. As part of our efforts to strengthen public financial
    inanageinent, considerableattention is being given TO improvingpolicies, practicesand
    capacities for procurement and audit. A national Piocuiemant Policy Agency (LKPP)
    was fonned in early 2008 and is now reviewing existing regularions on,government
    procurement (IIeppres 80). In the interim individuat ministries are moving to
    strengthen internal capabilities' and procedures. Of particular note, the Directoiate   '

    Generalo fHighways is now providingon-line infonnatiou on upcoiningpi.ocurements

    resources are being devoted to improving the effectiveness o f the Supreme Audit
    Agency asthe soh external auditor o f central and regionalgovemnient agencies andof
    the Inspectorate Generals 85 internal auditors. As part of these endeavors, the

    adopted a medium-term action plan for the introductioii of modern risk-based andit
    pmcljces. Implementation ofthe plan is expected to coininence later this year.
           T h e Government is also working to improve tlie existing land acquisition and
    environmental assessment pr0cesse.s. A minister-level Land Working Group was
                                             '
    established in 2007 and has eceiitly produced an Action Plan designed to streamline

  ' remaining agenda,. While the continuing turmoil in global. financial markets inay

    much can be achieved. We ai? also highly confident that the incoming governmei:t

1.    The positive impact on poor people o f policy reforms supported by the IDPL series
can be broadly categorized along two dimensions. First, by relieving infrastructure
bottlenecks to growth, reforms will increase average per capita incomes, including the
incomes o f poor people. Second, by increasing access to infrastructure, policy reforms
supported under the IDPL are likely to have a direct impact on the incomes (and broader
quality of life) o fpoor people. Caveats to this broadlypositive picture concern the timing
of likely impact, negative externalities o f infrastructure rollout likely to have a particular
impact on the poor andpossiblereforms o f infrastructure pricing.

CurrentStatusof InfrastructureServicesfor the Poor

2.    While the country's underlying economic indicators are strong, and the poverty
headcount has fallen to the pre-crisis level, poverty reduction remains a critical challenge
inIndonesia. Today 16.5% o f the total population (and 20% of the rural population) is
livingunder the poverty line (set nationally at Rp.166,697, andRp 146,837 inrural areas,
per capita expenditure per month). Inaddition, there are large regional disparities inthe
poverty level, with some districts exhibiting poverty rates o f over 50%. Matching such
disparities inincome are disparities inaccess to, and quality andprice, o f infrastructure.

3.    While the proportion o f non-poor households with access to all-year passable
asphalt roads is 75.9%, only 60.9% o f poor households have access to such roads. The
problem i s particularly acute for the rural poor, where only 53.0% o f poor households
have access to all-year passable asphalt roads.* According to the 2005 PODES village
survey, only 60% o f all villages have access to asphalt roads (Table One). Furthermore,
lack o f road maintenance, particularly inrural areas, i s a considerable issue inthis sector.
While the national road network i s in good condition, with 95% paved and 88% in good
to fair condition, much o f the district and village road network (that most used by rural
poor) i s inpoor to bad condition. This has a significant effect on the livelihoods o f poor
people and access to services such as education and health care.

4.    Access to water and sanitation infrastructure services in Indonesia is currently
highly regressive (Table Two).           Over one half o f poor households lack access to
sanitation (compared to under a third o f non-poor households). Again, over one half o f
poor households lack access to safe water, compared to 42% o f the non-poor.
Preliminary analysis of 2007 data suggests that only 17% o f the population has access to
piped water, from PDAM and other sources. Of the households that have access to safe
water, 52% have individual privately owned sources o f drinking water (pump or well),
and 25% have ajointly owned source (communal tap). Indonesia has one o f the highest
rates o f self-suppliedwater at both the individual and community level. Thus the majority
o f the population i s "self-provisioning".

5.     Twenty-five percent o f households pay for water, including both piped water and
other sources (vendors, etc). The average price o f water piped from plant (2004 cost
inflated to 2006 prices) i s Rp. 1,500/m3. ,This varies from one area to the next, ranging
from Rp. 340 (Lombok) to a high o f Rp 4,367 (Jakarta), as does the cost o f household
connections which range from Rp. 300,000 to Rp. 1,000,000 (Jakarta) - see Tables Three
andFour. Water companies are subsidized andthe average level o f cost recovery is 80%.
Water piped from other sources costs an average o f Rp. 21,200, water purchased from
vendors costs Rp47,700/m3, packaged or bottled water costs Rp. 326,600/m3. Given the
concentration o f piped (from plant) water provision amongst wealthier urban households
these water tariffs are highlyregressive inimpact.

6.     Rather than use vendors, most households haul water themselves. Their cost of
supplyis accounted for bythe time takento collect water. Nationally, 64% ofhouseholds
hauling water spend 5 minutes or less to access water for daily use, 29% spend between 5
and29 minutes, and 8% spend 30 minutes or more. Having to haul water has a dramatic
impact on usage. Nationally households with access to piped water use 11 times more
water than those without access. This i s even more marked for poor andrural households:
those with access to pipedwater use up to 25 times more water than those with no access,
which has significant health and sanitationimplications.

7.     Official household access to electricity was 55% in 2005, although informal
connections are common, raising access rates.g According to the 2007 Susenas, 88% o f
the population has access to PLN electricity, 90% of the non-poor and 77% of the poor.
Approximately 3 to 4% of the PLN-unservedpopulation (mostly inrural areas) use non-
PLNelectricity and the rest use energy from other sources. There is a big gap inthe level
o f usage between different types o f household: urban households use on average 60%
more electricity than rural households, and the poor use 64% less than do non po,or
households. Average monthly expenditure on PLN electricity for poor households i s Rp.
18,699, compared to Rp. 47,380 for nonpoor households (Data from the 2007 Susenas).

8.     The Bank's report Electricity for All suggests that in 2006, people in rural areas
outside o f Java-Bali were paying an average o f about $2/month on energy.                  Poor
households were on average using about 40KwH/month o f electricity. Fullcost recovery
for 40KwH/month outside o f Java-Bali was estimated at $6/month. More generally, PLN
estimates that the average small household consumer (R1,450VA) sees subsidies which
account for 40% o f supply cost.             In the absence of a breakdown quintile of the
R1/450VA sub-category, we can assume that o f all the PLNcustomers these would be the
poorest. Thus reducing R1subsidies would have a regressive effect."

 The PovertyImpactof ReformsSupportedunder the IDPL Series

 9.      All o f the reforms embodied inthe IDPL are intended to support economic growth
 and aggregate welfare through improvements in the quality, efficiency and reach o f
 infrastructure provision. In particular, a key objective o f the IDPL series i s to restore
 national infrastructure expenditure to a more appropriate level. Previous analytical work
 by the World Bank has suggested that inadequate investment in infrastructure is already
 acting as a bottleneck to growth, so that increased investment could be expected to give a
 substantial boost to GDP (Box 1).

1                            Box 1: The Importance of Infrastructure Reform                                  i

 10. Prior to the crisis, the poverty elasticity o f growth is estimated to have varied
 between -0.81 (1987-90) and -2.60 (1984-1987). As o f 2004 the poverty elasticity o f
 growth was -2.1 (See Table Five). Conservatively assuming that infrastructure investment
 is a comparatively inequitable source o f growth, a 2.4% increase in GDP per capita
 associated with improved performance o f infrastructure sectors would still be associated
 with a decline inthe povertyindex bymore than2%.

 11. In fact, previous analytical work by the Bank has suggested that infrastructure has
 traditionally been an important part o f equitable, or pro-poor, growth in the country.
 Making the New Indonesia Workfor the Poor notes that "from 1970 onwards, large and
 sustained reductions in poverty in Indonesia have only occurred during periods o f
 sustained economic growth..           . the pro-poor performance for these three decades was
 based on a conscious strategy that ... integrated the macroeconomy with the household
 economy by lowering the transactions costs o f operating inmarkets.. ...transaction costs
 fell markedly through the construction o f roads and other infrastructure that enabled the
 poor to be connected to the growth process.. ." Analysis by the ADB suggests a similar
 result for electricity, and that a 1.0% increase in government investment in roads i s




                                                        88

                            Annex 5: Poverty and SocialImpacts


associated with a decline in poverty by 0.3% over five years (the largest impact o f any
government investment).'

12. Before the crisis, growth in Indonesia was considerably more pro-poor than it has
been recently. Between 1980 and 1999, the bottom quintile o f the income distribution
saw consumption rise at rates faster than average. Since the crisis, the bottom quintile
has seen considerably slower than average income growth.12 A number o f factors account
for this change including stagnant employment growth, highfood prices and an extremely
sluggishperformance inagriculture.

13.    The poverty elasticity o f growth is significantly lower inrural regions o f Indonesia
than in urbanized regions (-0.5 in Papua compared to -2.5 in JavaBali, for example).
Declining expenditure on maintenance o f and investment in infrastructure may have
played some role inslowing agricultural growth andreducing the ability o f rural people to
benefit from continued growth in services - increasing transport costs faced by farmers
and consumers as well as reducing access to markets. Prior to the 1997 crisis, over 7% o f
GDP was spent on infrastructure investment. By 1999, this had declined to closer to 3%,
where it has remained. The Bank's recent Rural Investment Climate Assessment found
evidence o f drastic underinvestment in road maintenance and rapidly declining road
quality in the period since 1999. National figures suggest that between 2000 and 2006,
the percentage o f national and provincial roads in good or fair condition has fallen 16%
and 26%, respectively. A return to higher investment and maintenance expenditure in
infrastructure may be one factor inrestoringthe pro-poor impact o f growth.

14. International experience also indicates strong direct linkages between infrastructure
service provision and poverty reduction. Reliable, affordable and cost-effective provision
o f infrastructure services can help inimproving health and education outcomes (reducing
levels o f child mortality from water borne diseases, respiratory illnesses, better access to
schools and clinics) and indirectly inreducing the fiscal burden o f governments to create
space for other expenditures. Improved access to reliable infrastructure services can also
increase the general welfare o f poor households through reductions in the opportunity
costs (both time and money) associated with finding imperfect alternatives to meet
essential needs.

15.    Indonesian experience matches this international pattern.                 Making the New
Indonesia Workfor the Poor suggests that better access to roads and telecommunications
"are associated with significantly lower poverty." Access to an all-year passable road is
associated with a 7.7% increase in consumption in urban areas and a 3.1% increase in
rural areas. This is even higher for certain areas such as Papua where it reaches over
20%.

16. Better quality improves the pro-poor impact o f infrastructure. Improved quality
roads, measured by a proxy o f higher average speed traveled between village and
provincial capital, raises per capita expenditure, with an elasticity o f 0.06. Infrastructure
can have a particularly dramatic effect on non-farm earnings in rural areas. The Bank's
Rural Investment Climate Assessment concluded that the percentage o f rural household
income derived from non-farm enterprises was more than twice as highinvillages where
there were no blackouts as in villages suffering blackouts more than weekly. And non-
farm income was more thantwice as highinvillages with a concrete or asphalt road as in
those connected only by a dirt road (See Figure 1 on constraints to rural enterprise
identified by surveyed entrepreneurs).

17. The costs o f inadequate water and sanitation are substantial and the health and
environmental costs in cities are especially high. Considering those 70 million people
who use and share public and other non-private forms o f sanitation facilities, it is
estimated that the cost o f poor sanitation (just measured by waiting and walking time) i s
in the order of Rp 530,000 (US$56) per person per year, or almost 2.6% of GDP.13
Overwhelmingly, poor people do not have access to networked water and sanitation.
They pay considerably more than networked consumers per liter o f water. And they do
not benefit at all from a system that starves PDAMs o f investment resources in order to
subsidize consumption. A redirection o f subsidies from consumption to rollout would be
overwhelminglypro-poor.

18. A recent survey o f those currently without access to electricity reported that 87%
mentioned the high cost o f connection as a barrier to access compared to 4% who
mentioned high monthly bills.l4And existing consumption subsidies favor the wealthy
connected over the poor. In2005, the Government provided Rp. 11trillion o f subsidies
to the electricity industry. Because o f differential access and lower levels of usage, the
poorest 10% o f Indonesians benefited from an estimated Rp. 900 billion o f subsidies,
while the richest 10% received Rp. 1.3 trillion. As with water, redirecting consumption
subsidies to rollout and supply regularizationwould be overwhelmingly pro-poor.

19. Reforms supported by the IDPL will play a role in extending access, through
increasinginfrastructure investment at the national and local level. Several IDPL reforms
are focused on supporting the government's strategy to increase household access to
quality services, including rural electrification and access to piped water.         Network
expansion will reduce the regressive quality o f existing infrastructure access, although
international experience suggests that the poorest sections o f the community are usually
the last to be connected. Policies addressing sub-national governments' incentives to
invest in infrastructure may also, in time, improve the provision o f rural roads. And
support for more rational pricing should help target (needed) subsidies at those
households that are most in need -first, those unconnected to networked services and,
second, the connected poor.

Caveats -Potential Negative Impacts of Infrastructure Reform and Investment

20.    Caveats are necessary to this broadly positive picture. First, the welfare effects o f
many o f the IDPLpolicy reforms are likely to take a decade or more to be realized. While
it is to be hoped that improved maintenance supported bybetter planningand operations
may help preserve the quality o f infrastructure over the short term, many o f the policies
supported by the series are intended to improve governance over the next few years,
which will induce new investment plans, which in turn will induce infrastructure
construction. The process o f construction may yield some benefits in terms o f
employment alongside some social dislocation. But only when construction of new
infrastructure is completed do the full benefits begin to be realized.

21.    A second caveat regards potential negative impacts o f infrastructure expansion.
Notwithstanding the many social benefits o f improved infrastructure, there may be some
social costs associated with expanded infrastructure investment.              The negative
externalities o f expanded infrastructure reach and use often fall disproportionately on the
poor. Poor people suffer from the impacts o f related pollution (including particulate and
NOx exposure from transport and energy) as well as from traffic accidents (see Box 2).

                                                                              ~
Box 2: Traffic Accidents
Indonesiais experiencing a growing road safety problemwith 30,000 fatalities occurring
annually, and an estimated annual level o f injuryabove 1,000,000. With rapidly growing
motorisation, mainly through motorcycling, this situation i s highlylikely to deteriorate
further inthe immediate future and with further road construction. Fatality rates per
10,000 vehicles in2004 were 8 times higher inIndonesiathaninAustralia, andmore than
twice the level inMalaysia. 90% o f all road casualties inIndonesiaare inthe
economicallyproductive 15 to 50 year old age group. Total annual costs o froad crashes
inIndonesia(in2002) are estimated at Rp.35 trillion, correspondingto 1.9% ofGDPand
9.9% o fthe value o f total national expenditure on investment inphysical assets.

22.    Land acquisition associated with road construction may have adverse social
consequences. Regarding land acquisition in particular, Indonesia's current standards o f
compensation do not meet World Bank standards, particularly in respect o f loss o f
livelihood. Furthermore, even land acquisition under World Bank projects has had a
mixedimpact (Box 3). Indonesia's land acquisition systems do to provide compensation
for relocation to those without formal title. The IDPL reforms which envisage improved
compensation standards may help to mitigate the adverse social consequences.

Box 3: Land Acquisition and Relocation
A review o fthe landacquisition andresettlement operations associatedwiththe World
Bank's Indonesianlending operations found that duringFYOO-FY04, the portfolio had
15 projects involvinglandacquisition andresettlement, which affected approximately
20,000 households. Urbanandtransport sector projects accounted for nearly 85% o fthe
affectedhouseholds. Almost all projects that involved resettlement were sectoral
investment projects, which typically consisted o f large number o f subprojects with
relatively small, localizedresettlement impacts. A larger proportion o f affected
households were urbanhouseholds engaged inpettybusiness, artisan trade andunskilled
labor. Common resettlement measures consisted primarilyo f cash compensation for
acquired landand replacement housing incase o f displacement. Follow-up review found
that nearly two thirds o fthe households moved to relocation areas moved out o fthese
sites eventually for want of livelihood opportunities.

Acquisition and Resettlement, WB Strategy Paper. Dec 05)

23.   A third, but only partial, caveat regards pricing reform. Giventhe cost o f a piped
water connection, pipedwater may not be an economically feasible option for the poorest
rural households even if investment levels increase and prices are rebalanced from
connection charges towards usage charges. The average household expenditureper month
is Rp. 1,470,287; the current cost o f connection for piped water can range from Rp.
300,000 to Rp. 750,000, representing up to halfthe average monthly consumption for the
average household. For the poorest quintile, whose average monthly consumption is Rp.
618,186, these fees are prohibitively high.

24.   The timing o f changes, if any, to electricity subsidies and pricing has not been
specified inthe IDPL reforms, but measures calling for their review have been included.
This i s with the aim o f reducing their regressive impact.        Upward electricity tariff
revisions would adversely affect those who already have connections, but would help to
expand the rate o f connection, particularly in the eastern provinces where poverty rates
tend to be higher. Over the coming 4 to 5 years, the Government i s committed to
expanding access to new users, in particular households, and to streamlining the tariff
structure with a view towards gradually increasing tariffs on a sliding scale for each
category o f user (ie the lowest level household users will only see on average smaller
incremental quarterly increases thanhigher level users, starting in2011.)

25.   Indonesia demonstrated its capacity to divert spending from regressive pricing
subsidies to pro-poor expenditure with the reduction o f fuel subsides in2005 (See Figure
Two). The government reallocated a total o f US$1.7 billion in 2005 away from the
regressive fuel subsidy to pro-poor sectors and programs with better-founded
development objectives (the PKPS-BBM programs).            A similarly motivated effort to
further reduce fuel subsidies and/or to retarget electricity subsidies could have a similarly
dramatic impact on poverty.

ANNEX 6: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

1.     The IDPL program promotes policies and institutional structures that will contribute in
the medium term to infrastructure investment. Though infrastructure investment can have
environmental consequences, the main purpose o f the IDPL engagement is to improve the
management and promotion o f investment in the types o f infrastructure needed to increase
growth, reduce poverty, and increase service delivery and household access to infrastructure
services.

2.     It is not possible to identify precise environmental effects o f the policies recognized in
the IDPL program. Some policies designed to increase infrastructure investment will have
positive environmental and health outcomes (e.g., water and sanitation facilities, better solid
waste management, policy changes in pricing o f fuel and power that encourage conservation
and efficiency). Otherpolicies intendedto increase accessto infrastructure services mayhave
negative effects for the environment (eg roads and power plants). Still other policies directly
target the Government's capacity to manage environmental impacts o f infrastructure service
delivery (eg. revisions to environmental impact assessment legislation). Inmost cases it will
take the best part o f a decade for policies that are designed to increase infrastructure
investment to flow through into new investment plans, construction andoperation o f facilities,
and for environmental consequences to be felt.

3.     Nevertheless, if the IDPL program is successful it i s likely that individual policies will
have significant environmental effects, both positive and negative.                       The IDPL policies -
including policies that address national government, sub-national government, and the private
sector - are focused particularly on four infrastructure sectors: energy, roads, water and
sanitation, and solid waste.           The IDPL series also contains policy reforms expected to
strengthen some key GO1 environmental policies, including the environmental impact
assessment (AMDAL) process and municipal solid waste management. The following
discussion describes the nature o f these potential effects, and reviews the Government's
capacity to deal with these effects, and the measures being put in place to strengthen this
capacity.   15



Increasedelectricity investment

4.     The Government's energy plans include increased investment in electricity generating
capacity, with likely negative consequences inrespect o f climate change and other more local
effects. The Government's current plan is to increase reliance on coal over 20 years, from
24% to 30% o f total energy use, and to expand the use o f biofuels from 1.3% to 5% o f total
energy use. Increased domestic coal consumption may contribute to air pollution, including
C02 (global warming) and SO2 (acid rain) emissions, and has the potential to lead to more



l5OP 8.60 (11):Environmental, Forests, and other Natural Resource Aspects. The Bank determines whether
specific country policies supported by the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country's
environment, forests, and other natural resources. For country policies with likely significant effects, the Bank
assesses inthe Program Document the borrower's systems for reducing such adverse effects and enhancing
positive effects, drawing on relevant country-level or sectoral environmental analysis. Ifthere are significant gaps
inthe analysis or shortcomings inthe borrower's systems, the Bank describes inthe ProgramDocument how
such gaps or shortcomings would be addressedbefore or during program implementation, as appropriate.

                              Annex 6: EnvironmentalImpacts
extensive strip mining - affecting threatened forests in Kalimantan and Sumatra. A major
expansion o f production o f biofuels could leadto more conversion o f forest area into oil palm
plantations.

5.    The Government recognizes the challenges created by climate change and has shown
highpolitical commitment for successful climate change actions. The President of Indonesia
has expressed commitment to climate change action at international venues in 2007.
Indonesiahas also achieved global visibility bypresidingover the Conference o f the Parties o f
the UNFramework Convention on Climate Change in Bali in 2007, as a leader o f the troika
countries inthe negotiating process up to 2012, as a founder o f the Forest-11, and as a leader
in the global Finance Ministers' dialogue process.      The Government has developed two
programmatic documents on climate change: a National Action Plan Addressing Climate
Change (December 2007) and the Development Planning Response to Climate Change (final
version, June 2008).     The Government also formed a National Commission on Climate
Change in July 2008, headed by the President and involving 15 key ministries. The new
institutions andpolicies that are emerging from the new focus on climate change could leadto
a reconsideration o f the energy policies noted above.

6.    In terms of measures specifically addressing Indonesia's fuel mix in electricity
generation, the Government is encouraging the connectipn o f natural gas pipelines to existing
combined cycle gas turbine plants, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions bypermitting
substitution away from current diesel fuel. The Bank is preparing an investment project
aimed at showcasing developments in geothermal energy, which could play a significant role
inIndonesia's electricity supply andwould also contribute to reduced greenhouse emissions.
It could be noted that Indonesia is a non-Annex 1 country and has no greenhouse gas
emissions reductions targets under the current international climate regime.

Reducedelectricity subsidies

7.    Through increased transparency concerning the costs and benefits o f current pricing
policies, the IDPL program encourages the Government to consider reducing electricity
subsidies. Reduced energy subsidies would restrain the growth o f energy demand, reducing
the need for investment and hence mitigating the negative consequences o f electricity
investment outlined above.

8.    Higher oil and electricity prices could induce household and industrial consumers to
switch to other energy sources, with bothpositive and negative environmental consequences.
Analysis o f the consequences o f the 2005 reductions in oil subsidies, prepared for DPL 3,
suggested:
        Lower overall consumption o fpetroleum based fuel (10-15%) byhouseholds,
        transport and industry, implyinga reduction inair pollution;
         Onlyminor effects on overall economic growth, meaning any reduction inindustrial
        timber demand would be insignificant.
    0    Some fuel switching and more active considerationo f alternative fuels for the future,
        possibly leadingto more fuel efficient technologies and lower growth o f fuel demand.
        A treblingo fthe price for kerosene (the main energy source for cooking) reduced
         consumption by 13%, comparable with annual demand fluctuations attributable to

                                                98

                                Annex 6: EnvironmentalImpacts

        other causes. Even ifthere were significant switching into fuel wood inrural areas,
        the FA0 and CIFOR have studied the issue intensively since the 1970sand concluded
        that fuel wood is not a significant driver o f deforestation or landuse change.
    0   Industrial fuel switching away from oil could leadto substitution towards coal (with
        negative consequences) or towards natural gas (with positive consequences). Inthe
        short term, industrial fuel consumers, including PLNand other electricity generators,
        were constrained intheir ability to switch fuel sources. Inthe longer term, Indonesia is
        increasing its reliance on coal.

9.    The fuel substitution effects o f higher electricity prices can be analyzed along similar
lines to the higher oil prices examined inDPL 3. Overall, the environmental consequences o f
higher electricity prices are likely to be dominatedbythe positive effects o freduced growth o f
electricity demand.

IncreasedRoadsInvestment

10. Increased road investment i s likely to contribute to increased vehicle use, and increased
air pollution, particularly in urban centers. Air pollution's annual costs to the economy have
been calculated at $400 million per year, and are typically borne disproportionately by low
income groups who are more likely to be exposed to pollution and less likely to be able to
afford mitigating measures.

11. Indonesia's vehicle fleet is one o f the major contributors to air pollution, with energy
production, industry, and forest fires constituting other important sources. Recent analysis o f
Jakarta's air indicated significant levels of lead, suspended particulates (soot, smoke dust and
liquiddroplets), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The
City o f Jakarta has several initiatives aimed at improving air quality, including the use o f
compressed natural gas inbuses, conversion o f the city's tuk tuk fleet to compressed natural
gas, promotion o f public transport, and development o f sidewalks to promote walking for
short distance travel. At the national level, Indonesia has adopted an array o f legislation
addressing air pollution, including emissions standards for vehicles, but enforcement o f these
standards i s weak.    Happily, the use o f lead in petrol was finally ended in 2007. The
significant reductions in fuel subsidies, in 2005 and 2008 are also important in terms o f
slowing the growth o f vehicle emissions.

12. The World Bank is currently conducting an "Assessment o f Fuel Quality and Vehicle
Standards and Air Quality inIndonesia". This work is expected to be completed bythe end o f
2008. Based on the analysis, the Bank will consider how best to engage with the Government
to address air quality issues.

13. Increased road investment will also include new road construction, and will result in
associated project-specific environmental impacts. The strength o f Indonesia's systems for
management o f such impacts is discussed below under AMDAL and the improvements inthe
law that will make these project specific impacts easier to manage and mitigate.
Environmental standards for national roads projects o f the Ministry o f Public Works have
recently been improved to address matters such as the siting o f workers' camps in forests,



                                                99

                                Annex 6: EnvironmentalImpacts

removal and replacement o f trees, specifications for quarries, washing roads works vehicles
near rivers, etc.

14. New or improved roads can also increase access to fragile habitats such as natural
forests, contributing to their degradation. Assistance i s being provided to the Ministry o f
Forestry to improve forest monitoring and the transparency o f information. Both measures
can help to better plan roads so that they minimize conflict with forest management. In
addition, the Aceh Forest and Environment Project i s providing information to the
reconstruction process concerning possible negative impacts o f road-building as well as
alternative routes.

IncreasedInvestmentinWater and Sanitation

15. Poor PDAM performance has contributed to excessive reliance on private wells, and
excessive groundwater extraction and subsidence inpartso f Indonesia. Low rates o f sewerage
and sanitation coverage cause widespread contamination o f surface and groundwater. As a
result, Indonesia has experienced repeated local epidemics o f gastrointestinal infections and
has the highest incidence of typhoid inAsia. Economic losses attributable to poor sanitation
are conservatively estimated at 2% o f GDP?

16. The IDPL program seeks to create the conditions for increased investment inwater and
sanitation, which will have positive environmental consequences as well as positive
implications for people's health. International experience suggests that PDAMs will need to
improve their financial situation through increased sales o fpiped water before major progress
will bemade inaddressing sanitation.

ImprovedSolidWaste Management

17. The IDPL program recognizes the national Government's initiatives to improve
municipal solid waste management. Indonesia's largely uncontrolled disposal o f solid waste
has become a growing threat to the quality o f water, air, and land.          Informal dumps
contaminate surface and ground waters, and encourage pests and pathogens that spread
communicable disease. This threat is compounded by the lack o f environmentally sound
waste disposal and treatment facilities.        The Government's new municipal solid waste
management law, and the associated "socialization" and capacity buildingby the Ministry o f
Environment are important efforts to reduce these sources o fpollution.

The Government'ssystemsfor managingenvironmentalimpacts

18.   The Government's annual work planincludes the environmental actions to be addressed
in each budget cycle. Some of the items mentioned include development of debt for nature
swaps, reducing environmental pollution, reducing smoke andhaze from forest and landfires,
national movement for the rehabilitation o f forests and degraded lands, conservation o fnatural
resources, improving environmental management through the spatial planning process and

19. Among government ministries, the Ministry o f Public Works is responsible for the
greatest infrastructure activity.       The Directorate General o f Highways, within MPW, has
established an environmental unit to ensure appropriate treatment o f environmental issues in
roadplanningand construction.

20.    A Special Allocation Fund (DAK) for Environment was instituted in 2006, providing
fiscal transfers to sub-national governments for environmental initiatives: Funding nearly
tripled in 2007 to Rp. 352 billion, indicating the Government's commitment to improving
environmental outcomes.

21.    The Government has prepared draft legislation, which will amend and improve the
existing Environmental Management Law. The new legislation is a trigger for IDPL 3. The
amendments address matters including:
     0    Standardsandrules for ambient air andwater quality, emission andeffluent quality,
          environmental impact assessment, business licensing and environmental management
          documentation, and environmental investigations;
     0    Roles and responsibilities o f central and sub-national governments;

     0    Rights o f communities and environmental organizations to make allegations and
          request investigations;
     0    Implementation o f environmental management and monitoring o f businesses;

     0    Sanctions for violations relatedto contaminationo f the environment, the
          environmental impact assessment process, or business license conditions.

22.    Environmental impact assessment i s critical in planning new infrastructure, and in
managing the environmental consequences o f construction and operation o f infrastructure.
The World Bank has supported the Ministry o f Environment in analyzing the strengths and

                                                  101

weaknesses o f Indonesia's existing impact assessment regime, known as AMDAL. Focusing
on the AMDAL elements o f the new legislation, the proposed amendments would include:
        Changingthe requirementfor assessment from projects above a certain financial size
        to projects which would have a significant environmental impact.
        A requirement that everybusiness that is expected to generate significant
        environmental impacts should conduct an environmental impact assessment to obtain a
        business license.
        A requirement that environmental mitigationmeasures identified inthe AMDAL, and
        the follow-on management andmonitoringplans must be included as conditions in
        business licenses.
        Authority for civil servant investigations including monitoring and inspection, and
        ability to report violations directly to a prosecutor, rather than going via the police as is
        currently required.
    0   Sanctions for the violations o f environment elements o fbusiness licenses or breach o f
        AMDALprocessrequirements, includingjail terms andfines (eg. 6 months and/or Rp.
        1billion (US$ 100,000) for carrying on abusiness without havingconducteda
        necessary AMDAL).

23.   The Ministryo f Environment is also engaged in measures to improve the capacity of
sub-national environmental agencies responsible for conducting AMDALs.                    Measures
include:
        Conducting surveys to examine the quality o f assessmentsprepared by these agencies;
    0   "Socializing" (ie publicizing to relevant stakeholders) the regulatory framework for
        decentralized AMDAL;
        Providing training andcertification for environmental assessors;
        Developing the roles and functions o f local governments, anddeveloping a code o f
        conduct for interactions between local councils and civil society; and
        Buildinganew system o ffiscal transfers including accountability andtransparency in
        the Kabupatenbudget and anopen inclusive process for its formulation and
        implementation.

24. The World Bank i s currently preparing a Country Environmental Analysis to strengthen
the Bank's understanding o f environment and natural resource management challenges, and
propose specific recommendations on how to achieve more effective results. Part o f this
analysis has already included a review o f the Government's and donors' priorities and
activities. Further analysis i s required to determine whether the environment and natural
resource categories that obtain most funding are the sectors most in need o f funding. The
workplan for the CEA has been discussed in a stakeholder workshop. It i s intended that this
work will be completed duringFY09.

                         governments:
                              Ministerial regulations (Kepmen 05/08 andKepmen 06/08) have
                              been issued on the structure, functions and licensing o f AMDAL

Indicator11:             Declineinthe open-dumpdisposalof solidwaste (MoE).
Baseline:                 Open dump waste disposal is 53% in large andmedium cities and 85%
                          insmall cities.
Latest information:       The IDPL2 team has not been able to verify the baseline specified in
                          IDPL 1. The Ministryo fEnvironment currently reports that 90% o f
                          cities use open dumping. Nevertheless, the Ministryo f Environment
                          indicates that open dumping will be eliminated within 5 years, so that
                          there is likely to be clear evidence o f satisfaction o f the target indicator
                         bythe end o f2010. The Ministry defines open dumpingbyreference to
                         UNEP classification, havingregardto a rangeo f factors. These factors
                          are reflected inAdapura ratings which are reported annually bythe
                         MinistryofEnvironment, andwhichmay serve as ausefulindicator of
                         progress towards the target indicator. Adapura ratings assess landfills
                          on the presence o fvarious physical indicators, such as whether there are
                          facilities for leachate treatment, whether there are monitoring wells to
                          assess the quality o fwater flowing underneath city dumps, whether

ANNEX 8: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT


BackgroundandAnalyticalUnderpinnings

1.    This operation provides general budget support to the Indonesian Government and will
be executed through the Governments public financial management systems. This annex
summarizes the current state o f these systems and the ongoing reforms with a view to
assessing the attendant fiduciary risks with respect to the proceeds o f this development policy
loan.

2.    The public financial management systems in Indonesia have strengths and weaknesses.
The strengths include a sound regulatory framework across most parts o f the budget cycle, an
orderly, transparent andpredictable budget formulation process, f h d predictability for budget
execution, sound budget classification, comprehensive and transparent budget documentation,
Government Accounting Standards aligned with comparable international standards, a chart o f
accounts which i s broadly consistent with GFSM 2001 and a strengthened external audit
institution.

3.    These strong points are the result o f a concerted reform effort among key stakeholders to
the budget process since the political transition in 1998. These efforts were given momentum
and direction in the 2001 White Paper on public financial management reform. The Bank's
DPL series has had public financial management as an area o f focus and has contributed to
some o f the significant improvements made in the last few years. Improvement in Public
FinancialManagement continues to be a key focus area for DPL 5.

4.    Key stakeholders to the budget process remain committed to further reform through an
evolving and pragmatic reform agenda. The focus o f Government reform is on the
implementation o f an integrated financial management information system, further unification
o f the budget, further improvement o f the chart o f accounts, restructuring o f budget programs,
the introduction o f a medium term expenditure framework and performance based budgeting,
a full roll out o f the treasury single account, improvement o f the institutional and regulatory
framework for procurement, improvements to cash and asset management, internal controls
and internal and external audit.

5.    This assessment draws on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World
Bank and other development partners. A PEFA assessment was concluded inJune 2008. This
assessment has also taken into consideration the findings o f a joint Bank-Fundmission on
Strengthening Budget Management undertaken inJune 2008, results o f a previousjoint Bank
Fund mission on Budget Reform Priorities reported to Government in June 2007 and the
September 2008 update o f the ROSC on Fiscal Transparency in Indonesia from 2006 (IMF
Country Report No. 08/298, Selected issues; Indonesia). The assessment also draws on the
ongoing policy dialogue and advisory services provided through the Government Financial
Management and Revenue Administration Project and the associated Public Financial
Management Multi-Donor Trust Fund.

Key PFMIssues-RecentDevelopmentsandthe Way Ahead

6.    Significant advances have been made inbudget preparation - instituting a State Budget
which combines the previous separate recurrent and development budgets and improvements
inbudgettransparency. However, problems inbudgetexecutionpersist with 50percent ofthe
capital expenditure still being spent inthe last quarter. The Treasury has conducted a survey
of the impediments to the disbursement o f budgetary h d s through questionnaires. The
results o f the survey are being reviewed and will form the basis for an action plan to smooth
out disbursements duringthe fiscal year.

7.    Implementation o f a single treasury account (TSA) as foreseen by State Treasury Law
No. 1/2004 i s ongoing. The Treasury in cooperation with BI i s presently piloting the daily
sweep o f government revenue deposits from collecting branches and post offices into the
TSA.    Depending on the success o f the pilot, the daily sweep will be extended to all
commercial bank branches starting January 2009.          Public procurement environment has
witnessed improvements in the last few years. However, there are still weaknesses in its
regulatory and implementation aspects.        Presidential Decree 106/2007 was signed in
December 2007 establishing an independent agency LKPP responsible for planning and
development o f strategies, policies and regulations associated with the procurement using
public finds. Makingnewly established LKPP operational by recruiting staff and allocating
budget i s a priority.

8.    The Government Accounting Standards are well aligned with comparable international
standards (IPSAs).     The chart o f accounts is broadly consistent with GFSM 2001.         The
aggregate Government Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in a timely manner
for four years now. However, there are questions on reliability. The Supreme Audit Agency     -
BPK - has for the last four years issued a "disclaimer" opinion on these financial statements.
Among the reasons cited for this were internal control weaknesses in the preparation o f the
financial statements and instances o fnon compliance with applicable regulations.

9.    The internal audit framework o f the Government i s extensive but the institutional
structure is complex. Government Regulation 60/2008 on Government's Internal Controls
issued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities o f the different
players in internal audit. The overall internal control framework continues to be weak with
paper intensive processes and inefficient use o f human resources. GO1is preparing for the
implementation o f an IntegratedFinancial Management System knownby the acronym SPAN
to replace the multitude o f financial data processing applications currently used by
government institutions.

10. The external audit institution, BPK, has received significant increase in its operating
budget to fund an increase in the number o f auditors as well as regional offices. The audit
report on the financial statements i s submitted to legislature within 5 months after the end of
the year. A peer review o f the BPK was completed in 2004 and revealed serious weaknesses
incapacity. Since then, improvements are graduallybeingmadeto the organization, withnew
hires andtraining. BPK has a follow up peer reviewplanned for FY 2009.

                          Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

11. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as the Anti-
corruption Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Comption Court have begunto deliver tangible
results. High profile corruption investigations have been launched, leading to a number o f
successful prosecutions.

12. Parliamentary oversight o f budget processes has been strengthened.           Parliamentary
commissions have become particularly active in scrutinizing and amending the Government's
draft annual budget. The Government published IMFfiscal transparency report andundertook
its socialization throughout Indonesia. The public availability o f fiscal information i s already
improving and the Government has published a fiscal risk statement together with the 2008
budget.

13. These reforms directly influence the environment in which public expenditure i s
planned, budgeted, executed and accounted for across all levels o f government. A more
detailed commentary on progress in implementing these reforms is given below to help
identify the attendant risks arising from the borrower's capacity to manage this loan and
determine the fiduciary arrangements for this operation.

ReformingBudgetFormulation

14. Fiscal relationships between the executive and legislature are defined in the State
Finance Law No.17/2003. The House o f Representatives (DPR) i s the principal legislative
body and it plays a significant role in shaping the budget and fiscal policy. The budget i s
passed inagreement betweenthe President and the DPR.The process involves an examination
by the DPR o f the macroeconomic framework, macro-fiscal policies and the detailed budget
allocations. The budget has been the centerpiece o f strengthening the legislature vis-a-vis the
executive following the political transitions following 1998 and the relative roles o f the
executive and legislative branches inthis area are evolving.

15. The budget documentation i s comprehensive with the main outstanding area o f
improvement being explanation o fthe expenditure implications o fnew policy initiatives.

16. The laws governing budget management clearly specify the responsibilities o f the
Minister o f Finance and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the President,
as head o f the Government, has overall authority to exercise national fiscal management, Law
No. 17/2003 clearly delegates the responsibility of overall fiscal management o f central
government finances to the Minister o f Finance as chieffinancial officer. The law also assigns
responsibilities to individual ministers, governors and other local authorities for financial
management and accountability intheirjurisdictions.

Provisions o f the new regulations are beingimplemented. Budget classification and execution
is based on administrative,      economic and functional classification consistent with
COFOG/GFSM2001.          The Ministry o f Finance i s developing plans for a medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) to guidebudget policy.

17. Forward estimates at the aggregate level were introduced with the 2008 budget and are
being including inthe 2009 budget as well. Efforts in Bappenas and the Ministry o f Financer


                                             111

                              Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

are ongoing to redefine the budget program structure and to develop templates and manuals
for a mediumterm expenditure framework and performance based budgeting. The efforts are
plannedto be piloted inthe coming years.

18. The level o f extra-budgetary expenditures i s not known and the issue is not on the
reform agenda.

ReformingBudgetExecution

19. Indonesia still spends 50 percent o f its total capital expenditure inthe final quarter o f the
year.' For the past six years, spending has always started slowly and then accelerated towards
the end o f each year. This spending pattern i s o f concern because project implementation i s
disrupted by an adverse cycle. Moreover, under-spending on capital expenditure constrains
increases ininfrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms o f
more severe challenges that are encountered at each stage o f the public expenditure
management cycle.

20.   The Government maintains a comparatively rigid budget execution process. Detailed
input controls aim to ensure that the composition o f the budget complies with political
priorities and that the budget i s not altered during execution. Spending warrants (DIPAs),
while now issued at the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive amounts o f detail leaving
little flexibility for adjustments in the composition o f inputs needed to carry out a given
activity. Re-allocations across DIPAs from delayed programs to better performing ones that
could enhance satisfactory implementation o f the overall expenditure program require lengthy
revision, sometimes involving Parliament. Such inflexibility creates practical difficulties and
inefficiencies.

21. With expandingfiscal space, public investment is increasing, puttingadditional pressure
on PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment i s inherently more demanding
thancurrent or mandatoryexpenditure.

ReformingTreasury, Cash andAsset Management

22.   Transparency i s still weakened by a multitudeo fbank accounts. The DGTreasury itself
maintains multiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and foreign currency, at Bank Indonesia.
External audit reports from 2004 to 2006 noted that there are around 4,600 bank accounts that
have not been reported to the DG Treasury. By the end o f December 2007, the Ministry o f
Finance completed a census o f all government accounts and identified 32,570 accounts.
Subsequently 2,086 accounts have been closed. Efforts are on-going to determine which o f the
remaining 30,484 accounts can be included in the TSA regime either directly or through a
mechanism o f daily sweeps into the TSA.

23.   Regulations associated with Law No. 1/2004will address this weakness andprovide for:
(i) installationoftreasurysingleaccount(TSA)atBankIndonesia; (ii) conversionof
    the                                                                               the
operational bank accounts at commercial banks into zero-balance transit accounts; and (iii)       a

                           Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

mandatory review at the Ministryo f Finance of bank accounts o f all state agencies outside DG
Treasury oversight, with a view to closing all those that do not serve the public interest. Pilot
runs for testing zero-balance arrangements with commercial banks for the expenditure
accounts have been successful.. The roll out o f TSA to the revenue accounts, which was
initially scheduled for the first quarter o f 2008, has been postponed, due to pending
negotiations with Bank Indonesia and commercial banks on interest payment for government
balances held at Bank Indonesia and remuneration o f banking services by the Government.
The Treasury is presently piloting the daily sweep o f government revenue deposits from
collecting branches andpost offices into the TSA with Bank Indonesia. The pilot i s plannedto
be tested in October 2008 in 6 branches o f 6 commercial banks and a few post offices. The
pilot is planned to be conducted in 3 Government Treasury Offices (KPPNs). Depending on
the result o f the test, the daily sweep i s planned to be extended to all commercial bank
branches starting January 2009. The daily sweep will be with respect to deposits made the
previous day and not on the same day. This i s because the commercial banks have agreed not
to charge for this service provided the sweep i s done the following day. This would be a
significant improvement compared to the current practice, established in 1989, o f sweeping
the revenue accounts twice a week.

24.   The implementing regulation for Law No. 1/2004, Government Regulation No. 36/2007
on Cash Management, was issued in July 2007 detailing the governance and set-up o f cash
management. In addition, a number o f Ministry o f Finance regulations (PKM) have been
issued to further the establishment o f the TSA:
            PMK 57 is the generic PMK to regulate opening o fbank accounts bythe line
            ministries.
            PMK 58 mandates a census o fthe existing lineministryaccounts.
            PMK 59 mandates Echelon Iofficers o fthe MinistryofFinance to disclose bank
            accounts, ifany are being operated.

25.   The cash-based accounting system generates timely records o f revenue and expenditure
transactions, but does not track monthly arrears.      Transaction records are electronically
transmitted to the directorate o f accounts at DG Treasury headquarters for consolidation and
generation o f periodic reports on budget execution. However, DG Treasury plans to move
towards an accrual recording system, which would make this possible.

26.   The Ministry o f Finance is preparing the implementation o f an Integrated Financial
Management System to replace the multitude o f financial data processing applications
currently used by government institutions. The system is known by the acronym SPAN. It will
integrate and replace the multiple software applications within the Treasury as well as those
being implemented inthe DGBudget to support the budget formulation process.

27.   Following some delay, the second stage biddingprocess for SPAN has been initiated in
August 2008 andthe contract for the provision o f turnkey services for SPAN i s expected to be
signed by April 2009. A new management and implementation structure for the project i s now
being established.

28.   Government assets are not comprehensively recorded, properly organized, and fairly
valued.    An integrated and automated asset management system, which will enable


                                               113

                           Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

government to optimize the use o f its assets across ministries and regions, will be established
in2009.


ProcurementReforms
29.   The past few years have witnessed improvements in the public procurement
environment.     Presidential Decree (Keppres) No. 80/2003 provided a national public
procurementregulation that meets most o fwhat is generally regardedas accepted international
practice, including basic principles: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and
efficiency. This decree also requires that a national public procurement office be established
as a regulatory body for public procurement. With the introduction o f Keppres No. 80/2003, a
previous certification ("pre-qualification")    process for suppliers/ providers o f goods and
services was, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. This previously led to
segmentation o f the market, especially at the provincial level. Keppres No. 80/2003 also
established the basis for sanctions, complaint-handling and requirements for certification o f
users.

30.   However, the public procurement system still has significant deficiencies in its
regulatory and, more importantly, implementation aspects. These has been delays in
establishing a strong regulatory body; slow progress in the development of procurement
regulation anchored by a law; slow progress inthe development o f standard tools interms o f
bidding documents and users manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing
agencies, especially at the provincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices
in the bidding process and concerns over the efficiency o f anti-corruption and sanction
measures.

31.   This is supported by the findings o f some analytical tools and reports such as the self
diagnostic assessment conducted by the NPPO in 2007 using the Base-Line Indicators (BLIs)
tool developed under the World Bank and OECD Development Assistance Committee
Procurement Round Table initiative. The assessment o f the BLIs presents a "snapshot"
comparison o f the actual system against the international standards or the "model system" that
the BLIs represent. Baseline bench markingo f Indonesia's procurement system inJune 2007
showed it scoring 62.5% for Legislative and Regulatory Framework (PILLAR I), 55% for
Institutional Framework and Management Capacity (PILLAR 11),59.3% for Procurement
Operations and Market Practices (PILLAR III)and 69% for Integrity and Transparency of the
Public Procurement System (PILLAR IV) in comparison with recognized international
standards. Other studies indicate that there i s significant room for improvement.

32.   PresidentialDecree 106/2007 was signed inDecember 2007 establishing an independent
agency, the Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Pemerintah (LKPP) or Government Institution for
Procurement Policy, who will be responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused and
coordinated planning and development o f strategies/ policies/ regulations associated with the
procurement o f    Goods/Works/ Services using public funds. This institution will report
directly to the President o f the Republic o f Indonesia. The organization structure for the new
LKPP is being developed. In addition to the Chairman, who heads LKPP, and an Executive
Secretary, there will be four departments, each headed by a Deputy with responsibilities for (i)
Strategy and Policy Development, (ii)    Monitoring-Evaluation and Information Systems, (iii)
Human Resources Development, and (iv) Legal Affairs and Settlement o f Objections

                                                 114

                           Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

respectively. The LKPP i s currently staffing Echelon 11positions and expected to complement
all the staffing needs by end 2008.

33.   A numbero flaws havebeen enacted since 2000 that affect, or make reference to, public
procurement. They include laws on civil works, state finance, treasury, audit, and small-scale
business. The pace o f Indonesia's decentralization reforms has affected public sector
procurement at all levels o f government, with ministers, governors, and even mayors able to
issue decrees, regulations, and instructions. The plethora o f regulations is often inconsistent
and many regulations do not meet accepted international practice. Consequently, national
procurement reform andthe need for national procurement policies and standards are critical.

34. Indonesia's legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by
anchoring it with an overarching consolidated and comprehensive national public sector
procurement law at the highest level that (i)establishes the fbndamental principles and
procedures applicable to all public sector procurement, (ii)allows for the imposition o f
sanctions where the principles and procedures, particularly those relating to good governance
and ethics, are not met, (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement, and
(iv) ensures that such a law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. The
LKPP is currently drafting a procurement law with an expected two years time horizon for
enacting this law as it needs to go through a review and consultation process followed by
submission to the Parliament.

35.   Inthe meantime, LKPP has consolidatedthe different amendments o fKepress 80/2003
into one document. It i s also planning to revise this with the objective o f improving it with
possible simplification for users.

36.   Standard bidding documents (SBD): Currently, there are no national standard bidding
documents that are used regularly by all government agencies in Indonesia. Some
implementing agencies (such as Ministry o f Public Works) have developed standard bidding
documents for their own use. The NPPO, through the support o f ADB, has drafted eight
National Model (Standard) Bidding Documents being (1) An Explanatory Guide, (2) Goods
with Pre-qualification, (3) Goods with Post-qualification, (4) Works with Pre-qualification,
(5) Works with Post-qualification, (6) Other Services with Pre-qualification, (7) Other
Services with Post-qualification, and (8) Consulting Services, and that are now available in a
draft form. The use o f these documents is still not mandatory and they are being used on a
pilot basis. It is important for LKPP to collect comments from users on these documents,
improve them and mandate their use on a national basis. One of the improvements would be
to harmonize such documents with those o f International Development Partners such as the
World Bank, ADB, JBIC and AusAid.

37.   Public Procurement Function: There has been growing concern, both by the
Government and the Bank, over the pace o f project implementation. Significant delays and
slow disbursement seem to occur across the entire PFM cycle. Projects reported delays and
difficulties    in budget      preparation    and    approval,    budget      execution,    and
implementatiodprocurement.         Specifically,    there      are     concerns      on      the
implementatiodprocurement capacity o f Government staff and the absence o f incentives for
project managers/procurement committees. Added to this, fear o f prosecution by auditors and
anti corruption agencies has also affected projects due to the reluctance o f officials to take

                                              115

                            Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

action amid growing worries o f being prosecuted under anti-corruption legislation, even over
minor mistakes. LKPP is considering assessing the introduction o f central procurement units
at ministries and at local governments' level.



38.   Capacity-building: Keppres No. 80/2003 required the Government to adopt an
examination system and certification for procurement practitioners within Government
contracting entities, in order to ensure that their level o f competence i s consistent with their
level o f responsibilities. So far, the rate o f staff passing the basic procurement certification is
very low (less then 20 percent) which amplifies the need for a strategic approach to capacity-
building. LKPP is in the process o f developing a strategy for human resources &
trainingkertification on public procurement. This will entail development o f training courses
andcriteria for tertiary institutions.

39.   Corruption, sanctions and independent appeals mechanism: Despite improvements in
the public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive practices. While
addressing this requires an overall governance strategy, there are several important elements
in the procurement system that can support such a strategy, for example an independent
complaints mechanism, an effective sanctions mechanism, and improving transparency inthe
procurement process through the use o f e-procurement.

40.   KeppresNo. 80/2003 requires the establishment o f a complaints handling mechanism.
However, this i s not set up independentlybut within each implementing agency. LKPP is now
in the process of developing a strategy to approach complaints handling. While it is
imperative to develop procedures for an independent complaints handlingmechanism, LKPP
should avoid becoming the agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop
a system andmonitor its efficiency andreliability.

41.   E-procurement: The Ministry o f Public Works, Ministry o f Communications and
Information and the City o f Surabaya have both been at the forefront inthe development o f e-
Government Procurement (e-GP) technology. The NPPOwas also taking the lead on behalf o f
the Government for implementation o f e-GP inIndonesiaat a national and sub-national level.
The critical issue now i s to develop a roadmap for the development o f e-GP in the country,
setting the roles o f the different stakeholders, and the responsibility for ensuring minimum
interoperability and core data standards for the various e-GP providers to comply with.

AccountingandReportingon BudgetExecution
42.   The aggregate Government Annual Financial Statements have beenpreparedina timely
manner for four years now (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007). Although the timeliness i s a
significant achievement, concerns remain over their reliability. The BPK has for the last four
years issued a "disclaimer" opinion on these financial statements. Among the reasons cited
for this were internal control weaknesses in the preparation o f the financial statements and
instances o f noncompliance with applicable regulations.

43.   The aggregate annual financial statements present revenues, expenditures and transfers,
surplus/deficit, and financing aggregates, as compared with budget provisions. A balance
sheet and a cash flow statement are also presented, along with a full statement o f government
accounting policy.

                                                   116

                              Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

44.    The Government Accounting Standards are well aligned with comparable international
standards (IPSAs). Technical capacity constraints limit the pace at which these accounting
standards can be implemented at all levels o f government, including line ministries and sub-
national governments.        The capacity constraints in the line ministries are being addressed
through training o f staff through an ambitious training program. The target i s to train over
7000 accounting staff in line ministries by the end o f the year - at least one staff per satker by
the end o fFY 2009.

45.    Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry and
sent to the MoF for consolidation.         A mid-year un-audited report on budget realization is
presented to the DPR inJuly and is available to civil society. However there are reconciliation
issues between the budget realization reports of the Treasury and those o f the MDAs. These
differences are reported as a suspense item in the budget realization reports which have been
disclosed inthe annual financial statements since 2004.

46.    GO1issued Finance Minister Regulation No 171/PMK.05/2007 on Accounting System
for Line Ministries. The changes brought about bythe new Regulationinclude:
     (a) Emphasis on line ministries being responsible for recording the budget allotment for
         their ministries; and
     (b) Emphasis on receivables, payables and investment recording by the line ministries -
         these should be recorded andreportedinthe line ministries' financial statements.

47.    Based on the new regulations, line ministries will assume responsibility for their budget
monitoring - they do not have to depend on MOF controls only - and the financial statements
o f line ministries would present a more accurate picture o ftheir financial position.

48.    Although commendable action has been taken to improve government financial
reporting, there continue to be serious challenges in making government financial statements
reliable, as reported by the BPK inits annual audit report for 2006. This reflects the immense
challenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots i s
weak and accountingprocesses are not yet integratedor fully automated.


ExternalAudit
49.    The Audit Board (BPK) was established under the Constitution and its roles and
responsibilities are set out in Law No.15/2004. The organizational structure o f BPK i s
outlined in the Decree o f Secretary General No. 34/2007 and No. 39/2007 and its governance
arrangements have been set out in Law 15/2006. BPK has a mandate to audit all government
entities including M D A s as well as state owned enterprises (SOEs). Its independence from the
Executive branch is reflected in its board members being appointed by the Parliament. It has
recently received significant increase inits operating budget to fund an increase inthe number
o f auditors and administrative staff as well as the number o f regional offices.2 All
expenditures, revenues and assets/liabilities o f the Government are subject to its audit.
However since 2006 BPK has not been able to audit income tax revenues because access to
individual tax payer records has been denied. This situation has arisen from the requirements


 The total annual budget for BPK has increasedfrom Rp 234 billion in2004 to Rp 1.5 trillion in2008. The
numberofregional offices has increased from 7 (2004) to 29 (2008).

                                                    117

                           Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement
enacted in taxation laws (No. 6/1983 and 16/2000) under which only the Minister o f Finance
can authorize access to individual tax payer records, on a case by case basis. As a result, BPK
has been unable to audit taxation revenues, which represent about 70% o f central government
revenues.

50.   BPK performs financial, performance and special purpose audits. The audits are
undertaken in accordance with the BPK Auditing Standards which are stipulated in BPK
Regulation No.1/2007 on State Finance Auditing Standards. These standards are generally in
line with international standards andhave been applied since the 2006 fiscal year.

51.   The audit report on the financial statements is submitted to the legislature within 5
months after the end o f the fiscal year. In the past four years the submission o f the audited
financial reports to Parliament has been timely. BPK also submits interim audit reports to the
Parliament every six months on irregularities andinefficiencies it has identified at MDAs.

52.   Auditees generally submit formal responses on audit recommendations and their
implementation to BPK. The extent o f follow up is regularly monitored by BPK and reported
inits interimaudit reports. Records maintained at BPK indicate that on an average of 80% of
audited entities submit formal responses on follow up o f audit findings. However this may not
reflect the relative importance o frecommendations.

53.   A peer review o f the BPK was completed in 2004 and revealed serious weaknesses in
capacity. Since then, improvements are gradually being made to the organization, with new
hires andtraining. BPK has a follow up peer review planned for FY 2009.


InternalControlsandInternalAudit
54.   The internal audit fkamework o f the Government is extensive but the institutional
structure is complex andthe mandates and division o f labor between the various internal audit
institutions have not been clear. Government Regulation 60/2008 on Government's Internal
Controls issued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the
different players.

55.   BPKP is now entrusted with the task o f designing the guidelines on internal control
implementation, providing training, and improving the competence o f government's internal
auditors on government's internal controls - essentially an advisory role. BPKP i s also
mandated to audit cross-sector activities, audit activities on request by the President's, and
audit on government's treasury activities if assigned byMOF.

56.   IGis still the main internal audit apparatus o fthe line ministries. InprincipleIGs have a
mandate to audit all MDA activities and determine their annual audit plan independently and
all units within a MDA are required to provide data needed by IGs. Inpractice most audits by
IGs check compliance on technical andoperational aspects o f activities, including compliance
with internal control procedures. Evaluations to determine adequacies o f internal control
systems are rarelycarried out. A systematic risk-based approach to internal audits i s still in its
infancy. Starting from 2006, IGs also review their MDA's annual financial statements, to
ensure their accuracy, reliability and integrity, prior to their submission to DG Treasury in
MOF.

57.  Bawasda i s the internal auditor o f local governments. Lack o f trained and skilled
auditors and methodology results in making Bawasda as the weakest component o f GOI's
internal control framework.

58.   There was no formal commitment control system at Satker andMDA levels that records,
reports, monitors, or controls spending commitments during the year against approved
budgets and cash availability. However, Finance Minister Regulation No 17l/PMK.05/2007
on Accounting System for Line Ministries now passes on the responsibility o f commitment
control to line ministries. The DIPA documents, which are detailed down to the spending unit
or Satker level, prepared by the MOF establish annual budgeted ceilings on expenditure
commitments. These procedures DIPAs, generally prevent MDAs from placing orders above
the approved budgets (DIPA limits) for particular spending items.

59.   Ministry o f Finance Regulation No.134/PMK.06/2005 and DG Treasury Regulation No.
PER-66/PB/2005 prescribes detailed procedures for payment o f salary and non-salary
expenditures, which supplement other written procedures on accounting and recording
transactions. The processes are however paper intensive and involve inefficient use o f staff
resources. For example the supporting documentation required for payment o f goods and
services covers multiple documents which duplicate information, with weak audit trails and
accounting evidence.    3


60. BPK's audit report for 2006 records numerous instances o f non compliance with rules
for processing and recording transactions such as non-compliance with procurement
procedures, payments not supported by adequate documentation and overpayments.
Weaknesses in the country's internal audit function would imply that the degree o f non-
compliance to rules would behigher than would be otherwise evident.

61.   The overall internal control environment continues to be weak.                However, recently
regulations on accountability o f line ministries and internal control are positive developments.


ReformingRegionalPublicFinancialManagement

62.   Decentralization has provided local governments with significant resources and
authority. More than a third o f general government expenditures are now executed by sub-
national government.      This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFMcapacity at
the local level.

63. After decentralization, the central government passed comprehensive legislation for
PFM reforms at the regional level to mirror the changes being made at the center. The
regulatory framework for regional PFMreforms i s now largely inplace including inregard to
mechanisms for fiscal transfers to local governments. However, most regions lack adequate
technical andhumanresources to implement the reforms.



 InGovernment's view, the procedures may create some duplication ofwork. However, t h ~ approach is takento
                                                                                        s
maintain a check andbalance mechanismand clarify roles, as mandated by Law Number 1/2004on State
Treasury.

                           Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

64.   Sub-national governments are obliged by law to report certain fiscal and financial
information to the central government. Most local governments now do report the information
required but do so with some delay. Accordingly it i s now possible to produce consolidated
general government reports although with some delay.

65.   Allocations to individual sub national government units are formally issued with the
passing o f the national budget inOctober before the financial year but notional allocations are
also included in the Budget presented to the DPR inAugust. Inpractice this leaves sufficient
time for sub-national government unitsto finalize their budgets but submissions are often late
due to local government constraints. However, budget allocations o f shared revenues (non-tax
revenue) are not issued before MarcWApril inthe financial year. The notional allocations are
significantly underestimated by the central government and disbursements from the center to
the regions are back loaded towards the end o f the fiscal year. Both practices are deliberately
chosen by central government to ensure fiscal discipline but they constrain successful
financial management at local level

66.   Because o f over budgeting o f expenditure by sub-national governments and under
budgeting o f transfers by central government many subnational governments have build up
reserves inrecent years.

State-OwnedEnterprises

67.   Indonesia has a sound legal framework for corporate governance and monitoring SOE
operations. First, the SOE Law No. 19/2003 sets a clear ownership policy as the state i s not
allowed to be involved in the day-to-day management o f SOEs and must allow them full
operational autonomy. Second, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details corporate governance
responsibilities, including the need to: (i)
                                           submit each quarter the SOEs' financial statements
to the State Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises and to the appropriate line ministry; (ii)
prepare annual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an independent
auditor; and (iii)publishSOE annual reports ina timely manner.

68.   Existing laws and regulations governing SOEs are not effectively implemented. Long
delays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports
are usually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have
accessed the local capital markets with listed instruments. Government included fiscal risk
statements inthe budgets for FY08 and FY09 and i s working on further improving the quality
hereof.

69.   The planned use o f PPPs to accelerate investment will create fiscal risks that merit
disclosure. The Government has taken steps to mitigate fiscal risks from PPPs. Presidential
RegulationNo. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the selection o f bidders in
an open, competitive tender and gives the Minister o f Finance the right to approve or reject
requests for Government support.


DebtManagement
70. During the previous DPL series, two major initiatives in debt management have been
implement; a clear debt managment strategy which was publicly announced, and a newly

                                             120

                               Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

  created DG for Public Debt Managment (DGDM), which has a risk management oversight for
  both domestic and external debts.

  71.   The Government has also successfilly reduced its Debt to GDP ratio to about 35%
  (2007), from the peak o f over 90% (1999). Despite the positive development in terms debt
  sustainability and institutional reforms, the Government's institutional capacity to manage
  public debts remainweak.

  72.   Audit reports confirm that data andreports on domestic debt is reliable but indicate that
  data and reports on foreign debt differ from donor records andmaynot be accurate.


  GovernanceandAnticorruption
  73.   Indicators o f corruption in Indonesia are improving, albeit s10wly.~Sufficient and
  dedicated resources have been made available to most o f the agencies critical to anti-
  corruption efforts. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as the
  Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court have begun to deliver
  tangible results. Inaddition, institutions like the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK), the Financial
  Transaction and Analysis Centre (PPTAK), and the Attorney General's Office have all
  critically improved their anticorruptiontrack record.

  74.   High profile corruption investigations have been launched, leading to a number of
  successful prosecutions. For example in September 2008, seven parliament members are
  under investigation or prosecution as suspects in several corruption cases, most o f them
  involvingbribery. Some o f the parliament members were arrested red handed when receiving
  bribes. A senior prosecutor has been sentenced to 20 years inprison for receiving bribes. This
  case has in turn lead to removal o f three very senior prosecutors, including two Deputies o f
  the Attorney General.

  75.   While there is clearly success and strong momentum related to investigating and
  prosecuting individual corruption cases, there has been less progress in developing and
  implementing a coherent, well-focused strategy for corruption prevention within the state
  administration. MenPAN, the ministry tasked with coordinating, monitoring and evaluating
  implementation o f such a strategy, has limited capability in this regard. As a result,
  implementation o f the existing anticorruption strategy for the state administration has been

' weak.

  76.   While progress in developing and implementing a coherent, well-focused strategy for
  corruption prevention in the state administration i s limited, recent developments have been
  promising. Previously, KPK was incharge o fpushingand monitoring bureaucracy reform as a
  corruption prevention measures within several institutions such as the Ministry o f Finance, the
  Supreme Court and the Supreme Audit Institution (BPK), but when this task was handed over
  to MenPAN in 2007 progress became very slow. Despite the limited progress by MenPAN,
  hdividual government agencies, e.g. in addition to the already mentioned the Ministry o f




   For example, Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for Indonesiawas 2.2 in2005,2.4 in
  2006 and 2.3 in2007.

                                                      121

                          Annex 8: PublicFinancialManagement

Foreign Affairs, Ministry o f Trade and most recently the Attorney General's Office have
initiated important internal bureaucracy reforms which are well underway.


KeyAreas for Further Reform
77. Inthe period ahead, progress o f the following key ongoing PFMreforms will need to be
closely monitored:

     0 Ensuringcoherence andmomentum inPFMreform.

     0 Deepening the reforms o f the central government budgetary sector, along the lines
        discussed above;

     0 Ensuring greater integrity and more effective management o f public funds through
        continued implementation o f a TSA, automating the treasury payments system, and the
        institution o fmeasures to prevent the proliferation o f off-budget bank accounts;

     0 Strengthening internal audit institutions by establishing synergistic relationships
        between them andremoving overlaps;

     0 Implementation o f a new treasury system, extending implementation o f Government
        Accounting Standards and reengineering o f underlying business processes at spending
        agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting; and,

     0 Widening the reforms throughout Government. This means extending modem financial
        accountability and management processes to sub-national governments in a
        coordinated manner andbringingthese fully inline with emerging national standards.

78. Many o f these are being actively considered and prioritized implementation plans are
being developed by the Government. Implementation i s well underway inregard to the TSA
and the institutional framework for procurement.

79. The capacity to centrally monitor these and other reforms has recently been established
at the Secretary General's office o f the MoF. The Indonesians would benefit from a coherent
reform plan or strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination o f PFM reforms. This
would also allow for enhanced monitoring and accountability within GO1 and thus provide
additional momentum and direction to reform efforts.


Managementof ForeignExchange
80. The foreign exchange control environment i s assessed to be generally satisfactory. The
country i s no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. BankIndonesia (BI)
was last subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy
in 2002.      That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number o f
vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements o f BI. The main recommendations have been
implemented, including the establishment o f an independent audit committee at BI and the
publication o f BI's audited financial statements. Audited financial statements o f BIfor 2007
have been reviewed and we note that the audit report issued by the BPK contained an
unqualified audit opinion.

Conclusion
81. Indonesiahas established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM.
Changes inthe legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum
has shifted towards implementation o fnew PFMpractices.

82. Knownweaknesses infinancial management and accountability continue to be gradually
addressed through the PFM reform program discussed above. The development partners are
actively engaged in this process. Key elements o f the reforms are supported by the DPL
triggers, as well as the G F M W project and initiatives supported by development partners.
However, much remains to be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact o f these
reforms.

83.   Inthe meantime, some fiduciary risks will arise for this operation. Although the pace o f
implementingthe plannedreforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory
o f reform is in the right direction and the current Government continues to demonstrate a
commitment to continue the task o f completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking these
into consideration, the Bank assessment team does not propose puttinginplace any additional
fiduciary arrangements for this operation.
