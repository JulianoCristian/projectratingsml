INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $40 million to the Korea
Development Finance Corporation (KDFC), to be guaranteed by the Republic of
Korea.  Interest on the loan would be at 7    per mnnum.      The loan would
be repaid in conformity to a schedule based on the aggregate of amortization
schedules of sub-loans made pursuant to this loan. The approximate repayment
period would be 17 years, including 2-1/2 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The economy of Korea is dealt with in paragraphs 2-7 of the Presidentts
Report of the same date on a proposed development credit and loan to the
Republic of Korea for a Second Education Project (Report No. P-1245-KO). A
Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
3.       For a review of Bank Group lending in Korea, reference is made to
paragraphs 8-17 of the President's Report of the same date on the proposed
Second Education Project. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1973, and notes on
the execution of on-going projects.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
4.       The record of Korea's achievement in industrial development from the
mid-1960's to date has been impressive.   Manufacturing output in 1966-1972
increased at an annual rate of about 20%, or almost twice the rate of GNP
expansion. This rapid industrial expansion was the most important cause of
the exceptionally large income gains, the attainment of nearly full employ-
ment, the phenomenal export expansion, and the structural transformation of
a basically agrarian economy into a dynamic industrial one.
5.       The government's fiscal, monetary, trade and exchange rate policies
were geared in a concerted fashion to accelerate industrialization. Prices
of imported machinery and equipment were kept relatively low (through the
exchange rate policy) in relation to the rising general price level.
"Preferred" sectors, such as import substitution industries and export
industries were given full access to imports of machinery and raw materials
(often with exemptions from import duties and from other restrictive measures),
and low-cost finance through preferential allocation of domestic credits and
foreign loans, in addition to fiscal concessions for industrial investment
and export.
6.       The pattern of industrialization has generally been appropriate.
Labor-intensive light manufacturing, such as textiles and clothing, footwear



-2-
and artificial hair, electrical and electronic components-, etc. has developed
to take advantage of the abundant and inexpensive but educated and well-
disciplined labor force. Industrial expansion has taken place both in import-
substitution and export industries. Generally speaking5 the protection and
incentive policy has not led to misallocation of resources or to structural
imbalances.
7.        Given the established light industrial base and the increasingly
limited scope for further rapid expansion of -ight manufacturing, the
diversification and deepening of the industrial struct'ure seems a logical
next phase of Korea's industrialization.  The government7s policy has already
moved in this direction; a steel mill and a petro-chemical complex have been
established, and other basic metal industries, shipbu: ding and mechanical
engineering industries are being act ively promoted. Tiitially, start-up
production costs, the-small scale of production and the need to adapt to the
new technologies will make some of the newly estabs,hed industries costly.
The continuation of protective/incentive measures is Justified for the present
on an infant industry ground; however, in the long-run some dismantling of
these measures will probably be needed.
8.        Sound corporate finance' is an important element in future
industrial development.  The paXst r'apid industrial expansion was financed by
mounting high-cost borrowing with a consequent deterioration in the
corporate financial structure' (equity as a percentage of total assets of an
average industrial firm declined from 52 percent in 196  to 23 percent in
1970). Internally generated corporate funds were inadequate.   The capital
market has been insufficiently- developed to meet financing requirements.
Corporate debts were about equal-ly'divided among government owned commercial
banks and speciali-zed banks, foreign suppliers' credits, and borrowing' from
"curb"'markets (unorganized money markets). Baiking funds''were predominantly
short-term with interest rates ranging'from`6 percent (for export production)
to over 20 percent (discount on commercial bills).  The'roll-over of short-term
bank loans was custom=7,r- Fbreign' supplierst' credits provided an inexpensive
source of investment fundmuntil the devaluation'of the'Won and revaluation'of
various currencies in-1971. The "curb" markets satisfied marginal demand for
short-term capital with 30-50 percent interest rates. Under mounting high-
cost debts - the situation was aggravated by the"econotid slowdown from mid-
1971, which had been preceded by over-investment in capacity - profitability
and liquidity positions of industrial firms gen'erally deteriorated.
9.        The Emergency Decree and related stabilization measures taken by
the government in August 1972 were designed, inter alia, to ease the problems
described above, particularly the financial difficulties of industrial firms,
and to prevent these problems from disrupting industrial investment. Short-
term domestic debts of industries both to the banking system and to the
"curb" markets were consolidated by the Decree into medium-term loans'with
moderate interest rates.  The general level of interest rates was reduced;
and an Industrial:IRationalizatior Fund was established to aid, and improve
the financial structure of, "problem" industries. The Decree yielded
immediate and substantial assistance to businesses by providing them the
opportunity and time to correct past imbalances and strains in corporate
finance,



- 3 -
10.       The recent pclicy trend indicates the governmentts determination
to move towards a more rational financial system. At a macro-economic level,
the stabilization measures are expected to create, after a short transitional
period, an atmosphere more conducive to increased domestic savings. Since
the government intends to keep investment demand in check, a better balance
between supply and demand of investment funds can be expected in future - a
situation which should mitigate anomalies in the financial system, such as
the multiple preferential interest rates, strict credit-rationing by the
government side-by-side with "curb" markets, and excessive recourse to foreign
suppliers' credits. At an institutional level, the government is trying to
channel a greater proportion of savings through organized markets in such a
way as to strengthen the financial structure of industrial enterprises.
Recently a commercial paper market was created by the establishment of KIFC.
The strengthening and expansion of capital markets are being encouraged under
a new decree, the Public Corporation Inducement Act which enables the govern-
ment to require a large range of companies to offer their shares to the
public.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
11.       The KDFC was established in 1967.  It was sponsored by the Federation
of Korean Industries with the support of the government and the assistance of
the Bank and IFC. When it began operations in March 1968 its initial capital-
ization consisted of share capital of Wl.35 billion ($5 million at the rate of
exchange then current W270 = US$1.00), a government-subordinated loan of
W2.025 billion ($7.5 million) and loans of $5 million each from the Bank and
USAID. USAID's loan was subsequently reduced to $3 million.l/ The initial
resources available to KDFC,therefore, totaled $22.5 million equivalent. By
the end of 1972 KDFC's net worth had increased to W3.9 billion ($9.75 million
at the current rate of exchange of W400 = US$1.00) including share capital of
W1.8 billion, increased from the original amount by annual stock dividends
from 1969 onwards. As of the same date KDFC had received three Bank loans
totalling $55 million and a loan from Caterpillar (Far East) Ltd., of $5
million, subsequently reduced to $1 million.!/ KDFC plans to increase its
share capital to W3 billion in 1973, by a stock dividend of 10 percent (already
declared) and by a rights issue for cash amounting to W1.02 billion,
12.       KDFC was set up to assist the development of private enterprise
in Korea mainly by providing medium-term and long-term finance. Although
the growth of KDFC'S portfolio has been rapid, from W300 million at the end
of 1968 to W17.2 billion at the end of 1972, in quantitative terms it is
still relatively small, with a share of around 2 percent of total gross domestic
capital formation in manufacturing and mining in 1971. In qualitative terms
KDFC's role has been more important. Due to the high professional standards
it maintains, particularly in the appraisal of projects, it is an acknowledged
leader among financial institutions in Korea. In providing term finance to
industry, KDFC works alongside two much larger government-controlled
institutions, Korea Development Bink (KDB) and Medium Industry Bank (MIB)
and branches of five foreign commercial banks. The operations of KDFC,
KDB and MIB are complementary, but KDFC faces increasing competition from
foreign commercial banks in term lending.
1/ Both the ATD aadtaterpillar loans were tied to US sources of supply and
moved slowly.



- *4 -
13.      KDFC has been well-managed from its inception and has been headed by
the same President, Mr. C.H. Kim, throughout the period. He is supported by
two Vice Presidents and a competent professional staff of 50, including four
able department managers. KDFC's organizational structure has served well so
far, but the management is currently reviewing the organizational structure
to determine whether the growth in KDFC's operations calls for administrative
changes.
14.      KDFCts operating policies and procedures are generally of a high
standard, although KDFC is seeking to strengthen its work on the economic
assessment of projects and on project supervision. KDFC's lending rate for
Won loans is currently 15.5 percent per annum, in line with the i-nterest rate
structure directed by the government.   Its lending rate on foreign exchange
loans has remained unchanged for the past five years at 10 percent per annum,
with its borrowers bearing the exchange risk. That rate is under competitive
pressure. As of December 31, 1972, KDFC had approved 109 loans and invest-
ments amounting to W23.4 billion ($58 million equi'valent). At the same date,
about 82 percent of its portfolio was represented by foreign currency loans.
KDFC's financial position and performance have been satisfactory throughout
its life. In 1972, earnings represented 38 percent on share capital and 18.9
percent on net worth. Since 1969, KDFC has declared an annual dividend of
20 percent (10 percent in cash and 10 percent in stock). Its portfolio is
sound and provisions amply cover any likely losses.
15.      KDFC's uncommited domestic currency resources as of January 1, 1973,
together with the proposed share issue of Wl billion., collections and retained
earnings, should enable it to undertake the Won commitment it has projected.
For projected foreign exchange commitments, KDFC wci.ll require additional
foreign exchange resources of about $50 million in-the two-year period
beginning June 1973, when the third Bank loan is expected to be fully committed.
It hopes to raise $6 million equivalent from KfW. This leaves a shortfall of
about $44 million. The Bank has so far been the principal source of KDFC's
foreign exchange resources. With a view to reducing KDFC's dependence on the
Bank, KDFC and the government have agreed with the Bank on a plan to diversify
KDFC's foreign exchange sources. KDFC has approached IFC for assistance in
raising long-term funds in the foreign commercial market, and IFC is willing
to give such assistance when market conditions are favorable. In addition,
KDFC proposes to approach foreign commercial banks directly for relatively
short term funds, which it would blend with the proposed Bank loan. The
government has also agreed that KDFC shall in future be free to approach AsDB
and KfW for funds with the government's support. implementation of this plan
will take some time and it is important that KDFC should be enabled to maintain
continuity of growth. Against the prospective shortfal'l of about $44 million,
a fourth Bank loan of $40 million is recommended.
16.      The terms of the proposed loan would be similar to those of recent
Bank loans to development finance companies. In view of the competence of
KDFC's management and staff, its high operational standards, the soundness
of its portfolio and its financial position and performance, and so as not
to constrain its operations unnecessarily, the Bank Loan Agreement would
provide for a debt/equity ratio 4.5:1 in place of the present limit of 3:1.-
The free limit would be increased to $750,000 instead of the present $500,000,
with an aggregate free limit of 25 percent of the proposed loan amount.



17.       During 1972 KDFC collaborated with a Bank mission in an intensive
effort to establish, by a detailed study of a sample of KDFC projects, ICDFC's
developmental impact in general, and the overall economic rate of return on
the projects it had financed. The results of the study have led.to the
conclusion that the aggregate economic rate of return on projects financed
by KDFC is unlikely to be less than 25 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement betweer. the Bank and the Korea Development
Finance Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Korea and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The Loan and Guarantee Agreements follow
the pattern of Bank agreements for loans of this kind.
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PRDJECTS IN EXECUTION
1.        Loan No. 600      PyonZtaek-Kungang Irrigation Project   TJS$5.0 million
Loan of 142Z 23, 1969
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.    It
will irrigate 35,250 ha of land, impro-e drainage and roads, consolidate all
paddy fields, bench all upland and reclaim 4,400 ha of tidal land with the project.
The start of construction was postponed by a major reorganization of the executing
agency and delay in hiring consultants; the project is now one year behind
schedule.   Disbursement is 50 percent behind even when a one-year postoonement
is applied to the appraisal report schedule.Construction, however, is now progress-
ing satisfactorily.    A well-planned agricultural development program is being
implemented.   Shortfalls and delays in Won appropriation caused some delays in
the past.   After strong Bank requests to the Economic Planning Board for correc-
tive action, adequate funds for 1973 have been provided and the requirements and
provisions for future years will be reviewed this summer.
2.        Credit No. 151   First Education Project; tS$14.8 million Credit of
June h. 1979

departments.   It also includes 26 man-years of technical assistance, 20 man-years
of overseas fellowships to support developments agricultural and/or technical
education and to assist educational planning.    The project is about 18 months
behind schedule because, in the initial stages of project implementacion, delays
occurred in organizing the project unit, selecting and appointing the consultant
architects and establishing equipment procurement procedures.    The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that, because of the initial del~rs,
it will be completed about one year later than estimatted at the time of aDpraisal.
This may require an extension of the Closing Date by about six months to June 30,
1975.
3.        Loan No. 669      Third Railway Project;   MS4Q.0. million Loan and

satisfactorily.   To date, nearly 200 Korean farmers are participating;   two
international purchases of 1,600 dairy heifers have been completed; international
competitive bidding for dairy processing equipment (close to US$1 million) has
been accomplished; planning and construction of civil works for two dairy
processing plants are well underway; technical services are being strengthened;
and applied research for livestock production is already bringing significant
results.
5.        Loan No, 622 &    Second and Third KDFC Projects;  US$20.0 and US$30.0
Loan 1lo. 735    million Loans of June 26, 1969 and May 17, 1971

It aixus at transforming an area with the highest drought frequency in Korea
into one with yiex--round irrigation and crop diversification.. Also there
will be increas::d production of high value crops.  The Loan/Credit became
effective on September 15, 1972. CGnsultants are in the field and detailed
surveying and designing are proceeding satisfactorily.  Cost estimates have
increased by about 40 percent aLinly because more dam foundatlon grouting will
be required than expected at appraisal and major changes in designs have been
made. About 1,h00 ha of additional land have been added to the project   ,
through revision of original canal lines, thereby offsetiting the increased
costs.  Construction is expected to begin in Itay 1973. Insufficient funds
were budgeted originally for 1973, but the Government after Bank urging has
provided adequate Won financing for the year so that construclion can proceed
on shedule. The provisions for future years will be discussed this summer.
8.        Credit No. 335 Agricultural Credit Project;   US$105 million Credit
of September 29, 1972
Closing Date: SeDtember 1, 1976
This credit supports a three-year lending program for the development
of orchards, sericulture, mushrooms and to encourage poultry and swine production.
Difficulties encountered by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in
meeting agreed conditions have delayed effectiveness which is now expected before
June 30 of this year.
