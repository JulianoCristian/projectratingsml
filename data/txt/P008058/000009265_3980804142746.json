Some lessons\n            learned included: it is easy to underestimate the costs and\n            time needed for such complex transactions. This mistake was\n            committed by the Bank and the Peruvians, as both the cost\n            and the time required for the program have been more than\n            double the appraisal estimates. Top-level political support\n            is critical for success. When the message from the top was\n            clearly in favor of privatization, the process moved ahead\n            rapidly. Now that there appears to be more ambivalence,\n            progress is much slower. It is more efficient to have one\n            technical assistance operation that covers all\n            privatizations rather than several sector-specific technical\n            assistance operations. Sector policy and regulatory reform\n            should be well underway before privatization in the sector,\n            so that bidders can feel that they are entering a secure\n            environment, and will have a sound basis for calculating\n            their bids. Much of Peru's success in privatization is\n            due to the progress that was made beforehand in preparing\n            comprehensive sectoral legislation and rules."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
