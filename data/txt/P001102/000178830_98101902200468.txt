REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED WAN
TO THE SOCIETE DES CAOUTCHOUCS DE COTE D IVOIRE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A RUBBER PLANTATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Loan to the Societe des Caoutchoucs de C8te d'Ivoire (SOCATCI) with the
guarantee of the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$8,4
million %/ to help finance a project for the development of a 13,500 ha.
rubber plantation.  The loan would have a term of 30 years, including ten
years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent. The project will be co-financed
by the Fonds airopeen de Developpement (FED) and the Caisse Centrale de Coope-
ration Economique (CCCE) in amounts equivalent to that of the Bank Loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report No AW-38a,
"Current Economic Situations and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", September 8,
1972, confirmed the country's creditworthiness. This report analyzed the
country's economic growth record, which had been very favorable by international
standards. It concluded that prospects for further development remain excellent
and that the Government's development efforts deserve continued support from
external aid donors. For the near term (1972-74), however, the report foresaw
a temporary setback in growth. Annex I gives the country data for the Ivory
Coast. An economic updating missiDn is currently visiting the Ivory Coast.
3.        Throughout the post-war period, Ivory Coast's economic growth has
been spectacular. GDP has grown at a rate of seven percent per year in real
terms and per capita GDP is about US$300. This success can be largely
ascribed to the Government's liberal and pragmatic economic policies, the
availability of ample land and timber, the unchecked inflow of foreign
capital and know-how and the availability of large numbers of African workers
from neighboring countries. An important feature of development policy was
the emphasis which was placed on the diversification of agriculture, especially
cash crops, and the encouragement given to industry. As a result of these
measures, the Ivory Coast is gradually becoming less dependent on a few
major export commodities.
4.        The Government's development strategy remains essentially directed
towards further diversification of production. The Five-Year Development Plan
1971-75 sets out the Government's principal objectives. These are (a) con-
tinued diversification and modernization of agricultural production; (b)
industrialization geared to import substitution as well as the stimulation of
non-traditional exports; (c) balanced regional development with increased
emphasis on the less developed north and south-west parts of the country;
(d) improved social conditions, particularly housing, urban development and
health; (e) increased participation of Ivorians at all levels of the economy.
j Under the proposed financing plan, the three co-lenders would each provide
25 percent of the total financing required expressed in CFA francs. The
dollar equivalent of the Bank's share, at the rate of CFAF 230.2 = 1 US$
notified to the IMF as of March 1, 1973, would be $8.4 million as shown
above. The dollar equivalents in the Appraisal Report, in which the amount
of the proposed loan appears as $8.3 million,are based on a market rate of
CFAF 232 = 1 US$, ruling at the end or February.



-2-
5.            On the whole, these objectives correspond well to the needs
and the possibilities of the country. The emphasis on certain social needs
and regional balance is rnuch stronger than in the past Plan. This reflects
an increased awareness on the part of the Government that the benefits of
p7rogress should be shared by all secticns of the population and in all parts
of the country.  In spite of this awareness the Plan does not comte to grips
full_ with urbanization and urban unemployment and inco-le inequality.  The
Plan is, nevertheless, a usesful guide for action.  A Bank special employment
mission which is oresently in the Ivory Coast will assist the Govern,rent
with the treatment of en-ployment problems in the new Plan.
6.            The Plan does reserve a sizeable proportion of investment to
a-ricultural develoirrent.  Projects in the pri;mary sector - excluding economic
infrastructure - are to receive about one-fourth of total public investment
duringO the plan period 1971-75. This represents a considerable increase in
the annual average share of 12, during 1960-66. The Government's growing attention
to agricultural problems is a refLection of its policy aimed at increasing and
diversifying agricultural. production and exports and achieving more balanced
regional development, which are fundamental Plan objectives. As will be discussed in
Part IV, the project under consideration has been designed to serve these'key
objectives of the Govern"'ent's development strategy and to offer substantial
eTinly:ellt opportunities in the re-ion.
7.            Pasl and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for
further growth.  Possibilities in -many areas remain excellent and thb intense
investment activity of the Government and the private sector indicate that
these possibilities are being recognized and exploited. Despite uncertainties
ofL a fewi large investment projects and of the markel prospects for Mv.jor export
commodities, growth in the next ten to fifteen years is likely to re-main well
ahead of population growth (3.5 percent a year including immigration).   The
Developm,ent Plan estimates that economic growth during the 1970's will be close
to eight percent a year in real terms. Although the Plan appears in some respects
too a-bitious, the longer term growth potential is probably not much below the
high growth rates of' the past.
8.            WThile long-term grow-th prospects are therefore favorable, the
economy is currently experiencing a slight setback which is likely to continue
for the next few years.  Economic 1growth during 1972-74 is likely to be at
most five percent a year. There are several reasons for the temporar'y slowdown
in !growth. First, terns of trade have become less favorable and are unlikely
to improve significantly in the near future.   Import prices have been rising
fast since 1970 while cocoa prices which dropped to almost half the level of
early 1970 are recovering only gradually.   Second, the grow^rth impetus of the
three major export cormodities (cocoa, coffee and ti-ber) has markedly declined.
Cocoa and coffee productial is likely to increase more slowly than in the past
decade.  Timber production has reached a plateau, because the most valuable
species are becoming scarce. Third, production icrreases from past diversification
in plantation agriculture and industry will only occur in the second half of
the decade. The result of all this is likely to be lower than usual economic
,growth during the next few years.



-3-
9.            The slowdown in economic growth which has manifested itself
since 1970 is leading to a declining growth of government revenue and a drop
in public savings. In particular, the sharp drop of cocoa prices has hurt
public savings. The shortfall in public savings due to this cause was equivalent
to about one-sixth of public investment in 1971 and probably 1972, but a certain
improvement may be expected in future if coffee and cocoa prices continue to
develop favorably. The resulting tight financial situation moved the Government
to introduce austerity policies in the 1972 budget with regard to public spending.
In spite of these measures it was necessary to reduce total budgeted public
investment by 16 percent below the 1971 level. To finance its essentially
sound development program, the Government will, probably, have to make further
adjustments particularly with regard to administrative expenditures. Education
expenditures have also been rising rapidly and even though the needs in this
sector are large, economy measures may be in order.
10.          In spite of certain shortcomings in current expenditure policies,
the Government is continuing its impressive fiscal performance. Compared
with other developing countries, the Ivory Coast has a high level of tax revenues
- 20 percent of GDP plus sizeable quasi-fiscal revenues - and high public
savings - 10 percent of GDP in 1968-70 and 7.5 'percent in 1971. The austerity
measures indicate the Government's intention to maintain this performance in
the face of more difficult economic circumstances.
ll.           The Ivory Coast's external debt stood at about $525 million
as of December 31, 1971. The debt service ratio - 6.3% in 1971 - is still
low. By the end of the decade, however, debt service could become a major
problem, especially on the fiscal side. Preliminary projections indicate
that by 1980 debt service could absorb a substantial proportion of public
savings and export earnings. By the mid 70's it could climb to about 60
percent of public savings, thus markedly reducing the Government's capacity
to finance the local currency component of public investment.
12.           Even if the Government's efforts at resource mobilization are
successful, the implementation of the Development Plan will require a large
increase in foreign aid. For 1972-74, the needs for aid disbursements (grant
and loan funds) are estimated at $160 million per year as compared to about
$70 million in 1970 and $100 million in 1971. 'The principal sources of development
finance for the Ivory Coast remain France and the European Economic Community.
The United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Canada and a few
other countries will probably furnish additional capital. Bilateral sources
and the EEC are expected to provide about %70 million per year. Resources
from the Bank and from institutions providing finance on terms similar to those
charged by the Bank are estimated at around 030 million a year. The remaining
%60 million is to be financed from other sources such as mobilization of
private domestic resources, foreign private credits and a moderate drawdown
of reserves.



13.       French aid is concentrated on technical assistance, preinvestment
studies, and education; however, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE) is important in the financing of agricultural projects and public
utilities. The FED (EEC) has concentrated on agriculture and livestock
development and on certain infrastructure projects such as the Abidjan port,
the railroad, and the development of the Southwest around San Pedro. French
and German aid have also been important in the financing of San Pedro. The
UNDP is assisting principally in mineral and transport surveys, educational
reform, the planning of Abidjan sanitation, and various programs for the re-
settlement of population from the Bandama reservoir area. The U.S. Export-
Import Bank has been active in financing the Kossou dam and a sugar complex
in the North of the Ivory Coast. Aid coordination is assured by the Govern-
ment on an informal basis with the major donors.
14.       With the increase in aid requirements, the terms of aid are becoming
increasingly important. To prevent an unmanageable increase' in debt service,
the Government is considering limiting the use of commercia1I credits.  kt the
same time, sources of official development assistance should be prepared to
soften the terms of their aid. In view of its still satisfactory level of
external reserves, its favorable growth prospects and its still not excessive
debt service ratio, the Ivory Coast should be able to service additional debt
on conventional terms. However, the rapid increase in aid requirements could
soon lead to debt service difficulties, particularly from the fiscal point
of view, and a certain amount of concessionary financing is therefore desirable.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
15.       The Bank's role in lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded rapidly
since 1968. Since that date, the Bank has made ten loans to the Ivory Coast
totalling US$86.4 million. Three of these have been for roads; five were made
to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the development of oil palm
and coconut plantations and the construction of two oil mills; the remaining
two loans were for education and cocoa. The IFC has taken a small ($200,000)
participation in the Banque Ivorienne de Developpement Industriel. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Loans and notes on the execution of on-
going projects with particular reference to those which are encountering
problems in execution and giving rise to delay in disbursement.
16.       The Bank has made five loans to the SODEPALM Group in the Ivory Coast
for the development of industrial oil palm and coconut plantations and related
inaustrial infrastructure (Loans 611, 612, 613 of June 13, 1969, US$17.1 mil-
lion, First Oil Palm and Coconut Project; and 759 and 760, of June 22, 1971,
US$7.0 million, Second Oil Palm and Coconut Project). The SODEPALM Group has
planted over 4O,COO ha. of industrial oil palm estates and 10,000 ha. of coco-
nuts. It is also responsible for the Government's outgrower oil palm and coco-
nut program. These loans are being implemented satisfactorily.
17.       The Ivory Coastts principal foreign exchange earner and domestic
employer is the agricultural sector. Agriculture has demonstrated the greatest
comparative advantage and since it will continue to provide close to 90 percent
of exports, create job opportunities, help to stabilize an increasingly mobile
population and bring development to remote areas of the country, the Bank's



principal efforts in the identification and preparation of projects is in this
area. Other aid suppliers such as the European Development Fund (FED), the
Fonds d'Aide et de Coop6ration (FAC) and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) have also been active in financing agricultural development.
We expect to continue to direct a substantial proportion of our lending to
this sector. We are currently financing studies under Loan 686 which should
lead to a cocoa project by 1975 and are participating with the CCCE in preparing
a rice project in the West of the Ivory Coast. The Ivory Coast has also requested
our assistance in financing a cotton project, agricultural credit and additional
oil palm and coconut development.
18.       In support of agricultural development, we have placed secondary
stress on transportation, and the Bank has become the principal lender for
this sector. This was largely due to the fact that the Bank was closely as-
sociated, as Executing Agency, with the UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory
Coast. We expect that projects identified by this survey will continue to be
submitted to the Bank for financing in the next few years, in particular the
Abidjan-Agboville, Yabayo-Gagnoa and Katiola-Badikaha roads. Our next operation
which should be ready in a few months will include the Abidjan-Sikensi road.
The Government is also interested in obtaining our assistance in financing a
section of the reconstruction of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other
sections of the line are being financed by the FED and The European Investment
Bank (EIB).
19.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which we have a role to play although our financial participation is
expected to remain relatively modest. The UNDP is financing a two-phase
study of the sanitation needs of Abidjan and it'is expected that this study
will provide the basis for an urban sanitation project for Abidjan in the
near future. A Second Education Project is presently being prepared with
the assistance of UNESCO. Substantial investments are also foreseen, in the
later years, for industry, power, and possibly tourism, areas in which we
have not previously been involved, but in which the Government foresees the
need fo'r the Bank's participation.  The Government has requested Bank financing
for part of its 1972-74 telecommunications program and a project is expected
to be appraised in the near future.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN THE IVORY COAST
20.       Agriculture and forestry account for more than 90 percent of the
Ivory Coast's exports and 30 percent of its GDP. Tney are the mainspring
of the country's growth and should remain so for many years to come. In
1971, the Ivory Coast's exports were valued at CFAF 138 billion (US$
497 million) and three commodities - coffee (33,percent), timber
(23 percent) and cocoa (21 percent) accounted for about 77 percent of the
value of total exports. Agricultural production has registered during the
last two years a growth rate of about 6 percentl'in cash value and 11 percent
in value of exports. Moreover, three-quarters of the population depend
directly or indirectly on activity in this sector. Rural per capita income,
including the value of subsistence production is roughly calculated at CFAF
28,000 (US$169) for 1969. Regional income disparities are, however, very
large with the poorest areas being in the North of the country.



-6-
21.       Abundant land, good labor supply (including immigrant workers mostly
from Upper Volta), and generally favorable world markets for its principal
products have assured rapid growth of this sector. Through diversification
the Government has sought to reduce the country's dependence on coffee and
cocoa; efforts to increase the production of oil palm, bananas, pineapples,
coconuts, rice and rubber and to increase the exploitation of its forest resources
have been hignly successful. For example, during 197:!, the Ivory Coast produced
70,000 tons of palm oil and this should increase in 1973 to 100,000 tons.
Production of coconuts is still very limited but will grow rapidly. The pro-
duction of pineapples and bananas has also increased substantially and citrus
fruit projects have been started. The new Plan calls for continued diver-
sification, modernization of both coffee and cocoa cultivation, more careful
management of forest resources, and domestic processing of wood. Morb emphasis,
however, may be needed on food crops. To permit agricultural development, the
Government relies heavily on autonomous public enterprise for the development
of sp-cific commercial crops such as coffee, cocoa, oil palm and coconuts.
These enterprises have been successful as they have been able to open up large
new areas for development. This applies particularly to rubber which requires
skills which have not been developed in the small holder sector in the Ivory
Coast. The proposed project will provide labor opportunities and incomes well
in excess of those available to subsistence farmers and the trained labor could
provide a nucleus for future rubber smallholder development.
22.       The Government has also undertaken ambitious development programs
for cotton, rice and sugar as part of its plan for regional development. As
a result cotton production has risen in the last three years to about 50,000
tons of seed cotton. Rice production has reached, according to government
statistics, 380,000 tons of paddy and plans call for an increase of 170,000
tons by 197/. A sugar project in the North of the country is under construction
and is expected to produce 60,000 tons of sugar and provide over two million
dollars in income to the population of the region.
23.       Wood is one of the principal exports of the Ivory Coast; however,
due to massive cutting of the best species and inadequate protection of this
resource from wasteful cutting-over for agricultural purposes, the forest
reserves are in dec)ine. It is estimated that the present rate of exploitation
can only be maintained through 1975 after which point exports of wood are
expected to decline unless secondary species can be exploited. The Govern-
ment has begun a small reforestation program of 3,000 ha. per year but due to
the long growth cycle of hard woods it will not materially affect production
in the sector for many years to come.
24.       Earlier diversification efforts included the development of 13,000
ha. of rubber trees of whicn a large proportion are already in production.
This program was started in the mid 1950's. Virtually all tne rubber plantations
are owned by three companies; two private and one Government-owned company
controlling 1,800 ha. Production amounted to about 13,000 tons in 1971 which
was less than 0.5 percent of world natural rubber production. The Ivory Coast
has both good soils and climate for rubber cultivation. M4oreover, research
carried out in the Ivory Coast by the Institut de Recherches sur le caoutchouc
en Afrique (LRCA) has helped to select high-yielding trees and to promote a
scientifically-oriented rubber industry.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
?5.       The appraisal report entitled "Grand Bereby Rubber Estate Project"
(PA-129, dated March 6, 1973) is being distributed separately. A Loan and
Project summary is in Annex III. The project covers the first phase of
development of a 13,500 ha. rubber plantation and consists of:
a)  the clearing of 16,000 ha. and the planting over a period
of seven years of 13,500 ha. of rubber trees and the
maintenance of the planted trees;
b)  roads and other infrastructure for the plantation; and
c) technical and managerial assistance to be provided by the
Michelin Company for the establishment of the plantation.
26.       The project was prepared by the Compagnie Generale des Etablisse-
ments Michelin, with funds provided by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Coope-
ration. The Government subsequently asked the Fonds Eiropeen de D6veloppe-
ment (FED), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the
Bank (referred to as the co-lenders) to participate with it in financing
the project. The Bank's Permanent Mission in Western Africa helped to
complete the preparation of the project in cooperation with Micnelin and
the Government. The project was appraised in November of 1971 with repre-
sentatives of FED, the EIB and the CCCE. In February 1972 discussions were
held in Brussels among the co-lenders to lay the foundations for their joint
financing and immediately thereafter with the Government to obtain agreement
on organizational arrangements and with Michelin on the management contract.
The Bank's Loan for the project was negotiated in Paris, June 21 to July 4,
with representatives of the co-lenders present. Mr. Kpatchibo, Director,
Public Investment Budget,led the Government delegation. Subsequently the
Government decided to renegotiate the management contract and revise the
organizational arrangements for the project. Discussions were
held with the Gove'rnment 'in'early November in Washin'gton and among the co--
lenders, the Government and Michelin,in early December in Paris.
27.       The project would be located in the )auth-West of the Ivory Coast
close to the new port of San Pedro, which woulsd provide easy'access to ocean
transportation for the processed rubber.  The plantation would lie astride
the main coastal road to Tabou, on the Liberiah border. It is an'integral
part of the Ivory Coast's plan for the develop,ment of this region, one of
the least developed and sparsely inhabited parts of the Ivory Coast. Laborers
for the plantation are expected, however, to come from elsewhere in the Ivory
Coast and from Upper' Volta and Mali which provide most of the plantation labor



- 8 -
in the Ivory Coast. Housing and health facilities would be provided for the
workers and schools would be built and staffed at Government expense.
28.          The plantation will be brought to full development over a period
of about 1 years, the time estimated to brirg all of the trees into production.
This period can be divided into two roughly equal periods, of which the first,
1972-79, is the project period and comprises the land clearing and planting
phase. The production of small quantities of rubber would start at the end
of the first period, and a processing plant would be constructed at that time.
The second phase ending in 1985 would include maintenance of the plantation
and would cost about US%16 million including the factory. Although it would
take a total of about 21 years for the plantation to reach full production,
the plantation would be self-supporting by 1985.
29.          On the basis of forecast yields, the total production of the plan-
tation would amount to about 30,000 tons per year during the 1990's and
decline slightly thereafter. Even with the production of this plantation,
the Ivory Coast's share of projected world natural rubber consumption in
1985 would be less than one percent and would not be expected to exceed one
percent when the plantation reaches maximum production.
30.          Oraanization:  A new corporation, the Societe des Caoutchoucs
de Co^te-d'Ivoire iSOCATOI),has been established to execute the project. The
equity of the company will be wholly subscribed by the Government. The
Michelin Company would manage the project under a technical assistance and
management contract with SOCATCI. A plan of ivorization of management cadres
for the plantation is to be established by 1975. The management contract with
Michelin will assure that the project's physical assets will be kept separate
from others that SOCATCI might acquire and independent accounts will be maintained.
The contract which also includes marketing arrangements will be for a fixed
initial term of fourteen years, automatically renewable for four-year periods,
unless terminated by either party. It has been negotiated and initialed by
SOCATCI with Michelin and SATAC, a Michelin subsidiary in the Ivory Coast.
It is subject to the approval of the co-lenders and final signature is expected
by the end of March.
31.          Under the contract, Michelin (SATAC) will provide SOCATCI with a
team of five experts to establish and manage the plantation. The team
will receive ali its supporting services from the Michelin Group which is
responsible for establishing the plantation and bringing it into production.
Michelin and SATAC will be remunerated for their technical and managerial
assistance and will not make any finarcial contribution to the project. Their
remuneration will be based on a percentage of the salaries paid to their employees



-9-
seconded to the project, a fixed fee for each hectare of plantation completed sat
isfactorily and a smalL fixed annual fee. The equivalent of a small percentage
tone percent of net sales) of the rubber produced would constitute remuneration
for their managerial services once the plantation enters production. The
fees to be paid Michelin represent about 4.5 percent of project investments
and are considered reasonable.
32.       Under the contract, Michelin has undertaken to design and construct
on benalf ot* the plantation company a rubber processing factory f'or the latex.
Michelin has agreed to purchase such project produced rubber as may be offered
by SOCATCI on the basis of a draft sales contract which forms part of the
management contract and at a price in line with future world prices but with
a guaranteed minimum (17 # per lb c.i.±.). The sales contract would be re-
negotiable every two years. Conclusion of the sales ^lontract and final agree-
ment on the floor price would be deferred until arrangements are made for the
construction of the processing unit.  During negotiations the Bank received
assurances that these arrangements would, after consultation with the Bank,
be finalized by not later than December 31, 1977.
33.       Financing:  The total project cost, including taxes of US$1.3 mil--
lion, is estimated at US$29.4 million. The total financing required is
US$33.4 million, including interest and service charges during construction
(which have not been capitalized) amounting to Us$4.0 million. The Bank, FED,
CCCE and the Government would each finance 25 percent. Project construction
costs include land clearing and planting, plantation infrastructure such as
houses, hospitals, schools and other plantation buildings,J vehicles and
agricultural equipment, technical assistance, staff costs and administrative
and operating overheads. The following table shows some of the principal
categories of expenditure:

34.       The Bank loan would be for US$8.4 million to SOCATCI for a term of
30 years with a grace period of 10 years for repayment of the principal.   This
term is required by the long project development period and the project's cash
flow. The CCCE and FED loans would have the same term. The Bank would dis-
burse pari passu with the FED and the Caisse equal amounts on all categories
of project expenditures.



- 10 -
35.          The FED will make its loan to SOCATCI through the European
Investment Bank on special terms. It would bear interest at the rate of
1/2 percent in the first 14 years and 3 percent thereaft.er. The Caisse
Centrale will lend to the Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole which
would relend to the Company at an interest rate of 4-1/2 percent including
BNDA's service charge of 3/4 percent. The Government will provide its share
of project costs and payments of interest and service charges through
subscriptions to the equity of the Company. It will also guarantee that the
Company would at all times have available to it cash or bank overdraft facil-
ities equal to six months debt service or $1 million which ever is greater.
36.          The first phase of theprogram would be carried out during the
eight-year period 1972-79. Finance for the second phase, which extends
through 1985, would be assured by the Government. The Caisse and FED have
expressed the willingness in principle to consider finm cing the second
phase at the appropriate time and the Bank may be invited to participate.
The European Investment Bank has already expressed interest in financing
processing facilities.
37.          The p.-oposed loan would finance,jointly with CCCE and FED, costs
incurred by the Government since June 30, 1972 for land clearing, preparation
of seed beds and services by Michelin. The Bank's share of these costs would
not exceed 0300,000.
38.          Procurement: Since most of the project will be carried out on
force account and includes a high proportion of labor and administrative
overheads, only about US$6.0 million in purchases will actually be submitted
to international competitive bidding. These purchases include principally
vehicles and land clearing equipment, insecticides, fertilizers and some
construction materials. It has been agreed among the co-lenders that procurement
should be on the basis of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and should be
open to all the Banik's member countries and Switzerland. In accordance with
its practice for other agriculture projects, the Government has indicated that
it will exonerate the project from the payment of import duties and no
preferences are involved.
39.          Co-lending Arrangements. As indicated above, the co-lenders
have agreed to cooperate closely in the execution of the project. To this
end all withdrawal requests and supporting documentation would be sent by
the Borrower to FED's Controller in Abidjan. He would verify the requests
before transmitting them to the CCCE and the Bank. The Bank would retain the
right to disapprove any request on subsequent examination. This system should
facilitate coordination and expedite disbursements. A similar system would
be employed for approval of purchase contracts and bid evaluation.

40.        Although the project and financing arrangements are based
on the assumption that lJ,500 ha will be developed to maturity, the
high cost of doing so makes it prudent to pause after 5,000 ha have
been planted, that is, in about three years' time, to verify that there
have not been such adverse changes in the key assumptions on which the
original appraisal was based that it would be wise to discontinue further
planting. The Government and the co-lenders have accordingly agreed to
consult together before proceeding beyond 5,000 ha and, in the case of
the Bank, continued disbursement would be subject to a satisfactory
outcome of this review. A deci6ion by the Bank whether to proceed or
not to proceed further with financing the project would not be binding
on the co-lenders, nor would a decision on their part be binding on
the Bank.
41.        Justification:  In early 1972, the price of rubber was at
one of its lowest points in recent years,i.e. about 16$ per lb. c.i.f.
New York. (Prices have, however, risen in the last half year to 241
per lb.) A recent Bank study has indicated that the price of natural
rubber should increase by 1980 to 19$ per lb. in constant 1972 prices.
For the purpose of calculating a rate of return we have adopted a con-
servative price forecast of 17$ in constant 1972 prices per lb. for 1980
- the first year in which the plantation should be producing a substantial
amount of rubber. On the basis of this price forecast and by shadow
pricing foreign exchange, part of the labor, and certain elements of
the project infrastructure, the 13,500 ha. project was found to have an
economic rate of return or 13.2 percent. Excluding these adjustments,
the rate of return would be not less than 10 percent. The project's
financial rate of return is estimated at 7.7 percent and the return on
Government equity at 12.4 percent, including both profits and direct taxes.
The project would have a number of substantial secondary benefits. It
would contribute to a more balanced regional development through the
establishment of a focus of development in the Southwest of the country.
The employment effect of the plantation would be substantial. About
4,500 workers would gain direct employment and there would be considerable
impact on the local farming economy. It is assumed that 80 percent of
the labor force comes from neighboring countries. Workers would
receive average annual incomes of about $50b; more than twice those
they might expect in Upper Volta and Maii.  Total project receipts
in foreign exchange over the life' of the plantation are estimated to
amount to US$330 million.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.           The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Societe des
Cacutchoucs de Co^te-d'Ivoire, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of the Ivory Coast and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
43.         The draft Loan Agreement and draft Guarantee Agreement conform
substantially to the pattern of previous agreements for agricultural projects
involving co-financing with CCCE and EEC (FED). The following features of
the loan documents are of particular interest:
(a)  The Government, in addition to its guarantee of the loan,
is required to provide advances or contributions, to cover
any cash deficits of SOCATCI as well as any shortfalls in
-the liquid assets of SOCATCI below a specified level (Section
2.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement);
(b)  SOCATCI would not declare or pay dividends if, or if as
a result thereof, the Government would be required to make
advances or contributions pursuant to Section 2.03 of the
Guarantee Agreement (Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(c)  The effectiveness of the Loan Agreement would be dependent
upon:
(i)    formal action to raise SOCATCI's subscribed capital
to CFAF 1,950,000,000, the paying in of CFAF 250,000,000
and a call by SOCATCI's Board of Directors for the
paying in of the remainder of the subscribed capital
in accordance with a schedule acceptable to the Bank;
(ii)    action by the Government to grant SOCATCI the necessary
rights in the land required for the plantation;
(iii)    conclusion by SOCATCI of a Technical Assistance and
Management Services Contract with consultants acceptable
to the Bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank, and
(iv)    fulfillment of all the precedent conditions to initial
disbursements under the EEC (FED), CCCE-BNDA and
BNDA-SOCATCI loan agreements;



- 13 -
(e) No withdrawals would be made in respect of Part II of the
Project or in an aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent
of $4,000,000 unless and until the Bank is provided with
satisfactory evidence of the continued economic and financial
feasibility of the full 13,500 ha. plantation (Section 2.02
of the draft Loan Agreement).
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I reconmiend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

B. Projects in Execution
Ln No, 542  First Road Loan; U$5.8 million Loan of June 21, 1968;    Closi
Date: June 3, 1973
The Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road has been successfully completed
and the road studies financed with this loan are coming to an end. The
closing date has been extended to allow completion of certain of the road
studies.
Ln No. 761 Second Road Loan US%20.5 million Loan of june 22, 1971; Closing
Date: November 30, 1975
A section of the Yabayo-Man road will have to be rerouted due
to present uncertainties concerning the constructicn of a dam in the area
