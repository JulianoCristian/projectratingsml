AND DEVELOPMENT
RliPORT ANI) RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSEI) LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $24 million to the
Repuhlij of Tunisia for a highway project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project arises from preinvestment studies initiated
and carried out with the assistance of the Bank Group. On the recommendation
of a 1966 Bank economic mission a comprehensive survey of Tunisia's transport
sector was undertaken in 1967-68 with financial assistance of the UNDP and
the Bank as executing agency. On the basis of this study, the Bank identi-
fied in December 1968 a high priority highway investment project consisting
of the reconstruction of selected roads and bridges and the improvement of
highway maintenance throughout the country. Since a considerable amount of
engineering studies was required for this project, the Bank made an Engineer-
ing Loan (S2-TUN) of $850,000 in 1969 to help finance its preparation.
3.        The Bank Group's previous lending for transport in Tunisia consists
of twqo loans for ports, one of $7.0 in 1964 and another of $8.5 million in l968,
and a loan and a credit of together $17 million in 1968 for a railway project.
Following the above-mentioned Engineering Loan, the proposed project wouldl be
the Bank Group's first major operation in highways.
4.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington from
April 15 to 23, 1971. The Tunisian delegation was headed by Mr. Hf. Souissi,
Director of the Highway Department, Ministry of Public Worlks and Ihousing,
and included Messrs. M. Sefaoui, Director of the Transportation Department,
Ministry of Economic Affairs, T. Kalai, Assistant Director of Taxation,
Ministry of Finance, Z. Mestiri from the Ministry of Planning and
A. Badra from the Tunisian Embassy in Washington.
5.        Following is a summary statement of loans and credits to Tunisia
as of April 30, 1971:

6.        Implementation of the Second Education Project (Credit No. 94) has
been satisfactory, but disbursements have somewhat lagged behind schedule.
A recent mission has ascertained that an unused balance of $3.2 million will
be available under this credit, resulting mainly from savings on construction
and equipment expenditures. As an interim measure, the closing date (December
31, 1970) has now been postponed by seven months to permit the submission and



- 3 -
processing of pending withdrawal requests and to examine the Government re-
quest for utilization of the unused balance. I will in due course present
to the Executive Directors recommendations regarding the utilization of these
ftnds and a further postponement of the closing date.
7.        A detailed account of the problems encountered in implementing
the Cooperative Farm Project (Loan No. 484 and Credit No. 99) was contained
in my memorandum to the Executive Directors of November 5, 1970 (R70-213).
The Executive Directors approved amendments to the original Loan and Credit
Agreements on November 17, 1970. These amendments became effective on
March 24, 1971. and disbursements have been resumed.
8.        As a result of flood damages in the fall of 1969 and the necessitv
of giving priority to the repair of these damages, the Railroad Project
(Loan No. 606 and Credit No. 150) is about one year behind schedule. The
railroad company (SNCFT) has made efforts to reduce this delay, and sub-
stantial. procurement contracts have been recently signed or are about to be
signed.  A matter of concern is the weak financial, position of SNCFT, due
principally to loss of traffic because of the flood damages, delays in
repairing these fully and non-payment of freight charges by the railroad
company's largest client, a phosphate mining company.     However, the Covern-
ment is now implementing recovery programs for SNCFT and the phosphate
company designed to restore their financial position.
9.        Initial delays in the preparation of bidding documents and in the
letting of contracts account for slow disbursements under the Second Port
Project (Loan No. 573). A number of important contracts have now been
awarded and a normal rate of disbursement can be expected hencefortlh.
Disbursements under the First Water Supply Project (Loan No. 581) are now
reaching a satisfactory rate.   Implementation of the three Loans to Societe
Nationale d'Investissement (Nos. 449, 512 and 648) is proceeding satisfacto-
rily. Loan No. 724 to Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz becanme
effective on May 12, 1971.
10.       In 1962, TFl invested $3.5 million ($2 million as a loan and
$1.5 million as equity investment) in NPK-Engrais, a phosphate fertilizer
company.  In 1966, IFC macde an investment of D 300,000 (about $571,500) in
the share cnpital of Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SMI), which) in
1970 was increased h)v $630,000 allowing IFC to maintain its 20 percent
participation when SNI doubled its share capital.. In 1969, IFC made an
investment of $9.9 million ($8 million as a loan and $1.9 million in share
capital) in COFITOUR, a tourism development and holding company.
11.       The Bank and IDA are presently considering, projects in fisheries
and tourism infrastructure as well as a fourth loan to Societe Nationale
d'Investissement. A report on a proposed loan and credit for an agricul-
tural credit project will be presented to the Executive Directors in due
course.

PART III - THi PROJECT
12.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project,
Tunisia", (PTR-75a) is attached.
13.       Tunisia's road traffic has increased considerably over the past
few years as a result of urban development, increased agricultural product-
ion and a rapidly expanding tourism industry.    The extent to which Tunisia's
economic development is dependent on an efficient highway network was clear-
ly demonstrated bv the heavy flood of late 1969 when both production and
exports were considerably reduced because transport facilities had been bad-
ly damaged. Reliable farm-to-market roads and an adequate primary road net-
work which connects centers of production, consumption and export are re-
quired to support and promote agricultural development. Similarly, develop-
ment of tourism, the country's most important foreign exchange earner, relies
to a large extent on the road system.
14.       The highway network is fairly extensive and generally adequate
in coverage and length. However, its design characteristics are insuffi-
cient to cope with the growing traffic. Furthermore, an important backlog
of periodic maintenance has accumulated as a result of inadequate budgetary
allocations for this purpose. Finally, Tunisia's transport sector is
cliaracterized by inadequate arrangements for overall coordination and form-
ulation of policies, severe restrictions particularly on road transport an(1
an inappropriate taxation system.



-.5-
13.       The proposed project consists of: (a) improvement of about 275 of
primary and secondary roads serving the southern hinterland of Tunis and the
coastal region of Hammamet, one of Tunisia's most important tourist areas;
(b) reconstruction of 51 bridges and culverts, mainly in northern and
central Tunisia; (c) resurfacing and rehabilitation of about 1,920 km. of
paved roads throughout the country; and (d) consulting services for pre-
investment studies for further road improvements and for assistance in con-
struction supervision, implementation of the highway maintenance program,
improvement of transport coordination and a study of road transport regula-
tions and road user charges.
16.       The construction and maintenance program would be executed by
the Highway Department of the Ministry of Public Works. A special unit
will be created within that Department, assisted by consultants, for con-
struction programming and supervision. As regards the maintenance program,
agreement was reached during negotiations on a reorganization and strength-
ening of the Department's highway maintenance services, also to be assisted
by consultants. The provision of adequate budgetary allocations for the
expanded highway maintenance program was also agreed upon.
17.       An important objective of the project is the improvement of
coordination and policy formulation in the transport sector. To this ef-
fect wider responsibilities, particularly with regard to investment pro-
gramming, will be conferred on the Transportation Department of the Ministry
of Economic Affairs. Moreover, agreement was reached during negotiations on
the modification of current transport regulations which often are obsolete
and restrict efficiency, and on a further review by 1974 of the then exist-
ing regulation of the road transport industry. Finally, a study will be
made of the present road user taxation system with a view to simplifying
and rationalizing this system. Consultants will assist the government in
implementing this work.
18.       The estimated total cost of the project is $41.7 million.   The
proposed loan of $24 million would cover its foreign exchange component
and refinance the $850,000 Engineering Loan under which the project was
prepared. The project will yield substantial savings in highway user
costs. Its internal economic return is estimated to be above 16 percent;
the highway improvement program as a whole would have an aggregate economic
return of about 21 percent, the bridge reconstruction program 16 percent
and the resurfacing and rehabilitation program about 20 percent.
19.       Construction works will be executed by contractors selected
through international competitive bidding among prequalified firms in
accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Two partly government-owned construct-
ion companies are expected to participate in prequalification and bidding.
During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on arrangements which will
ensure that these companies will participate under the same conditions as
any other construction company.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Tunisia, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. IThe Loan Agreement substantially conforms to the pattern of
agreements used for highway projects. Its effectiveness is dependent upon
the Borrower entering into a contract satisfactory to the Bank with consult-
ants for the purpose of assisting the special unit to be established within
the Highway Department. (Section 8.01)
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       The latest economic report on Tunisia dated May 4, 1970 (EMA-22a)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 5, 1970, and an updating
memorandum was issued on March 3, 1971. An economic mission which spent
four weeks in Tunisia in March, is now preparing its report. A basic data
sheet is annexed.
22.       Tunisia's economic development during 1970 has, on the whole, been
less favorable than had been forecast. GDP at constant prices, which at
the beginning of 1970 was expected to rise by 7.2 percent, grew by not more
than 3.5 percent. Agricultural production stagnated as a good grain harvest
was offset by poor olive and wine crops. Output in most other sectors also
fell short of expectations partly because of disruptions caused by the
disastrous floods in September/October 1969. Domestic demand, on the other
hand, continued to rise faster than real output. Private and public consump-
tion increased by 9 percent. The combination of low production and buoyant
demand put pressure on prices and led to a 7 percent increase in imports.
As exports grew only slowly, the current account deficit in the balance of
payments rose by $15 million to an estimated $110 million. But the deficit
was more than covered by increased foreign aid, and reserves continued to
rise moderately.
23.       Tunisia's economic development over the last few years had been
affected by unfavorable weather conditions, severe marketing cotlstraints
especially for exports, and a number of organizational difficulties which
resulted in slow production growth, inadequate public savings, increasing
inflationary pressures, and a high external debt burden. These factors
have contributed to recent political changes and led to a serious search
for a more successful set of economic policies. These efforts culminated
in a new economic strategy, presented by the Prime Minister last November,
which aims at accelerating the growth of production and exports by reducing
direct government interference in economic decisions, encouraging private
initiative and entrepreneurship, and by relying more extensively on market
forces as guide for investment and production. More specifically, the



- 7 -
Covernment has stated its intention to give priority to increasing agri-
cultural output, and to the promotion of labor intensive small and medium
scale industrial enterprises. Productivity and export orientation will be
the principal criteria for investment allocation. Workcers' emigration will
be encouraged as an outlet for surplus labor, while efforts to control the
increase in population will be intensified.
24.      IHowever, mulch remains to be done to carry out the structural re-
forms envisazed by the Covernment.   Institutional changes will have to be
mad(e and the responsibilities of government agencies, banks, and enterprises
need to he newly defined in order to establish a more efficient economic
system.  Adequate export incentives will have to be given andl more liberal
exchange regulations are required. In additioni, there is urgent needl for
a reappraisal of sectoral policies. The Fourth Plan, which will sooni be
prepared, could play a leading role in the implementation of the necessatry
econonmic reforms.
25.       Tunisia's external debt burden is high.    In 1970, about 22 per-
cent of gross foreign exchange earnings had to be spent on servicing
external debt obligations, most of it for public and publicly-guaranteed
debt. Tle structure of external debt, however, has been improved in recent
vears by reducing the amount of new short and medium-term borrowing.     Never-
tleless, payments on present debts will remain large in coming years, and(
while there is scope for some additional borrowing on conventional terms,
Ttnisia will continue to depend to a large extent on the availability of
aid on concessional terms.
PART VI - COMIPLIANCE WIThI ARTICLES OF ACREETTENT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECONNENI)ATION
27.       I recommend( that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
