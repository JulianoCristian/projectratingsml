                                    About The Panel
 The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive
 Directors of the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure
 accountability in Bank operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The
 Inspection Panel is an instrument for groups o f two or more private citizens who believe
 that they or their interests have been or could be harmed by Bank-financed activities to
present their concerns through a Request for Inspection. In short, the Panel provides a
link between the Bank and the people who are likely to be affected by the projects it
finances.

Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and
fairly with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independencefrom the
Bank's Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living
conditions in developing countries."' The three-member Panel is empowered, subject to
Board approval, to investigate problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result of the
Bankhavingignoredits ownoperatingpolicies andprocedures.

ProcessingRequests

After the Panel receives a Request for Inspection it is processed as follows:

    The Panel decides whether the Request is prima facie not barred fi-om Panel
    consideration.
    The Panel registers the Request-a    purely administrative procedure.
    The Panel sends the Request to Bank Management, which has 21 working days to
    respond to the allegations ofthe Requesters.
    The Panel then conducts a short 21 working-day assessment to determine the
    eligibility o f the Requesters andthe Request.
    If the Panel does not recommend an investigation, and the Board of Executive
    Directors accepts that recommendation, the case is considered closed. The Board,
    however, may approve an investigation against the Panel's recommendation if
    warranted.
    Three days after the Board decides on whether or not an investigation should be
    carried out, the Panel's Report (including the Request for Inspection and
    Management's Response) is publicly available through the Panel's website and
    Secretariat, the Bank's Info Shop andthe respective Bank Country Office.

  findings andthe BankManagement'srecommendations.

                                  ExecutiveSummary

                                      Introduction

On January 28, 2005, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection, dated
January 21, 2005, (the "Request") related to the Cambodia: Forest Concession
Management and Control Pilot Project (FCMCPP) (the "Project").

The Project is financed by an IDA Credit, approved inDecember 2000. Its objectives are
"to demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of a comprehensive set of forest
management and operational guidelines and control procedures in forest concession
areas, and to establish an effective forest crime monitoring and prevention capability."
The Project is financed within the Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) framework, and
has four components: Forest Planning and Inventory; Concession Regulation and
Control; Forest Crime Monitoring and Prevention; and Project Management and
Institutional Strengthening.

Management states that the Project was modified in 2003 to address "post concession
management issues" inareas released from concessions. The Project also was subject to a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) inOctober 2003, at the request o f the East Asia and
Pacific Regiono f the Bank.

               The Requestersandthe Substance oftheir Claims

                                      TheRequesters

The NGO Forum on Cambodia submitted the Request on behalf of affected local
communities living in the districts o f Tbeng Meanchey in Preah Vihear Province; Siem
Bok and Sesan in Stung TrengProvince; and Anlong Veng inOddar Meanchey Province,
Cambodia (the "Requesters").     These four districts respectively are home to concession
areas o f four different concession companies.

The NGO Forum on Cambodia states that it has received "letters from a number of
villagers signed in March 2004" asking the Forum "to represent their request (. ..)."The
Request also states that the "local community representatives who signed the letters have
requested that their names be kept conjdential." The Request includes two signed letters
from representatives o f affected communities and a report prepared by the NGO Global
Witness for the affected communities at the request o f their representative, the NGO
Forum o f Cambodia, to help them substantiate the case and the alleged violation o f Bank
policies andprocedures




                                                                                       ix

               Complaints related to Project Design and Implementation

 The Requesters believe that the Bank did not comply with its policies and procedures in
 the design and implementation o f the Project and that, as a result, the forest-dependent
 communities affected by the Project have suffered and will continue to suffer harm. The
 Requesters claim that through a flawed design and poor implementation the Bank
 promoted the interests o f the logging concession companies, rather than those o f the
 people.

 In particular, the Requesters argue that by assisting the concessionaires in producing
 forest management plans and environmental and social assessments, the Bank used loan
 money to benefit logging companies with track records of, among other things, human
 rights abuses and illegal logging o f resin trees, which are one o f the main sources o f
 livelihood o f forest-dependent communities. The Requesters claim that the Bank Project
 made no attempt to correct the flaws o f the concession system. They claim that the Bank
 Project strengthened the position o f the concessionaires because it gave them the
 opportunity to present themselves as having the "seal o f approval" from the World Bank
 and thus make themselves more immune from criticism. They also state that during
 Project implementation the Bank did not attempt to correct the Project approach in spite
 o f available evidence o f ongoing illegal activities by the concessionaires.

 The Requesters also raise concerns regarding the use of a Learningand Innovation Loan
 (LIL) as the framework for the Project.          According to the Requesters, "Bank staff
 associated with the FCMCPP are evidently keen to push the idea that because the
FCMCPP was backed by a learning and innovation loan, it [the Bank] was therefore not
 bound by Bank operationalpolicies."

           Complaints in Relation to Specific Bank Policies and Procedures

Intheirclaims, theRequestersallegethattheBankhasfailedto complywithanumberof
Bank policies and procedures, including safeguards policies such as OP/BP 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment, OP/BP 4.36 on Forestry, OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples,
OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats, and OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property.

EnvironmentalAssessment, ForestsandNaturalHabitats

The Requesters claim that in designing the Project, consideration o f environmental and
social impacts was "very cursory at best and did not meet operational policy standards."
They claim that the Project was erroneously categorized as B, rather than A, under the
Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4-01), and thus no environmental assessment
was carried out. In addition, they state that consultations with affected people did not
take place during Project preparation, and the consultations conducted by the
concessionaires for preparing management plans were highlyinadequate.

The Requesters claim that an environmental assessment ahead o f the Project might have
identified forests of high ecological value, in particular the Prey Long forest. Instead,



                                                                                        X

 they claim, "the project has advised the Cambodian government to allow another 25
 years of logging by three concessionaires (...)" (concessions in the Prey Long forest).
 They consider that the Bank has violated its Forestry Policy (OP/BP 4.36) by assisting
 and endorsing the concessionaires, thereby allowing them to continue logging inthe same
 way as in the past, and by allowing the logging o f a forest o f high ecological value and
 thus hrther contributingto its degradation.

 The Requesters assert that failure to recognize forests in the concessions as natural
 habitats has resulted in a poorly conceived Project. They allege that the Bank has
 allowed the Project to produce outcomes that increase the probability o f severe and
 imminentdamageto naturalhabitats that arepart ofCambodia's naturalheritage.

 The Requesters also claim that the concessionaires' activities are a "direct threat" to the
 people whose livelihood depends on tapping resin, because the trees tapped for resin are
 the same commercial grade species that are o f high commercial value to companies in
 producing plywood and veneer. They claim that, although the "1988 Decree on Forest
 Practice Rules prohibitedfelling of trees that people were actively tappingfor resin" the
 companies `cconsistentlyflouted this law (...) and cut them in vast numbers", "with
 impunity."

 The Requesters state that even in the Management Plans prepared under the Project, the
 concessionaires included resin trees in their inventory and in their annual allowable cut
which the companies use to justify their economic viability. According to the Requesters,
 the "FCMCPP has endorsed managementplans which indicate quite clearly the intention
 by some companies to log resin trees illegally and exclude communities from areas of
forest. "



Social Issues,IndigenousPeoplesand CulturalProperty

The Requesters complain that although Cambodian indigenous peoples are affected by
the logging concessionaires, the Bank did not identify any issue related to indigenous
peoples duringthe Projectpreparation. The Requesters state that the Bank failed, without
justification, to conduct social studies and prepare an Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan (IPDP), and to consider the impacts o f the concession operations on the indigenous
communities whose vital link to the forest is economical, social and cultural.

The Request also claims that, before the Project started, the Bank did not carry out any
survey of existing cultural property in the concession areas, which, according to the
Requesters, "contain both spirit forests and sites of archaeological importance." The
Requesters add that while evidence i s available that many communities, in particular
indigenous peoples, worship spirit forests, concession companies have logged them. The
Requesters also complain that the Strategic Forest Management Plans (SFMPs) and
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) prepared by the concession
companies do not take these sites into account, despite their importance for the forest-
dependent communities.




                                                                                         x i

 The Request states that the concession areas contain archeological sites which have not
 been identified and excepted from production areas in the SFMPs. The Requesters state
 that logging o f spirit forests will seriously harm the interests o f local communities, and
 that similar lack o f attention to archaeological sites couldjeopardize cultural propertythat
 i s part o f the nationalheritage o f all Cambodians.

 Supervision

 The Requesters believe that Management did not comply with the Bank Policy on
 Supervision because under the Project inadequate management plans and environmental
 assessments prepared by the concessionaires were approved. They claim that the review
 o f the plans ignored the companies' bad track records and used a scoring system that did
not take into consideration the concession's adverse impacts on forest-dependent
 communities. Inaddition, the Requesters claim that these plans were disclosed only for a
 19-day consultation period, which was inadequate to allow the people to comment
 effectively on the plans.

                           ResponsefromBankManagement

Management states that the Project's emphasis on gradual reform o f concessions was the
most appropriate choice at the time the Project was conceived. Management contends
that this choice was shared by forest specialists and knowledgeable observers, and was
built up through public discussions, dialogue with the Government and the work o f other
agencies. According to Management, the approach adopted in this Project was a
responsible one and compliedwith Bank forest policies andpractices.

The Project was designed to help Cambodia create a credible regulatory framework for
concession operations. According to Management, when the Project was prepared the
concession areas were already defined. Management also claims that through the
concession management planning framework established under the Project, the area
covered by concessions decreased.

Management states that the "Bank has not Pnanced logging or infrastructure in high
ecological value areas." Management notes that the Bank financed studies under the
Biodiversity Management and Protected Area Project, which addressed, inter alia, the
Prey Long forest. In addition, according to Management the Project complies with OP
4.04, as no concessions have been issued as a result o f this Project. Management also
states that the guidelines for the SFMPs include various provisions ensuring
identification, assessment andplanningfor critical habitats.

Management claims that Bank supervision was always aware o f the issues surrounding
the Project and, for example, playedan active role inthe banon loggingandlogtransport
issued by the Government in 2002. The Response also states that the Bank made its
Phnom Penh office available for disclosing the forest management plans, although it
recognizes that the process o f disclosure could have beenmanaged better.




                                                                                          xii

 Management acknowledges that no EA was preparedbefore appraisal, and that "to have
 complied fully with the policies, the Bank should have requested more explicit
 documentation from the Government and provided more extensive explanation in the
 PAD. Local-level consultations on theproposed project concept should have been held at
 selected concession locations." Nevertheless, according to Management, these instances
 o f noncompliance did not lead to any harm or potential harm to the people living in the
 Project area.

 Management acknowledges that "the Bank was not infull compliance with OD 4.20 [on
 Indigenous Peoples] and that, in hindsight, screening studies and a framework IPDP,
 along with more discussion of the issue would have been more appropriate during
project design."   However, Management claims that the issues in OD 4.20 are to be
 addressed in consultation guidelines, which have been under preparation since April
2004. (As o f March 2006 these guidelines have not been completed). Management also
claims that the lack o f full compliance with OD 4.20 did not cause any harm or lead to
potential harmto the people livinginthe Project areas.

Management believes that the Project complies with the Bank policy on Cultural
Property, OPN 11.03. I t states that the "[gluidelines developed under theproject callfor
identijkation and designation of Special Management Areas and specijkally refer to
sacred groves, spiritforests and archaeologicalsites."

According to Management, the Project may claim some successes, such as the formal
adoption o f guidelines and codes o f practice for forest management, regular public
reporting on forest crime, and reduction in the areas under concessions. However,
Management also recognizes that involvement o f local communities was not adequate,
and that many issues, such as claims o f forest-dependent communities to resin trees as
their source oflivelihood, should havebeenaddressedat an earlystage o fthe Project.

The Response states that the resin tree issue emerged to a large extent during Project
implementation and that the Bank has since then supported studies to address it. With
respect to the claims that the Project approved six forest management plans, Management
asserts that the Bank never endorsed the plans nor recommended them for approval.
Management also states that the Project didnot finance any o f the concessionaires; rather
it aimed at building capacity within the Government.

The Response also contains lessons learned from this Project, taking into account the
complexity o f the situation and systemic problems (corruption, lack o f transparency).
The discussion highlights, among other things: constraints inpursuing options due to the
Bank's position not to take sides on existing investment contracts between the Borrower
andprivate companies; the importance o fearly localcommunity involvement; the needto
be outspoken, including with the Borrower, in the face o f significant problems; and the
potential value o f specifying conditionalities related to social concerns in the legal
agreement. The Panel appreciates the effort by Management,in its Response to the
Request, to identify lessons learned, and considers that this effort contributes
constructively to promotingthe effectivedesign and implementationof development
projects.

     The InvestigationReportandApplicable Policies and Procedures

This Report concludes the Panel's investigation into the matters alleged in the Request
for Inspection. Panel Member Tongroj Onchan led the investigation.                       Three expert
consultants/advisers on social and indigenous peoples issues, forestry and environmental
assessmentassistedthe Panelinthe investigation.

The Report examines the meritso f the claims presentedinthe Request. It also considers
Management's response to the claims. Inthe investigation, the Panel reviewed relevant
Project documents and other materials from the Requesters, Bank Staff, the Royal
Government o f Cambodia, local authorities, individuals and communities living in the
areas affected by the Project, nongovernmental organizations, and other sources,
including scholarly literature. The Panel interviewedBank Staff in Washington and in
the Bank offices in Phnom Penh and Bangkok, and visited the areas affected by the
Project on two Panel visits inMarch and October o f 2005.

Duringits visits, the Panel met with Requesters and other individuals and communities,
local and national authorities, representatives o f nongovernmental organizations, relevant
experts and others. The Panel also gathered considerable data with which to evaluate the
Requesters claims.

With respect to this Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied with the
following applicable operational policies and procedures:

The Project i s supported by IDA Credit No. 3365-KH for SDR 3.6 million, approved on
June 6,2000. The Credit Agreement became effective on October 20, 2000. The closing
date was originally set for December 31, 2003, but upon request o f the Borrower, the
Credit was extended to June 30, 2005. The Bank also granted a second request for
extension until December 31, 2005, but only with respect to the Project Component C,
Forest Crime Monitoring and Prevention. A Japanese Policy and Human Resources

'OP 4.36 (Forestry) issuedinSeptember 1993 applies to this Project becausethe Credit financing the
FCMCPP was approved inJune 2000 while the current BankPolicy OPBP 4.36 (Forests) was issuedin
November 2002.


                                                                                                  xiv

                           Forests and Society inCambodia

Cambodia i s a forest-rich country, which has emerged in recent years from long periods
o f intense conflict and war. It i s now at peace, the economy is stabilizing, and recent
economic performance i s promising, but the social and political environment remains
considerably unstable. This instability significantly affects the resolution o f issues inthe
forest sector, as inothers.

Forest resources in Cambodia play critically important roles in the economy, culture and
environment o f the country. There i s general agreement, however, that during the 1990's
tens o f millions o f cubic meters o f timber were extracted from these forests, and over ten
percent o fthe forest, more than a millionhectares, was lost to deforestation.

Forests form a crucial part o f the survival strategy o f the rural poor, who depend on and
use forests in a great variety o f ways. Forests are particularly important for indigenous
peoples, who live in the more remote and isolated regions o f the country. Forests
comprise their cultural and spiritual home, and are the basis o f their economic identity.
One o f the core concerns expressed in the Request for Inspection relates to the serious
depletion, caused by intensifiedlogging, o f resin-producing trees from which indigenous
peoples and local communities derive a major source o ftheir incomes.

By the early 1990's, rich commercial forests such as those found inCambodia had a very
highvalue perhectare for industrial loggers. Up to that moment, Cambodia's highforests
had been largely inaccessible to internationally supported industrial activity because o f
decades o f war and a total lack o f rural security, which ironically helped preserve them.
The highvalue ofthe forests has since attracted a timber industrywhich had already been
very active for more than 40 years in Asia, especially in the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia. This industry typically logs a very highvolume (everything o f value) where it
operates, and moves systematically through all the available forests. The operations are
not even close to sustainable.

Thus decision-makers in Cambodia during the 1990's were facing some tough choices.
The immediately available commercial values o f timber could make an important and
desperately needed economic contribution to the country, but unsustainable exploitation
o f timber conflicted directly with the survival strategies o f the rural poor, with the
conservation o f biodiversity, and with commitments to sustainable development. There
were also cultural and gender issues involved, which have been recognized as high
priorities inBankpolicies.

The Government owns the forest land in Cambodia, although it recognizes prescribed
access and use rights o f local and indigenous communities.           Starting in 1988, the
Government adopted a number o f laws, policies and instruments relating to forest
concession planning and management. In the early 1990'~~        the Government decided to



                                                                                          xv

 introduce private industrial forest concessions as the main instrument o f commercial
 forest management inthe country.

 In 1995,at the request of the Government, the Bank and other donors reviewed selected
 issues affecting the forest sector inCambodia to bring about sectoral development policy
 reform. Their report, issued in 1996, expressed serious concerns about a Government
 program aimed at allocating almost all the country's forests to only a few
 concessionaires, a program restingon "a level of timber exploitation which is likely to be
 unsustainable " and "unlikely to have signijkant impact on illegal logging. "  In2000, the
 Bank approved a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) aimed at tackling governance
 issues and pushing forward a program o f reforms to improve public resource and forestry
 management, and enhancepublic sector management.

                                        Findings

                          Project Focus on ConcessionSystem

 Evaluations o f the decisions taken regardingthis Project needto be considered within the
 overall context o f the Bank work in the forest sector and even in other sectors in
 Cambodia. Bank Staff interviewed by the Panelclarified that in 1995 the Bank beganto
take an interest in the forestry sector and considered what action might be feasible in
order for Cambodia to switch from a political economy o f forestry which was non-
transparent and driven by private and individual interests into one that was sustainable
and transparent.

The Panel, in principle, commends Management for engaging in forestry-related
work in Cambodia. The Panelrecognizesthat this requiredthe courage to be a risk
taker, knowing that the work was important for poverty reduction and
development, but also likely to lead to controversy and criticism. The Panel also
emphasizes that in such a context compliance with safeguard policies is essential,
even though transaction costs may be higher. Because o f the strong economic
incentives for unsustainable timber exploitation, the Bank has an important,role to play
and a comparative advantage inits effort to support sustainable forestry.

The record indicates, however, that the primary thrust of the Bank's efforts in the forest
sector during the 1990's was focused on industrial logging. The major emphasis on
concession logging (90 percent o f all studies) relegated broader forest management
considerations and alternative approaches to the margins. The Panel finds that in the
Project's focus on concessions, other aspects that were important to the Bank
program in Cambodia and the Government were largely ignored or at least
marginalizedthroughout the planningphaseof the Project. Inparticular, the Project
did not seem to take on the key objective of usingthe potentialof forests to reduce
poverty.

Inthis regard, it couldbe expected that conflict would emerge ifindustrial logging failed
to deal adequately and equitably with the legitimateneeds and interests o f indigenous and



                                                                                       xvi

  local communities. The Panelfinds, however, that the Project did not give adequate
  attention to the vital interests of local communities and indigenous peoplesin forest
  resources, and to the contestednatureofthe forest domain.

  Moreover, in addressing concession reform, studies on the technical/financial aspects o f
  the concession system dominated the agenda. The Panel finds that the Bank chose to
  give primary emphasis in the Project's design to the technical and financial aspects
  of concession reform at the expense of environmentaland social aspects. It thereby
  lost an opportunityto leadthe debateon muchneededreforminthe forest sector, so
  that forests couldbe sustainablymanagedfor the benefit of all Cambodians.

 Inthis regard, the Panel notes that what may be referredto as "technical-level" work is
 important, but often not sufficient, to cause fundamental change, particularly in a forest-
 rich, post-conflict country such as Cambodia. Issues involving timber, illegal logging,
 the rights and welfare o f rural communities and indigenous peoples, and biodiversity
 conservation go well beyond technical considerations. Inline with relevant policies, they
 require well-informed, high-level and wide-spread political and strategic consultations
 andnegotiations. The skill sets and senioritylevel for technicalforestry and strategic
 politicaldialogue are quite different. Operating on one level without the other will
 often provefutile and leadto problemsas in the presentcase. The Bank is one o f few
 institutions that should be able to operate inan effective way on these two levels.

                    Guidelines and Proceduresfor ConcessionAreas

 One of the Project objectives is to improve the effectiveness o f forest use guidelines.
 From 1998 to 2000, several sets o f guidelineswere developed supported by funding from
 the Bank andother donors.

 The Panel reviewed a sample o f the guidelines, focusing on provisions related to social
 issues. The Panel found that while some o f the provisions o f the guidelines are consistent
 with Bank safeguard policies, others do not meet Bank policy requirements. The
 guidelines, for example, do not require that an IPDP-type plan should be prepared to
 address the impacts o f concessions on affected indigenous peoples. They also do not
 include provisions to compensate people who would be involuntarily deprived o f their
traditional access to usuhct rights over resin trees.

The Panel is concerned that, with respect to the social aspects of the concessions,
certain parts of the guidelinesissuedunder the Project do not meet Bank safeguard
policy requirements and do not provide an adequate framework for the
Government of Cambodia to decide on any future forestry concessions. Unless this
situation is properly remedied,the Projectwill not achieve one of its mainobjectives
which is to "demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of a comprehensive set of
forest management and operational guidelines and control procedures in forest
concession areas."

                   Choice of Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)

 Learning and InnovationLoans (LILs)were established in 1997 inpart to pilot operations
 in untested areas before scaling-up, and to test new approaches that are attractive but
risky. Learningandhypothesis-testing are important elements of such projects.

Panel members asked during interviews with Management and Staff in Washington,
Bangkok and Phnom Penh about the way in which learning was made explicit in the
Project, and how this led to innovation. The questions were generally met with
puzzlement. Staffreferred to the Project as a "technical assistanceproject"-the  LILwas
evidently seen as a relatively quick and easy mechanism to mobilize a loan.

The Panel observes that the main aim of the loan was to support a legal and
regulatoryprogramon the basisofwhich long-termconcessionswere to be granted.
This cannot easily be regarded as a "learning and hypothesis-testing" exercise.
Moreover, while many things may certainly be learned about implementing sustainable
forestry, the Project design did not focus on overcoming the major and widely-
acknowledged difficulties affecting forest management in Cambodia. The Panel finds
that the elements conditioning the use of the LIL instrument do not apply
convincinglyto the Project.

The Bank document establishing LILs as an instrument also states that a LIL may not be
appropriate when the policy framework i s poor and borrower commitment and ownership
are especially weak. The Panel finds that these two conditions were present at the
time of the design of the Project. This provides a further indicationof the problems
ofusinga LIL as the framework for this Project.

The Panel notes that the Project aimed to ameliorate past damage inthe forests, and the
Panel commends this intention. It i s arguable, however, whether and the extent to which
the Project had a positive impact in the field. The Panel observes that a Project o f this
scale, focused on technical aspects o f forestry, was bound to have only a limited impact
given the prevailing political context and the very high stakes and potential gains
involved. This i s the case notwithstanding the existence o f the "Bank Policy Dialogue"
relating to the SAC. The Panelfinds that Managementcould have foreseen that this
type of Projectmightnot be effective in the presentpoliticalcontext, particularlyby
the time ofProjectinceptionwhen a number of sector studies hadbeencarried out.

                             Environmental Compliance

BankInvolvementin Project

Cambodian forests, at least in some locations, were highly valued in terms o f hard
currency as industrial raw material. A number o f concession agreements had been
concluded before Bank or other donor involvement in the sector. According to a 1998
World Bank paper, the terms o f the 1990s Forest Concessions in Cambodia were
negotiated behind closed doors, with no transparency, and with the highest levels o f


                                                                                    xviii

 Government (superior to anyone in the Forestry Department or Administration) directly
 representing the Government. Inthe face o f these realities, the Bank decided to work in
 the forestry sector, and to attempt to work with the Government on the "concession
 issue".

 The Panelfinds that the decisionto work on the concession issue is not inconsistent
 with the objectives of OP 4.36. The Panel notes that had the Bank avoided the
 concession issue, it may have had little chance to reform a system that was increasing
 deforestation, degrading the environmental contribution o f forests, and aggravating rural
 poverty. The Panel also finds that the Bank is in compliance with the provision of
 OP4.36 statingthat the Bank does notfinance loggingor loggingequipment.

 In assessing the Project under Bank policy, a key question becomes whether the
 Government had made a credible commitment to sustainable and conservation oriented
 forestry. The Panel believes that reasonable and neutral observers could differ in their
 conclusion.

 Inthis regard, Management refers to expressionsofcommitment bythe Government, and
 a range o f new policy and regulatory developments, as indicative o f a commitment to
 sustainable forestry. However, wide-spread unsustainable practices were occurring, and
there was general belief that high level officials and military were involved. The Panel
 also notes that the Government could have been fblly committed to sustainability in
principle and still not have beenable inpractice to completelyhalt illegal logging

The Panel finds that the Bank's view that the Government's commitment to
sustainability was consistent with OP 4.36 when the Project was formulated may
have been based on wrong assumptions. Given the rampant forest destruction and
community abuses alreadyoccurring,the Bank shouldhavetaken greater painsand
exercisedgreater cautionto ensure its compliancewith Bankforestrypolicy.

The Panel's review o fProject documents indicates that these concerns were notedbut not
addressed. The idea that the concession holders would manage community consultations
or resource assessments is a very serious flaw, especially given that the forest
concessions were exploiting a resource which rural poor people (including indigenous
peoples) reliedupon for an important part o f their livelihoods. The Panelfinds that the
Project's design created a structure likely to lead to inadequate levels of local
involvement, community consultations, and social and environmental assessments.
This does not comply with OP 4.36 and other Bank policies (analyzed inmore detail
below).

Identificationand Protectionof ForestsofHighEcologicalValue

One of the most valuable forest areas o f Cambodia is known as Prey Long. It is a large
forest to the west o f the Mekong River in Stung Treng Province. From as early as 1975,
the large block o f forest containing the Prey Long area was identified as an important




                                                                                       xix

 area for biodiversity conservation. More recently, it was included ina listing o f tentative
 natural sites for World Heritageconsideration for Cambodia.

 The Prey Long is one of the few remaining areas o f relatively undisturbed dense semi-
 evergreen lowland forest in the Indo-Chinese province o f the Indo-Malayan Realm, and
 has potential for holding populations o f several threatened species. These forest types are
 considered to be particularly important for wildlife habitat. During the Panel's visit,
 villagers living on the periphery o f Prey Long forest claimed to have seen tiger footprints
 and elephants in the forest. They were also unanimous in stating that it contained
 significant areas o f spirit forest and large spirit trees.

 The Prey Long forest i s presently covered by three concessions, and i s at risk o f
 sustaining serious damage ifindustrial-scale logging i s carried out.

 In the view of the Inspection Panel there is no doubt that the Prey Long forest
 merits consideration as a "forest of high ecological value", and this should have
 been obvious to Bank Staffduring both the design and implementationstages of the
 Project.An explicit acknowledgement ofthis status duringthe early stages o fthe Project
 could have influenced discussions and debates in Phnom Penh, and in particular should
have guided input into the SFMPs o f concessions covering the PreyLong area.

The Panel finds that while the Bank did not finance the harvesting of high value
forests, it did not ensure that the potential high ecological value of the Prey Long
forest was explicitly identified in the early years of the Project and taken into
considerationduringthe development of relevantSFMPs, as is requiredby OP4.36.

Identificationand ProtectionofNaturalHabitats

Most of Cambodia's forests that have been, or could be, subject to industrial logging fall
into the category o f natural habitats for the purpose o f OP 4.04. This policy calls for the
protection, maintenance and rehabilitation o f natural habitats, and has an especially high
standard o fprotection for critical natural habitats. Critical natural habitats under OP 4.04
include
sacred groves).
         "...areas.."initially recognized as protected by traditional local communities (e.g.


It is apparent from aperusal o fthe literature and from discussions with localcommunities
that there are many spirit forests and spirit trees in forests in their locality which are
important to the cultural identity o f local people. This i s particularly the case with
indigenous communities. I t is also clear that industrial logging, as carried out by
concessions in the past, has caused significant loss o f natural habitat and destruction o f
spirit forests without any consideration o f their spiritual or cultural values. It has also, in
manycases, opened the door to the conversion ofnaturalhabitatto non forest landuses.

While the Project did not explicitly support the significant conversion of natural
habitats, the Panel finds that the Project design and planning did not adequately
recognizethe existenceofnaturalhabitats, andparticularlycriticalnaturalhabitats.



                                                                                             xx

 As a result, essential information to enable their protection was missing in the
 concession planning and approval process. The Panel finds that this is not
 consistent with OP/BP4.04 onNaturalHabitats.

 The Needfor an EnvironmentalAssessment

 The Panelnotes that one could hardly overemphasize the negative effects o f the logging
 on a natural habitat o f world class value and most importantly on very poor and
vulnerable rural communities and indigenous peoples. Many moist tropical forests can
be described as both fragile and resilient eco-systems. They can withstand, and intime
recover from, certain kinds o f disturbances, but more serious degrees o f disturbance may
cause damages that are irreversible for long time periods.

When unsustainable logging occurs on a large scale over large areas, the environmental
damage to the forest may be very severe. But evenmore serious than the direct effects are
the further disturbances which loggingmay facilitate. These kinds o f collateral damages,
discussed inthe Report as "induced development", usually leadto irreversible changes.

As described inthe Report, many measures may be considered to address such potential
impacts, through "reduced impact" logging. These are the types o f measures that a
sustainable forest management project would support and implement, and that should be
considered within an appropriate environmental assessment. Based on the economic
realities inthe context o fthe present Project, they are also the measures that were ignored
bythe concessionaires duringtheir operations. The Panelfinds that the PAD and other
Project formulation documents did not contain an adequate analysis of the
environmentalissues surroundingthe Project,as is requiredby OP 4.01.

OP/BP 4.01 assigns proposed projects to one o f four categories, A, B C or FI. A project
i s assigned category "A" if it "(...) is likely to have significant adverse environmental
impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented (...). A project i s classified as "B" if
its potential impacts "(. ..) are less adverse than those of Category A projects." Category
A projects requireamuchmore extensive environmental assessment.

The Panel notes that logging under the concession system during the period o f the
formulation and execution o f the Project undoubtedly had significant adverse
environmental impacts that would be considered sensitive under OP 4.01. While the
Project did not cause or directly fund logging, the Panel observes that the association o f
the Project with the logging - through technical assistance provided to the Government
with the aim of managing such logging sustainably - also closely associates the Project
with the very serious impacts ofthe concession system.

Given the very serious potential impacts, and the close association of the Project
with these impacts, the Panel finds that the Project should have been placed in
Category A and a full EnvironmentalAssessment carried out. By failing to do this,
the Bank did not comply with OP 4.01. The Panel finds that careful study and
debate by multiple parties, as required for a Category "A" project under OP 4.01,



                                                                                          xxi

 could have helped avoid serious errors in the design and implementation of the
 Project. This type o f assessment might have led, for example, to a greater focus on
 alternative approaches to industrial scale logging, such as various types o f community
 andpartnershipforestry.

At the same time, the Panelrecognizes that overall Bank activity anddiscussions with the
 Government over the past decade, in combination with those o f other important donors,
may have ameliorated to some extent the damage to the forests and rural people in
Cambodia by repeatedly raising the issue with Government at multiple levels. The Panel
also notes that the activities o f NGOs were critical in raising the issues and providing
information on them for donors, including the Bank, and to Cambodia, including its
Government.

                                   Social Compliance

The Needfor a SocialAssessment

Both the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and the policy on Indigenous
Peoples (OD 4.20) require evaluating and assessing the social issues that arise in
connection with a Bank-financedproject. As described inthis Report, however, the Bank
chose to give primary emphasis to the technical and financial aspects o f concession
reform, while giving only minor consideration to social and environmental issues. The
Panel notes that even studies that Management cites in the Response as containing
sufficient information to address social concerns warned that the forestry sector was
focusing on industrial logging, while not giving adequate attention to aspects such as the
needs o f forest-dependent communities.

The Panel finds that the lack of a social assessment specific to this Project has had
serious consequences for the ability of the Bank to comply with its operational
policies,fromthe designthroughthe implementationphases ofthe Project.

IdentificationofAffected PopulationandProject-Area

The Panel notes that, by failing to identify the affected population within the planning
phase and to develop an IPDPfor the affected indigenous peoples, the size o f the affected
population was in effect not estimated at all.       Rather, the Project followed what
Management refers to as a `(Process-oriented" approach, which left the development o f
this information to a later date when concessionaires would develop their ESIAs. In this
case, the Panel finds that a safeguard postponed is a safeguard denied, because by
failing to identify beforehand the affected population, the Bank policies requiring
consultationandparticipationofthat populationcouldnotbe properlyfollowed.

Even at the delayed date, the Bank focused only on the areas covered by the
concessions to define the Project Area. The Panel finds that this led to an overly
restrictivedefinition of the Project Area. Each concession was considered separately
without looking at multiplier effects and interactions between the concessions. As a



                                                                                      xxii

 result, the Project's social impacts were significantly understated and the Bank
 social and environmentalsafeguardsnot applied to the proper area and population.
 The Panelfinds that this is not consistentwith the applicable Bank policies, OP 4.01
 and OD 4.20.

 Impactson LocalPeopleof IllegalLoggingofResinTrees

 The issue o f illegal logging o f resin trees i s a major concern o f Requesters. The
 importance o f resin harvesting for many rural Cambodians has been highlighted inrecent
 surveys, and was apparent to the Panel. According to one study, the threat o f logging
 concessions to trees tapped for resin i s very severe because resin tapping makes up a
 significant portion o f the income for approximately 100,000 people.             The Panel
 constantly heard testimony during its visits regardingthe importance o f resin trees to the
 livelihoods of local communities.

 As indicated in the Request, the issue of resin trees also involves ownership rights by
people living near the forests, including rights to transfer ownership o f trees. Numerous
 studies treat this as a matter o f customary tenure, and identifyhow, according to custom,
 a person becomes an owner of a tree. Households may have (customary) ownership over
manytrees.

Bankpolicies, especially OD 4.20 andOD 4.30, requirethe Bankto recognize traditional
rights even in the absence o f local legislation, whether or not such rights are recognized
innational law. Moreover, as acknowledged byManagement, harvestingofresintrees is
at present prohibitedunder Cambodian law.

Management claims, in its Response, that it was not informed about complaints o f harms
resultingfrom cutting o fresin trees by concessionaire^.^ Most anthropologists and social
foresters working inmainland Southeast Asia would be surprised by this claim, since this
i s a major issue for forest dependent communities in many parts o f Southeast Asia.
Furthermore, the tapping o f resin is such an important part o f life in communities located
near forests that, ifit is true that Management was unaware o f the seriousnesso f the resin
tree issue and the claims in areas o f the concessions, it indicates a considerable failure o f
public consultation and input into the design o f the Project - in addition to a lack o f
awareness o f standardethnographic literature on the region

However, the Panel has assembled numerous sources o f information from the Royal
Cambodian Government, local NGOs, and the Bank's own documents and reports, to
indicate that Bank Management was frequently made aware o f numerous complaints o f
harm to local communities due to the cutting of resin trees. The Panel notes that it is
amply clear not only that the Bank should have been aware o f the importance o f resin
tapping to forest dependent communities, and the harm that illegal cutting o f resins was
doing to those communities, but also that the Bank was aware o f these issues.

                                                                                         xxiii

 Under OP 4.01, anEAneeds, among other things, to evaluate the potentialenvironmental
 impacts o f a proposed project and identify ways to prevent, minimize, mitigate or
 compensate for adverse environmental impacts, taking into account social aspect^.^ OP
 4.36 requires social, economic and environmental assessments, and set-asides o f adequate
 compensatory forests for biodiversity and for safeguarding the interests o f forest
 dwellers.

 Inthe present case, however, the Bank failed to consider or investigate complaints about
 illegal loggingof resin trees on the part o f concessionaries covered by the Project, andthe
 associated harms to the local people. The Panel finds that the illegal loggingof resin
 trees has had major negative consequenceson the Requesters and the local people.
 The Panel further finds that the Bank's failure to consider and investigate these
 problemsdoes not complywith OP 4.01 or OP 4.36.

 The Bank also failed to carry out a careful assessment or inventory that might quantify
 resin trees and other timber and non-timber forest products traditionally used by
 indigenous peoples and others. The Panelfinds that such an assessment or inventory
 should have been part of a proper environmentalassessment, and should have been
the subject of a participatorysurvey and inventory at an early stage of the Project.
The failureto do so does not complywith OP 4.01.

The Panel also notes that the system to review concession plans failed to have a policy
disqualifying concessionaires who were engaged in illegal logging o f resin or other trees.
This seems to constitute a flaw inthe designwhich is inconsistent with the general spirit
o f the Bank's Forest Policy. Inthis sense, the Project missedan important opportunity to
help reduce the potential incentive for illegal logging of resin trees and to resolve the
basic conflict between resin-dependent communities and industrial loggers. This i s o f
particular concern given that the traditional tapping o f resin trees has been shown to be a
long-term sustainable use o f forests, which also contributes to poverty alleviation, one o f
the primary aims o fO.P. 4.36.

Consultationswith Affected Peopleduring Project Preparation

OP 4.01contains requirements for consultations with affected communities and specifies
that affected people and localNGOs should be consulted duringthe EA process about the
Project's environmental impacts and their views should be taken into account.                     The
policy calls for meaningful consultations, which may occur only when people receive
relevant material about the project in a timely manner before consultations take place and
in a language and form understandable and accessible to those consulted. In addition,
OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples states that Bank policy requires informedparticipationof
the indigenous peoples themselves.

Management states that consultations specific to the environmental assessment were not
carried out because no EA was prepared prior to the Bank's approval o f the LIL. In

                               ~~




 This applies bothfor Category A and Category B EAs,though the two types o fEAs differ interms o f
scope and other aspects (see Report).


                                                                                                xxiv

 addition, Management claims that environmental and social criteria would be
 incorporated in the ESIAsISFMPs prepared by concessionaires for each concession,
 backed by a consultative process (the `(process-oriented" approach, noted above).

 The Panelfinds that the Bank's decisionto postponean active social assessment and
 consultation procedure until the preparationof the ESIAs by concessionairesis not
 consistent with Bank policies, including OP 4.01, OP 4.04 and OD 4.20, which
 requireearly consultationsand/or surveysin the preparationphase.

 During the Panel's visit to Project-affected areas, villagers, including those who had
 signed letters requesting this Inspection, personally confirmed to the Panel that they had
 never been involved in any pre-Project consultation process, or (in most cases) any
 subsequent forms o fconsultation.

 The Panel recognizes the challenges in carrying out early consultations, taking into
 consideration the political and social context in Cambodia at the time (noted above).
 This does not, however, diminish the importance and need for doing so. The failure to
 meet the provisions o f Bank policies on consultations had significant effects on the path
 o f this Project. Consultationwith those affected by an action i s critical to understanding
potential impacts and identifying alternatives during project design and implementation
to reduce and avoid such impacts. Inthe present situation, the Panelfinds that the lack
 of early consultation greatly reduced Management's capacity to be informed of
critical concerns relating to indigenous peoples, resin tapping, local community
ownership of trees, community forestry initiatives, and other matters of central
importanceto the affectedcommunities.

Preparationof an IndigenousPeoplesDevelopmentPlan

The highland minority populations of northern and northeastern Cambodia (including
Kouy, Kreung, and others), whose indigenous status has been emphasized inthe Request
for Inspection, have long been recognized as indigenous peoples. As described in the
Report, these peoples live inthe heart o f lands subject to concessions.

Under OD 4.20, an IPDP is designed to address a number o f important issues, including
baseline data, land tenure, local participation, mitigation measures, institutional capacity
and monitoring and evaluation. Management acknowledges that, in hindsight, screening
studies and a framework IPDP, along with more discussion o f the issues, would have
beenmore appropriate duringProject design.

The Panelnotesthis acknowledgement,and finds that in linewith OD 4.20, an IPDP
should have been prepared for this Project. The preparationo f an IPDP is especially
important in light o f the close association o f the Project with the possible approval o f
concession operations that could have highly adverse effects on indigenous peoples.
There is, for example, a serious lack o f information about baseline social structure and
traditional landand resource use inthese communities. This issue and others would have
beenaddressedas parto fthe prerequisites of an IPDP under OD 4.20.



                                                                                        xxv

 The Panel observes that even many of these prerequisites for an IPDP are lacking.
 Had they been developed, many of the problems that have afflicted the Project
 would havebeen recognizedand mighthavebeencorrected.

 CulturalProperty: Spirit ForestsandArcheologicalSites

 OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property adopts the United Nations definition o f cultural
property, and describes it as "sites having archeological (prehistoric), paleontological,
historical, religious, and unique natural values." The Bank policy aims at helping to
preserve cultural property and to avoid its elimination by not financing projects that will
significantly damage non-replicable cultural property, and by assisting in the protection
andenhancement o f culturalproperties, rather than leavingthat protectionto chance

Spirit forests are recognized throughout Cambodia, and they have status as protected
areas under Bank Policy OPN 11-03, and from Royal Government o f Cambodia
precedents in legislation. As noted above, the Inspection Panel heard direct testimony
during its visits about the presence o f spirit forests and spirit trees in concession areas
covered by the Project.

The Panel notes that none of the means of handling the issue o f spirit forests, provided
for in the Bank policy, was carried out as part o f the Project. The Panel finds that to
leave determinations about spirit forests to concessionaires to include within their
ESIAs as they developed and presented their SFMPs for approval is not consistent
with OPN 11.03.

The Panel also observed that the Project made little preparation for the likelihood o f
finding archeological sites within the vast areas o f forest concessions being considered
for logging. Instead, based on the guidelines for the drawing up o f ESIAs, surveys for
archeological sites (as for spirit forests) were left in the hands o f the concessionaires.
This was the case notwithstandingthe widespread presence o f long-recognized, important
archeological sites in Cambodia - including its heavily forested areas           - and the
importance o f "archeological tourism" to Cambodia's economy.

Under OPN 11.03, the government of the country is responsible for managing cultural
property, but "Bank staff must determine what is known about the cultural property
aspects of theproposed project site and, if there is any question of cultural property in
the area, a brief reconnaissancesurvey should be undertaken in thefield by a specialist."
The Panel finds that the procedure used by the Project to identify important
cultural properties relied on the concessionaires to include them within their
proposed management plans, without provision for reporting their existence to
appropriate agencies or including appropriate specialists. This does not comply
with the minimum level of protection and enhancement of cultural properties
envisionedwithin OPN 11.03. It also potentially entails serious damage to cultural
properties because it fails to includeprovisionsfor protecting, from future looting,
sites that maybediscovered.

                              Project Implementation and Supervision

  The Panel reviewedcarefully the significant events inthe timeline o f the Project, inlight
  o f a number o f issues andconcerns raised inthe Request. These are consideredbelow.

  TechnicalAssistance

  The Request raised concerns that technical assistance was provided directly to the
  concession companies. The Panel notes that a distinction needs to be made between the
  Project's attempt to build capacity within the Government, particularly the Forest
  Administration, and the provision o f direct support to the concession companies. The
  Panel did not find evidence that technical assistance was provided directly to the
  companies. Rather, consistent with OP 13.05, the Bank focused its technical
  assistance on building the capacity of the Forest Administration to oversee the
  developmentof SFMPs by companies.

  The Review of SFMPs/ESIAs

  A major set of actions under the Project involved the review of draft SFMPs and ESIAs
  submitted by the concessionaires. The Panel noted efforts by Management to address
  problems in the review process and in the drafts submitted. Notwithstanding these
  efforts, significant problems persisted. For example, the criteria for reviewing the draft
  SFMPs created a disincentive for the identification o f spirit forests, and failed to
  disqualify companies who had engaged in illegal logging practices. There were also
  concerns over conflicts o f interest in the review process, and over the inclusion o f resin
  trees inproposed annual allowable cuts.

  The Project created a technical reviewteam (TRT) to review the draft SFMPsandESIAs.
  According to Management Response, the TRT completed its reviews in June 2004, and
  recommended six plans to go forward, allegedly "bringing about a reduction in the area
  exposed to concession operations from 6.4 million hectares to just over one million."
  Subsequently, the Bank and a Forestry and Environment Technical Working Group
  (TWG), composed o f donor agency representatives and others, engaged an independent
  consultant, GFA Terra Systems (GFA), to evaluate the TRT review o f the six plans that
  hadbeenrecommended to go forward.

  These GFA independent reviews were quite dammingo f almost all aspects o f the SFMPs
  and ESIAs. The Management Response agrees that each o f the ESIAs submitted by
 concessionaires had severe weaknesses, and acknowledges that the Independent Review
 also pointed to the lack o f adequate social and environmental assessment^.^ After
 reviewing the available evidence, the Panel considers that the SFMPs and ESIAs
were deficientin almost all regards, fromprocessto content.



~~       ~~~



5  Ina subsequent letter to the Borrower ofNovember 2005 (discussed below), Management amplifies upon
these concerns and makes recommendations to the Borrower.


                                                                                                xxvii

 The Panel recognizes that some Project Management and Staff consistently
 attempted to press the Government to improve the planning process and to press
 the concessionaires to conform to the various guidelines for preparing SFMPs.
 However, as detailed in the sectionsbelow, the Panelfinds that Bank supervision of
 the planning and development of the SFMPs/ESIAs was inadequate in that the
 Bank's level of supervision in generaldid not match the magnitudeof the problems
 causedby poor SFMPs andESIAs.

 Consultationand Disclosureinthe Developmentof SFMPs/ESIAs

 As indicated previously, the concessionaires were given responsibility for carrying out
 consultation and negotiations with local communities, even on issues such as the use o f
 resin trees.    With respect to indigenous peoples, OD 4.20 requires their "informed
 participation" and the identification o f "local preferences through direct consultation"
 and"incorporation of indigenous knowledge intoproject approaches." The Panelnotes
 the unequal power relations between concession staff and local communities. The
 Panel finds that assignment of responsibility for consulting with the indigenous
 peoples to the concessionaires, who are planning to log the forests used by the
 indigenous peoples, led to a flawed and inadequate consultation process that was
 inconsistentwith OD 4.20.

 The inadequacy o f the consultations carried out by the concessionaires was emphasized
 in the GFA independent reviews (noted previously). The Panel also reviewed the
 concerns and tensions that arose with respect to the period for public comment on the
 draft SFMPs/ESIAs in late 2002. The Requesters identified serious concerns with this
 process, particularly with the short period o ftime made available for public review.

 Management acknowledges that it should have managed the process better while noting
 steps it took to improve the process. The Panel notes this acknowledgement. The
 Panel finds that the Bank's supervision of this process was not always consistent
with OP/BP 13.05, which require Management to assess risks to implementation,
monitor activities, identify problems, and recommend to the Borrower ways to resolve
those problems.

The ForestCover Survey

The Requesters claim that the forest cover survey carried out in2003 was inadequate and
provided a distorted picture o f forest quality and cover, which assisted proponents o f the
concession system to argue the case for continued industrial logging.6 The Panel
recognizes the limitations o f the survey (short time for the work, limited resources and
the inherent problems in carrying out such a survey). The Panel is also aware o f the
uncertainties and difficulties encountered when carrying out such a survey, because o f
numerous variables and issues related to categorizing forest and other land uses, defining


 The Requesters also claimthat the survey wrongly "purported to show that Cambodia's forest cover had
increased by more than 4 percent". The Panel's review ofthe forest cover survey didnot confirm the
Requesters' allegation, which seems to be based on a selective use o f data provided inthis document.


                                                                                                    xxviii

 boundaries and interpreting data. The Panel finds, however, that there is sufficient
 evidence to suggest that the work was not carried out to the standards that should
 be expected for such an exercise. Applying arbitrary factors to the raw data to align
 them with values that are perceivedto be "more correct'' constitutes an arbitrary
 correction that provides an inadequateestimate of this criticaldata. The Panelalso
 finds that the supervision of the forest cover survey was inadequate and did not
 complywith OP 13.05.

 Conversionof Foreststo Other LandUses

 For several decades there has been a steady reduction in forest cover throughout
 Cambodia with a shift from high forest to degraded forest and agricultural land. The
 reviews o f the SFMPs indicated that the stocks o f commercial timber in many forest
 concessions were depleted within a few years and there was little or no intention to
 manage them as sustainable enterprises. There i s also substantial anecdotal evidence that
 manyofthese concessions havebeenre-allocated as landconcessions.

It is the Panel's view that concession logging has contributed to significant
degradation of Cambodia's natural forests and has hastened the conversion of
forests to other forms of land use. In the contemporary world, land conversions are
often under scrutiny because of, among other things, concerns about social equity and
environmental impact.     It is worth noting that donor fhding is frequently used to
regularize and legitimize various aspects associated with the process. In this case the
Project played such a role, albeit not explicitly. By legitimizing concession logging the
Project became a player, even if an unwitting one, in the overall land transformation
process.

The Suspensionof ForestConcessionLoggingActivities

In December 2001, the Government issued a Prakas (a decree or law) suspending the
issuance o f any logging permit to the remaining concessionaires until the approval o f a
new forest concession management plan consistent with the laws and regulations. This
suspension o f timber harvestingwas a significant event.

The Prakas also required an inventory o f logs legally felled prior to January 2002, and
stopped the issuance o f transport permits to concessionaires unless certain conditions
were met. The Government, Bank and other donors were involved in discussions about
mechanisms to allow logs already cut to be transported to processing plants. It is the
Panel's view that the Bank's participationin these discussionswas appropriate and
consistent with policy, It could be argued, however, that proposing a system by which
harvested logs could be transported actually encouraged illegal harvesting and log
transport. The Panelfinds that supervision of the Borrower's actions related to the
log transport ban could have been better performed to ascertain whether the
Borrower implementedthe Projectwith due diligence.




                                                                                     xxix

 Monitoring

 The Panel reviewed the monitoring activities supported by the Project. Initially the
 activities o f this component were implemented under a separate project financed by
 FAO/UNDP, with the NGO Global Witness serving as the independent monitor. In
December 2002, growing tensions between Global Witness and the Government
 culminated in the dismissal o f Global Witness in this role. In November 2003, the
 commercial firm SociCtC GCnCrale de Surveillance (SGS) was appointed as independent
monitor under the FCMCPP.

The terms o f reference (TOR) for the monitor under the Project called for it to review
documents prepared by the Government with respect to actions relating to forest crimes,
and from other sources such as NGOs, civil society, villagers and media. When reports
received are in need o f urgent action, they are first subject to a "credibility check" and
then passed on to the Government's competent agency for action. The TOR called for
`tfield monitoring of Government actions and achievements", and specified that "there
will be no random checking of reported illegal actions that have not already beenpassed
on to the relevant agencyfor action." Satellite data was available to screen areas selected
on the basis o f reports received indicating illegal activities. The TOR provided that
Quarterly Progress Reports o f the monitor are subject to a Government agency
"verification review" beforepublic release.

The Panel notes the importance o f having an independent monitor, which was a stated
Project objective. The Panel is concerned, however, that the provisions of the TOR
preventing the monitor from independently initiating field investigations, and
making the release of the monitor's report subject to Government verification,
conflict with the objective stated in the PAD to have "an independent monitor to
provide a check on the accuracy of Government reporting." During the Panel's visit,
SGS confirmed that field monitoring activities are triggered only by reports received, and
then passedon to the competent Government agencies. SGS also stated that they may not
initiate independent investigations.

SGS also claimed that little illegal forest activity has gone unreported since it started its
monitoring task and that illegal logging is no longer a critical issue in Cambodia. The
Panel notes that SGS' view that the issue o f illegal logging in Cambodian forests has
been successfully tackled is not shared by other Project stakeholders. During the Panel
visits, the existence o f continuing and widespread illegal logging emerged perhaps as the
only common ground between NGOs and concessionaires.

The Panel notes that the TORS for the forest monitor contain criteria regarding the
required independence o f the monitor. The Panel observes that information about
SGS was readily available fromvarious sources at the time that SGS was appointed.
However, the Panel could not find in the Project documents an evaluation or
discussion of whether SGS fulfilled the criteria related to independence for the
independent forest monitor. The Panel finds that this is not consistent with OP
13.05.



                                                                                        xxx

 Supervision Structures

 The Project operated within a difficult and dynamic political and social environment.
 The reform process in the forest sector requires changes in many aspects o f the way in
 which forests are perceived and managed in order to meet the relevant policy objectives.
 The Project team needed to develop (or be a part of) a broad based constituency for
 change that embraced Government, donors and NGOs, supported by good management
 andfacilitation skills.

 During the inspection, a consistent picture emerged that Project management was
 perceived as having a narrow focus on concession management (and particularly the
 technical aspects) and as not seeing the big picture. This led to the unraveling o f
 relationships, with the Bank perceived as being an apologist for the concession system.
 As aresult it became a target for wide spreaddissatisfaction.

It was perceived within the Bank that Management did not handle the situation well.
Numerous Supervision Missions took place, but none effectively addressed the
underlyingissues. The multi-level nature of Management structure appears not to have
functioned effectively in engaging the skills, expertise and oversight needed for a Project
o fthis nature.

The Regionrecognizedthe existence of significant problemsand requesteda Quality
Enhancement Review. Management is to be commended for taking this step. It is
not clear, however, that the key recommendations o f the Review have been put into
place, although some progress has occurred.

Notwithstanding the difficult context within which the Project was operating, it is the
Panel's view that many of the issues raisedby the Requesters might not have arisen
if the Project had received better supervision. Supervision should have aimed at
ensuringthat the unravelingof relationshipsthat became apparent during the early
years of the Project's implementation was addressed explicitly and quickly. In
particular, supervision should have aimed at ensuring that the Project had the
capacity throughout its life to develop a broadly based constituency, embracing
donors, GovernmentandNGOs, to advanceforest sector reform.

Cancellationof Concessions

The Panel examined the claim by Bank Staff in the October 2003 Quality Enhancement
Review that among the Project's successes was the cancellation o f 4 million hectares o f
landunder concession. Inthis regard, The Panel observed that 26 concessions, covering
6.5 million hectares, were cancelled prior to the commencement o f the Project, and 13
concessions, covering 2.7 million hectares, were current as o f November 2005. The
Panel also noted claims by some observers that almost all o f the concessions that were
cancelled no longer had a significant volume o f commercial timber attractive to
concessionaires. It is the Panel's view that a naturalattrition has been taking place,




                                                                                     xxxi

 and it is arguable whether the Project played a significant role in reducing the
 number of concessions.

 Management also stated, in its Response, that the Bank did not take sides regarding
 existing investment contracts between the Borrower and private companies, and that this
 limitedthe Bank's ability to pursueoptions under the Project. As noted above, however,
 Management also attributed the significant reduction in concessions to the Project. The
 fact that the Bank i s willing to portray substantial influence on Project outcomes while
 also implying that the Bank did not seek cancellations o f concessions i s notable and
 appears to send, perhaps, mixed signals. It also raises the question o f whether Bank
 concerns regarding potential liability in tort were well-founded, or rather functioned to
 justify a more limited, modest approachto concession reform.


                                   Assessing the Project

 The Panel observes that there are at least three points o f view in assessing the World
 BankForestryProject inCambodia inimplementing the Bank's policies andprocedures.
 These emergedfrom discussions with Management and Staffandother experts.

 The first point o f view is that the Project has been a success. Inline with Bank policies,
 it intervened in the forestry sector at a critical period when there was widespread
 destruction o f forests and focused successfully on canceling forest concessions,
 significantly slowing illegal logging and obtaining the public disclosure o f the
 concessionaires' sustainable forestry management plans. Inthis view, the Project could
have beenevenmore successful inachieving the objectives o f Bank policies ifthose who
conceived and implemented it initially had been able to continue to focus on reforming
the concession system. The LIL was an appropriate instrument for providing support
quickly inthe forest sector.

The second point o f view i s that the Project was consistent initially with Bank policies,
because it resulted in the cancellation o f a significant number o f forest concessions that
did not meet criteria established pursuant to Bank policies, and because it slowed illegal
logging; but after this initial success, the focus o f the Project should have shifted to other
ways o f achieving sustainable forest management in line with the objectives o f Bank
policy. These include community forestry which, while formally within the scope o f the
Project, was not implemented.

The third point o f view i s that the Project unintentionally contributed to the continued
destruction o f the forests in part because o f its nearly exclusive focus on reforming the
concession system, and in part from a failure to comply with Bank policies and
procedures. According to this view, the Project did not result in significant cancellation
o f concessions that would otherwise have continued operations, and it appeared to
legitimize the operations o f concessionaires who had not yet drafted acceptable
sustainable forestry management plans but could tout approval for the concession process
from the World Bank. In this point o f view, the exclusive focus on reforming
concessionaires led to the neglect o f other approaches to reform in the forestry sector,


                                                                                         xxxii

 such as community forestry. Associated with this view i s the belief that the LIL was an
 inappropriate instrument for the Project, because it was used as an instrument o f
 convenience for processing the Credit quickly and for bypassing normal safeguard
 procedures, rather than as a learninginstrument for the applicationo fresults on a broader
 scale.

 The Panel finds that the World Bank's willingness to become involved in the
 forestry sector at a time when otherswould not was commendable. It recognizesthe
 dedication of Staff and the risks that they took. However, the Panel also finds that
 the third point of view has some merit. Certainly inthe design and implementation of
 the Project, the Panel detected a nearly exclusive focus on reforming forestry
 concessions, a view that this could be done effectively on a technicalbasis, and a reduced
 emphasis on compliance with safeguard policies. Thus the necessary national strategic
 policy discussion that Bank policy requirements would have triggered did not occur.
 This may have unintentionally contributed in the long run to prolonging a bad situation
 and to some degree served to legitimizethe concessions.

 The Panel finds that the LIL was not designed for the kind of forestry project for
which it was used in Cambodia, and the use of the LIL, while enabling the funds to
be disbursed quickly, facilitated Project classification as Category B and lesser
attention to Bank safeguard policies and procedures,which in the long run proved
costly.

I t i s easy to judge inhindsight, and the Panel would like to reiterate that no Project could
have produced perfect outcomes inthe extremely difficult environment inCambodia.

The Panel is particularly impressed that there may now be an important
opportunity for Bank involvement in the forestry sector with a different and more
diverse rangeof activities.

The Bank's November 2005 letter to the Government o f Cambodia is especially
noteworthy in this regard. In this letter, the Bank stated, in light o f the findings o f
independent evaluations and on the basis o f ongoing dialogue, that "concessionaire
performance is unlikely to improve and concessionaires are unlikely to meet their
contractual and legal obligations." The Bank recommended, as a result, that the
Government "take appropriate action in accordance with the rights available to it under
Cambodian law and under the concession contracts (including any right it has to
terminate these contracts) to bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs to a quick
conclusion.''      The Bank hrther urged the Government to plan for sustainable
management o f areas that will be freed from concession and to conduct an assessment o f
these areas, especially those particularly threatened by illegal logging and land grabbing.
In addition, the Bank recommended that the Government consider "expansion of
community or commune-basedforest protection and/or land titlingfor small holders."

The Panel notes the Bank's consideration of the independent evaluations and ongoing
dialogue on these matters, reflectedinthis letter, and considersthat the November 2005



                                                                                       xxxiii

letter outlined productive ways of Bank support for the forestry sector which are
consistentwith the findingsof the Panel's Report.

 Chapter 1Introduction

 A. EventsLeadingto the Investigation

         1.     On January 28, 2005, the Inspection Panel received a Request for
                Inspection, dated January 21, 2005, (the "Request") related to the
                Cambodia: Forest Concession Management and Control Pilot Project
                (FCMCPP) (the "Project"). The NGO F o m on Cambodia submitted the
                Requeston behalf o f affected local communities living in the districts o f
                Tbeng Meanchey in Preah Vihear Province; Siem Bok and Sesan in Stung
                Treng Province; and Anlong Veng inOddar MeancheyProvince, Cambodia
                (the "Requesters"). These four districts are located respectively in the
                concession areas o f the companies Chendar Plywood, Samraong Wood,
                Everbright and Pheapimex.

        2.      TheNGO Forum on Cambodia statesthat they have received"lettersfrom a
                number of villagers signed in March 2004" asking them "to represent their
                request (...).'r7  They also state that the "local community representatives
                who signed the letters have requested that their names be kept
                conjdential."8

        3.      The Request includes two signed letters from representatives o f affected
                communities and a report prepared by the NGO Global Witness for the
                affected communities at the request o f their representative, the NGO Forum
                o f Cambodia, to help them substantiate the case and the alleged violation o f
                Bankpolicies andprocedures.'

        4.      The Panel registered the Request on February 4, 2005, and notified the
                World Bank Board o f Executive Directors ("the Board") andthe President.

        5.      On March 8, 2005, Management submitted its Response to the Request for

7.   The Requesters submitted a Request for Inspection to the Panel because
    they believe that the Bank did not comply with its policies and procedures
    in the design and implementation of the Project and, as a result, that the
     forest-dependent communities affected by the Projecthave sufferedandwill
    continue to suffer harm. The Requesters claim that through a flawed design
    and poor implementation the Bank promoted the interests o f the logging
    concession companies, rather than those o f the people. They believethat the
    Bank pursued a "pro-concession agenda" despite evidence o f harm to
    forest-dependent communities causedby the logging companies.

8.  The Requesters argue that by assisting the concessionaires in producing
    forest management plans and environmental and social assessments the
    Bank used loan money to benefit logging companies with track records of,
    among other things, human rights abuses and illegal logging o f resin trees,
    which are one o f the main sources o f livelihood o f forest-dependent
    communities. According to the Requesters, the Project made no attempt to
    correct the flaws o f the concession system and increased the likelihood that
    the concessionaires would continue to operate their concessions without
    effective controls. The Requesters claim that the Bank Project strengthened
    the position o f the concessionaires because it gave them the opportunity to
    present themselves as having the seal o f approval from the World Bank and
    thusmakethemselves more immunefrom criticism.

9.  The Requesters state that during Project implementation the Bank did not
    attempt to correct the Project approach in spite o f available evidence o f
    ongoing illegal activities by the concessionaires. They claim that the Bank
    took instead an indulgent view o f these crimes and kept working to ensure
    the concessionaires' six management plans are approved. The Requesters
    also argue that Bank loan-fhded technical assistance was offered to the
    logging companies irrespective o f their past offences and based on criteria
    that these companies do not meet.

10. According to the Requesters, the above-mentioned claims involve
    noncompliance with Bank policies and procedures, including safeguards
    policies such as OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, OP/BP 4.36 on
    Forestry, OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats
    andOPN 11.03 on CulturalProperty.

11. The Requesters claim that in designing the Project, consideration o f
    environmental and social impacts was "very cursory at best and did not
    meet operational policy standards." They claim the Project was erroneously
    categorized as Byrather than A under the Bank Policy on Environmental
   Assessment, and thus no environmental assessment was carried out. In
    addition, they state that no consultations o f affected people took place
   during Project preparation, and the consultations conducted by the
   concessionaires for preparing management plans were highly inadequate.



                                                                               2

           According to the Requesters, the Project failed to consider the impacts o f
           the concession operations on the indigenous communities whose vital link
           to the forest is economical, social and cultural.

      12.  The Requestersalso believe that Management didnot comply with the Bank
           Policy on Supervision because under the Project inadequate management
           plans and environmental assessmentsprepared by the concessionaires were
           approved. They claim that the review o f the plans ignored the companies'
           bad track records and used a scoring system that did not take into
           consideration the concession's adverse impacts on forest-dependent
           communities. In addition, the Requesters claim that these plans were
           disclosed only for a 19-day consultation period, which was inadequate to
           allow the people to comment effectively on the plans.

2. ManagementResponse

      13. Management states that the Project's emphasis on gradual reform o f
          concessions was the most appropriate choice at the time the Project was
          conceived. Management contends that this choice was shared by forest
          specialists and knowledgeable observers, and built up through public
          discussions, dialogue with the Government andthe work o f other agencies.

      14. According to Management, the approach adopted in this Project was a
          responsible one and complied with Bank forest policies and practices.
          Management believes that, aside from some processing and documentation
          requirements in OP 4.01 and OD 4.20, the Bank is in compliance with all
          the policies and procedures raised inthe Request. Management also claims
          that the lack o f full compliance with some policies did not cause any harm
          or lead to potential harm to the people living in the Project areas.
          Management maintains that no full environmental assessment was carried
          out because social and environmental issues had been identified in
          background studies conducted, inter alia, under the Bank-financed
          Technical Assistance Project and considered sufficient to address these
          issues.

     15. According to the Response, when the Project was prepared the concession
          areas were already defined. The FCMCPP was designed to help Cambodia
         create a credible regulatory framework for concession operations.
         Management also claims that through the concession management planning
         framework established under the FCMCPP, the area covered by concessions
         decreased. Out o f 6.4 million hectares o f concessions, the Technical Review
         Team created under the Project recommended only six concessionaires'
         management plans (out o f the thirteen submitted), covering a total o f one
         millionhectares. to EO forward to the next Dlanninalevel.




                                                                                     3

16, Management claims that the Bank was always aware o f the issues
    surrounding the Project and, for example, played an active role in the ban
    on logging and log transport issued by the Government in 2002. The
    Response also states that the Bank made its PhnomPenh office available for
    disclosing the forest management plans, although it recognizes that the
    consultation and disclosure process could have been planned better.
    Management claims that prioritizationswere requiredand the assessment of
    social impacts was postponed to a later time when the proposed concession
    areas would be known and selection of concessionaireswould be underway.
    Forest inventory, mapping and yield calculations were considered at that
    moment more important.

17. According to Management, the Project may claim some successes, such as
    the formal adoption of guidelines and codes of practice for forest
    management, regular public reporting on forest crime, and reduction inthe
    areas under concessions. However, Management also recognizes that
    involvement o f local communities was not adequate, and that many issues,
    such as claims of forest-dependent communities on illegally cut resintrees,
    should have been addressed at an early stage o f the Project. The Response
    states that the resin trees issue emerged to a large extent during Project
    implementation and that the Bank has since supported studies to address it.
    Management also recognizes that consultations carried out by the
    concessionaires were inadequate and states that new consultation guidelines
    are under preparation.

18. With respect to the claims that the Project approved six forest management
    plans, Management asserts that the Bank never endorsed the plans nor
    recommended them for approval. Management also states that the Project
    did not finance any of the concessionaires; rather it aimed at building
    capacity within the Government.

19. The Response also contains lessons learned from this Project, taking into
    account the complexity o f the situation and systemic problems (e.g.
    corruption and lack o f transparency). The discussion highlights, among
    other things: constraints in pursuing options due to the Bank's position not
   to take sides on existing contracts between the Borrower and private
   companies; the importance o f early local community involvement; the need
   to be outspoken, including with the borrower, in the face o f significant
   problems; and the potential value o f specifying conditionalities on social
   concerns in the legal agreement. The Panel appreciates the effort by
   Management to identify lessons learned, and considers that this effort
   contributes constructively to promoting the effective design and
   implementationof developmentprojects.




                                                                              4

3. Eligibility of the Request

        20.   To determine the eligibility o f the Request and the Requesters the Panel
              reviewedthe Request for Inspection and Management Response. The Panel
              Chairperson, Professo'r Edith Brown Weiss, together with Panel member
              Tongroj Onchan and Executive Secretary Eduardo Abbott visited Cambodia
              from March 12 through March 19, 2005. During their visit, the Panel
              Members met with the signatories of the Request for Inspection and with
              over a hundred affected villagers from several communes; with the NGO
              Forum on Cambodia, Global Witness, Wildlife Conservation Society,
              Oxfam GB, and other local nongovernmental organizations; with national
              Government officials; with the DANIDA ResidentRepresentative inPhnom
              Penh; and with local Bank Management and Staff and the Country Director
              in Bangkok. The affected villagers with whom the Panel met included
              indigenous people.

       21.    The Panel determined that the Requestfulfilled the eligibility requirements
              for inspection. Because the Request and the Management Response contain
              conflicting assertions and interpretations concerning the issues, the facts,
              compliance with Bank policies and procedures, actual harm, and potential
              harm, the Panel recommended an investigation to the Board o f Executive
             Directors.

       22.    On April 14, 2005, the Board approved the Panel's recommendation to
             conduct an investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for
             Inspection. The Request, Management Response, and the Panel's Report
             and Recommendation were made public shortly after the Board authorized
             the inspection sought bythe Requesters.

4. The Investigation

       23.   The purpose o f the investigation was to establish whether the Bank
             complied with its own policies and procedures inthe design, appraisal and
             implementation o f the Project, and whether, if instances o f noncompliance
             were found, they caused, or were likely to cause, harm to the Requesters
             and the people they represent. Panel Member Tongroj Onchan served as the
             Lead Inspector for the Panel's investigation.

       24.   The Panel conducted a two-part investigation.       The first part involved
             detailed research into Bank records related to the Project, interviews with
             Bank Management and Staff, and a review o f other relevant documents.
             The second part took the form of an in-country fact-finding visit. To assist
             in its    investigation, the Panel hired three      consultants, who are
             internationally recognized experts on forestry and environmental issues and




                                                                                        5

                 Paul Taylor.l1

          25.    Panel Chairperson EdithBrown Weiss, Panel MemberTongroj Onchan, and
                 Panel Member Werner Kiene, together with Executive Secretary Eduardo
                 Abbott, Deputy Executive Secretary Peter Lallas, Operations Officer
                 Tatiana Tassoni, andtwo expert consultants visited Cambodia from October
                 20 to October 30, 2005. During the visit, the Panel met with Government
                 authorities, Bank Staff, the Requesters and other people in Project-affected
                 places, NGO representatives in Phnom Penh and in Stung Treng Province,
                 representatives o f the Cambodia Timber Industry Association (CTIA),
                 prominent citizens and other interestedparties.

          26.    The Panel interviewed Bank Management and Staff in Washington, D.C.
                 before and after visiting the Project-affected area, and inthe Bank offices in
                 Phnom Penh and Bangkok. In its investigation, the Panel identified and
                 carefully reviewed all documents relevant to the case that the Requesters,
                 Bank Staff, and other sources provided to the Panel. The Panel also
                 analyzed other evidence gathered during the field visits or otherwise in its
                 research, including scholarly literature.

          27.    This Report presents the results of the Panel's investigation regarding the
                 different sets of forestry, environmental and social issues the Requesters
                 raise intheir submission to the Panel.

5. BankOperationalPoliciesandProceduresApplicable to the Project

          28.   With respectto this Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied
                with the following applicable operational policiesandprocedures:

B. The Project
         29.    The Project has as its objectives, "to demonstrate and improve the
                effectiveness of a comprehensive set of forest management and operational
                guidelines and control procedures in forest concession areas, and to
                establish an effectiveforest crime monitoring andprevention ~apability."`~

         30.    The FCMCPP has four component^:'^

             o Component A (Forest Planning and Inventory)                     provides for the
                   preparation of `yorest concessions management plans to serve as models
                  for current andfuture concessions, including field surveys and inventory
                   (...) andpreparation of detailed annual operationalplans to givepractical
                   effect to suchforest concessionsmanagementplans."

             o Component B (Concession Regulation and Control) seeks to strengthen
                   the capacity o f Forest Management Offices "to oversee concession
                   operations and ensure that they are in compliance with the forest
                   managementand operationalplans."

             o Component C (Forest Crime Monitoring and Prevention) aims at
                   "strengthening the capacity" o f the implementingagency, the Department
                   of Forestry and Wildlife (DWF), and the Ministry o f Environment to
                   "systematically and regularly monitor illegal logging and launch effective
                  prevention activities."    This component is also aimed at supporting the
                   concessionaires, the local and national forestry and national parks offices,
                  and the affected communities to design and implement "timber theft
                  prevention plans" and disseminate the information on the Government of
                  Cambodia's `yorest crimeprevention programs."

             o Component D (Project Management and Institutional Strengthening)
                  provides for the creation o f the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the
                  "strengthening of its capacity to manage the project and be responsible
                 for procurement andJinancial management activities, and monitoring and
                  evaluation."

         3 1. Management states that the Project was modified in 2003 "to addresspost-
                concession management issues (...) in areas released from concessions,
                [where] the Government has taken preliminary steps to institute new
                management arrangements,"" though the Development Credit Agreement
                did not require any amendrnent.l6According to the Response, the RGC has

                plans for these areas. Management states that the FCMCCP, as amended,
                finances  collaboration between the Forest Administration (FA) and the
                Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in one of the post-concessions areas,

                InnovationLoan (LIL) framework. The Credit Agreement became effective
                on October 20, 2000. The closing date was originally set for December 31,
                2003, but uponrequest of the Borrower, the Credit was extendedto June 30,
                2005. The Bank also granted a second request for extension to December
                31, 2005, but only with respect to Project Component C, Forest Crime

 Chapter 2 Project Conceptand Design

 A. Forestsand Society in Cambodia
          33.     Forest resources in Cambodia play critically important roles in the
                  economy, culture and environment o f the country.2' Untilthe middle o f the
                  20thCentury forests totaled about thirteenmillion hectares, over 73 percent
                  o f the country.22However, there i s general agreement that over the decade
                  o f the 1990's tens o f millions o f cubic meters o f timber were extracted from
                 these forests, and over ten percent, more than a million hectares (ha) o f the
                  forest, were lost to def~restation.~~ 1996 it was estimated that more that
                                                            By
                  1million hectares o f deforestation had occurred and a hrther three million
                 hectares o f forest had beendegraded during the preceding 30 years.24It was
                 a decade o f intense forest degradation and destruction in Cambodia,
                 although it was by no means the only country where this kind o f thing
                 occurred.25 At present, Cambodia i s about 50 percent covered by high
                 forest; an area o froughly ninemillionha.26

 1. Forestryinthe Social, Economicand PoliticalContext

          34.    The current situation o f the forest sector in Cambodia needs to be seen in
                 the context o f a country that enduredseveral years o f repressive and bloody
                 Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, when structures were destroyed and
                 considerable social dislocation occurred. This was followed by a decade o f
                 civil war. Cambodia i s now at peace, the economy i s stabilizing, and recent
                 economic performance i s promising27 although the social and political
                 environment i s considerably still unstable. This instability significantly
                 impingeson the forest sector, as it does on other sectors.


"  Forests are muchmore important than is indicatedby the available economic statistics where the
contribution of forests and logging to GDP rangesfrom about 7 percent in 1994 to 2 percent in2002, and
the forest taxes contribution to nationalrevenuesrangesfrom about 3.5 percentinthe late 90s to 0.4
percent in2002. See "The Forest Sector inCambodia -Part I:Policy Choices, Issues and Options.

        35.    Inthe early 1990's Cambodia, and any donor intending to cooperate with
               the country, faced a classic and very intense situation o f conflict over forest
               resources: resources that were critical for the very survival o f the poorest
               rural people, including indigenous people; resources that were o f very high
               biodiversity and conservation value because o f their inherent ecology and
               unusual general lack o f disturbance; and resources that presented an
               enormous quick profit opportunityto the wealthy andpowerful.

        36.    Forests form a crucial part o f the survival strategy o f the rural poor. An
               estimated 85 percent o f the population depends on agriculture, fisheries and
               forest products.** In a country where the average annual per capita income
               i s less than USD300,29 and 90 percent o f the population i s rural, the poor
               dependon and use forests ina great variety o f ways: food from h i t s , nuts
               and mushrooms, fuel wood, resins and gums, medicines from wild plants,
               wildlife hunting for food, artisan use o f poles and wood for construction.
               The forests can also maintainclear streams, ponds and lakes for direct water
               use and fish production.

        37.    Forests are particularly important for indigenous peoples, who live in the
               more remote and isolated regions o f the country. Forests comprise their
               cultural and spiritual home, and are the basis o f their economic identity. In
               fact, one o f the core concerns expressed in the Request for Inspection
              relates to serious depletion, caused by intensified logging, o f resin-
              producing trees from which indigenous peoples and local communities
              derive a major source o f income.

        38.   Inaddition, over the last decadea largesegment o fthe forests o fCambodia
              have been quite important for the not-so-poor and even for the very rich.
              These are the commercial-timber-richforests, the rain forest dipterocarps o f
              Southeast Asia, which range from mainland Malaysia through the central
              islands of Indonesia and the Philippines. The dipterocarp forests are
              biologically very diverse, but they contain a very highvolume o f a group o f
              trees - dipterocarps, a family o f tropical trees - which are the most
              commercially valuable o f mixed high tropical forests. The dipterocarps are
              also resin-producing trees.

        39.   By the early 199O's, rich commercial forests such as those found in
              Cambodia had a very highvalue per hectare for industrial loggers, because
              o f well developed markets and processing technology and increasing
              depletion o f commercially valuable forests in neighboring countries. Up to
              that moment, Cambodia's high forests had been largely inaccessible to
              internationally supported industrial activity because o f decades o f war and
              total lack o f rural security, which ironically helped preserving them. This
              highvalue, however, has since attracted an all too vigorous timber industry

                  which has been very active for more than 40 years especially in the
                  Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. This industry typically logs a very
                  high volume (everything of value) where it operates, and moves
                  systematically through all the available forests. In general the demand for
                  the products, mostly plywood and lumber, originates in more developed
                  industrial economies so that the scale o f utilization has been huge. These
                  operations are not even close to sustainable, and large areas, even whole
                  countries, have had their commercial forests depleted over the past four
                  decades.30

 2. Economicsof IndustrialForestryand Concessions

           40.    From the time that Cambodia emerged from civil conflict in the 1980's its
                  forests were seen as important resources that could be utilized for the
                  development o f the nation. The Fifth Party Congress in 1985 identified
                  forestry as one o f four "economic spearheads" and called for rapid
                  expansion o f forest p r o d ~ c t i o n . ~ ~

          41.     Social forestry was identified as important at this time and it was noted that
                  the "...enhancement of social forestry should be encouraged as part of
                  improved agricultural extension activities. The development of small scale
                 family    or community plantations ... should be encouraged, where
                 feasible."32 However, this entreaty was largely overlooked inthe following
                  decade as the state focused on industrial forestry.

          42.    Because o f the anarchic state o f industrial logging during the mid to late
                  199O's, the major focus o f Government and key donors was on the timber
                  and conservation values of the forests.33These were seen as the priority
                 areas o f concern. Livelihood aspects and forest dependence o f various rural
                 communities, particularly in relation to management o f concessions and
                 protected areas, seemed to take a back seat.34Topics related to community
                 interests in forest management were primarily relegated to NGOs to address
                 through small-scale ilot testing o f community forestry projects, generally
                 in degraded areas?' As a result, the forest sector seemed to become
                 compartmentalized.

          43.     The timber that can be produced within timber rich forests often has
                  commercial market values that are much higher than the immediate
                  commercial values for the forest's other goods and services. For example,
                  although biodiversity may be o f immense value to society, the immediate
                  marketing opportunities for it may have very little or no value.36

          44,     Resin tree tapping does not occur universally across Cambodia, but in the
                  areas where it i s practiced it can provide a major support to rural
                  livelihoods. Studies in southern Mondulkiri Province reported that 86
                  percent o f families owned resin trees, with an average o f 77 trees per
                  far nil^.^'The income from the sale o f resin from these trees averaged USD
                  3.6 per tree per year (with a mean annual income per family ranging from
                  USD 299 to USD 377 across four villages). The total annual income from
                  resin sales across the four villages studied was USD 61,000. Clearly, a loss
                  o f all or part o f this income will have a significant impact on people's
                  livelihood.

          45*    The value "on the stump" of an average mature timber tree in Cambodia in
                 the 1990swas at least USD 50. The value converted to lumber andplywood
                 would have been USD 250 or more.                 Of course the resin value is, in
                 principle, renewable each year, while the timber value in an individual tree
                 may take 50 or more years to renew. Nevertheless, the timber value is
                 available immediately in its totality. The precise values change with time
                 andspecies and canbedebated, butthere is no question that inCambodia in
                 the 1990s the immediate market value o f the timber and the immediate
                 market value o f all the other goods and services are orders o f magnitude
                 apart.

         46.     Thus policy makers in Cambodia during the 1990's were facing some tough
                 choices, assuming they were ignoring any self-interest. The immediately
                 available commercial values o f timber could make an important and
                 desperately needed economic contribution to the country, but unsustainable
                 exploitation o f timber conflicts directly with the survival strategies o f the
                 rural poor, with the conservation o f biodiversity, and with commitments to
                 sustainable development, as discussed below. There are also cultural and
                 gender issues involved, which have been recognized as high priorities in
                 Bank policies.        Indigenous peoples o f forests have their very cultural
                 identity bound up in these eco-systems; and they seldom, if ever, work in
                 timber industries.       Women almost never work in timber extraction or
                 processing, which are the main jobs that would be created by timber


36This is at present generally the case, butnot always. For example inCosta Rica and a number ofother
countries the direct and immediate commercial value o f nature-based tourism greatly exceeds the value of
converting natural eco-systems to other commercial uses.

                industries in rural Cambodia, but they are often directly involved in
                garnering the other goods and servicesprovidedby forests.

        47.     As echoed in some of the Cambodia literature, and as extensively
                documented elsewhere, sustainable forest management i s not often found in
                practice, and the poorer the country, the rarer the occurrence.           This is
                mainly due to basic economic realities rather than to any policy failure or
                lack o f technical competence, although these latter two may compound the
                situation. Understanding the economics and policy choices surrounding
                sustainable forestry is key to the analysis o f one o f the central charges o f the
                Inspection Request: that a World Bank-hnded Project "has promoted the
                interests of the logging concession system (...) despite abundant evidence
                that the com anies have already caused harm to forest-dependent
                communities."  P*
       48.      Insimplest terms, any forest area has a measurable amount o f commercial
                timber volume, and it also has an amount of commercial volume that it is
                growing or being produced per year. Sustainable management requires, at
                the very least, that annual harvests are no greater than annual biological
                production. However, a mature forest, such as many o f those that existed in
                Cambodia in the 1990's can contain 50 to 100 times the volume o f the
                annual growth. The complete harvest o f the available volume as rapidly as
                i s feasible maximizes the internal rate o f return, the profits, to the forest
                owner and operator and directly conflicts with sustainable management and
                development. I t i s true, however, that sustainable harvesting can still be
               profitable, just not as profitable as unsustainable operations.

       49.      The above case assumes the owner has secure tenure over and access to the
                forest resource. In the case o f Cambodia in the 1 9 9 0 ' ~private sector
                                                                                    ~
               parties with interest in exploiting the forest resource will have judged that
               due to political instability, the security of the Government's tenure and
               consequently their own access to the resource was very weak. (Their
               agreements and deals would change if the Government changed.)                This
               creates even greater economic incentives to liquidate the resource as rapidly
               as possible. These realities o f sustainable/unsustainable forestry underlie
               and frame the development options available and decisions made in
               Cambodia over the past decade.

       50.     These difficulties surrounding commercial forestry sustainability certainly
               raise questions concerning the advisability o f forest concessions. What are
               the alternatives? To understandthe options available to Cambodia and its
               donor partners in the mid-90'sYit i s useful to follow the logic o f a simple
               decision tree. Cambodia became aware in the early 1990's that with a
               minimum of stability and security established in some forested parts of the
               country there was a very valuable forest resource in place (hundreds o f

                  millions if not billions of dollars of end product value as discussed above).
                  The Government decided to harvest this resource.                        A valid, though
                  questionable,      explanation was that the country needed economic
                  development andjobs above all. I t is important to note that various military
                  factions were alleged to be directly involved in and profiting from timber
                 harvesting or guarding harvesting operations. This meant that the option of
                  stopping the harvesting may not really have existed unless one were ready
                 to field militaryunits andwrest control o f forest areas.

          51.    Under the legal system in Cambodia the Government owns the forest land,
                  although prescribed access and use rights o f local and indigenous
                 communities are recognized in the regulatory frame~ork.~'There were
                 several possibilities for sustainable harvesting to be carried out on an
                 industrial scale (as opposed to local-level subsistence scale). Selling the
                 forest land to private parties would not encourage sustainable management
                 and could lead to rapid deforestation and conversion to other forms o f land
                 use.

          52.    If forests were to remain in Government hands and be harvested, the
                 alternatives were for, (i) Government to operate the harvesting itself, or
                                                the
                 (ii) kindofagreementtobemadebetweentheGovernmentandthe
                      some
                 private sector. It should be noted that even in affluent and technologically
                 advanced countries, direct Government management o f for-profit harvesting
                 i s almost never found, and was certainly not a viable option in Cambodia.
                 Public-private agreements may take many forms in their details, but they
                 fall into two basic categories: long-term permits (or concessions) to operate
                 ina certain area; or shorter term or year by year permits to harvest specific
                 volumes in smaller more clearly designated areas.40 The decision tree
                 described above i s not meant to justify, but to explain how the concession




39See Chapter 4.A.2 for policy and legal settings that define the access and use rights o f local and
indigenous communities.
40The above does not consider localcommunity involvement intimber extractionandproduction. This is
often considered an ideal possibility as the economic benefits would be shared with local communities. It is
by no means impossible, but has proved very difficult to implement. Governments are generally reluctant to
devolve authority to manage valuable natural resources to local communities. There are also technical
constraints. Industrial operations such as are common inAsia require very significant investments inheavy
equipment,highly trained engineers to manage processingtechnology, and international marketing
capability. Some communities withwell developed capacity have achieved this, but very few. It is true that
small scale technologies are available that are within the capacity o f many communities. The Partnership
Forestryproposed by the Independent Forest Sector Review o f 2004 is a version o f this concept. The rural
communities o f Cambodia o f the 1990shad been isolated for decades and deprived of education, media and
even outside contact. There is general agreement that their capacity for this kindo f operation would have
beenminimalat the time that the government made the decision to embrace the concession system as its
main form o f industrial logging. However, this is not necessarily the case at the time that the Project was
designed.


                                                                                                            14

                 decision was reached by Government in the mid to late 1 9 9 0 ' ~and                     ~ to a
                 largedegree acceptedby its donor partners.41

           53.   In neighboring countries in Asia, and indeed in many other parts of the
                 world, the presence o f highly valuable commercial forests on public land
                 has frequently led to pervasive corruption in the sector and to widespread
                 and readily apparent illegal logging.42 Amongst these many countries,
                 Cambodia must be considered one o f the most vulnerable to vertically
                 integrated corruption andto illegal logging.

          54.    It should be noted that the Project's designers also seemed to accept the
                 concession system as a given without giving serious consideration to
                 alternative approaches to harvestingthat would lead to the achievement o f
                 Cambodia's long term economic goals and conform to the Bank's forestry
                 objectives as outlined in OP 4.36. Several possibilities existed at the time
                 that could have been considered. These included various types o f
                 community and partnership forestry, as was discussed by the Independent
                 Forest Sector Review in2004. These options were beingseriously discussed
                 inthe late 1990's at thetimetheProject was beingdesigned.43

 3. History of ConcessionManagement

          55.    The Government of Cambodia decided in the early 1990's to introduce
                 private industrial forest concessions as the main instrument o f commercial
                 forest management in the country (although concession-type arrangements
                 had applied from the late 1980's). According to an Asian Development
                 Bank-funded study, instead o f creating a clear legal context for the
                 concession system, the Government superimposed it on the existing permit
                 system.44 The number o f concessions expanded rapidly to 33 by 1997.
                 During the decade of the 1990's' concessions were continually being
                 withdrawn, cancelled and/or reallocated to other entities as forest or land
                 concessions. New concessions were also given.



41Interms o frevenues, whenthe State owns the forest, as inCambodia, and it hasbeendecidedto harvest
some timber, the State should collect some money from those who harvest. This i s the "stumpage" value o f
the trees standing inthe forest, i.e., the value o f the logs, or a finishedproduct, minus the costs o f extraction
and processing, allowing for a reasonable return. Inopen, well-hnctioning systems, this often is decided by
public auction. Inrevenue systems, the government musthave someone inthe field who monitors the
quantity and types o f logs, and that report becomes the basis for payment.

        56.    There is much that is not known with any degree of certainty about when
               and how various entities came to be cancelled or assumed new names and
               beneficiaries. There are strong indications that the granting o f concessions
               was a highly political process.45Certainly, concessions were given well
               above the level ofthe DepartmentofForestry andWildlife (now the FA).

        57.    The following table summarizes the cancellations and reallocations that
               occurredbetween 1994and2005 basedon the best available information.

                                           uncontrolled and/or illegallogging activity occurred.
                                           A "collection permit" system(long inexistence) was
                                           increasingly employed to allow the sale, transport
                                           andexport oflargevolumes ofconfiscated logs
                                           producedby illicit logging. The system operated
                                           throughout muchofthe forest estate.

4. Evolutionof ForestPolicyin Cambodia

         58.     Since the 1 9 8 0 ' ~numerous regulatory instruments have been developed
                                         ~
                 with the primary aim o f regulating the timber industry and ensuring that
                 royalty payments are collected and used for national development. Limited
                 rights o f local communities to harvest forest products are also included in
                 the regulatory framework. The following paragraphs summarize the key
                 instrumentsthat havebeenenacted.

         59.     The "Forest Practice Rules of the People 's Republic of Kampuchea", Kret
                 No 35 signed 25 June 1988, was the principal forestry law preparedby the
                 People's Republic o f Kampuchea. This law remained in force until 2002
                 and hence was in existence at the time all forest concession contracts were
                 signed. It states that the forest resources in the entire country are the
                property o f the state and are under its admini~tration.~'It provides that the
                Ministryof Agriculture shall make decisions on permits for "harvesting of
                trees or the gathering of sub-productsfor familial or public uses,"51Article
                 17 o f this law prohibits the cutting o f resin trees, stating that it "shall be
                forbidden (...) tofell the trees that people have tappedfor resins"52

          60.    The "Instructions on the Implementation" of the 1988 law provides an
                 administrative determination o f what constitutes a resin tree. A resin tree i s
                 defined as having a diameter o f less than 1.20 meters, larger diameter trees
                 being considered too old to produce resin.53 This size limitation was
                 subsequentlydisregarded as complaints related to the cutting of resin trees
                 gained prominence in2000.

          61.    A sub-decree on the creation of a "National Committee to Manage and
                Execute Forest Management Policy" was passed in 1996. This committee
                was given responsibilities for        ". ..the development, research and evaluation
                 of forest policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia."54The committee had a high
                 level membership, which included the then two Prime Ministers, along with
                 senior representatives of the Council o f Ministers, and the Ministries of
                Economics and Finance, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Defense,
                Interior, Planning, Commerce, Environment, the Council of Development
                and the Department of Forestry." Clearly, forest policy was seen as an
                important national issue and one that required a dialogue across most
                sectors.

          62.   A sub-decree on "Forest Concession Management" was passed in 1999.
                The purpose of this sub-decree was to "[dlevelop a forest concession
                planning, implementation and control system which will lead to balanced,
                sustainable and technically competent management of productionforests in
                the Kingdom of Cambodia."56 The sub-decree also stated other purposes,
                including to:

                            "Ensure that concessionforest management regimes conserve and
                            protect natural biodiversity, ecosystem function and important
                           forest    services such as soil conservation and watershed
                            regulation;yy57

                            "Protect, and maintain rights of access to, thoseforest resources
                            occurring on concession areas that are o economic, subsistence
                            and spiritual value to local communities;"       sf

                            "Ensure regular consultation with, and participation by, local

                          concession management plans and the monitoring of operational
                          activities over the life of the

                          "Establish a competent forest management planning and control
                          system that will provide a context for, and encouragement to,
                          applications by the Cambodian timber industry for international
                          forest management certijkation (Le. Forest Stewardshi Council,
                          IS0 14001,ITTO and any similar certijkation system)."      !

        63.     This sub-decree was an important step forward in developing a regulatory
                framework for industrial logging. Of particular importance was the
                recognition o f the rights o f local communities to access and use forest
                resources in concession areas for economic, subsistence and spiritual value;
                and to participate (along with other relevant stakeholders) in the
                development o f concession management plans and in monitoring
                operational activities. The sub-decree also provided the regulatory
                framework for the focus o f the FCMCPP, which was under development at
                the time.

        64.     On April 26, 2001, the Director o f the Department o f Forestry and Wildlife
               wrote a letter to the Director o f Cambodia Timber Industry Association and
               the directors o f all concession forest investment companies. The letter
               called upon them to:

                          "(...) temporarily postponefelling treesfrom which thepeople are
                          currently extracting resin in theforest coups 2001 or in theforest
                          coups you are about to exploit, although you have negotiated and
                          signed a contract agreeing to give and receive afull amount of the
                          moneyfor the treesfrom which resin is extracted."

        65.    This letter draws attention to comments made by the Prime Minister on
               April 18, 2001 about complaints by local residents regarding concession
               forest companies illegally felling trees from which they extract resin.

        66.    In July 2002, a "National Forest Sector Policy'' was issued. This policy
               identified national goals for the forest sector o f environmental protection,
               biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, socio-economic development,
               and good governance.61It is stated that this set o f national goals provides
               the overall development framework for the conservation and management
               o f the country's forest resources. Among the tasks identified to achieve
               these national goals are:

                           "To recognize legally and protect the traditional rights of local
                          populations to use forest resources under the ramework of food

                          participation of ~ocalpopu~ations."~~

         67.    The July 2002 Policy was followed by a new "Forestry Law" enacted in
                August 2002. This law provided the legal framework for the new forest
                sector policy. The law applies to all forests, whether natural or planted,64
                although it excludes flooded forest^.^' Among its provisions o f direct
                relevance to this inspection are the following:

                          "This law shall be implemented to ensurefull public participation
                          in any government decision that have the potential for heavy

                          communities and forest resources of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
                          Consistent with the Cambodian code of forest management and the
                          Environment     Protection and Natural Resources Law, an

        68.     Underthis law, aPermanentForest Estate is perceivedas consisting ofthree
                categories o f forest: Production Forests (including Community Forests);

                been issued. Prakas No. 089, dated March 14, 2005, lists the resin tree
                species that cannot be cut without prior agreement of the local communities
                or permission from MAFF. A Prakas on "Forestry Revenue Systems
                Management" was issued in August 2003. A Prakas on "Procedures for
                Entitlements to Exploit Forest By-products in Productive Forest Areas
                Besides Concession Forests" was approved on July 18, 2005. The first
                article ofthis Prakas o f2005 states:

                           "This Prakas sets forth the procedures for entitlement to exploit
                          forest by-products in productive forest areas besides concession
                          forests through public bidding in order to supply for local needs
                          and exports in accordance with Article 20 of the Forest Law."71

                 The second article ofthe 2005 Prakas provides that

                          "all annual coups of productiveforests besides concession forests
                          that are declaredfor public bidding shall have technical schemes
                         for the exploitation of forest by-products which are stipulated in

                          decided by the Forest Administration." (Emphasis added.)

        70.    As well as the various laws, sub-decrees and Prakas, several important
               guidelines have been developed and issued since 1998 that have provided

                management following increasing pressure from local communities NGOs
                and donors. The legal framework supporting community forestry i s
                included in provisions in the Forestry Law (2002) and the Sub-Decree on

 5. EthnographicContext of IndigenousPeoplesandEthnicityinCambodia

          73.   The following is a brief overview o fthe ethnographic context o f indigenous
                minorities inCambodia. Annex Bprovides a broader survey of this subject.

          74.   Cambodia is unusual within Southeast Asia for its small ethnic minority
                populations, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage o f the
                p o p ~ l a t i o nO~f~Cambodia's approximately ten million inhabitants, almost
                                   .
                90 percent are ethnic Khmer. Though Cambodia's Chinese, Thai, and
                Vietnamese are ethnic minorities, and are the subject o f considerable
                literature on ethnic relations, these minorities do not fit the standard
                definitions o f indigenous populations and have not been considered as such
               in other World Bank projects. Furthermore, although the historic ethnic
               composition of Cambodia during the Angkor kingdom i s unknown, the
               dominance o f this historic Khmer kingdom within and beyond the current
               boundaries o f Cambodia has very probably entailed many centuries o f
               significant linguistic and ethnic "Khmerization" (or convergence o f other
               languages and ethnic traditions toward those o f the Khmer who were
               historically dominant inthe region).

         75.   The map below shows localities where five language families are spoken
               with names of selected languages spoken within each family. The national
               language o f Cambodia i s Central Khmer (Khmer family).

               76.    Cambodia's first postcolonial ruler, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, aimed to
                      promote national unity and to counteract the perceived economic
                      dominance of the Vietnamese and Chinese minorities by devising an ethnic
                      classification scheme in the 1960's according to which some non-Khmer
                      ethnic minorities were to be included as bona fide Khmers.76 Minority
                      groups including the Kouy who lived in the northeastern. provinces were
                      labeled "Khmer Loeu" ("upland Khmer"); the Muslim Cham who speak an
                      Austronesian language and are found inthe central area o fthe country were
                      labeled "Khmer Islam"; and Khmer-speaking ethnic Khmer living in the
                      Mekong delta but on the other side of the Vietnamese border were labeled
                      "Khmer Krom" (or "lowland Khmer"). The plain "Khmer" (without any
                      adjectival modification) were the vast majority o f (Khmer) Cambodians
                      livinginthe center andmost ofthe country.

               77.    The constitution of Cambodia says nothing about ethnic minorities.
                      However, in the organization o f Government ministries and their
                      departments, and also in several pertinent areas o f legislation or draft
                      legislation, the current Royal Government o f Cambodia does effectively

                  recognize the distinctiveness o f its ethnic minority population^.^^ Ongoing
                  efforts to develop legislation relating to Indigenous Peoples should also be
                  noted.      Particularly relevant i s Article 23 o f the Royal Cambodian
                  Government's Land Law o f 2001 ("Part 2: Immovable Property o f
                  Indigenous Communities"),           which defines "indigenous             community"
                  (literally "original ethnic minority" in Khmer) for purposes o f the
                  legislation as    "a group of people that resides in the territory of the
                  Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest ethnic, social, cultural,
                  and economic unity and who practice a traditional lifestyle, and who
                  cultivate the lands in their possession according to customary rules of
                  collectiveuse.''

         78.     Despite the lack o f recognition in the present Constitution o f indigenous
                 peoples as a special category, there is ample recognition inpast and present
                  Cambodian Government practice and legislation for the status o f some
                 ethnic populations as having a "social and cultural identity distinctfrom the
                 dominant society that makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the
                 development process" which i s the definition used in the Bank policy on
                 indigenous peoples, OD 4.20. The highland minority populations o f
                 northern and northeastern Cambodia especially (including Kouy, Kreung,
                 and others), whose indigenous status has been emphasized in the Request
                 for Inspection, have longbeenrecognized as indigenous peoples.

         79.     The cultural and distinct identity o f the populations is also evident in the
                 particular relationship they have with the forests. General ethnographies of
                 forest-dwelling Cambodian peoples refer to spirit forests, which are
                 recognized throughout Cambodia, by Khmer Buddhists as well as all
                 indigenous peoples o f Cambodia. A recent study has documented more than
                 twenty sites "considered exceptionally sacred to the Kreung" - most are
                 spirit forests but also included are a few areas within local streams. The
                 study found that while spirits are omnipresent, they are considered most
                 powerfbl in very specific areas. As a result, logging o f these areas has
                 negative impacts "not only on thephysical environment but on the spiritual
                 landscape as well." The study also noted that the Kreungthemselves "want
                 development, but not at the expense of their religion and culture" - for
                 which they consider these spirit forest areas exceptionally important.78

         80.     I t is also important to note that spirit forests have status as protected areas
                 under Bank Policy OPN 11-03 on Cultural Property, and from the Royal
                 Government o f Cambodia precedents inlegislation, including the LandLaw



77Cambodia's Ministryo f Religious Affairs formerly included a Department o f Ethnic Minorities, which in
1992developed a list o f 36 recognized ethnic minority groups totaling 309,000 persons (including
Vietnamese and Chinese, thus approximately 3.5 percent o f the then-total population of 8.9 million).

 6. Civil Society in a Post-ConflictSituation

          81. Civil society in general, and NGOs inpost-conflict Cambodia inparticular,
                  have been an important part o f Cambodia's economy, social life, and
                  system o f government since the United Nations (UNTAC)-supervised
                  elections o f 1993.

          82.    According to a 2004 study, unlike in neighboring Vietnam and Laos,
                 Cambodia's "NGO community is very free                     to design stand-alone
                 programme activities" and partnering with Government agencies is not
                 compulsoryy~.79Prior to UN supervision, Cambodia suffered severe
                 hardships and the breakdowno f Government institutions, insuch a way that
                 after UN-supervisedelections o f 1993, NGOs were very heavily involved in
                 "post-conflict reconstruction, emergency relief work, repatriation and
                 resettlement of refugees, and assisting with the implementation of basic
                 services and    infrastructure."    8o


          83.    The same Curley study also noted a large influx o f funds and resources to
                 the NGO sector for these purposes, as well as "human rights and
                 democratization programmes". In the late 199O's, the study observes, a
                 trend emerged toward "localization of NGOs to be run by Cambodian staff
                 (...)," and the growth of "a more sectoral and `issue specijic'funding
                 approach [benefiting areas such as] women and children, trafficking,
                HIV/Aids" and apparently also a decline in funding for human rights and
                 democratization. Curley presents evidence from numerous interviews about
                 the role o f NGOs infostering broader civil society (of which NGOs form a
                part), ind noted that there was growing interest among NGOs and donors in
                 developing grassroots organizations (such as "Buddhist organizations,
             ,  village development groups, irrigation committees" etc.), though NGO
                 leaders recognized the inherent conflict in providing support to grassroots
                organizations without "taking up the spacefor people to do it themselves."8`

         84.    An additional study published in August 2000 by the Cambodia
                Development Resource Institute focused especially on the effects o f
                international and multinational lender aid on the growth o f civil society as
                well as on the growth o f Cambodian Government capacity.82 While also

             noting many positive accomplishments o f international aid and o f the NGO
             sector study, the study nevertheless pointed out several negative aspects o f
             these sectors' growth within what it called Cambodia's "aid-dependent
             economy."

       85.   The study first notes that the scale of aidwithin Cambodia is so great that it
             "distorts the economy" intwo important ways:

                      First, a high proportion of Cambodia's best-educated people
                      either work for donor agencies or international [NGOs] or have
                      been assigned to donors' projects as counterparts. This raises the
                      price of educated labour and hinders the development of skill-
                      intensive production and exports. Second, donors and NGOs have
                      virtually taken over the funding of education, health care, social
                      welfare, rural development etc., while government spends most of
                      itsfunds on defence and security. In addition, donorfunding eases
                      pressure on government both to increase collection of revenue and
                      to raise the salaries of government employees because so many
                      top- and mid-level officials receive salary supplements as project
                      counterparts.
                                                                (Godfiey et al. 2000:~.i.)

       86.   Overall, the study concludes that in Cambodia's experience since 1993,
            "although some positive results have been achieved in the development of
            individual capacity, most projects in such a situation are donor-driven in
            their identijkation, design and implementation, to the detriment of
            institutional capacity development". Noting that most former counterparts
            have left Government or moved to only part-time Government work, the
            study suggests that donors must develop a strategy to deal with this
            situation or technical assistance to Government "will continue to be
            disappointing, and an escapefrom aid dependence will bepostponed."

       87.  The unique role o f civil society in Cambodia is directly relevant to the
            FCMCPP and to several issues raised in the Request for Inspection, such as
            lack o f consultations with Project-affected people and NGO-driven
            monitoring o f forest protection and forest concessionaire activities.    The
            Request itself was facilitated through the NGO Forum on Cambodia. An
            NGO served as both Government monitor and public critic on illegal
            logging issues while being a Project contractor through a UNDP/FAO
            project.

      88.  At the request o f the Government o f Cambodia, in 1995 the Bank and other
           donors (United Nation Development Programme - UNDP, and the United
           Nations Food and Agriculture Organization -FAO) reviewed selected



                                                                                       27

                 important issues affecting the forest sector in Cambodia to bring about
                 sectoral development policy reform.            Their report, the Forest Policy
                Assessment, was issued in 1996 (the "1996 Assessment"). It summarized
                 the findings and recommendations o f joint missions in Cambodia in
                November 1995.

         89.    The 1996 Assessment expressed serious concerns about the program o f the
                Government that aimed at allocating almost all the country's forests to only
                a few concessionaires, a program resting on "a level of timber exploitation
                which is likely to be unsustainable" and "unlikely to have significant impact
                on illegal logging.    " It identified the concession system as a constraint to
                sustainable and socially responsible forestry in Cambodia because
                concessionaires      appeared to       have conducted inadequate resource
                assessments and overestimated timber availability,                     thus    creating
                unsustainable demands leading to illegal logging.

         90.    The 1996 Assessment recommended, among other things, that the
                Government define a policy reform agenda to strengthen sector governance
                and organization, the incentive framework and resource mobilization. It also
               proposed that the Government: commission a review o f the legal
                obligations o f the concessionaires, and redesign the concession system;
                firmly commit to sustainable harvesting; and develop guidelines to review,
               monitor and enforce the concessionaires' management plans. The 1996
               Assessment also suggestedthat the Government hire technical assistance to
               prepare proposals for reviewing the concession system, for designing and
               implementingpilot concession system trials, and for evaluating andrevising
               forest management guidelines, resource assessments and inventory work.

        91.    InMay 1996,ajoint mission of the Bank,UNDP andFA0,83known as the
               Forest Policy Mission, prepared draft Terms o f Reference to carry out the
               studies recommended by the Forest Policy Assessment. Support for this
               technical assistance was requested under the existing Bank-financed
               Technical Assistance Project (TA Project - Credit No. 2664-KH).

        92.    During the first TA Project annual review, also in 1996, assistance to the
               Government for forest management was added as a component o f the TA
               Project.     This component supported studies on forest concession
               management, forest policy reform,84 legal counsel services, and log control
               and ~erification.~~   These studies were carried out during the time when the
               FCMCPP Project was beingconceived andplanned.

         93 4    A 1998 World Bank mission, conducted under the TA Project, reviewed
                 progress in the forestry sector and the technical studies. The mission also
                 noted the following: that field conditions in forestry had deteriorated; that
                 illegal logging had reached alarming levels; and that harvesting was
                 dominated by uncontrolled and uncoordinated issuance o f log collection
                 quotas. In addition, the mission found that, in this context, local
                 communities were routinely harassed and forestry officials even killed. It
                 added that the Government had acknowledged these issues and had
                 expresseda commitment to change.

         94.    The 1998 mission further recommended that the Government consolidate
                the results of the technical studies and establish a policy framework for
                sustainable forestry. It noted, among other things, the proposal in these
                 studies for the Government to create a forest concession management
                system.

         95.    This proposed concession system would manage the allocation o f land, the
                procedures for bidding and award o f concessions, revenue systems and
                other aspects o f forest management. The proposal envisioned that
                concessionaires would prepare management plans for approval by the then
                Department o f Forestry and Wildlife, in compliance with specific rules and
                guidelines (under preparation at the time). The mission also identified the
                possibility o f implementinga pilot Sustainable Forest Management Project
                that could be supported by a learning and innovation loan, to test the
                regulatoryproposals included inthe technical assistance studies.

         96.    In 2000, the Bank also approved a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC)
                aimed at tackling governance issues and pushing forward reforms to
                improve public resource and forestry management and enhance public
                sector managementaS6The Report and Recommendation o f the President o f
                IDA to the Executive Directors on the proposed SAC noted that conditions
                inforestry haddeteriorated considerably duringthe 1990's -with worrying
                levels o f illegal logging, revenue losses and local communities negatively
                affected by forestry operations. It also stated the need for fundamental
               reforms in the forestry sector, especially in relation to concession
               management, forest crime monitoring and forest law. The Report and
               Recommendation added that, in fulfillment o f conditions for Board
               presentation o f the proposed credit, the Government had developed and
               implemented a work program for establishing forestry crime monitoring
               capacity, reported quarterly on the forest crime monitoring to the public,
               and adopted the sub-decree on ForestryConcession Management."

        97.     The Report and Recommendation specified several forestry related
                conditions for releasing the second tranche o f the SAC. These were:
                completing a forestry concession review and taking actions based on the
                review's results to terminate non-performing contracts, where appropriate;
                requiring other concessionaires to present restructuring programs; and not
                awarding any contracts outside the scope, rules, and procedures set out in
                the Sub-Decree on forestry concession management." The Government was
                also expected to support community forestry, to adopt a related sub-decree
                andto submit a draft Forestry Law to theNationalAssembly.

        98.     According to Management Response, the SAC as well as the FCMCPP
                were part o f a series o ftools and approaches to address the serious problems
                affecting the Cambodia forestry sector. The SAC provided a means for the
                Bank to exercise leverage through conditionalities that the FCMCPP,
                because o f its small size, did not allow. However, some important
                Government commitments, such as establishing the Independent Forest
                Crime Monitoring program and disclosing the SFMPs/ESIAs prepared by
                the concessionaires, were formulated as an integral part o f the SAC
                program and the FCMCPP.

 C. ProjectFocus on ConcessionSystem

        99.     The Requesters complain that with a `yawedproject design (...) the World
               Bank has promoted the interests of the logging concession system and the
                concessionaires.y~*g    In their view, "abundant evidence" and information
                collected over a period o f five years about the concessionaires' track record
                and the harm the companies caused to forest-dependent communities was
                available before the Bank loan funding the Project was appr~ved.~'The
               Request claims that during the Project preparation and implementation
               phases the Bank did not comply with its social and environmental policies
               andprocedures, inparticular with the policies on environmental assessment,
               forestry, naturalhabitats, indigenous peoples and cultural property.g*

        100. The Requesters state that the FCMCPP "was premised on the validity of the
               existing concession system and its operators" while ignoring the flaws o f
               this system andthe "persistent and well documented`' illegal activities o fthe
                concessionaire^.^^ They state that Bank Staff confirmed intwo meetings (in
               2002 and 2004) that the World Bank's "operationalfocus" was to make the
               concession system work, at whatever operational scale this may occur.93

          101. The Requesters also quote a 1999 World Bank paper on Cambodian
                 forestry, according to which the "center piece" for the forestry sector in
                 Cambodia could be a "sustainably managed industrial concession
                 system."94According to the Request, the FCMCPP was premised on wrong
                 assumptions, that is, among others, "if the concession system disappears,
                 theproject is, on its own terms, afailure", and "successful project outcomes
                 [are linked] to the continued tenure of the incumbent concessionaires." As a
                 result, the Requesters believe that, given the "discredit"                  o f the
                 concessionaires, the Bank committed a "serious error ~fjudgment."~~

          102. Management states that "the choice of workingfor gradual reform of the
                 [concession] system was the most appropriate at the time." This strategy, it
                 adds, was "widely shared by knowledgeable observers" and "grew logically
                from the work of other agencies and was built on dialogue with the
                                    According to Management, a design alternative consisting
                 o f targeting a few concessions `tfor intensive technical assistance and
                 development as model operations" was considered but rejected because of
                 "the Bank's obligation to comply with OP 4.36 on Forestry, the risksfor the
                Bank in aligning with any particular concessionaire, and the important
                need to deal with system-wide regulatory deficiencie~."~'

          103. The Response states that the Bank's objective in Cambodia, reflected inthe
                Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), was to help build the conditions for
                sustainable development and povertyreduction. The LIL9*was conceived in
                this context, says Management, to make the regulation o f the forestry sector
                more "effective and equitable" way, but "did not seek to promote the
                existing concession                  Management Response also states that inthe
                1990s it became evident that the concession system, created by the
                Government with no Bank consultation, needed to be managed and
                controlled ina transparent and accountable way.

         104. Studies funded by ADB and the Bank-under the TA Project had identified
                the responsibilities to regulate the system and the challenges posed by it.
                However, Management states that, alone among the donors, the Bank
                decided to take up such challenges, while at the same time being aware o f
                problems such as ``conflicts of interest, capacity constraints, and thepublic
                sector's lack of familiarity with afair and well-governed system.      Y Y100

           105. In assessing the focus o f the FCMCPP, it is important to refer to the basic
                  objectives in Bank policies relating to work in the forest sector. The Bank
                  Policy on Investment Lending(Investment Lending: identification to Board
                  presentation OPiBP 10.00) states that the Bank finances projects that
                  contribute to the sustainable development of countries by helping them to
                  make the best use o f their resources, so as to fight poverty, protect the
                  environment and make the public and private sector more effective.
                  Operational Policy 4.36 Forestry (1993) states that the Bank's involvement
                  in the forestry sector aims to "reduce deforestation,                         enhance the
                  environmental contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce
                 poverty, and encourage economic development."'0' OP 4.01 requires that
                 projects proposed for Bank financing be subject to an environmental
                  assessment to "ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable,
                 and thus to improve decision making." (OP 4.01, paragraph 1.)

           106. The decisions taken regarding this Project also needto be considered within
                 the overall context o f the Bank work in the forest sector and even in other
                 areas in Cambodia. Bank Staff interviewed by the Panel clarified that in
                  1995 the Bankbegan to take an interest inthe forestry sector and considered
                 what action might be feasible to switch from a non-transparent political
                 economy o f forestry driven by private and individual interests into one that
                 involves sustainable and transparent forest management.lo3 According to
                 Bank Staff, at the time of Project identification and conception in 1999,
                 amidst the last years o f civil war, with some areas still under the control o f
                 the Khmer Rouge, concession companies reportedly carried out a string o f
                 illegal operations harmingrural populations as well as forests.

          107. In such a difficult environment, Staff stated that the Project was an attempt
                 to improve an almost unmanageable situation. This was based on the
                 perception that forest resources in Cambodia were critical for poverty
                 reduction, biodiversity conservation, economic development and revenue
                 flow to Government. A number o f other donors were also concerned, and
                 the IMF had raised the issue o f unsustainable forest exploitation as a
                 concern blocking one o f its credits to Cambodia (a highly unusual
                 occurrence at that time).

          108. The Panel, in principle, commends Management for engaging in
                 forestry-related work in Cambodia. The Panel recognizes that this
                 required the courage to be a risk taker, knowing that the work was
                 importantfor poverty reductionand development,but also likely to lead

design, and operation--including the "without project" situation--in terms o f their potential environmental
impacts".

                  to controversy and criticism. However, while recognizing the danger that
                  projects dealing with natural forests might be avoided in the future, simply
                  to avoid controversy and criticism, the Panelalso emphasizesthat in such
                  a context compliance with safeguard policies is essential, even though
                  transaction costs may be higher. It is precisely because o f the strong
                  economic incentives for unsustainable timber exploitation that the Bank has
                  an important role to play and a comparative advantage in its effort to
                  support sustainable forestry.     And in this regard donor partnership and
                  cooperation i s equally important.

           109. The Panel's investigationhas revealed, however, that, ina number o f cases,
                 compliance with Bank policies during Project design and preparation fell
                 short o fwhat the policies require, giving rise to a set o fproblems that lasted
                 throughout implementation. The sections below addresses these issues in
                 general and with specific reference to the Requesters' claims related to the
                 Bank compliance with the policies on EnvironmentalAssessment, Forestry
                 and Natural Habitats. This is followed by a review o f compliance with
                 Bankpolicies onIndigenous Peoples, CulturalPropertyandSupervision.

           110. The record indicates that the primary thrust o f the Bank's efforts in the
                 forest sector during the 1990's was focused on industrial logging. The 1996
                 Forest Policy Assessment (carried out by the Bank, FA0 and UNDP)
                 acknowledged that it      ". .focuseslargely on commercial and industrial

           111. Interestingly, there is scant mention o f the importance o f forests for local
                 development or poverty alleviation, although the Government's goal of,
                 among other things,    "...protectionof traditional users.. ..9,106i s noted. In a
                 later part o f the document a cautionary note is included that "[i]n some         .
                 countries the damage that results from neglecting local communities in
                providing access to, and control ox forest resources is being recognized
                and is leading to change."'07 The Panel notes, in hindsight, that if this
                caution had been heeded and acted upon, many o f the conflicts that arose in
                the following years mighthavebeenavoided.

          112. As already noted, the Bank carried out a series o f studies between 1997 and
                 1999, as part o f the Technical Assistance Credit, with the objective o f

                 providing "assistance to the Secretariat of the National Committee for
                 Forest Policy in the formulation of a long-term forest policy".'o8 These
                  studies provided most o f the background documentation that guided the
                  formulation o f the Project. However, as noted in the Management
                 Response, there were other studies and consultations that added to the
                 environmental and social knowledge base, and Management claims that
                 "...by the time of project appraisal, it was determined that there was
                 suficient information about the social and environmental aspects of the
                 concession management system to design a process to address these
                 aspects. O9`
         113. This analysis looks at whether Management acted consistently with Bank
                 policies, in light o f the information available at the time o f Project
                 appraisal.

         114. As noted above, OP 4.36 Forestry (1993) states that the Bank's involvement
                 in the forestry sector aims to "reduce deforestation,                   enhance the
                 environmental contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce
                 poverty, and encourage economic development."' loThe conditions outlined
                 in the 1991 Forest Sector Policy Paper for the Bank's involvement in the
                 forest sector include "[ulndertaking social, economic and environmental
                 assessments of theforests being considered for commercial utilization."`           ``
                 All of these aspects are important and all should be given attention. Best
                 practices in forestry, as encapsulated in the various Criteria and Indicators
                 for Sustainable Forest Management, similarly calls for a form o f forestry
                 practice that explicitly embraces economic, environmental and social
                 considerations.'   l2


         115. A useful indication o f the direction o f the Bank's primary focus can be
                 obtained from an analysis o f the studies carried out under the TA Project,
                 noted previously. The studies were designed primarily to provide the
                 technical background to reform the concession system. The studies
                 provided an opportunity to ensure that the relevant key aims for the Bank's
                 involvement in the forest sector, outlined in OP 4.36, were addressed
                 explicitly. The following table gives an indication o f the major focus o f the
                 studies.

116. As indicated by the table, studies on the technicaVfinancia1 aspects o f the
      concession system dominated the agenda,               and environmental and
      sociaVcultura1 aspects were given only minor consideration. The major
      emphasis on concession logging (90 percent o f all studies) relegated
      broader forest management considerations and alternative approaches to the
      margins.

117. The background studies emphasized the technical aspects o f industrial
      logging, although several studies were included to explore some aspects
     related to people-forest interactions. Arguably, if the high dependence o f
      local communities on forests for economic and cultural purposes had been
     given focused attention, povertyreductionand local economic development
     would have come more to the fore inthe national debate that was occurring
     at the time, and also received a higher profile in Project design and
     implementation.

118. It appears that the Bank failed to recognize that forests in Cambodia (as in
     many countries in the region) are contested domains, with local
     communities being one o f the key contestants. The Government has dejure
     control over forest land, but local communities claim and exercise usufruct
     rights, some o fwhich have a legalbasis, such as the rights to tap resintrees.
     Once the Government gives use rights to concession companies to access
     forest land and harvest timber, it is setting up a situation where these two
     key stakeholders, concessionaires and local communities, will contest their
     rights o f access and usage. It could be expected that conflict would emerge
     if industrial logging failed to deal adequately and equitably with the
     legitimate needs and interests o f indigenous and other local communities.
     This should have been anticipated by anyone knowledgeable about the
     topic.

119. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Fraser Thomas study warned
     o f the consequences o f focusing on industrial logging to the exclusion o f
     other aspects in 2000: "One of the major criticisms of theforestry sector is
     thatfor too long its primary focus has been the sustained supply of wood
     productsfor forest processingfacilities, and that inadequate attention has


                                                                                35

              been given to the needs of forest dependent communities, to the broad
              hydrological and soil conservation functions of forests, their conservation
              value and their broader signijicance in cultural and other   term^.""^

         120. The Management Response noted that the 1991 Forest Sector Policy Paper
              (the "1991 Forest Strategy") emphasized preservation o f intact forest areas
              and included a Bank commitment not to finance commercial logging in
              primary moist tropical forests. The Response`also notes that the broad goals
              o f the 1991 Forest Strategy were to prevent or significantly reduce
              deforestation and to stimulate plantations and creation o f additional forest
              resources.' l4

         121. The Management Response also states that the Project benefited fiom the
              insights o f the review conducted by the then Operation and Evaluation
              Department (OED) of the Bank in 1999-2000. This was about the time that
              the Project was appraised and approved by the Bank.

         122. Following this review, according to Management, the Bank carried out a
             two year analysis and consultation that led to a new forestry strategy. The
             strategy identifies three objectives for forestry work:         to harness the
             potential o f forests to reduce poverty; to integrate forests within sustainable
             economic development; and to protect vital local and global forest services
             and values. The strategy also put an emphasis on governance and forestry
             reform.

        123. The Panel notes that the Project did seek to address certain issues o f
             governance in relation to concession management and illegal logging. The
             Panelfinds, however, that the Projectdid not seem to take on other key
             aspects identified by the strategy, especially the emphasis on using the
             potential of forests to reduce poverty."115     The decision not to prioritize
             assessment o f social issues, noted in Management Response,         i s a fbrther
             reflection o f the lack o f attention given under the Project to social and
             poverty reduction issues (The question o f social assessment i s analyzed in
             more detail in Chapter 4.A. o fthis Report).

        124. The lack o f an explicit emphasis on poverty in the Project design i s
             particularly surprising given the assertion bythe Cambodian Government in
             the Letter o f Development Policy for the SAC to the World Bank President
             in 2000 that poverty in Cambodia is overwhelmingly a rural phenomenon,
             and "(...) forest resources must also be used as a means of supporting

                agriculture and rural de~elopment.""~The Letter goes on to note that "the
                Royal Government needs to develop meansfor awarding long- term forest
                 tenure rights to local communities, indigenous peoples, and other target
                groups.,,''*
          125. The Panelfinds that in the Project's focus on concessions, other aspects
                that were important to the Bank program in Cambodia and the
                Government were largely ignored or at least marginalized throughout
                the planningphase of the Project.Inthis regard, the Panelfinds that the
                Project did not give adequate attention to the vital interests of local
                communities and indigenous peoples in forest resources, and to the
                contestednatureofthe forest domain.

          126. While there may be a certain logic in narrowly focusing on improving the
                FA capacity to improve the existing concession system, it might have been
                more effective in pursuit o f Bank policy objectives to have a detailed
                assessment o f (and potentially also, support for) alternatives to the entire
                forest concession system. For example, many NGOs and publications have
                argued that resin-tapping and community forest management have been
                more effective at both long-term sustainable forest maintenance and also
                poverty reduction. In addition, by turning over to concessionaires what are
                essentially social science hnctions (social surveys, public consultation),
                rather than developing the social science capacity o f local institutions, a
                great opportunity for obtaining the Bank's stated goal o f "strengthening
                good governance through a more eflcient and accountable public
                administration" has very likelybeen missed.

          127. The Panel finds merit in the contention o f the Request for Inspection that
                the Project's association with concession management to some degree
                served to legitimize the concessions. This does not contradict the finding
                that working on sustainable forestry in some way, was well justified, and
                that such risk-taking is commended; it merely reemphasizes the need for a
                meticulous applicationo f the appropriate safeguard policies.

          128. The Panel finds that the Bank (i)biased the collection of information
                needed to design the Project towards technical and financial aspects,
                and (ii)ignoredthe importantrole of forests in Cambodia as livelihood
                and cultural assets for local and indigenous communities. The Panel
                further finds that the Bank chose to give primary emphasis in the
                Project's design to the technical and financial aspects of concession
                reform at the expense of environmental and social aspects. It thereby
                lost an opportunity to lead the debate on much needed reform in the

                   forest sector so that forests could be sustainably managed for the
                   benefit of all Cambodians.

            129. In this regard, the Panel notes that what may be referred to as "technical-
                   level" work i s important, but often not sufficient, to cause fundamental
                   change, particularly in a forest-rich, post-conflict country such as
                   Cambodia. Issues involvingtimber, illegal logging, the rights andwelfare o f
                  rural communities and indigenous peoples, andbiodiversity conservation go
                  well beyond technical considerations. In line with relevant policies, they
                  require well-informed, high-level and wide-spread political and strategic
                  consultations and negotiations. The skill sets and seniority level for
                  technical forestry and strategic political dialogue are quite different.
                  Operatingon onelevelwithout the other will oftenprovefutileandlead
                  to problems as in the present case. The Bank i s one o f few institutions
                  that can operate inan effective way on these two levels.

 2. Guidelines andProceduresfor ConcessionAreas

           130. One of the stated Project objectives i s "to demonstrate and improve the
                  effectiveness of a comprehensive set of forest management and operational
                  guidelines and controlprocedures inforest concession areas." `I9The Panel
                  notes that the above-mentioned guidelinesmust be consistent with the Bank
                  operational policies and procedures, including the Safeguards Policies
                  (Environmental Assessment, InvoluntaryResettlement, IndigenousPeoples,
                  Cultural Property, Forestry, Natural Habitats etc.).

           131. Several guidelines were developed fiom 1998 through 2001 with hnds and
                  technical support from the World Bank as well as other donors (FAO, ADB
                  etc.).I2' They were prepared to guide the sustainable forest management at
                  strategic, compartment and coupe levels.               12' They relate to "planning,

 ` I 9The 1996 Cambodia Forest Policy Assessment identifiedconcessionaires' unsustainable timber
exploitation as one o f the major problems o f the Cambodia forestry sector and recommended that the
government adopt a `brecautionary approach to logging through its evaluation processfor concession
managementplans" and monitoring o f compliance with the concession terms. Among various follow up
actions, the Report suggested that the Government develop and issue guidelines for review, monitoring and
enforcement o f forest management. Terms o fReference (TOR) for these guidelines were developed inthe
context o f ajoint B a W D P l F A O mission to Cambodia conducted inM a y 1996. The TOR requiredthe
guidelines to be environmentally sound and incompliance with accepted international practice. .According
to the TOR the guidelines were to, inter alia, reflect existing Cambodian legislation and codes, take into
account traditional and standard practices inCambodia's forestry sector, be enforceable inthe context o f
the concession agreements andnationalenvironmental legislation, promoteand facilitate participationo f
forest-based communities and be compatible with international forest practices and codes. The guidelines
were to cover, among others, forest managementplanning, harvest planning, forest use zoning and post
harvest assessmentand management.
I2O   See Chapter 2 for a comprehensive list o f these guidelines and handbooks.

                                                                                                          38

               conservation, watershed and riparian zone delineation and protection,
               reduced impact logging, access management (road design, construction,
               maintenance and de-commissioning), and forest engineering."122 They
               include the Cambodian Code of Practice for Forest Harvesting, the
               Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management (which contains a number of
               area-specific guidelines), the Social Forestry Guidelines, the Community
               Forestry Guidelines and the Forest Concession Management Planning
               Manual (Planning

        132. According to the Requesters, although the FCMCPP was intendedto reform
               concession operations, the "set of prescr@tionsyyto be applied under the
               Project "consisted less of `time-bound milestones ' than a package of
               assistance, advice and elastic guidelines." As a result, the Requesters claim,
               "the FCMCPPprovided a useful alibi" to the Government for not choosing
               "between either terminating defaulting companies or having its professed
               attempts at reform exposed as hollow and insincere.9  ,124


        133. Staff interviewed by the Panel stated that, in their view, the guidelines
               comply with Bank policies. For example, with respect to cultural property,
               Management states that the guidelines developed under the Project refer
               specifically to sacred groves, spirit forests and archeological sites.125   ~n
               supervision missions, however, the Bank itself had acknowledged some
               weaknesses in the same guidelines. Specifically, the Panel notes that the
               Project's Mid-Term Review Report states that "certain deficiencies in the
               Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management have led to a situation
               where most of theplans had the same                      The Panelalso notes
               that the GFA reports, which independently reviewed the SFMPs/ESIAs
               preparedby the concessionaires, examined these guidelines and expressed
               concerns about the adequacy o f some o f their provisions, especially with
               respect to the social ones. The GFA Report also observed that ideas for
               promoting "social accountability" amongst concessionaires at the time o f
               planningdid not go much further than the 1998 Social Forestry Guidelines,
               a document which was apparently neverproperly di~seminated.'~~

        134. In light o f the Requesters' allegation and the Panel's finding that Project
              preparation chose to give emphasis to technical aspects o f concession
              operations and set aside social and environmental considerations, the Panel
              reviewed a sample o f the guidelines. The review focused particularly on

              aspects o f concession operations.

         135. The Panel found that the guidelines provide for some measures which are
                consistent with Bank safeguard policies, including the concessionaires'
                obligations to consult appropriately on local rights to, and uses of, the
                forest, in order to avoid or negotiate compensation for traditionally used
                forest products. Also, according to these guidelines, the concessionaires
               must survey and avoid culturally and historically important sites. The
                guidelines do not,however, set up a method of confirming that local people
               have been informed o f the concessionaires' plans, nor do they set up a
               transparentlymonitored grievance procedure that allows affected people to
                dispute the characterization o f their lands, their cultural properties, and the
               value that should be placed on, or recognized for, their traditional uses of
               forest products.

         136. The Panel notes that, particularly in a situation like that o f remote parts o f
               Cambodia (and many other countries), where the power relationship
               between local forest dependent communities and industrial logging
               concessionaires is so unequal, the absence o f an effective grievance
               procedure and monitoring mechanism can be an open license for the
               suppression o f the poorest and most vulnerable populations' rights, whom
               Bankpolicieswere developed to protect.

        137. Bank Management rightly recognizes that it failed to prepare a framework
               Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (PDP) for the Project as requiredby
               OD 4.20. Similarly, the guidelines didnot requirethat an IPDP-typeplanbe
               prepared to address the concessions' impacts on affected indigenous
               peoples.

        138. In addition, Management did not ensure that the guidelines included any o f
               the requirements that would effectively constitute a resettlement or
               compensation planfor all those people who would be involuntarily deprived
               o f their traditional access to usufruct rights over resin trees, as required by
               the Bankpolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30). Inits constructive
               section on lessons learned, Management acknowledges that it could have
               dealt better with the problem o f "restriction of access to livelihood
               resources.yy128

        139. With respect to cultural property o f the forest-dependent communities, the
               Panel notes that the Project included in the guidelines a process for
               safeguarding spirit forests. However, while the guidelines require that
               archeological, religious, and historical sites be protected, they do not require
               that concessionaires involve specialists in these fields to address questions
               o f cultural property, as OPN 11.03 provides.12' The guidelines are also

   The policystates that: "Bank Stafl: (I)determine what is known about the culturalproperty aspects of

                                                                                                      40

                 inadequate for protecting these cultural properties because they provide that
                 the concessionaires, who would benefit from the logging, are in charge of
                 determining areas that should be excised from loggingoperations.

           140. The Panel is concerned that, with respect to the social aspects of the
                 concessions, certain parts of the guidelines issued under the Project do
                 not meet Bank safeguard policy requirements and do not provide an
                 adequate framework for decidingon any future forestry concessions by
                 the Government of Cambodia. Unless this situation is properly
                 remedied,the Project will not achieve one of its main objectives which
                 i s to "demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of a comprehensiveset
                of forest management and operational guidelines and control procedures
                inforest concessionareas."

 D. Choiceofthe LearningandInnovationLoanas FinancingInstrument

          141. One o f the concerns raised by the Requesters relates to the applicability of
                Bankpolicies to aproject financed througha Learningand InnovationLoan
                (LIL),as is the case of the FCMCPP. According to the Requesters, "Bank
                staff associated with the FCMCPP are evidently keen to push the idea that
                because the FCMCPP was backed by a learning and innovation loan, it was
                therefore not bound by Bank operational policies."' 30 A further question
                that arose inmeetings between the Panel and the Requesters i s whether the
                LILwas the appropriate financinginstrumentto support thisProject.

          142. LILs were established in 1997 in part to pilot operations in untested areas
                before scaling up, and to test new approaches that are attractive but risk
                Learning and hypothesis-testing are important elements o f such projects.         Ji
                According to the Bank document establishing and describing the LIL, it
                "would be used: (i) when institutional capacities need to be built up in
               preparation for a large scale program; (ii) in an uncharted but promising
                territory for which viable technical, financial, social and environmental
               solutions are not yet known; (iii) to pilot a potentially good development
                effort when the time is right and the ground has already been laid through a
                local initiative, a social assessment, other participatory exercise or another
               partner's efforts; or (iv) some combination of these conditions.9,132
               addition, "[LILs] may not be appropriate when: the policy framework is
               poor; and (ii) borrower commitment and ownership are especially
               weak."133

          143. Panel members asked during interviews with Management and Staff in
                 Washington, Bangkok and Phnom Penh about the way in which learning
                 was made explicit within the Project, and how this led to innovation. The
                 questions were generally met with puzzlement. Staff referred to the Project
                  as a "technical assistance project"-the             LIL was evidently seen as a
                 relatively quick and easy mechanism to mobilize a loan. The main aim of
                 the loan was to support a legal and regulatory program on the basis of
                 which long-term concessions were to be granted. The Panel notes that
                 this cannot easily be regarded as a learning and hypothesis-testing
                 exercise.

          144. While many things may certainly be learned about implementing
                 sustainable forestry, the Project design did not focus on overcoming the
                 major difficulties affecting forest management. The anarchic nature o f the
                 forest sector in Cambodia i s widely acknowledged, with corruption alleged
                 to be embedded at all levels o f the public sector.'34The Panel notes that the
                 Project attempted to reform the way inwhich commercial timber harvesting
                 was managed by improving the technical, social and environmental aspects
                 o f concession management, and it put a major emphasis on the technical
                 aspects at the expense o f the others.'35 The Panel observes that this was
                 bound to have only a limited impact unless the broader governance issues
                 were addressed.

          145. The Project design targeted mainly technical fixes that, given the "total
                 system failure,"'36 emphasized in the ADB-funded Fraser Thomas study,
                 were largely irrelevant. To the Panel, the PAD statement that, "[pletty and
                 large scale corruption are characteristic of theforestry sector and learning
                 is needed to discover how regulations can be made more effective in the
                face of extremely low salaries and dficult working condition^,"^^' does not
                 provide a convincingjustification for the use o f the LIL instrument. The
                 Panel finds that the elements conditioning the use of the LIL
                 instrumentdo not apply convincinglyto the Project.

          146. In addition, the Bank document establishing LILs as an instrument states
                 that a LIL may not be appropriate when the policy framework i s poor and
                 the borrower commitment and ownership are especially weak. The Panel
                 finds that these two conditions were present at the time of the design of

                the Project. This providesa further indicationofthe problems of using
                a LIL as the framework for this Project.

         147. The Panel also notes that to address issues raised under the Project, the
                Project team needed to create a broad coalition o f interests within the
                Government, donor and NGO communities to promote change. This agenda
                did not become explicit inthe way the Project team carried out its tasks. It
                focused primarily on the concession system itself, when the major problems
               were elsewhere. The Mid Term Review o f the Project in FebruaryMarch
                2003 likewise noted that "...many of the forestry sector's problems are
                deeply rooted forest
               technical   solution^."^^

         148. The Panel notes that opportunities were missedto use the LIL as an explicit
               vehicle to learn more about the context within which the Project was
               operating, and to innovatebased on the learning. The Project was narrowly
               focused and technically driven and failed to occupy the institutional space
               created by the moratorium on logging and the disengagement o f the ADB
               from the forest sector, and to advance a broader governance agenda in the
               sector.

        149. The Panelreiterates that the Project didnot directly cause the damages from
               the large scale unsustainable logging in Cambodia over the past decade.
               Indeed the Project aimed to ameliorate the extent of damage, and the Panel
               commends this intention. However, it i s arguable whether and the extent to
               which the Project had a positive impact on what actually happened in the
               field.

        150. The Panel i s aware o f the "Bank policy dialogue" conducted through the
               SAC,    which     contained conditions     on various     forestry issues.139
               Notwithstanding this, it was likely to be difficult for a Project o f this scale
               focused on the technical aspects o f forestry to have a large impact, because
               o f the prevailing political context and the high stakes and potential gains
               involved. The Panel finds that Management could have foreseen that
              this type of Project might not be effective in the present political
              context,particularly by the time of Project inceptionwhen a number of
              sector studieshadbeencarriedout.

        151. With respect to the applicability o f Bank policies to a Project financed with
              a LIL, the Panel notes that the Bank document defining LILs as financing
              instruments reads, "LILs would conform to the Bank's basic operational

 Chapter 3 EnvironmentalCompliance

A. Basisfor BankInvolvementinthe Project

        152. Drawing from the Bank policy on Forestry, OP 4.36, the Requesters state      `
                 that when there is commitment from the Government "the Bank may
                finance improvements in the planning, monitoring, and field control of
                forestry operations to maximize the capability of responsible a encies to
                 carry out the sustainable management of                the resource."'       In the
                 Requesters' view, however, not only did the Bank "go beyond this in its
                 active support of the concessionaires" but it i s also "doubtful that the
                 Cambodian Government can be considered in compliance with the criteria
                                                                                  "
                 the policy on forestry lays out to measurea Government ~ommitrnent.'~~

        153. According to the Requesters, the Government has maintained a concession
                 system where "as the FCMCPP task manager himself admitted, `land
                allocation was inappropriate, concessionaire selection was noncompetitive
                and nontransparent contracts were poorly conceived, (and) local interests
                were not considered."'43 The Requesters believe that this does not meet the
                first OP 4.36 criteria of commitment requiring the adoption of policies and
                the institutional framework to ensure conservation, sustainable use o f
                forests and active participationo f local people.`44

        154. The Requesters also claim that, at the start of the FCMCPP, the
                Government did not develop any plan to define the role of the public and
                private sectors and local people in forest management, and to promote
                sound forestry conservation, as provided in OP 4.36. They add that no
                "social, economic, and environmental assessments of the forests being
                considered for commercial use" has been undertaken, in noncompliance
                with the thirdcriterion defined inthe Bank's forestry policy.

        155. With respect to policy criterion to "set aside adequate compensatory
               preservation forests to maintain biodiversity and safeguard the interests of
               forest dwellers, specifically their rights of access to designated forest
                areas " - the Requesters allege that, although it has been met "on paper ",
                "inpractice however, concession com anies 'have consistently disregarded
               forest dwellers' rights and interests." 45 In addition, the Requesters allege,
                                                             P
                the managementplans "approved by the FCMCPP" didnot bring about any
                improvement. The fifth criterion provided in OP 4.36 requires the
                Government       to     establish    institutional capacity    to   enforce     these

                commitments. The Requesters claim that no such capacity was present at
                the start of the Project, and that, as this is indeed an objective o f the
                FCMCPP, the Project "has signallyfailed to meet" it.'46

         156. Management responds that the design o f activities slated for financing and
                the Bank's assessment of the Government commitment followed the
                "guidance of OP 4.36' and were "based on frank dialogue with the
                Government and consultation              with other      donors   and NGOS."'~~
                Management maintains that, pursuant to the 1993 Policy on Forestry, if
                there i s "sustainable and conservation-oriented forest management" the
                Bankmay provide financing.

        157. Management further states that this 1993 Policy i s based on a 1991 Bank
                paper according to which, when the commitment i s present, ``projects will
                be judged on their individual merits". On the other hand, states
                Management, if no commitment i s shown, the Bank is to restrict its
                operations to help the country achieve the conditions to obtain such
                commitment. Management immediately adds that "this is the approach the
                Bank adopted for         the FCMCPP" based on consultations with the
                Government, which gave "repeated assurances of commitment to a
                sustainable forest policy." The Bank's view then was to "convert that
                commitment to an ongoingprogram.9         ,148


        158. Management maintains that the Government: (a) developed measures to
                strengthen the control over the concessionaires' compliance with their
                obligations; (b) established a National Committee on the Organization and
                Implementation o f Forest Policy, which, although not working as expected,

               policy dialogue"; (c) committed to develop means to award long-term forest

                "mandating a `crackdown 'on illegal logging."

        159. Management also claims that, although recognizing that the Government
                has shown "uneven" progress on the reform agenda, it has "provided
                encouragement shared by the Bank and NGOs, including Global

          160, To address the Requesters' concerns, a short review o f some the existing
                conditions and knowledge available to the Bank at the time o f Project
                preparation i s helpfbl. Cambodian forests, at least in some locations, were
                highly valued in terms of hard currency as industrial raw material. The
                concession agreements had been concluded before Bank or other donor
                involvement inthe sector. Many o f the private sector partners were wealthy
                and powerful actors who had been involved in unsustainable logging in
                neighboring countries.         Some concession companies were tied to
                neighboring centrally-planned economy countries                 (countries  which
                supported the Cambodia regime in various ways).               Forestry systems in
                "open market" neighboring countries were described as notoriously corrupt,
                in that private sector actors made unofficial payments to gain access to
                valuable public resources.'51

          161. According to a 1998 World Bank paper, in Cambodia, the 1990's forest
                concession terms were negotiated behind closed doors, with no
                transparency, and with the highest levels o f Government (superior to
                anyone in the Forestry Department or Administration) directly representing
                the G~vernment.'~~addition to these concession agreements, there was
                                     In
                also considerable chaos and lack o f central Government control inthe forest
                areas. NGO programs o f observation and public disclosure indicate that
                local military chiefs were involved in logging, both with concession
                companies and without them.153The exact extent i s debated in the
                documents, but there is no disagreement that illegal logging was abundant,
                which i s the important point for this analysis.

          162. Inthe face o f these realities, one may consider the Bank OperationalPolicy
                on Forestry which states (as noted above) that "Bank involvement in the
               forestry sector aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental
               contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty, and
               encourage economic de~elopment."`~~

          163. The Bank decided to work inthe forestry sector, as discussed above, and to
               attempt to work with Government on the "concession issue." The Panel
               finds that the decision to work on the concession issue is not
               inconsistent with the objectives of OP 4.36. The Panel notes that had the
               Bank avoided the concession issue, it may have had little chance to reform a
               system that was increasing deforestation, degrading the environmental
               contributiono f forests, and aggravating rural poverty.

      164. The Bank policy on Forestry states that "The Bank does not finance
            commercial logging operations or the purchase of logging equipment for
            use in primary tropical moistforest." The Panel finds that the Bank is in
            compliance with this section of the Policy, because it did not finance
            loggingor loggingequipment.

      165. OP 4.36 provides that if logging i s being done in tropical moist forests, the
            Bank seeks "the government's commitment to move toward sustainable
            management of thoseforests (...)." The policy also notes the conditions to
            evaluate whether a Government i s committed to sustainable forest
            management. Among these are: adoption o f a legal and institutional
            framework to ensure the conservation and sustainable management o f
            forests and the participation o f local people and o f the private sector;
            adoption o f a comprehensive and environmentally sound forestry
            conservation and development plan; undertaking o f social and o f
            environmental assessments o f the forests; setting aside o f compensatory
            preservation forests for protection o f biological diversity to safeguard the
            interests o f forest dwellers; and establishment o f institutional capacity to
            implement these commitment^.'^^

      166. Inassessingthe Project under these and other provisions o f the Bankpolicy,
           the key question becomes whether the Government had made a credible
           Commitment to sustainable and conservation oriented forestry. The Panel
           believes that reasonable and neutral observers could differ in their
           conclusion.

     167. According to Management, the Government had expressedits commitment
           in numerous meetings and documents. The increase in various policy and
           other regulatory instruments (numerous Prakas, the 2005 National Forest
           Policy and 2005 Forest Law) promulgated during the past five years aimed
           at reforming and regulating the industry may also be viewed as an
           indication o f commitment to sustainable forestry. However, rampant
           unsustainable practices were occurring, and there was general belief that
           highlevelofficials andmilitarywere involved. The Panelalso notes that the
           Government could have been hlly committed to sustainability inprinciple
           andstill have beenable inpractice to halt illegal logging.

     168. The Panel finds that the Bank's view, that the Government's
           commitment to sustainability was consistent with the requirements of
           OP 4.36 when the .Project was formulated, may have been based on
           wrong assumptions. Given the rampant forest destruction and
           community abuses already occurring, the Bank should have taken
           greater pains and exercised greater caution to ensure its compliance
           with Bankforestry policy.

                                                                                      47

        169. The Panel's review o f the Project Appraisal Document and other Project
               documents indicates that these concerns were notedbut not addressed. The
               idea that the concession holders would manage community consultations or
               resource assessmentsi s a serious flaw, especially given the known fact that
               the forest concessions were exploiting a resource which rural poor people
               (including indigenous peoples) relied upon for an important part o f their
               livelihoods. The Panelfinds that the Project's design created a structure
               likely to lead to inadequate levels of local involvement, community
               consultations,and social and environmentalassessments.This does not
               comply with OP 4.36 and other Bank policies (analyzed in more detail
               below).

 B.IdentificationandProtectionof Forestsof HighEcological Value

        170. The Requesters claim that the Bank did not undertake an environmental
               assessment ahead o f the Project that might have identified forests o f high
               ecological value, inparticular the Prey Long forest. Instead, they claim, "the
              project has advised the Cambodian government to allow another 25 years
               of logging by three concessionaires (Colexim Enterprise, Everbright CIG
               Wood and Timas Resources)." The Requesters consider that the Bank has
               violated OP 4.36, by assisting and endorsing the concessionaires, thereby
               allowing them to continue logging in the same way as in the past, and by

               its degradation.
               allowing the lo ing o f a forest o fhigh ecological value and thus increasing
                              %i

       171. Management states that the "Bank has not financed logging or
               infrastructure in high ecological value   area^."'^' The Bank also financed
               studies under the Biodiversity Management and Protected Area Project
               which addressed, inter alia, the Prey Long forest. Management also states
               that the FCMCPP standards and guidelines were developed to "address
               micro-level considerations by requiring the mapping of forest use, includin
               environmentally and socially sensitive Special Management Areas.""          %
               Management adds that the 25-year forest management plans to be
               developed by the concessionaires, as well as the five-year compartment
              plans andthe annual plans "are expected to address areas of ecological and
              other values." Indeed, Management states that in 2002, when the
              Government removed from the compartment planning the requirement
              related to high ecological value forests, the Project was rated U as
              unsatisfactory. The requirementwas reinstated in2003.159

       172. OP 4.36 states that `6[i]nforests of high ecological value, the Bankfinances
              only preservation of light, nonextractive use of forest resources." OP 4.01

                  also states that a project environmental assessment "evaluates a project's
                potential environmental rish and impacts in its area of influence" and
                 compensates and mitigates for adverse environmental impacts. Importantly,
                 the policy states that, when feasible, the "Bankfavors preventive measures
                 over mitigatory or compensatory measures."

          173. One o f the most valuable forest areas o f Cambodia i s known as Prey Long.
                 It is a large forest to the west ofthe Mekong River inStungTreng Province.
                 From as early as 1975 the large block o f forest containing the Prey Lon
                 area was identified as an important area for biodiversity conservation.16$
                 More recently, it was included in a listing o f tentative natural sites for
                 World Heritage consideration for Cambodia.16' It i s one o f the few
                 remaining areas o f relatively undisturbed dense semi-evergreen lowland
                 forest in the Indo-Chinese province o f the Indo-Malayan Realm,162and has
                 potential for holding populations o f several threatened species. These forest
                 types are considered to be particularly important for wildlife habitat.163
                 Duringthe inspection, villagers living on the periphery of Prey Long forest
                 claimed to have seen tiger footprints and elephants inthe forest. They were
                 also unanimous that it contained significant areas o f spirit forest and large
                 spirit trees.

          174. The Prey Long forest is presently covered by three concessions, and is at
                risk of sustaining serious damage ifindustrial scale logging is carried out. It
                was claimed that one o f the reasons why it was not included inthe protected
                area network for Cambodia i s that senior people in the Government have
                interests insome o f the logging concessions covering the area.164

              Picture 1Prey LongForest

        175. The independent review o f the SFMPs was critical of the fact that none o f
              the concessions covering the area o f Prey Long considered it as part of a
              joint conservation network.'65 The reviewers considered that the Prey long
               area should be brought to a higher level (above that o f the concession) for
              public discussion considering national and international interests. They
              noted that the Technical Advisor in the Bank-supported Biodiversity
              Planningand Management Project commented that "the remaining lowland
              rainforests are under-represented in the present system of protected areas
              in Cambodia; a new system is beingprepared."'66

       176. Inthe view ofthe InspectionPanelthere is no doubt that the Prey Long
              forest merits consideration as a "forest of high ecological value", and
              this should havebeen obvious to Bank Staff during boththe design and
              implementation stages of the Project. An explicit acknowledgement of
              this status during the early stages o f the Project could have influenced
              discussions and debates in Phnom Penh, and in particular should have
              guided input into the SFMPs o f concessions covering the PreyLongarea.

       177. The Management Response indicated that the Bank had not financed
              logging or infrastructure in high ecological value areas (or any others).
              While this i s true in a strict sense, by not raising the Prey Long issue
              explicitly, there i s an implicit acknowledgement that logging in the Prey
              Long area may be acceptable.

        178. The Management Response stated that, during a supervision mission in
              October 2004, the Bank sought and received commitment from the FA to
              explore opportunities for landscape level conservation inthe Strung Chinit-
              Prey Long area. Specifically, the Bank agreed with the Government to use
              an ongoing review o f protected areas under the Biodiversity Management
              and Protected Areas Project to assess conservation needs inthe Prey Long
              area. However, there are no indications that the results o f these studies have
              been integrated into the thinking of the FCMCPP, the FA or the
              concessionaires preparingSFMPs.

        179. The Management Response also indicated that the guidelines developed for
              andunder the FCMCPP address micro-level considerations by requiring the
              mapping o f forest use, including environmentally and socially sensitive
              Special Management Areas. This approach is certainly needed during five
              year and annual planning, but there i s no escaping the need for planning at
              the larger strategic (landscape) level. Micro-level planning cannot
              effectively identify large areas that are o f national andor international
              significance for their ecological value.

       180. The Panel finds that while the Bank did not finance harvestingof high
             value forests, it didnot ensure that the highecological value of the Prey
             Long forest was explicitly identified in the early years of the Project
             and taken into consideration during the development of relevant
             SFMPs, as is requiredby OP4.36.

C. IdentificationandProtectionofNaturalHabitats

       181. The Requesters claim that failure to recognize forests in the concessions as
             natural habitats has resulted in the commissioning o f a poorly conceived
             Project. They also allege that the Bank has allowed the Project to produce
             outcomes that increase the probability o f severe imminent damage to
             natural habitats that are part o f Cambodia's natural heritage.

       182. According to Management the Project is in compliance with OP 4.04
             because no concessions have been issued as a result o f this Project. In
             addition, Management states that the guidelines for the SFMPs include
             various provisions ensuring identification, assessment and planning for
             critical habitats.167

       183. Most o f Cambodia's forests that have been, or could be, subject to industrial
             logging fall into the category o f natural habitats for the purpose o f OP 4.04.
            This policy calls for, inter alia, the protection, maintenance and
            rehabilitation o f natural habitats. It has an especially high standard of
            protection for "critical natural habitats", stating that "The Bank does not
            support projects that, in the Bank's opinion involve the significant

16'ManagementResponse,p. 38.


                                                                                          51

                 conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats."'68 Critical natural
                 habitats under OP 4.04 include "(. ..) areas initially recognized as protected
                 by traditional local communities (e.g. sacred groves) (...).rr169

         184. It is apparent from a perusal o f the literature and from even rudimentary
                 discussions with local communities that there are many spirit forests and
                 spirit trees in forests in their locality which are important to the cultural
                identity o f local people.'70 This is particularly the case with indigenous
                communities.

         185. Thus, there are many areas within the general forest estate that need to be
                considered as critical natural habitats. The regulatory framework developed
                in Cambodia for forest management also acknowledges the need to
                "[plrotect and maintain rights of access to thoseforest resources occurring
                on concession areas that are of economic, subsistence and spiritual value to
                local ~omrnunities.~"~~     As a consequence, the Bank's operational policies
                and Cambodia's regulatory framework contains specific provisions to
                protect natural habitats and especially critical natural habitats, and the Bank
                i s not to support projects that involve the significant conversion or
                degradation o f critical natural habitats.

 D. Needfor an EnvironmentalAssessment

        189. The Requesters claim that the Bank breached its environmental assessment
               policy (OP 4.01) regarding the classification o f the Project and failed to
                observe the policy requirements for assessing the Project's likely impacts.
               They claim that, although the PAD indicates that the environmentalimpacts
               o f the concession activities       would be assessed during Project
               implementation rather than Project preparation, no such analysis was
               carried out inthe Project's first four years o f execution. Inthe Requesters'
               view "had proper environmental assessment been carried out, it is unlikely
               that the Bank would have decided to support the activities of
               environmentally destructive

        190. Management acknowledges that no EA was prepared before appraisal, and
               that "to have complied fully with the policies, the Bank should have
               requested more explicit documentation from the Government and provided
               more extensive explanation in the PAD. Local-level consultations on the
              proposed project concept should have been held at selected concession
               locations." Nevertheless, according to Management, these instances o f
               noncompliance did not lead to any harm or potential harm to the people
               livinginthe Project area.'77

       191. Management asserts that the Project design recognized that "environmental
               and social problems existed in the management of forest concessions and
               incorporated measures to address them." In addition, according to
               Management, no specific decision to conduct an environmental assessment
               during Project preparation could be made because the locations to be
               examined for these purposes "could not be known in advance." The Project
              thus elected to adopt a "process-oriented appr~ach."'~~ approach was
                                                                          This
              to include a consultation process that incorporated environmental and social
              criteria in the forest management planning procedures to be applied in all
              concessions.17'

          192. OP 4.01, paragraph 2, states that "EA is a process whose breadth, depth,
                 and type of analysis depend upon the nature, scale and the potential
                 environmental impacts'' o f the Project. An environmental assessment must
                 evaluate the potential risks and impacts in the area o f influence o f the
                 Project; analyze Project alternatives; and prevent, minimize, mitigate or
                 compensate for negative impacts and enhance the positive ones, during
                 Project preparation andthroughout implementation.

          193. The policy clarifies also that an "EA is initiated as early as possible in
                project processing and is integrated closely with the economic, Jinancial,
                 institutional, social, and technical analyses of a proposed project." In
                 addition, various instruments are available to meet the requirements o f OP
                 4.0 1, such as "environmental impact assessment (EIA), regional or sectoral
                 EA, environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment, and environmental
                 managementplan (EMP) (...). When theproject is likely to have sectoral or
                 regional impacts, sectoral or regional EA is required."

          194. The Panel notes that one could hardly overemphasize the negative
                 effects of the loggingon a naturalhabitatof world class value and most
                importantly on very poor and vulnerable rural communities and
                indigenous people. Many moist tropical forests can be described as both
                fragile and resilient eco-systems. They can withstand, and in time recover
                from, certain kinds o f disturbances, but more serious degrees o f disturbance
                may cause damages that are irreversible for long time periods. Commercial
                tropical trees o f the kind found in Cambodia's forests normally have quite
                large crown areas. When felled without planning they can take other trees
                with them ina kind o f domino effect and destroy large areas o f vegetation.
                Unplannedskid trails, roads and logging yards crisscross forests and add to
                vegetation destruction, expose bare soil that can exceed 25 percent o f the
                area logged,'*'         and disturb streams damaging water quality and causing
                erosion.     With proliferation of vines and shrubs, forests may lose their
                original eco-system qualities and productivity for decades.                   'Research
                indicates that these levels o f disturbance seriously impact wildlife, reducing
                or removing many species because o fhabitat destruction.

         195. But even more serious than the direct effects are the further disturbances
                which logging may facilitate.               These include large and small scale
                individual clearing by developers or farmers; the use o f fire and the greatly
                increased danger o f wildfire; and newly provided access for hunting and
                furtherharvesting. These kindsof collateral damages, discussed later inthe
                report as "induced development", usually lead to irreversible changes.
                Damages to water courses and wildlife may have impacts far beyond the

      immediate area.     Where there is no interest in sustainability or future
     harvests, abandonment after harvest invites further damage as described
      above. When rural communities and indigenous people are dependent on
     the original forest resources for their livelihoods or aspectsofthem, then the
      environmental damage is compounded by further impoverishing them
     andor changing their livelihood systems.

196. The extent o f the damage to forest eco-systems that has occurred in
     Cambodia over the past two decades has not been scientifically quantified
     in the field. However, given that the sub-contractors had no training and
     that there was little or no control or accountability, it i s highly likely that the
     damage has been severe. Even without field evidence, the Bank clearly
     should have taken a precautionary position on the level o f damage that
     could be expected.

197. The Panelnotes that reduced impact logging consists of: harvestingno more
     than a certain maximum volume (which translates to a limited number o f
     trees) per hectare; careful advance planningo f roads, skid trails and yards to
     minimize their footprint; advance cutting o f vines if abundant to lower
     disturbance levels; directional felling o f trees to lessen damage to smaller
     trees.  These measures all have some cost, and the first measure can
     significantly reduce the immediate log production from a given area. These
     are the types o f measures that a sustainable forest management project
     would support and implement, and would be considered in a proper
     environmental assessment.        It is generally, although not universally,
     accepted that moist tropical forests where slopes are not too steep and soil i s
     not too saturated can recover and maintain most o f their productivity after
     carefully planned and executed selective harvesting (partial cutting where
     no clear cuts are applied).     This is the main technical field technique
     employed in sustainable, as opposed to unsustainable, forest management.
     The Panel observes that, based on the economic realities reviewed above,
     they are also precisely the measures that were ignored by the
     concessionaires duringtheir operations.

198. With respect to the "process-oriented approach" Management claims to
    have adopted, the Panel notes that, in such a dynamic situation, a process
    could be applied that was designed with explicit planning, action, reflection,
    learning and re-planning loops and subsequent feedback to Project
    management (i.e.       applying action-research and adaptive management
    approaches to implementation). However, it i s not clear what the "process-
    oriented approach" is, how it i s applied and how the results are used to
    advance knowledge and implementation. Further, there i s no mention of
    applying a "process-oriented approach" in the PID or the PAD. One i s left
    with the impression that the phrase may have been coined in hindsight,
    rather than used at the time as an explicit approach to advance the Project
    andtake advantage o fthe LILstructure.

          199. The Panelfinds that the PAD and other Project formulation documents
                 did not contain an adequate analysis of the environmental issues
                 surroundingthe Project,as is requiredby OP 4.01.

  E.EnvironmentalCategorizationof the Project

          200. According to the Requesters the Bank "erroneously categorized" the Project
                 as a "Category B" although the concession system and the concessionaires
                have "comprehensively demonstrated" that they have sensitive, diverse and
                unprecedented environmental impacts, such as de radation caused by
                industrial-scale logging or damage to watershedf81 The Requesters,
                therefore, believe that the Project should have been categorized as a
                "Category A" project because the impacts o f the concessions affect a
                "signij?cant portion of Cambodia 's forest reserve and large populations
                who inhabit or depend on it for their livelihoods" and may be considered
                "irreversible."182In addition, the Request asserts that, after the Project was
                assigned Category B, no environmental assessment was carried out to
                conform to the requirements for a Category Bproject.

          201. Management states "that the decision to classzJL this project as a "B " was
                correct and appr~priate.""~The categorization of a project depends on
                various factors, including the "nature and magnitude of its potential
                environmental impacts," and i s normally based on "expected impacts on-
                the-ground.184" According to Management, a forestry project i s typically
                classified as A when it involves plantation activities or production forestry.
                This Project was categorized as B because it supported "interventions"
                which were to strengthen the capacity o f Cambodia and forest crime
                monitoring and reporting, rather than physical works. In addition, the
                Response notes that social and environmental impacts had already been
                addressedinbackground studies.'85

       ,202. OP 4.01 and BP 4.01 require that the project Task Team, with Regional
                Environment Sector Unit's concurrence, assign proposed projects to one o f
                four categories (A, B C or FI). An "A" project "is likely to have significant
               adverse     environmental      impacts      that   are    sensitive,  diverse,   or
                unprecedented.,,. A potential impact is considered `sensitive' if it may be
               irreversible (e.g. lead to loss of a major natural habitat or raise issues
               covered by OP 4.01 Natural Habitats, [and] OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous

                  environmental impacts on humanpopulations or environmentally important
                  areas-including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats-
                  are less adverse than those of Category A projects."            Category A projects
                  require a much more extensive environmental assessment than Category B
                  projects.

           203. The Panel notes that the concession logging that occurred during Project
                  design and execution undoubtedly had significant adverse environmental
                  impacts that would be considered sensitive under OP 4.01.                While the
                  Project did not cause or directly fund this logging, the Panel observes that
                  the association of the Project with the logging through the technical
                  assistanceprovided to the Government to manage such logging sustainably-
                  also closely associated the Project with the very serious impacts o f the
                  concession system.

           204. According to OP 4.01 the nature and magnitude o f a Project's potential
                  impact determines the categorical placement. The Panel recognizes that a
                  substantial number o f technical studies on the forest concession system had
                  been carried out before the Project commenced but it is quite clear at the
                  end o f the Project that the design and implementation did not adequately
                  recognize and address the environmental and social problems existing
                  within the forest concessions. Properly categorizing the Project could have
                  brought this to light before rather than after the Project was carried out.

          205. Given the very serious potential impacts, and the close association of
                  the Project with these impacts, the Panel finds that the Project should
                 have been placed in Category A and a full EnvironmentalAssessment
                 carried out. By failing to do this, the Bank did not comply with OP
                 4.01. The Panelfinds that carefulstudy and debate by multipleparties,
                 as required for a Category A project under OP 4.01, could havehelped
                 avoid serious errors in the design and implementation of the Project.
                 This type o f assessment might have led, for example, to a greater focus on
                 alternative approaches to industrial scale logging, such as various types o f
                 community andpartnership forestry.

          206. At the same time, the Panel recognizes that overall Bank activity and
                 discussions with the Government over the past decade, incombination with
                 those o f other important donors, may have ameliorated to some extent the
                 damage to the forests and rural people in Cambodia by repeatedly raising
                 the issue with Government at multiple levels. The Panel also notes that the
                 activities o f NGOs were critical in raising the issues and providing
                 information on them for donors, including the Bank, and to Cambodia,
                 includingits Government.

Chapter 4 Social Compliance

A. Needfor a SocialAssessment

        207. With respect to the analysis o f social issues surrounding the Project, the
                Requesters believe that, perhaps due to the lack o f a proper environmental
                assessment, the Bank did not identify any concern related to indigenous
                peoples in either Project preparation or implementati~n,''~They add that
                Bank Staffdidnot give convincing reasonsas to why no social studies were
                conducted and no indigenous peoples plan prepared."'      Inthe Requesters'
                view the existence of a specific Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples implies
                that this issue "is distinct from broader questions of social impacts." They
                emphasize that Cambodia's indigenous peoples- among them the Kuoy
                people- are directly and adversely affected by logging operations because
                their livelihood and their culture "are intrinsically linked with the
                           89


        208. As noted above, Management acknowledges that no Environmental
                Assessment, which would examine a project's social impacts as well, was
                prepared before the Project was appraised. Management also believes that
                existing information about the social issues o f concession operations was
                sufficient and that the Project addressed them. According to the Response,
                the Social Forestry Guidelines for Forest Concessions, prepared by a social
                scientist o f the Bank team during Project preparation, was the foundation
                for addressing social aspects and consultation processes during the Project.
                Management adds that the Project also "builds on the previous TA Project,
                ADB supported consultations and Bank work during the identijkation
                mission" as well as "several studies done during the prior TA Project that
                addressed logging impacts on communities and for which consultations

       209. Management recognizes that the Bank was not in fbll compliance with OD
                4.20 and that, in hindsight, screening studies and a framework IPDP, and
               more discussion o f the issue, would have been more appropriate during
               Project design. The Response clarifies that "the project approach was to
               develop, together with and as part of the general consultation process,
               criteria and guidelinesfor community engagement in concession areas with
               local people, including issues such as customary use of resources,
               traditional property rights and symbolic value and religious practices
               associated with forests."'91 In the Project design, this was to lead to

                "Indigenous Peoples issues (...) embedded in the SFMPs and ESIAs
               prepared by the concessionairesyy~92

       210. Both the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and the policy on
                Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) require evaluating and assessing the social
                issues that arise inconnection with a Bank-financedproject. Paragraph 3 o f
                OP 4.01 requires that the EA takes into account, among other things, the
               natural environment, humanhealth and safety, as well as the social aspects,
               in particular involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural
               property, in "an integrated way." OD 4.20, paragraph 6, provides guidance
               to ensure that indigenous peoples receive social and economic benefits and
               do not suffer adverse impacts as a consequence o f a Bank-supported
               project. The policy recognizes that issues related to these populations may
               arise in various sectors in which the Bank works, such as agriculture, road
               construction, forestry, hydropower, mining etc. The policy adds that
               "[ilssues related to indigenous peoples are commonly identified through the
               environmental assessment or social impact assessment processes, and
               appropriate measures should be taken under environmental mitigation
               actions" (OD 4.20, paragraph 10).

       211. The Panel finds that the lack of a social assessment specific to this
               Project has had serious consequences for the ability of the Bank to
               comply with its operational policies, from the design through the
               implementationphases of the Project. The following paragraphs address
               specific problems which resulted from the lack o f a proper social
               assessment.

1.IdentificationofAffected Populationand ProjectArea

       212. The Project records and Management Response show that the Project failed
               to identify the population affected by it and to develop an IPDP for the
               affected indigenous peoples during the planningphase. The Project left the
              development o f this information to the concessionaires in their ESIAs. In
              this case, the Panel finds that a safeguard postponed is a safeguard
              denied, because by failing to identify beforehand the affected
              population, the Bank policies requiring consultation and participation
              of that populationcouldnot be properlyfollowed.

       213. In addition, aside from the question o f timing o f (or postponement of)
              consideration o f social impacts, the Terms of References (TOR) for the
              SFMPs and especially the ESIAs do not properly correspond to the
              requirements o f identifying the size and boundaries o f the impacted
              populations provided by OP 4.01 and OD 4.20,'93 no matter when they get
              done. This i s because, even if and when they are done at a level envisioned

                                                                                       59

               as acceptable by the Project, there i s no requirement in the TOR that the
               planspreparedby the concessionaires consider the secondary or cumulative
               effects o f their activities as i s required within a proper environmental or
               social assessment incompliance with OP 4.01.

       214. The Panel notes, for example, that it is extremely likely that "unplanned
               development induced by the                        whose assessment i s required by
               Bank policy, will occur with major social impacts          -potentiallychanging
               the size and spatial boundaries ofthe ProjectArea beyond the boundaries of
               the concession itself.      Such induced development can be in the form o f
               squatters following logging roads to farm, or other induced development
               along new roads, or in the form o f conversion o f forest land to plantation
               (which has been documented in many areas previously logged by
               concessionaires in Cambodia).              In addition, the potential impact of
               watershed changes as a result o f deforestation can also be felt outside the
               concession area, and add to the impacted population.

       215. The Panelfinds that even at the delayed date, the Bank focusedonly on
               the areas covered by the concessions to define the Project area. The
               Panelfinds that this ledto an overly restrictivedefinition of the Project
               Area. Each concession was considered separately without looking at
               multiplier effects and interactions between the concessions. As a result,the
               Project's social impacts were significantly understated and the Bank
               social and environmentalsafeguardsnot applied to the proper area and
               population. The Panel finds that this is not consistent with the
               applicableBankpolicies, OP 4.01 and OD 4.20.

       216. These failures have significant consequences for the Requesters and the
               local communities. Absent a means to assess the full size o f the affected
              population and the spatial boundaries o f the Project, the Project will not be
               able to measure adequately the social and environmental impacts within that
              populationor that area.

2. Impacts on Local People of IllegalLoggingof ResinTrees

       217. The Requesters claim that the concessionaires' activities are a "direct
              threat" to the people whose livelihood depends on tapping resin, because
              the trees tapped for resinare the same commercial Fade species so valuable '
               for companies in producing plywood and veneer.           95 They also claim that,
              although the "1988 Decree on Forest Practice Rules prohibited felling of
              trees that people were actively tapping for                resin" the corn anies
              "consistentlyflouted this law (...) and cut them in vast numbers9),19         66with

              impunity."'97 They cite a study according to which the harvestingrecords o f
              two concession companies include a range from 80 to 89 percent o f resin-
              producingtrees. The Requesters also state that even inthe SFMPsprepared      '
              under the Project, the concessionaires included resin trees intheir inventory
              and annual allowable cut by which companies justified their economic
              viability. According to the Requesters, the "FCMCPP has endorsed
              management plans which indicate quite clearly the intention by some
              companies to log resin trees illegally and exclude communities from areas
              offorest. ,,
                         ''*
      218. The importance o f resin harvesting for many rural Cambodians has been
              surveyed in the works o f Prom and McKenney (2003), McKenney et al.
              (2004). As Prom and McKenneypoint out, the threat o f logging concessions
             to trees tapped for resin is very severe because resin tapping makes up a
              significant portion o f the income for approximately 100,000 people in
             Cambodia.

     219 The Request for Inspectionuses this figure and compares the importance o f
             resin harvesting as a source o f employment compared to employment inthe
             logging concession (industrial logging) industry as follows: "Resin tapped
            from various species of dipterocarp tree is an economically valuable
             commodity both within Cambodia and abroad. An estimated 100,000
             Cambodians derive a portion of their incomefrom resin collection. Thisfar
             exceeds the numbers of people concessionaires can claim to be employing.
             Resin tapping is a sustainable activity that causes little or no harm to the

             con~ewation.~"
             trees that are ta ped. As such it is regarded as complementary to forest
                              f

     220. During the Panel's visit to affected areas, villagers described the severe
             hardships they had suffered when, in the past, logging concessions had cut
             their resin trees, either without any compensation or with negligible
             compensation      determined     unilaterally  by   concession     Staff   or
             representatives. Villagers also described the importance o f resin-tapping as
             a source o f cash income. This fact, as it turns out, had been graphically
             illustrated in many bbVillageTimeline" drawings o f the kind which the
             Inspection Team saw at Kasach Thmei village in Stung Treng (Figure 2).
             Such drawings express in a local, highly visual way, the same conclusions
            demonstrated in the studies noted above - that resin tapping i s an extremely
            important economic activity for the people in these communities. "Village
            Timelines" like the one shown below were developed by village "PRA
             Committees" for the "Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) Reports" o f the
            Northeast Cambodia Community Development Program, implemented by
            Partners for Development (PfD). The tapping and collecting o f resin,

221 Regarding the legal status o f usufruct rights to resin trees, the Request for
   9
    Inspection states that it is illegal to cut trees that people tap for resin under
    the 1988 Decree on Forest Practice Rules and recently under the 2002


                                                                                  62

                  Forestry Law. Management also recognizes that "at present harvesting of
                  resin trees isprohibited."




                 Picture2 ResinTrees

          222. "Ownership" and particularly the "ability to transfer title to" resin trees are
                 treated by numerous authors more as a matter o f customary tenure than o f
                 national Cambodian law. According to a 2003 study, the owner o f a resin
                 tree is considered the first person who marks the tree. Villagers recognize
                 ownership o f resin trees as private property. However, such ownership has
                 no formal legal basis. Under the 2002 Forestry Law (2002), forests are the
                 property o f the State (Article 2.B), which can grant customary user rights to
                 timber products and non-timber forest products (Article 2.C). Although
                 such rights provide less security o f tenure than owning private property
                 because the State can remove the user rights in the future, the study also
                 notes that considerable protection i s still assured for user rights (as opposed
                 to ownership) under the Forestry Law.2oo



2ooSee Prom and McKenney, 2003, p. 6. See also Forestry Law, 2002, Article 40 reads: "(A) For
communities living within or near the Permanent Forest Reserve, the State shall recognize and ensure their
customary user rights for the purpose o ftraditions, customs, religious and livelihood as defined inthis Law;
(B)The customary user rightsofa local community for timber products and NTFPsshall not require a

such sale does not threaten the sustainability o f the forest. A transport permit is required for any thirdparty
who buysNTFPs for The right to barter or sell NTFPs without a permit provided such sale does not

                                                                                                             63

         223. There are differences betweenthe customary tenure system and these legal
                 provisions regarding usufruct rights, especially since the former allows for
                 tree ownership and transfer o f ownership. Additional legal rights to resin
                 trees for indigenous groups, including the Kouy group discussed in the
                 Request for Inspection, will undoubtedly be recognized under the
                 provisions mentioned in Section 1.3 above regarding Indigenous Peoples,
                 contained within Chapter 3 Part 2 (articles 23-28) o f the Royal Cambodian
                 Government's Land Law o f 2001 ("Part 2: Immovable Property o f
                 Indigenous        Communities").    These    provisions     define       "indigenous
                 community" (literally "original ethnic minority" inKhmer") for purposes o f
                 the legislation, while postponing a precise determination on which
                 communities qualify, as follows:

                            An indigenous community is a group of people that resides in the
                            territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest
                            ethnic, social, cultural, and economic unity and who practice a
                            traditional lifestyle, and who cultivate the lands in their possession
                            according to customary rules of collectiveuse.

                            Prior to their legal status being determined under a law on
                            communities, the groups actually existing atpresent shall continue
                            to manage their community and immovable property according to
                            their traditional customs and shall be subject to the provisions of
                            this law.
                                (Royal Cambodian Government, LandLaw o f 2001, Article 23)

        224. The Kouy and many other ethnic groups meet the Bank's definition o f
                indigenous peoples. The Bank has recognized this in various other Bank-
                financed projects, as has the Royal Government o f Cambodia in various
                documents. Presumably, detailing their communal rights to immovable
                property will, inthe future, be part o f the as-yet-unfinished implementation
                steps inimplementing the 2001 Land Law legislation.

 3. Assessment of the Impactsof ConcessionOperationson the AffectedPopulation

       226. The Request describes extensive cutting of resin trees by specific
                 concession companies and the impacts of these actions on the livelihoods of
                 forest-dependent communities.201 Management states that "[plrior to the
                Request, the Bank was not informed about the cited logging and claims o
                harm and has not had an opportunity to investigate" (emphasis added).2         i
                Management claims that only during project implementation has the issue
                o f resin trees emerged in its "@lle ~ t e n t . "However, the Response also
                                                                   ~ ~ ~
                reiterates that the "Bank has notfinanced any logging and is not responsible
               for    damages that may be the result of               third parties, including
                concessionaires, pards, military forces or others acting in violation of
                Cambodian law." O4

       227. Management recognizes in its Response that tapping resin is an important
                source of income for rural Cambodians, that industrial forestry can be in
                "direct conflict with resin utilization" and that, as a result, "careful planning
                to exclude trees usedfor resinfrom the harvesting program" is required.205
                With respect to the forest management plans, Management states that the
                inclusion o f standing trees in the forest inventory does not determine the
               harvesting strategy. Management claims that concessionaires "plan their

                   environmental impacts of a proposed project and develo                           appropriate

                  nearby areas of Southeast Asia should indicate that there was widespread
                  knowledge about the economic importance o fresin tapping for communities
                  living in and near Cambodia's forests.208A broader survey of traditional

                  resin tapping and use as reported in historical, archeological, and
                  ethnographic literature (including historical references from ancient writers
                  such as Herodotus, Theophrastus, and Pliny the Elder, up through numerous
                  contemporary ethnographic accounts) is provided in Gianno's study o f
                  Semelai Culture and Resin Technology (1990:8-11 and bibliography, p.

           230. Most anthropologists and social foresters working in mainland Southeast
                  Asia would be surprised by Management's claim, in its Response, that it
                  was not informed about complaints of harms from cutting o f resin trees by
                  concessi~naires,~~~since this is a major issue for forest dependent
                  communities in many parts o f Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the tapping o f
                  resin is such an important part o f life in communities located near forests
                  that, if it is true that Management was unaware of the seriousness of the
                  resin tree issue and the claims in areas o f the concessions, it indicates a
                  considerable failure of public consultation and input into the design o f the
                  Project - in addition to a lack of awareness of standard ethnographic
                  literature on the region.

          231. The Panel has assembled numerous sources o f information from the Royal
                 Cambodian Government, local NGOs, and the Bank's own documents and
                 reports, to indicate that Bank Management was frequently made aware o f
                 the potential and alleged harm to local communities due to the cutting of
                 resintrees.

          232. For example, the Bank's "Social forestry guidelinesfor forest concessions"
                 (1999) notes on page 3 that social issues have received very little attention
                 inCambodia's forest concession system.The guidelines also statethat:

                            Toncessions have been established with little or no regard to
                            local settlement and land usepatterns (...). Concessionsfrequently
                            initiate operations under the assumption that they can plan and
                           conduct timber extraction across the concession area. Again, little
                           or no attention is given to local people. Consequently, soon after
                           operations start, conflicts develop as gum-tapping trees are cut,
                           spiritual forests are disturbed and concessionaires curtail access
                           to theforest to localpeople."

          233. In addition, the Bank organized a "Cambodia Forestry Consultation
                 Workshop" in Phnom Penh on Nov 21, 2003 (well before the Request for
                 Inspection was lodged). The report on the workshop contained a World
                 BankBriefingPaper as anannex. The Report states, inpage 13, that:



thing wherever met with, except that it is sometimes thicker and sometimes thinner as it lies in the big cuts
that the tappers make in the tree trunks."
209ManagementResponse, p. 53, notedabove (referringto complaints cited inthe Request).


                                                                                                           67

              "The recently approved Sub-Decree on Community Forestry ought
              to enable the Forest Administration to strengthen the quality of its
              engagement with local communities onforestly issues and should
              go along with stronger efforts to manage conflicts between
              commercial forest      users and other       demands     (e.g. resin
              collection)."

234. Many documents from the Royal Government o f Cambodia relating to the
     Forestry Sector also make clear that the rights o f resin tappers are a major
     concern. Complaints forwarded to the Ministryo f Agriculture, Forestry, and
     Fisheries with copies to the complainants, which were in turn received by
    NGOs and (according to representatives of those NGOs) provided to Bank
     Staffby the same NGOs, testify to the fact that this issue was well known.

235. Among these, for example, are the following:

    o The Ministry o f Agriculture's Guidelines on Implementation o f the
        Forestry Law, including "Instructions on Implementation of Kret chbab
        number 35 krar char", signed 25 June 1988 on the management o f the
        forestry sector; see Section 3.3 "About cutting trees which villagers have

       concession or in the forest reserved for exploitation, even ifyou have
       negotiated and signed an agreement on suitable compensation for
       cutting resin trees." This letter notes that the companies who receive it
       are preparing "new forest concession plans in which a Social and
       Environmental Impact Assessment should be incorporated." It then
       states, "Permission to resume the cutting of resin trees can be discussed
       after you havefinished andpresented the results of the above study."

                     directors (...)."



          236. In addition to correspondence from Government officials, there were also
                  popular articles published in the Phnom Penh Post about communities
                  deprived o f their economic basis in resin-tapping by logging o f resin-
                  producing trees, including one published by Stephen O'Connell and Bou
                  Saroeun, a Staffmember, inMay 2000.2'0

          237. There were also numerous reports o f NGOs, including Global Witness,
                 which were sent to the Bank. These include the Global Witness Forest
                  Crime Report for Sandan District, Kompong Thom, dated July 30, 2000,
                 which documented the murder o f a resin collector as well as current illegal
                 logging activities beingcarried out by concessionaires and others, providing
                 detailed GPS coordinates and witness accounts. In addition, the Global
                 Witness Independent Monitoring and Verification report o f Oct. 2000,
                 entitled "Forest Crime Monitoring and Reporting Project CMB/99/AO4
                 (UNTS/CMP/OO l/DFI)," states:

                          Much of the information gathered by Global Witnessrelates to the
                          illegal logging activities and intimidation of          villagers by
                          concessionaires in 1997. However, Colexim employees have
                          recently told villagers that the concessionaires intend to resume
                          cutting of resin trees and the villagers are, following the alleged
                          murder of a,resin collector in 1997 by one of Colexim's security

238. The evidence indicates that, even though the quality o f consultations was
     poor overall, Bank Staff knew about the harm causedby previous examples
     o f unlawful cutting o f resin trees, and were aware o f "claims o f harm" from
     this source. Undoubtedly such past history o f activity by logging
     concessionaires i s one reason for strong local opposition to the forest
     concession system.

239. The Panel notes that not only that the Bank shouZd have been aware o f the
     importance o f resin tapping to forest dependent communities, and the harm
     that illegal cutting o f resins was doing to those communities, but also that
     the Bankwas aware ofthese issues.

240. Management Response notes that such past activities o f concessionaires
     cannot be considered a failure o f Management to comply with Bank policy,
     since they were carried out prior to, or at least not as part o f or within the
     scope of, the FCMCPP. Management also noted that the guidelines for the
     development o f SFMPs and ESIAsby concessionaires include requirements
     for surveying local community uses o f forest products.

241. Inthe present case, however, in the critical early stages o f the Project, the
    Bank failed to consider or investigate complaints about illegal logging of
    resin trees on the part o f concessionaires covered by the Project, and the
    associated harms to the local people. The Panel finds that the illegal
    logging of resin trees has had major negative consequences on the



                                                                                  70

                Requesters and the local people. The Panel further finds that the
                Bank's failure to consider and investigate these problems does not
                complywith OP 4.01 andOP 4.36.

        242. In addition, the Bank failed to carry out a carefbl assessment or inventory
               that might quantify resin-trees, other timber and non-timber forest products
               traditionally usedby indigenous peoples and others. The Panel finds that
               such an assessment or inventory should have been part of a proper
               environmental assessment, and should have been the subject of a
               participatory survey and inventory at an early stage of the Project.
               The failure to do so does not comply with OP 4.01.

        243. The Panel also notes that the system to review concession plans, described
               later in this Report, failed to have a policy disqualifying concessionaires
               who were engaged in illegal logging o f resin or other trees. This seems to
               constitute a flaw in the design which is inconsistent with the general spirit
               o f the Bank's Forest Policy. Inthis sense, the Project missed an important
               opportunity to help reduce the potential incentive for illegal logging o fresin
               trees and'to resolve the basic conflict between resin-dependent communities
               and industrial loggers.      This is of particular concern given that the
               traditional tapping o f resin trees has been shown to be a long-term
               sustainable use o f forests, which also contributes to poverty alleviation, one
               o f the primary aims o f O.P. 4.36.

B. Consultationwith Affected PeopleduringProjectpreparation

       244. The Requesters claim that "it is not clear what consultation, ifany, took
              place before theproject began,    " while they believe that it "is certain that
               the project-affected groups who are requesting an Inspection Panel
               investigation, were not amon st those invited to participate in any pre-
              project consultation process.""     The Requesters also raise several issues
               with respect to the consultations with affected communities carried out by
               the concessionaires for the preparation o f the SFMPs/ESIAs. This Report
               addresses these latter claims in Chapter 5, Project Implementation and
               Supervision, Review o f the SFMPdESIAs.

       245. Management states that consultations specific to the environmental
              assessment were not carried out because no EA was prepared prior to the
              Bank's approval of the LIL.Inaddition, the Project Information Document
              (PID) "did not record the type of environmental impacts, make note of the
              type of EA or EA instruments needed or of a proposed consultation
              schedule". While stating that "local-level consultations on the proposed
              project concept should have been held at selected concession locations"
              Management recognizes that the Bank didnot comply fully with OP 4.01.2''

                                                                                           71

               However, Management also claims that the Project "builds on the previous
               TA Project, ADB sup orted consultations and Bank work during the
               identijcation mission"  P14,on consultations which were conducted during
               the ADB-funded Fraser Thomas study on community forestry, and on
               consultations related to studies on logging impacts on communities done
               before the TA Project.

         246. According to Management, in 1998 the Bank also held consultations with
               conservation and social NGOs to assist the Government in preparing
               forestry regulations, guidelines and codes, and in 1999 it discussed the
               Project with Government, industries and NGOs before the Loan approval at
               a workshop on forest ~ertification.~'~Management states that this
               "consultation process led to a set of criteria and guidelines for sustainable
               production/concession forest management, speciJically including ongoing
               consultations,    working    relations    between     concessionaires    and
               communities/people, andprotecting the rights of communities/people."

         247. Management also recognizes that the "quality of some consultations may
               have been affected by the presence of higher level government ofjcials,
               especially forest oficials"  but believes that "by the time of project
               appraisal, it was determined that there was suficient information about the
               social and environmental aspects of the concession management system to
               design aprocess to address these aspects."216

         248. As already noted, Management claims that the Project adopted a "process-
               oriented approach," "backed by a consultativeprocess," according to which
               environmental    and social criteria would be incorporated in the
               ESIAs/SFMPs preparedby the concessionaires for each concession.

         249. OP 4.01contains requirements for consultations with affected communities
               and specifies that affected people and local NGOs should be consulted
               during the EA process about the project's environmental impacts and their
               views should be taken into account. The policy calls for meaningful
               consultations which may occur only when people receive relevant material
               about the project ina timely manner before consultations take place and ina
              language and form understandable and accessible to those consulted.

         250. Inaddition, OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples states that Bank policy requires
              informed participation o f the indigenous peoples themselves. Thus,
              "identijjing local preferences through direct consultation, incorporation of
              indigenous knowledge into project approaches, and appropriate early use
              of experienced specialists are core activities for any project that affects
              indigenous peoples and their rights to natural and economic resources." OP

     4.04 expects that the views, roles and rights o f local communities and
     NGOs, affected by the Bank-financed project involving naturalhabitats, are
     taken into account so that the affected people may participate in planning
     designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating such projects.

251 Duringthe Panel's visit to Project-affected areas, Project-affected villagers
     personally confirmed to the Panel that they had never been involved in any
     pre-project consultation process, nor (inmost cases) any subsequent forms
     o f consultation.

252. The Panel notes that surveys and consultations specific to the proposed
    design o f this Project should have been undertaken, or a detailed
    examination o f prior surveys and consultations as they relate specifically to
    the proposed design of this Project should have been presented to show in
    detail why m h e r consultations and sui-veys were unnecessary at this stage.
    It is unlikely that the latter could be done, since the Bank admits in
    Management Response (and in fact uses as justification for the "process
    oriented approach") that "SpeciJicplanning decisions to be made at each
    location could not be known in advance." Yet it is always at specific
    locations that problems arise, and it was to prevent that outcome that the
    social safeguard policies (including requirements for surveys and
    assessmentsearly inthe process) were devised.




                                                                              73

        253. The Panel regards as a flaw in the design o f the Project and a flaw in the
               timing of the consultations, rather than a "specific planning decision", the
               failure to carry out surveys and assessments early in the process, to
               postpone them to a later phase when concessionaires were expected to
               follow guidelines developed by the Project. The Panel finds that the
               Bank's decision to postpone an active social assessment and
               consultation procedure until the preparation of the ESIAs by
               concessionairesis not consistentwith Bank policies, includingOP 4.01,
               OP 4.04 and OD 4.20, which require early consultationsand/or surveys
               in the preparationphase.*l' Inmaking this finding, the Panel recognizes
               the challenges in carrying out consultations inthis early phase, taking into
               consideration the context at the time.

        254. The question o f adequacy o f consultations during the design and
               preparation phases also relates closely also to the requirement in OP 4.01
               that the Project's environmental assessment should have considered
               alternatives; and to the requirement in OD 4.20 that projects affecting the
               subsistence base o f indigenous peoples should look carefully for ways to
               avoid this outcome in the design o f the Project. All these examples o f
               seeking alternatives inthe design o f this Project could have benefited from
               consultations with the local population - since all these policies recognize
               that severe disruptions can occur unless alternatives are examined. Thus
               early consultations with these alternative potential designs in mind are
               comparable (inthe social realm) to early studies o f siting for a dam, or other
              preparatory design studies o f dam safety, in the realm o f physical
              engineering. Within the social sphere, the effect o f postponing such
              consultations and surveys until after the general design o f the concession
              system has been finished, and concession boundaries drawn and allocated,
              i s like decidingto postpone the studies o f where a dam should be located, or
              how it can safely be designed, untilafter that dam has already been built.

       255. The Panel recognizes the challenges in carrying out consultations in the
              early phases, taking into consideration the political and social context in
              Cambodia at the time (reviewed earlier in this Report). This does not,
              however, diminish the importance and need for doing so. The failure to
              meet the provisions o fBankpolicies on consultations had significant effects
              on the path o f this Project. Consultationwith those affected by an action i s
              critical to understanding potential impacts and identifying alternatives
              duringProject design andimplementationto reduce andavoid such impacts.
              Inthepresentsituation, the Panelfindsthat the lackofearly consultation

 C.IndigenousPeoplesDevelopmentPlan

           256. As noted above, the Requesters complain that although Cambodian
                  indigenous peoples are affected by the logging concessionaires, the Bank
                  did not identify any issue related to indigenous peoples during the Project
                 preparation. The Request indicates that the Kuoy people and other
                 indigenous groups live in the forested area in the north and north-east o f
                 Cambodia, which i s the heart o f the logging concession system. The
                 Requesters claims that, since the concessions threaten the livelihood and
                 culture o f these groups, the Bank should have required the preparation o f an
                 Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) to address these social
                 impacts. According to the Requesters, the Bank has failed to comply with
                 OD 4.20 because it didnot take into account the impacts o f the concessions
                 on the indigenous peoples, which in turn has allowed the concession
                 companies "to ignore these issues completely."218

          257. "Management acknowledges that the Bank was not in full compliance with
                 OD 4.20 and that, in hindsight, screening studies and aframework IPDP,
                 along with more discussion of the issue would have been more appropriate
                 duringproject d e ~ i g n . " Management states that "the Bank has recognized
                                                 ~ ' ~
                 the importance of this issue" and that various mission reports have noted
                 that social problems were not address adequately inthe past.             220  The Bank,
                 therefore, decided to assist the Government in preparing community
                 consultation guidelines which would include a step-by-step manual with
                 provisions specifically related to indigenous peoples.

          258. OD 4.20's overall objective i s "to ensure that indigenous peoples do not
                 suffer adverse effects during the development process, particularly from
                 Bank-financed projects, and that they receive culturally compatible social
                 and economic benefits." According to the policy "[tlhe key step in project
                 design," "is the preparation of a culturally appropriate development plan
                 based on full consideration of the options preferred by the indigenous
                people affected by the project." Paragraph 14 (a) through (h) outline the
                 prerequisites o f such an IPDP; paragraph 15 (a) through (i) the            outline
                 contents o f such a plan.221

          259. The Panel notes that unlike with the FCMCPP, in other projects in
                 Cambodia the Bank paid considerable attention to indigenous peoples
                 issues, regardless o f the environmental categorization.222The Health Sector
                 Support Project (IDA 37280, USD 17,200,000, effective 14 Aug. 2003,
                 closing 31 Dec. 2007) has no IPDP but does have an initial Environmental
                 Assessment, Social Assessment, and Resettlement Plan. The Land
                 Management and Administration Project (IDA Credit No. 3605-KH, USD
                 24,300,000, effective 19 June 2002 and closing 31 Dec. 2007) i s also
                 relevant since it includes issues o f land tenure (including those among
                 indigenous and non-indigenous people). This Land Management project
                 includes an "Indigenous Peoples Policy FrameworlZ' as well as
                 environmental and social safeguard reports. In addition, the Bank-financed
                 Provincial and Peri-Urban Water and Sanitation Project (IDA Credit No.
                 3746-KH for USD 16,900,000 effective 16 November 2003, closing 30
                 June 2008), which i s the only Project given an "A" level environmental
                 classification, includes an "Ethnic Minorities Development Strategy and
                Indigenous Peoples Framework" as well as an Environmental Assessment
                 and a ResettlementPlan. The Rural Electrification andTransmission Project
                (IDA Credit No. 3840-KH for USD 40,000,000, effective 29 March 2005,
                closing 30 June 2009) has developed a "Highland Peoples Development
                Plan." Except for the A-level Provincial and Peri-Urban Water and
                Sanitation Project, all these projects were given a "B" level EA
                classification.

          260. The Panel notes Management's acknowledgment that developing a
                framework IPDP would have been more appropriate during Project
                design. The Panelfinds that in linewith OD 4.20, an IPDP should have
                beenpreparedfor this Project.

          261. With respect to the prerequisites for an IPDP set forth inOD 4.20, the Panel
                notes that the Project shows a serious lack of information about baseline
                social structure and about traditional land and resource use, and no
                information about the inheritance o f traditional land and passageway rights
                across generations. This lack o f adequate baseline data, even for the area
                within the overly restricted boundaries o f the "Project area" as designated


local organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in matters relating to
indigenouspeoples (...) resource useshould be taken into account in theplan's design (...)Planning
should encourage early handover ofproject management to local people. As needed, theplan should
include general education and training in managementskillsfor indigenous peoplefiom the onset of the
project.''
"* Along with the FCMCPP, an exception is the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project
(IDA Credit No 3320-KH) financed within the framework ofLILs,which was classified as a "B" and no
IPDP was prepared because according to the Project Appraisal Document, the "deJinition ofprovisions for
indigenouspeople will be an integralpart of both the Park Management and the Community Development
components". Cambodia Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project, ProjectAppraisal

                                                                                                      76

                by Management, severely hampers any attempt to determine potential
                 adverse impacts o f the Project on the indigenous peoples affected by it. As
                 already noted, even less baseline information i s available about the wider
                 areathat will be impacted by the Project.

        262. The Panel also found that no attempt was made to develop social, technical,
                 and legal capacity within the institutions responsible for Government
                interaction with indigenous peoples as required by OD 4.20. On the other
                hand, no provision was made for early handover of project management,
                and for the education and training in management skills for indigenous
                people, The Panel team observed such skills at work in villages where
                indigenous people had formed committees to protect forests from illegal
                logging.

        263. The Panelobserves that even many of the prerequisitesfor an IPDP are
                lacking. Had they been developed, many of the problems that have
                afflicted the Project would have been recognized and might have been
                corrected.

D.CulturalProperty:SpiritForestsandArcheologicalSites

        264. The Request for Inspectionclaims that, before the Project started, the Bank
                did not carry out any survey o f existing cultural property inthe concession
                areas, which, according to the Requesters, "contain both spirit forests and
                sites of archaeological importance."       The Requesters add that while
                evidence i s available that many communities, in particular indigenous
                peoples, worship spirit forests, concession companies have logged them.
                For example, the communities living in the Kompong Area have
                complained that Colexim company has "previously logged their spirit
               forests in both 1997 and 2002." The Requesters also complain that the
                SFMPs/EIAS prepared by the concession companies do not take these sites
                into any account, despite their importance for the forest-dependent
                communities.223

                CuttingofResinTrees andDestructionof Spirit Forests

        265. The Request for Inspection also states that the concession areas contain
                archeological sites which have not been identified and removed from
                production areas in the SFMPs prepared by the concessionaires. A lack o f
                attention to archaeological sites could jeopardize cultural property that i s
                part o fthe nationalheritage ofall Cambodians.224

        266. Management believes that the Project is incompliance with the Bankpolicy
                on Cultural Property, OPN 11.03. Management claims that not only has the
                Banknot endorsedthe SFMPs butit expressedits concerns andreservations
                specifically with respect to spirit forests, archeological and other sites
                culturally important for the communities.225

        267. OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property adopts the United Nations definition o f
                cultural property, and describes it as "sites having archeological
                (prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious, and unique natural
                values7,.226 The Bank policy aims at helping to preserve cultural property
                and to avoid its elimination by not financing projects that will significantly
                damage non-replicable cultural property and by assisting in the protection
                and enhancement o f such cultural properties, rather than leaving that
                protection to chance. OPN 11.03 also provides that the scope o f projects
                should include the training and strengthening o f institutions entrusted with
                safeguarding a nation's cultural patrimony rather thanpostponing this to the

                 f b r e , so as to internalize the costs in computing overall project costs. The
                 policy also allows deviations from its provisions only when these can be
                justified with great project benefits and unavoidable, minor or otherwise
                 acceptable loss o f damage to cultural property.

          268. Spirit Forests. Issues related to spirit forests should be treated somewhat
                 separate from those concerning archeological and other culturally important
                 sites -even though requirement for their protection derives from the same
                 Bank policy- becausethe status andboundary of any particular forest as a
                 "Spirit Forest" derives from the traditionally recognized presence of spirits,
                 whose presence in turn can fbndamentally be known and mapped only
                through consultations with local populations and not by any other
                 archeological survey or any similar known scientific means.

          269, During its visits to communities innortheastern Cambodia, the Panel Team
                heard very sincere and heart-wrenching accounts from villagers about
                 sicknesses and difficulties in their villages, attributed to the fact that spirit
                forests hadbeen cut by loggers.

         270. Spirit forests are not among those "structures" that, according to OPN
                 11.03, can sometimes be "relocated, preserved, studied, and restored on
                alternate sites" nor are they appropriate for "selective salvage, and museum
                preservation before destruction (.      ..)," The only way to preserve spirit
                forests is to determine where they are located through a process o f survey
                by specialists along with public consultation, and having mapped them,
                assure that they are not loggedor otherwise destroyed.

         271. In addition to the conflict o f interest in that concessionaires would benefit
                from reducingthe size o f or denying the legitimacy of spirit forests, there is
                also another form o f conflict o f interest related to the scoring system
                adopted in the review o f the SFMPS/ESIAS.~~~           In particular, by excising
                spirit forests from the size of the potential logging area, the concessionaires
                would score lower in the ranking by FCMCPP Staff as they judge
                concessions for approval - thus the scoring system developed by the
               FCMCPP has a built-in disincentive for accurately reporting the size o f
                Spirit Forests and other locally usedforest areas.

         272. The Panel finds that none o f the means o f handling the issue o f spirit
               forests, provided for in the Bank policy, was carried out as part o f the
               Project. The Panelfinds that to leave determinationsabout spirit forests
               to concessionairesto include within their ESIAs as they developed and
               presented their SFMPs for approval is not consistent with OPN 11.03.
               The Panel also notes that there are excellent institutes within Cambodia
               with world-class ethnographers capable of handling surveys o f this kind,
               and those could have beenstrengthened instead as part o fthis Project.

          273. Archeological Sites. Unlike Spirit Forests, whose locations can only be
                  determined by consulting local people, very important subsurface
                  archeological sites may be present but completely unknown to or
                  unrecognized by localpeople.

          274, A first approach to determining the presence o f archeological sites i s
                  normally through preliminary checking o f whether archeological sites
                  within areas o f a forest concession are already listed on existing registers o f
                  cultural properties. Though such registers have been maintained since
                  French colonial times, and continue today, the record show that the
                  FCMCPP Staff did not include checking those registers as part o f Bank
                  preparatory activities for the Project, nor as part o f the guidelines for
                  concessionaires.

          275. Archeologists interviewed by the Panel Team unanimously expressed the
                  opinion that archeological surveys would be productive, although they also
                  expressed concerns about who would have specialist training to cany them
                  out and how the results mightbe usedor mis-used.228

         276. Especially important was the observation that if a forest logging operation
                  didnot disturbbelow the surface of the ground, it mightnot benecessary to
                  survey an area for subsurface archeological sites, especially if there were
                  inadequate preparations to protect any site so located.

         277. Considering the widespread presence o f long-recognized, important
                  archeological sites in Cambodia - including its heavily forested areas and              -
                 the extreme importance o f "archeological tourism"                           to Cambodia's
                 economy, it is surprising that the FCMCPP made so little preparationfor the
                 likelihood o f archeological sites within the vast areas o f forest concessions
                 being considered for logging. Instead, the guidelines for the drawing up o f
                 ESIAs, including surveys for archeological sites as with the spirit forests
                 discussed above, was left inthe hands o f the Concessionaires themselves.

         278. OPN 11.03 states that the Government o f the country i s responsible for
                 management o f cultural property. However, paragraph 3 states that "[blank
                 staff must (1) determine what is known about the cultural property aspects
                 of the proposed project site. The government's attention should be drawn
                 speciJically to that aspect and appropriate agencies, NGOs or university


228Some expressed dissatisfaction with many archeological surveys done as part o f development projects in
Cambodia, since only trained specialists could recognize the presence o fprehistoric sites from evidence o f
surface debris such as stone tools. Consequently this specialist felt that many sites were being destroyed for
construction o fbuildings, ports, etc., due to inadequate surveys. Others also feared that ifa private
company discovered an archeological site through conducting a survey on its own, there would be a strong
incentive to "loot" the site (that is, improperly excavate a site for saleable artifacts without recording
provenance o f items and arranging for their permanent disposition ina proper Cambodian museumor
educational institution).


                                                                                                           80

     departments should be consulted: (2) If there is any question of cultural
    property in the area, a brief reconnaissance survey should be undertaken in
     thefield by a specialist."

279. The Panel finds that the procedure used by the Project to identify
     important cultural properties relied on the concessionaires to include
    them within their proposed management plans, without provision for
     reporting their existence to appropriate agencies or including
     appropriatespecialists.This does notcomplywith the minimumlevel of
    protection and enhancement of cultural properties envisioned within
    OPN 11.03. It also potentially entails serious damage to cultural
    properties because it fails to include provisions for protecting, from
    future looting,sites that may be discovered.

 Chapter 5 ProjectImplementationand Supervision

        280. This Chapter analyzes various issues relating to Project implementation and
               supervision, in light o f claims made inthe Request, Management Response,
               andthe relevant Bankpolicies.

        281. In their submission to the Panel, the Requesters claim that the Bank has
               beennegligent inits supervision o f the Borrower's implementation, and has
               thus contravened several aspects of OP 13.05. Inparticular, they claim that
               Management       repeatedly contravened the requirement       for   Project
               supervision to ccascertainwhether the borrower is carrying out the project
               with due diligence to achieve its development objectives in conformity with
               the legal agreements." According to the Requesters, "the lack of
               supervision has accountedfor many of the FCMCPP's damaging acts and
               omissions." They believe that as a result o f this the Project has had an
               overall negative impact because it has legitimized a flawed concession
               system and the harmbeing done to the forest-dependent communities.229

       282. As support for their claim, the Requesters allege that the Bankhas:

                    i.AllowedProjecttechnical assistanceto beofferedto companies
                   that should have been excluded under the terms o f reference given to
                   the TA consultants;

                   ii.Not ensuredthat theplanningprocessesfor SFMPs andESIAs
                   carried out under the auspices o f the Project included adequate and
                   appropriate consultation o f the affected people

                   iii.FailedtoensurethetimelydisclosureoftheESIAs/SFMPs;

                   iv. Failed to ensure the observance o f minimum standards inthe 2003
                   forest cover survey;

                   v. Did not take any action to change the flawed methodology of the
                   FCMCPP's review o f the SFMPs and ESIAs, in particular the
                   Project's refusal to take account o f the legal prohibition on cutting
                   resin trees;

                   vi. Attempted repeatedly to help a company overturn the log transport
                   banandprofit from its illegalloggingofvillagers' resintrees.

       283. Management claims that it complied with the Bank policy on Supervision
              (OD 13.05 until July 19, 2001, and OP/BP 13.05 onwards). It notes that
              since mid 2000, Bank Staff conducted nine formal supervision missions,

229Request,Attachment 1, p. 73.


                                                                                       82

              including a mid-term review. In addition, from August 2002 to January
              2004 the Project Task Team Leader was based in Cambodia.230
              Management also states that the Bank's Quality Assurance Group
              conducted a "voluntary" Quality Enhancement Review (QER) in 2003 at
              the Request o fthe East Asia Regiono f the Bank.231

        284. Management believes that during Project implementation the Bank faced
              many challenges which the Project PAD had identifiedas key risks o f the
              Project.    Management notes that these are flagged in the Request for
              Inspection itself. Among these, the Response notes the tensions that arose
              duringProject implementationamong the various stakeholders - the Bank,
                                                                              -
              the Government, NGOs, other donors and the concessionaires. According
              to Management, disputes especially between Global Witness and the
              Government contributed to the removal o f Global Witness as the
              Independent Monitor and this deepened the mistrust o f the NGOs towards
              the Government's commitmentto the reforms.

        285. The sections below analyze these various issues and, more broadly,
              Management supervision o f Project implementation under relevant Bank
              policy. To inform this analysis, the chapter begins with a brief overview o f
              the organizational basis o f the Project and the Project implementation
              timeline.

A. Project OrganizationalFramework

       286. As described in Chapter 1, the Project has four basic components. These
              components are:    Forest Planning and Inventory; Concession Regulation
              and Control; Forest Crime Monitoring and Prevention; and Project
              Management and InstitutionalStrengthening.

       287. The Management Response describes the "Project Organization" upon
             which implementation actions would be founded.232 The Project i s being
             implemented by the former Department of Forestry and Wildlife (DFW),
             which was reorganized in 2003 and became the Forestry Administration
             (FA), an agency o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
             (MAFF).The ProjectDirector is aDeputyDirector inMAFF.233

       288. Under the FCMCPP, the FA created a Technical Review Team (TRT) with
             responsibility to review the SFMPs to be prepared by the concessionaires.
             The forest crime monitoring and preventionrole, provided inComponent C
             o f the Project, was initially carried out under a project financed by the
             United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United

                Nations Development Program (UNDP). The NGO Global Witness served
                as "independent monitor" within this initial framework.              For reasons
                indicated below (see next section), the function o f independent monitor
                subsequently became the responsibility o f a commercial firm contracted
                underthe FCMCCP, the Societe Generalede Surveillance (SGS).

         289. In January 2001, a Japanese grant in the amount o f USD240,OOO was
                provided to the Government to assist in the implementation o f the
                FCMCPP. The grant financed advisory services to "develop and introduce
               procedures for better integration of environmental and social safeguards
                into concession planning." These included guidelines and procedures for
                planningand plan approval, and guidelines and procedures to address gaps
                inthe Recipient's forest management standards. The Grant also supported
                advisory services to "assist in thepreparation of revisedforestry legislation
                and development of forest revenuesystem."234

         290. This section provides abrief overview o f certain significant events that have
               marked the implementation of the FCMCPP, including steps to develop and
               review the proposed SFMPs and ESIAs. A detailed analysis o f these events

291. Severalpointsrelatingto this timeline are highlightedbelow.

      o   Submissionof draft SFMPs.

292. As indicated in the Table, the deadline for the submission of the draft
      SFMPs initially was September 2001. No companies met the target date.


                                                                                85

                The Government granted the concessionaires an additional year, until
                September 2002, for completingthe draft SFMPs/ESIAs.

        293. The Requesters believe that failure by the concessionaires to meet the
                deadline constituted grounds to cancel the concession contracts.         They
                complain that the World Bank let this "slip" without requesting a
                penalization o f the concessionaires. In their view, this allowed the
                companies to continue their logging operations through the end of 2001
                "before pressurefrom international donors other than the Bank" convinced
                the Government to suspend logging operations in 2002. The Requesters
                believe that these events show the Bank's willingness to "shield" the
                concessionaires.

        294. Management states, in response, that the Bank considered the extension o f
                the deadline reasonable because o f the delay in "selecting technical
                assistance under the Project" but expressed its concerns about the
                continuation o f logging.235Management also claims that it was a Bank
                missi,onwhich reached an agreement with the Government to issue a Prakas
                suspending logging operations.

                o The SFMP Processand Confrontationswith the Public

        295. On December 16,2001, the Government issueda Prakas on the Suspension
                o f Forest Concession Logging Activities (described in more detail below).
                However, tensions that had been building up among various Project
                stakeholders in the previous months, inparticular between the Government
                andthe NGO community, erupted when the director o f Global Witness was
                attacked andbeaten inApril 2002.

       296. Later, in November and December o f 2002, conflicts worsened. The
                Requesters highlight the problems they faced because the SFMPs/ESIAs
                prepared by the companies were disclosed for public review and
                consultations for only 1.9 days, which included a public holiday.236        ~n
                addition, there were reports that physical force was used to disperse affected
                communities that gathered in front of the FA in Phnom Penh to request a
               meetingwith FA Staff about the recentlydisclosed SFMPS.~~'

       297. After this incident the Government removed Global Witness as Independent
               Monitor and this function was contracted to a commercial enterprise, SGS.
               The actions of Bank Management in relation to these events and the
               relevant Bank policies and procedures are reviewed in more detail in the
               sections below.

                 o Actions to Review the Projectandthe draft SFMPsESIAs

          298. As indicatedby Table 6, above, several actions were taken in2003-2005 to
                 review Project implementation and, more specifically, the draft SFMPs and
                 ESIAs. The first of these was the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)238
                 review, in the form o f a Quality Enhancement Review (QER). This QER
                 was initiated at the request o fthe East Asia andPacific Region o f the Bank.

          299. The QER drew attention to some "successes" o f the Project as well as
                 various shortcomings. The QER cited as successes, among others, a
                 reduction o f 4 million ha of areas under concession and a "substantial
                 empowerment of civil society and donors in their battle to create a
                 transparentforestry industry operating within thepublic

          300. At the same time, the QER indicated that the Bank's effectiveness had been
                 damaged, among other things, by the "inability of the country team to
                 coalesce around a shared strategy on substance and process," "not having
                 in place a clear and well articulated vision of how the recently liberated 4

                 Bank commitment to non-concessionairesforest users, especially the rural
                 poor in and near the forest." The review also noted that the LIL had
                 limitations as instrument "in addressing the long-term structural nature of
                 Cambodia'sforest governanceproblem."

         301. The TRT was created by the FA under the Project to review the concession
                 Management plans. It was composed o f FA Staff trained under the Project
                 to review and evaluate the SFMPs and the ESIAs. The TRT completed its
                 review in June 2004. Amon other things, its report recommended that six
                 SFMPslESIAs go forward.24%

240Management Response asserts that, in2003, after completing its first review o fthe plans, the TRT team
requested comments on such evaluation from the Forestry and Environment Technical Working Group
(TWG), one o fthe groups emerged from the restructuring o fthe Working Group onNatural Resource
Management, which is associated with the Government-Donor Consultative Group (CG) chaired by the
Bank. The TWG is chaired by the Director o f the FA and DANIDA, the Danish InternationalDevelopment
Agency, is the Lead Donor Facilitator. Management states that although the TWG endorsedthe
methodology and the conclusion o f the TRT's first review o f two SFMPdESIAs, it could not review all the
submitted plans. InMarch 2004 the TWG promoted a multi-donor sponsored Independent Forest Sector
Review (IFSR), which was to examine the entire forest sector and to evaluate both the FCMCPP and the
draft SFMPdESIAs. However, since the IFSR did not complete the review o f the concessionaires'
management plans, the Bank and the TWG decided to engage GFA Terra System (GFA), a German
consulting firm, as an independent consultant to evaluate the TRT review of the six concession plans
recommended to go forward. Management Response, 7 35-36


                                                                                                        87

        302 The Bank and other donors, working within the Technical Working Group,
                then contracted GFA Terra, a German consultingfirm, in2004 to carry out
                anindependentevaluation ofthe TRT review. The two GFA reports, issued
                in 2004 and 2005, heavily criticized the concessionaires' plans and
                identified several inadequacies and deficiencies, especially in the
                consultation process. The GFA evaluation concluded that none of the six
                plans could be an adequate basis for sustainable forest management. These
                reports were followed by a letter from Bank Management to the
                Government in November 2005 regarding the concessions and concession
                review process.

        303, The findings and recommendations issued by the TRT and GFA, as well as
                those contained in the November 2005 letter from Management, are
                reviewedinmore detail below as part of the discussion ofkey issues raised
                inthe Requestrelevant to Project implementation.

 C.IssuesRelatedto Implementationand Supervision

 1. ProvisionofTechnicalAssistance

        304. The Requesters claim that the Project allowed technical assistance to be
               offered to the concession companies. They state that such assistance should
               have, however, been excluded under the terms of reference for the
               consultants because the companies were "unable or unwilling" to develop
               plans in compliance with international standards, as the Government
               requiredunder the FCMCPP. According to the Requesters, providing loan-
               funded assistanceto the concessionaires "reduces theplanningprocessfrom
               a meaningfiul test of companies' suitability, to a window-dressing exercise
               in which the concessionaires ' technical dejciencies and cynicism would be
               masked courtesy of loan-backed technical as~istance."~~'

       305. The Management Response noted that the Project did not target
               concessionaires as recipients o f technical assistance and none was provided.
               However, to meet the standards set by the Government, concessionaires
               could do so by using their own resources o f contracting technical expertise.
               Management claims that "[tlechnical direction by the regulatory authority
               is necessary and was not considered as technical assistance as

       306. The Panel observes that the technical assistance provided was primarily in
              the nature o f contracted experts to assist the TRT, established by the FA to
              review the SFMPs. This effort was intended to assist in building the
              capacity of the FA to manage concessions more effectively. The relevant
              tasks included, among others, carrying out assessments o f timber volumes
              inindividualconcessions.

                                                                                         88

       307. The Panel notes that a distinction needs to be made between the Project's
               attempt to build capacity within the Government, particularlythe FA, and
               the provisionof direct supportto the concession companies.The Panel did
               not find evidence that technical assistance was provided directly to
               companies. Rather, consistent with OP 13.05, the Bank focused its
               technical assistance on building the capacity of                 the Forest
               Administration to oversee the development of SFMPs by companies.

2. Review of SFMPs and ESIAs

       308. According to Management, the "core of the                      was to establish a
               system through which the Government could review and manage
               sustainable forest management plans (SFMPs) and related environmental
               and social impact assessments (ESIAs) prepared by concessionaires. The
               preparation and review of the SFMPs was to be based upon a set of
               regulations and guidelines which have been developed since 1998 with
               support from the World Bank (includingthe TA Project and the FCMCPP)
               and other donors. This section addresses several issues raisedinconnection
               with the reviewof draft SFMPs andESIAsduringProject implementation.

               o Considerationof Past Conduct

       309. The Requesters claim that when the plans submittedby the concessionaires
               were reviewed, the FCMCPP did not take into account the companies'
               illegal activities and "closed its eyes to all past offences". The Requesters
               believe that reviewing the plans without considering the past practices of
              the companies"introduced basic errors into the review process.77    244


       310. Management responds that the Bank has "endorsed using track records in
               concession evaluation and has encouraged the Government to cancel
              contracts for concessionaires that are in clear and persistent non
              compliance with Cambodian forestry regulations."245According to the
              Response, the companies' backgroundswere reviewedand certain "suspect
              practices", such as the "irresponsible use of subcontractors", were raised
              with the Government. Management also states that "ultimately the FA
              refused to accept unproven allegations in its assessment methodology,"
              though the TRT "addressed a number of issues, including the quality and
              completeness of the environmental and social assessments."246

           311. The file on this Project contains information relevant to this issue. A letter
                from Management to the Government, dated October 19, 2001 states as
                follows:

                          "Government should (...) take due consideration of corporate track
                          record, patterns of compliance with law, regulation andfinancial
                          obligations, and capacity to conduct technically sound operations.
                         I n this context we would like to underline the needfor Government
                          to take account of well documented instance[s] of serious default
                          and deviation by various concessionaires. These include cases of
                          convictionsfor involvement in illegal

          312. A letter from Bank Management dated December 12, 2001, contains similar
               warnings:

                          "(...) we do also believe that Government needs to act definitely
                         with respect to concessionaires that are in clear and persistent
                         non-compliance [with requirements and standards for sustainable

                         partners.9924
                         forest mana ement] and which are unlikely to be viable long term
                                      8

          313. The Panel notes these efforts by Management to underline the need to take
               into account the issue o f illegal logging. Nonetheless, the system to review
               concession plans did not have a policy disqualifying concessionaires that
               have engaged inillegal logging o f resin or other trees. The Panelfinds that
               this is inconsistent withthe general spirit ofthe Bank's Forest Policy.

               o Conflictsof Interest

         314. The Requesters also raise issues o f conflict o f interest in the process o f
               preparing and reviewingthe plans. They claim that the plans actually were
               drafted for the concessionaires by Government Staff (from FA and the
               Forest Research Institute), who work for the same Government agency
               responsible for deciding whether or not to allow the companies to resume
               their operations. The Requesters state that the Bank did not heed concerns
               raised about these conflicts o f interest.249

         315. Inthis regard, Management states that the Bank has been aware o f this issue
               since Project preparation. Management indicates that the PAD notes "both
               petty and large scale corruption", and that the Bank discussed with the
               Government the issue o f its Staff working for concessionaires and
               "cautioned" against it. However, according to Management, this situation
               stems from a limited number o f experts in forest issues in Cambodia and

              employment. !SO


        316. However, Management also states that the Bank "established its
              prerogative to review and comment on orest management plans prior to
              their submission for $nul appr~val."~ In the Response, Management
                                                         f
              claims that "the Bank is aware of the deficiencies" o f the plans and has not
              endorsedor recommendedthem for approval.252

        317. The Panel notes Management's acknowledgement of this issue, and
              observes that such concerns raise significant questions about the review
              process established under the Project.

              o Inclusionof ResinTrees in Inventoriesfor Logging

        318. The Request also claims that the companies included resin trees in their
              inventories and annual allowable cut (AAC), despite the prohibition in the
               1988 Decree on Forest Practice Rules and the 2002 Forest Law on the
              cutting resin trees. According to the Requesters, the FCMCPP's review of
              the plans accepted these inventories and annual allowable cut provisions as
              legitimate.

        319. Management responds that the"[r]egulatory provisions regarding resin
              trees have evolved during theperiod ofproject implementation" andthat the
              inclusion o f all standing trees inthe forest inventory depends on the purpose
              of such inventory. Management adds that c ` [ ~ ] ~ l ~figures were
                                                                               m e
              discountedby 50percent in harvest calculations used by the FA TRTand do
              anticipate limitations that might occur at later stages in the planning
             process." Management also recognizes that "at present harvesting of resin
              trees isprohibited.7, 253


        320. The Panel notes the actions taken by Management to address this issue.
              However, the Panel reiterates its findings that the illegal logging o f resin
              trees has had major negative consequences on the Requesters and local
              people, that the Bank failed to consider and investigate these problems as
             requiredunder Bank policies, and that the Project has failed to carry out an
              assessment or survey of resin trees and other forest products traditionally
             usedbv indigenous Deoulesand others.

                o The ScorecardSystem for Assessing the SFMPs andESIAs.

        321. One o f the Requesters' concerns about the review conducted by the TRT
                relates to the scorecard system adopted to assess the SFMPsESIAs. They
                believe that the system is "very heavily weighted towards consideration of
                the amount of timber the company has le@ in its concession." As a result,
                the Requesters note that, if in a concession area there i s still "viableforest,"
                the company's plan will be approved, regardless of the poor quality of the
                plan itself or the quality of consultations, or lack thereof, carried out to
                prepare

       322, Management Response does not deny this quirk o f the scoring system but
                does note that no SFMP has yet beenapproved in any case.255According to
                the Response, the scorecard system is an evaluation methodology created
                within the FA. The results of the first phase of review "generally support
                the validity of the system" as 9 out of 15 concessions were recommended for
                reje ~ t i o n . ~ ' ~

       323. As noted previously in this Report, the Panel found that the scoring system
                creates a built-in disincentive for accurately reporting the size o f spirit
                forests and other locally used forest areas, because the removal of such
                areas from the size o f the potential logging area in the proposed SFMP
                would lead to a lower score inthe rankings o f the SFMP for approval (see
                Chapter 4.D., CulturalProperty).

       324. The Panel notes concerns about the scoring system, and observes that they
                raises significant questions about how the criteria used in the assessment
                system could be applied in a manner consistent with the basic objectives of
                Bank policies.

                o   The TRT and GFA Reviewsof the draft SFMPs/ESIAs.

       325. As noted above, the TRT review of the draft SFMPsESIAs was completed
               in June 2004. The TRT recommended six plans to go forward, allegedly
               "bringing about a reduction in the area exposed to concession operations
               from 6.4 million hectares tojust over one

       326. The Bank and other donors then contracted GFA as an independent
               consultant to evaluate the TRT review. The GFA thoroughly and
               comprehensively analyzed a total o f six strategic plans (corresponding to
               the six concessionairesrecommended for approval previously bythe TRT).

        327. The first GFA assessment, in August 2004, covered the management
               planningprocess, a detailedfield assessmentof two plans and desk reviews
               of the remaining four plans. The second review, in August 2005, assessed
               the four plans subjectedto desk review in2004 in greater detail and made
               recommendationsfor the individualconcessions underreview.

        328. The GFA assessment noted that the "Frame conditions for sustainable
              forestry and related long-term management planning are still extremely
               poor   (..,)"258   and concluded that "(...) we do not see much chance for a
               sustainableforestry concession system and we do not see the possibility to
               protectforests fromfurther destruction.'7259

        329. The GFA reviewerswere quite dammingof almost all aspects ofthe SFMPs
               and ESIAs, and they noted that "None of the SFMPs (...) comply with the
               basic idea of multiple-useforestry onprinciples of SFM; none (...)fulJil the
               primary purposes of strategicforest management lans as these are clearly
               (...)formulated in theDFWs PlanningManual."2          f

        330. In judging the compliance of the plans with Cambodian guidelines and
               generalSFMprinciples, the reviewdrewthe followingconclusions:

                            "(...) the concessionplanning did not obtain community support
                           for, andparticipation in,forest management, nor did they optimize
                           social, environmental and economic benefltsfrom their plan areas.
                            With a strong bias towards timber exploitation for the beneflt of
                           the companies allplansfail to meet SFMrequirements (...)."26'

                           "The plans certainly do not reflect the ability of the companies to
                           finally implement

                           "(...) the result of     the Forest Function Zoning is also
                           unsatisfactory, and consequently, the calculated net operable area
                           of all concessionsappears to be inflated."263

                           "Social issues of forest management in all plans are inadequately
                           dealt with."264

                           "There is no evidence that biodiversity surveys have been
                           conductedseriously by any of the concessions."265

        331. The Panel observes that the findings o f the GFA reviews, which identify
                 major flaws in each proposed concession plan, provide an indication o f the
                 magnitude and scale o fproblems that arose duringProject implementation.

                 o ManagementViews on the draft SFMPs

        332. The Requesters contend that "(...) the World Bank's project had
                 recommended that the Cambodian government approve the loggingplans of
                six of the companies."266 In its Response to the Request for Inspection
                 Management claimed that it had not endorsed the plans and recommended
                them for approval.

        333. In this regard, one o f the conditionalities o f the LIL was that "Prior to
                Department of Forestry and Wildlife approval of any management plan
                prepared under the project, the Borrower shall furnish the Association a
                copy of theplanfor review and comment."267 Implicit in this requirement i s
                that the Bank will review the actions and proposed decisions o f the
                Government, and express its views before action is taken.

        334. The Panel can find no evidence that the Project endorsed the plans or
                recommended that any o f them be accepted. In fact, in its letter o f
                November 2005, Management recommended to the Government not to
                approve the deficient SFMPs, and to pursue alternative forest management
                systems. (This letter is reviewed in more detail below.) At the same time,
                the Panel notes that the role of the Project and the role of the FA have
                become conflated inthe minds o fmany observers.

                o ObservationsandFindings: the Review of SFMPs and ESIAs

        335. The Management Response acknowledges the weaknesses and deficiencies,
                highlighted by the GFA independent review, in each o f the SFMFs
                submitted by concessionaires. The Response also acknowledges that the
                GFA Independent Review o f the Strategic Forest management Plans also
                pointedto the lack o f adequate social and environmental assessments.268

        336. After reviewingthe available evidence,the Panelfinds that the SFMPs
                and ESIAs are deficient in almost all regards from, processto content.
                The SFMPs and ESIAs are especially inadequate in four important and
                interrelated respects: (i)
                                         a failure to ensure that local communities will not
               be adversely impacted by Project-supported activities, (ii)failure to ensure
                                                                          a
               that appropriate consultation occurred, (iii)a failure to ensure that
               appropriate and effective environmental guidelines are in place and (iv) a

                                                                                         94

               failure to ensure that concession operations can be carried out to achieve
               long-term sustainable management o f Cambodia's forests.

        337. The Panel recognizes that some Project Management and Staff
               consistently attempted to press the Government to improve the
               planning process and to press the concessionaires to conform to the
               various guidelines for preparing SFMPs. However, as detailed in the
               sections below, the Panel finds that Bank supervision of the planning
               and development of the SFMPs/ESIAs was inadequate in that the
               Bank's level of supervision in general did not match the magnitude of
               the problemscausedby poor SFMPs and ESIAs.

 3. Consultationin Developmentof SFMPs and ESIAs

       338. The Request for Inspection provides numerous examples to indicate that
               Environmental     and     Social  Impact     Assessments     prepared     by
               Concessionaires, in fulfillment the Project's goals o f consulting with local
              populations, were woefully inadequate in terms o f meeting the Bank's
              requirementsfor consultations with localpopulations.

       339. Management reiterates that the Bank "did not finance any activities of
              concessionaires and has not accepted or endorsed the claims of
              concessionaires to have consulted villagers adequately." On the contrary,
              according to Management, concession companies have conducted some
              consultations "because of the Bank's efforts to improve the Government's
              management and control over the concession system."

       340. Management also recognizes that it was evident since 2002 that the
              consultations carried out for preparing the ESIAs/SFMPs were inadequate.
              As a result, the Bank recommended to hire an international consultant "to
              develop a detailed and comprehensive step-by-step manual for community
              consultations, do field testings and build initial capacity for community
              consultations, benefit sharing and protection of cultural/ spiritual and
              livelihood resources."     Management claims to have monitored the
              consultation process and raised its inadequacy and weaknesses with the
              Government. However, Management emphasizes that in "any particular
              concession area, the responsibility to carry out meaningful consultations
              with local communities rests with the concessionaires when preparing their
             strategic, compartment, and annual plans."269

       341. The inadequacy o f the consultations carried out by the concessionaires was

              "Synopsis o f Conclusions and recommendation^"^^^ which contains a
              also emphasized in the GFA reports. That report, for example, provides a

              summary of "common observations" on all the concessions regarding the


269ManagementResponse, p.32.

                                                                                         95

     quality of their SFMPs and ESIAs (each o f which had been the subject o f
     earlier specific observations within the report).

342. Three exemplary paragraphs from that review are quoted below in fill.
     These regard the quality o f the handling o f social issues within these plans
     submitted by Concessionaires are paragraphs 16 on consultations and social
    issues; paragraph 17 on biodiversity issues which mentions also the social
    issue o f cultural and historical sites (about which information must also be
    obtained by consultation and survey), and paragraph 18 which concludes,
    from the two prior paragraphs, that the economic viability o f the
    concessions i s inflated due to the inadequacy o f these surveys and
    consultations.

               (16) Social issues of forest management in all plans are
               inadequately dealt with. Village consultations and participation of
               communities in the designation of community use areas did take
              place in some instances, but were inadequate and certainly not
              following the spirit of the guidelines. Village buffe. zones and
              community use set-asides are incomplete in all plans, and the
              whole social context of the concession's planning is more than
              problematic as a result. Even though the TRT initiated community
              consultations aspart of their review process, this should have been
              performed     beforehand    by the companies. I n none of         the
              concessions permanent Community Consultation Committees
              (CCCs) were established as stipulated in the Sub-decree on the
              Forest ConcessionManagement. The critical issue of respect of the
              legitimate rights of the communities to free access to the use of
              resin trees and exclusion of traditionally used resin tree species
             from the harvest, is not accountedfor in the SFMPs, particularly
              no deductions are madefrom the estimated availableyield (EAAY).

              (17) There is no evidence that biodiversity surveys have been
              conducted seriously by any of the concessions. The biodiversity
              set-asides have been allocated to the minimum required size only,
              located    in   mostly     inappropriate  locations   and    without
              consideration of the broader landscape within and outside the
              concession. Other special management areas such as for the
             protection watershed and soil conservation areas, cultural and
              historical sites or seed trees were notproperly dealt with.

              (18) As a consequenceof deficiencies mentioned under 16and 17,
              the result of the Forest Function Zoning is also unsatisfactory, and
              consequently, the calculated net operable area of all concessions
             appears to be inflated.
                                          GFA Terra SystemsReport, 2005, p. 144




                                                                                96

           343. An unusual feature o f the Project design i s that the concessionaires were
                   given responsibility for carrying out consultation and negotiations with
                   local communities, even on issues such as the use o f resin trees. This
                   procedure i s problematic under Bank policies.

           344. First, as discussed elsewhere in this Report, it i s highly unlikely that the
                   concessionaires can impartially carry out the "meaningful consultationsyy
                  required under OP 4.01 when they so clearly have a conflict o f interest in
                   the outcome o f the consultations and negotiations. It i s also unlikely that
                   such a procedure can meet the requirements of OD 4.20 to ensure the
                   "informed participation" o f the indigenous peoples in addressing issues
                  pertaining to them, and the "identzjkation of local preferences through
                  direct consultation, incorporation of indigenous knowledge into project
                  approaches, and appropriate early use of experienced specialists are core
                  activities for any project that affects indigenous peoples and their rights to
                  natural and economic resources." (OD 4.20 par. 8.)

           345. Second, unequal power relationships between the concession companies
                  and the affected people make this type of consultation an inequitable
                  situation. Within the context o f recent Cambodian history and conditions, it
                  also makes it very difficult for individuals or local communities to defend
                  their rights.271

           346. The Panel notes the unequal power relations between concession staff
                  and local communities. The Panel finds that assignment of the
                  responsibility for consulting with the indigenous peoples to the
                  concessionaires, who are planning to log the forests used by the
                  indigenouspeoples, ledto a flawed and inadequateconsultation process
                 that was inconsistentwith OD 4.20.




271 The records examined by the Panel show that raw data for any consultation surveys camed out by
concessionaires has not been obtained, and would be difficult to compile or check, since the "surveys" or
"consultations" generally consisted o f meetings at which information on the Project was provided and
opinions elicited then written down. Nevertheless, for purposes o f eliciting opinions about a project, there
i s an obvious conflict o f interest here on the part o f the interviewer, inaddition to the fact that respondent
confidentiality is not being guaranteed. Insofar as opinion surveys are part o f any consultations about the
designo fa project, results are always questionable unless one can guarantee respondent confidentiality in
any opinion survey.


                                                                                                                97

       347. The Panel also notes that this kindo f arrangement missed the opportunity to
            fulfill anobjective ofBankpolicies, which is to develop local governmental
            and nongovernmental capacity within this sector. In this regard, Bank
            policies encourage lending and development projects to invest in specific
            kinds oflocalcapacity building. OB 4.20, para 14(c), for example, indicates
            that the "institutions responsible for       government interaction with
            indigenous peoples should possess the social, technical, and legal skills
            neededfor carrying out theproposed development activities.., It adds that
                                                                          ."
            they "should normally involve appropriate existing institutions, local
            organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise
            in matters relating to indigenouspeoples."

4. PublicDisclosure of SFMPs andESIAs

      348. The Requesters claim that the Government decided to disclose the SFMPs
            and ESIAs to the public only for a 19-day period, which included a public
           holiday, thus reducing the actual time for reviewing the plans and providing
            comments to two weeks. The tense events surrounding this time period, in
            October of 2002, are noted above. According to the Requesters, the Bank
           criticized this limited consultation period but also indicated that it was
           sufficient to meet the condition o f the SAC, and thus did not act to remedy
           this situation.

      349. It i s also not clear to the Requesters why the Bank agreed to take up the
           responsibility to disclose the plans but then `ffailed to discharge this
           responsibility competently." They note that the Bank did not have all the



                                                                                    98

                 documents, or had only one copy o f the plans actually received, and that
                 these copies were in black and white, which would make color maps not
                 understandable. The Requesters also allege that the Bank agreed with the
                 Cambodia Timber Industry Association to release edited copies o f the
                 SFMPsinwhich economic data were omitted.272

        350. Management Response notes that tensions had developed between the
                Bank,the FA andNGOs about many aspectso fthe disclosure ofthe SFMPs
                and the subsequent consultation.         Management also claims that the
                disclosure o f the SFMPsESIAs was an important concern for the Bank
                "although not required under Bank                   Management also claims
                that the Government agreed to such disclosure only after pressure from the
                Bank, and that the consultation period was extended beyond the 19 days
                from October 29,2002 to January 31,2003.

        351, In addition, the Response claims that, because o f practical issues, color
                copies were not readily available, but, on November 12, some NGOs
                representatives were given available color copies at the Bank office and
                several copies were subsequently provided to NGOs and other interested
                groups. Management also states that the Bank "stated the consultations
                were to be continued with affected communities until there was agreement
                on a satisfactory plan [beyond January 31, 20031; and only then would
                plans be approved." In any event, Management recognizes that the
                disclosure process and the related expectations could have beenplanned and
                managed better.274

       352. It is evident that the Bank took on some o f the responsibility o f the
                borrower with respect to disclosure and related consultations, perhaps with
                the best o f intentions. Not surprisingly, the responsibilities o f the Bank and
                the Government became conflated in the minds o f many people. The
                Requesters therefore perceived the Bank as being complicit in restricting
                access to full documentation o f the SFMPs and in being a party to a faulty
                consultation process, which included the imposition o f unrealistically short
                periods for the review. The Bank was also increasingly seen as an apologist
                for the concession system, and was perceived to be going out o f its way to
               pushfor the legitimizationofthe concession systemat all costs.

       353. Management acknowledges that it should have managed the process better,
               while noting steps it took to improve the process. The Panel notes this
               acknowledgement. The Panel finds that the Bank's supervision of this
               process was not always consistent with OP/BP 13.05, which require
               Management to assess risks to implementation, monitor activities, identify
               problems, andrecommend to the Borrower ways to resolve those problems.

 5. Forest Cover Survey

           354. The Requesters claim that the forest cover survey carried out in 2003 was
                  poor in quality and provided a distorted picture o f forest quality and cover,
                  which assisted proponents o f the concession system to argue the case for
                  continued industrial logging.275The Requesters also claim that the study
                  contained internal inconsistencies, methodological weaknesses and basic
                  errors, and that at the very least, poor oversight o f this study constituted a
                  breach o f OP 13.05 on Project Supervision.

          355. The Management Response notes that the FA, with assistance from a
                  qualified international consultant, prepared the forest cover survey, which
                 was intended to provide information about "recent land cover trends" as a
                 basis for discussions o f forest management issues nati0nwide.2~~
                 Management states that the Bank reviewedthe TOR o f the study with the
                 help o f independent specialists and consulted with FA advisers. According
                 to Management, the study methodology does not show specific defects. The
                 Independent Forest Sector Review- a multi-donor sponsored study initiated

          356. The Paneli s aware that carrying out forest cover surveys and comparing the
                 results with earlier surveys i s almost always fraught with uncertainties and
                 difficulties because o f numerous variables, such as different photo scales,
                 different standards for categorizing forest and other land use cover and
                 uncertainties with defining boundaries between different land use and
                 vegetation types.        Such exercises are            generally    open to various
                 interpretations and frequently give rise to debate and contention. The
                 present study is no exception.

         357. The questionable reliability o f some o f the data in this study was noted in
                 the report on the forest cover survey.278Inparticular, it was noted that there
                 were "(. .) uncertainties associated with differentiating boundaries in
                            .
                 deciduous forest and wood and shrubland non-forest categories (...)."279
                However, it was feIt that there was a "(...) high degree of precision,
                 especially with regard to the results provided for evergreen and semi-



275The Requesters also claimthat the survey wrongly "purported to show that Cambodia's forest cover had
increased by more than 4%". The Panel's review o fthe forest cover survey didnot confirm the Requesters'
allegation, which seems to be based on a selective use o f data provided inthis document.

                evergreen forests."28o The raw data for the three cover types: deciduous
                forest, other forest and non-forest was considered to be unreliable, and the
                areas estimated for these cover types was considered to be too high.

          358. To compensate for the perceived overestimate in area for these categories,
                arbitrary reductions were applied to the area of deciduous forest to bring
                them to more realistic values. Three adjustments were tested, 10, 15 and20
                percent, with 15 percent considered to be the "balancing point on the
                                                                                   ...

                the interpreted area of deciduousforest reported in 1996/1997."281

          359. On this basis, a 15 percent reduction was applied to the gross areas o f
                deciduous forest. No adjustments were applied to the areas determined for
                evergreen and mixed evergreen forest, as the ability to determine the
                boundaries for these categories was considered to be satisfactory.

          360. On the basis o f these adjustments, the forest cover report concluded that in
                2002, 55 percent to 60 percent o f the country was forested,282and in the
                period 199611997to 2002:

                           "There was an average annual rate of loss of forested area in
                           Cambodia that rangedfrom 0.5%to I%."

                           "During this sameperiod, there was an annual rate of increase in
                           the non-jorested area in Cambodia that ranged from 0.7% to
                           1.9%."

                          "There was a loss during this period of almost 325,000 ha of
                          evergreen and semi-evergreenforests."

                          "The average annual rate of loss of evergreen and semi-evergreen
                          forests during thisperiod was I.O%."283

         361. The Panel recognizes the limitations of the study (short time for the work,
                short period o f supervision by international consultant, limited financial
               resources, and the inherent problems associated with carrying out this type
               o f survey). The Panel, however, finds that there is sufficient evidence to
               suggest that the work was not carried out to the standardsthat should
               be expectedfor such an exercise. Applying arbitrary factors to the raw
               data to align them with values that are perceivedto be "more correct"
               constitutes an arbitrary correction that provides an inadequate
               estimate of this critical data. The Panel also finds that the supervision

 6. Conversionof Forestto Other LandUses

          362. For several decades there has been a steady reduction in forest cover
                 throughout Cambodia with a shift .from high forest to degraded forest and
                 agricultural land. Some o f the conversion to agriculture has been small-
                 scale, both permanent and shifting, although much has been to larger scale
                 plantation enterprises.

          363. It was reported in 2003 that more than 900,000 ha o f land had been
                 allocated as agricultural land concessions.284It is not known how much of
                 this landoriginated as forest concessionsandwas transferred to agricultural
                 concessions once most o f the commercial timber was harvested. At the
                 present time many o f the forest concessions are depleted of commercial
                 timber, and there are numerous examples of landbeing converted to large-
                 scale lantations o f eucalypts, acacias, rubber and various horticultural
                 crops.p85

                  `powerful1 people' and land speculation play a major role, e.g. in the TPP
                 and Colexim concession areas.

          365. A specific example o f the scale o f the conversion comes from a recent
                 report which refers to a letter written in October 2003 by a provincial
                 politician to the Prime Minister in support o f a company requesting
                 permission to construct a 400 km road to connect Mondulkiri to Ratanakiri
                 along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border in exchange for "(,..) land
                 concession with I kilometre wide along the road sides (left and right) so
                 that the company willplant rubber-acacia-Chan Kreusna trees and various
                plants for the company's income source of income (...)(sic)."287      To allay
                 concerns about any potential damage to the forest it was notedthat "(...) the
                forest in this region suffered completely destruction              If this land
                 concession i s granted it would encompass an area o f 800 sq km,

          366. Land conversion and the associated commodification o f land (the treatment
                 o f land as an article o f trade) seems to be developin! into a significant
                 movement which some describe as "land grabbing."28 Several observers
                 claimed that "jrst the forests were plundered, now the land is being
                plundered."2  90


          367. It i s clear from the reviews o f the SFMPs that the stocks o f commercial
                 timber in many forest concessions were depleted within a few years and
                 there was little or no intentionto manage them as sustainable enterprises.291
                 There i s also substantial anecdotal evidence that many o f these concessions
                have beenre-allocated as landconcessions.

         368. It i s the Panel's view that concession logging has contributed to significant
                degradation o f Cambodia's natural forests and has hastened the conversion
                o f forests to other forms o f land use. In the contemporary world, land
                conversions are often under scrutiny because of, among other things,
                concerns about social equity and environmental impact. It i s worth noting
                that donor funding is frequently used to regularize and legitimize various
                aspects associated with the process. In this case the Project played such a
                role, albeit not in an explicit manner. By legitimizing concession logging
                the Project became a player, even if an unwittingone, in the overall land
                transformation process.

 7. Suspensionof Forest Concession LoggingActivities

       369. In December 2001, the Government issued a Prakas (a decree or law)
             suspending the issuance of any logging permit to the remaining
             concessionaires until the approval of a new forest concession management
             plan consistent with the laws and regulations. This suspension of timber
             harvesting was a significant event.

       370. The Prakas required an inventory o f logs legally felled prior to January
             2002, and stopped the issuance o f transport permits to concessionaires
             unless certain conditions were met. The Government, Bank and other
             donors were involved in discussions about mechanisms to allow logs
             already cut to be transported to processing plants. The Bank proposed the
             establishment of a system that would allow harvested logs to be transported
             subject to meeting prescribed conditions, including the prior payment of
             royalties.

       371. It i s widely claimed that this led to further illegal harvesting o f trees, and
             further illegal log transport. The Requesters claimed that the Bank
             repeatedly attempted to help a company to overturn the log transport ban.
             I t is the Panel's view that the Bank's participation in these discussions
             was appropriate and consistent with policy. It could be argued, however,
             that proposing a system by which harvested logs could be transported
             actually encouraged illegal harvesting and log transport. The Panel finds
             that supervision of the Borrower's actions related to the log transport
             ban could have been better performed to ascertain whether the
             Borrower implementedthe Project with due diligence.

8. Forest Crime Monitoring: The IndependentMonitoring Function

       372. Component C of the FCMCPP aimed at strengthening the capacity o f the
             FA to monitor illegal logging and to prevent illegal activities in a regular
             and systematic way. This Project component was to be implemented
             through data collection and analysis and by providing equipment,
             contractual service, training and technical assistance. According to the
            FCMCPP's PAD, an "international NGO will function as an independent
            monitor to provide a check on the accuracy of Government's reporting."292
            The creation of a Forest Crime Reporting Unit within the Government and
            reporting quarterly to the public on forest crime monitoringwere also Board
            presentation conditions for the SAC.

                               Picture10LoggingTruck, March2005

         373. Initially, the activities o f this component were implemented under a
                separate project financed by FAO/LTNDP, the Forest Crime Monitoring and
               Reporting Project (FCMRP).           Global Witness served as the independent
               monitor fiom 1999 to 2003. As such, observers widely agree, including
               BankStaffinterviewedbythe Panel, that Global Witness independently and
               effectively investigated, and reported to the Government, forest crimes and
               badpractices occurring inCambodian forests.

         374. However, in December 2002, growing tensions between Global Witness
               and the Government over Global Witness' actions as forest monitor,
               culminated in the dismissal o f the NGO as the international independent
               monitor. InNovember 2003, a Swiss commercial firm, Societe Gknerale de
               Surveillance (SGS), was awarded the contract as independent monitor under
               the FCMCPP.           The FAOAJNDP-funded FCMRP Project closed in
               December 2003.

         375. The contract between SGS and RGC was signed on November 23, 2003.
               According to its TOR, the monitor is, inter alia, to "validate that allforest
               crimes are being reported and that reported actions have been
               accomplished by the competent agencies of the RGC."293The monitor i s
               thus responsible for verifying the "government 's accomplishments to
               controlforest illegal activity inparks,protected areas andforests."

         376. One component of the monitor's activities i s to review documents,
               including all reports prepared by the Government with respect to the actions
               taken to report and control forest crimes, andreports providedby alternative
               sources, such as NGOs, civil society, villagers and media. When reports
               received are in need o f urgent action, they are first subject to a "credibility

              check" and immediately after they are passed on to the Government's
              competent agency for action.

        377. A further critical component of the independentmonitor's work, laid out in
             the TOR, i s `tfield monitoring of Government actions and achievements."
              This field monitoring is to cover all forest areas by ground check, aerial
             reconnaissance and analysis o f satellite imagery. Selection o f the areas for
             field monitoring depends upon the reports received by the monitor and
             passed on to the Government's agencies.

        378. The TOR also specified that "there will be no random checking of reported
              illegal actions that have not already been passed on to the relevant agency
             for action." Ground checks will be conducted every quarter over a two or
             three week period and one day of aerial reconnaissance i s to be undertaken
             each quarter. As to the analysis o f satellite data, the areas to be screenedare
             selected based on reports received indicating that illegal activities have
             taken place. This type o f monitoring was to be carried out once in the first
             year and again in the second and third year at intervals to be agreed at the
             endofthe first year.

        379. SGS is to prepare Quarterly Progress Reports, which review the reports
             from all sources and evaluate the Government's performance, including its
             response to the so-called incident reports. Incident reports, from NGOs or
             civil society, provide factual information o f incidents or suspected illegal
             activities. They may also arise from activities that the monitor has
             discovered accidentally while carrying out its regular tasks. The TOR
             clarified, however, that the monitor is "not responsiblefor undertaking any
             monitoring or inspections activities for the primary purpose of detecting
             and investigating such incidents."

        380. The TORs provided that the monitor's Quarterly Progress Reports are
             subject to a verification review by the competent Government agency
             before their public release. The Panel notes that the TORs are not entirely
             clear regarding how this procedure affects the public release o f these
             Reports. One provision states that the Reports can be released after being
             verified by the Government agencies, and adds that after 30 working days
             from submitting reports to the agencies the monitor has the right to release
             the Reports "regardless of the ~ e r i j k a t i o n . "A~ ~separate provision states
                                                                          ~
             the monitor will disseminate its reports to the public "after verzjkation" by
             the concerned agencies, and adds that "[ilfthe government does not respond
             within 30 working days" then the monitor has the right to release the
             Report.295When asked about this verification procedure, SGS indicated that
             it gives the Government a chance to address the issues before its progress
             report i s released.

381. The Panel notes the importance o f the task of supporting an independent
      monitor, an objective of the Project. The Panel is concerned, however,
      that the provisions of the TOR preventing the monitor from
      independently initiating field investigations, and making the release of
      the monitor's report subject to Government verification, conflict with
      the objective stated in the PAD to have "an independent monitor to
     provide a check on the accuracy of Government reporting." The
      Government verification role may be detrimental to the independence o f the
     monitor, as the reviewing agency may amend monitor's reports before their
     public release.

382. During its visit to Cambodia, the Panel team met with SGS officials. SGS
     confirmed to the Panel that field monitoring activities are triggered only by
     reports received and thenpassed on to the competent Government agencies.
      SGS also stated that it may not initiate independent investigations, nor does
     it have a network of people who can provide additional independent
     information.

383. During the meeting with the Panel, SGS claimed that little illegal forest
     activities have gone unreported since it started its monitoring task, and that
     SGS receives on average one or two reports about alleged illegal activities
     per month. SGS also maintained that illegal logging is no longer a critical
     issue inCambodia.

384. The Panel notes that SGS' view that the issue of illegal logging in
     Cambodian forests has been successfully tackled i s not shared by other
     Project stakeholders. During the Panel visit, the existence o f continuous and
     widespread illegal logging emerged as perhaps the only common ground
     betweenNGOs and concessionaires. (Bank Staff themselves emphasized, in
     a number o f meetings, that illegal logging is still a pressing issue.)

385. The TOR also lay out the criteria that an independent monitor should meet.
     These include "at least 15 years working experience in forest resource
     management and crime monitoring;" "significant international context
     experience related to tropical forests;" and understanding o f the political,
     economic and institutional issues related to forestry management within the
     Cambodia context. The independent monitor should also be "genuinely
     independent, neutral, credible and responsible" and "not connected with
     any activity besides the activities of forest crime monitoring and reporting."

386. The records, including information contained in SGS's own webpage, show
    that the Government of Cambodia awarded SGS a new contract for `)re-
    shipment inspection of imports for Cambodia" in 2004. Research has also
    shown that SGS has been the pre-shipment inspector since 1995 when the




                                                                                107

                  Government launched pre-shipment inspection services.296Media sources
                  also refer to problems SGS has encountered inother countries.297

           387. The Panel observes that information about SGS was readily available
                  from various sources at the time that SGS was appointed. However,
                  the Panel could not find in the Project documents an evaluation or
                  discussion o f whether SGS fulfills the criteria related to independence
                  required for the independent forest monitor. The Panel finds that this
                  is not consistent with OP 13.05 on Project Supervision. OP 13.05
                  requires, among other things, that Management "identzhproblems promptly
                  as they arise during implementation and recommend to the borrower ways
                  to resolve them" and "ascertain whether the borrower is carrying out the
                 project with due diligence to achieve its development objectives in
                  conformity with the legal agreements."

 9. Bank SupervisionStructures

           388. The sections above consider specific issues relevant to Project
                  implementation and Management supervision. This section focuses, more
                  generally, on the nature and structure of Management supervision o f the
                  Project .

          389. The Project operated within a difficult and dynamic political and social
                  environment in Cambodia. The reform process in the forest sector requires
                  change to take place in many aspects of the way in which forests are
                 perceived and managed to ensure that national policy objectives (not least
                 being poverty alleviation) are achieved.

          390. Inthis context, the Project team neededto develop (or be a part of) a broad
                 based constituency for change that embraced Government, donors and
                 NGOs. Implicit in this is the requirement for good management and
                 facilitation skills within the Project team so that a coalition for change could
                 develop momentum and influence outcomes by articulating and pursuing a
                 broadly based agenda.

          391. During the inspection, a consistent picture emerged that Project
                 management was perceived as having a narrow focus on concession
                 management (and particularly the technical aspects), as not seeing the big
                 picture, and as being confrontational and divisive with civil society. This
                 led to the unraveling o f relationships, with the Bank perceived as being an
                 apologist for the concession system. As a result it became a target for wide
                 spread dissatisfaction.



296Pre-shipment inspection identifies goods prior to shipment interms o f quality, quantity, tariff
classification, import eligibility etc. so as to assess custom duties and facilitate foreign trade.
297See for example, Financial Times, March 13, 1998 edition.


                                                                                                      108

          392. It was perceived within the Bank that Management did not handle the
                 situation well. Numerous Supervision Missions took place, but none
                 effectively addressed the underlying issues. The multi-level nature o f
                 Management structure appears not to have functioned effectively in
                 engaging the skills, expertise and oversight needed for a Project of this
                 nature.

          393. The Region recognized the existence of significant problems and
                 requested a Quality Enhancement Review. This was conducted in
                 October 2003, and was an important step in identifying many of the
                 underlying issues and suggesting ways ahead. Management is to be
                 commended for taking this step. It is not clear that the key
                 recommendations of the Review have yet been put into place, although
                 some progress has occurred. The results o f the QER were discussed at a
                 workshop in Phnom Penh with donors, NGOs and the Government in
                 November 2003 prior to releasing the final tranche o f the SAC and
                 extending the Project closure date.

          394. Notwithstanding the difficult context within which the Project was
                 operating, it is the Panel's view that many of the issues raised by the
                 Requesters might not have arisen if the Project had received better
                 supervision. Supervision should have aimed at ensuring that the
                 unraveling of relationships that became apparent during the early
                 years of the Project's implementation was addressed explicitly and
                 quickly. In particular, supervision should have aimed at ensuring that
                 the Project had the capacity throughout its life to develop a broadly
                 based constituency, embracing donors, Government and NGOs, to
                 advance forest sector reform.

D.Considerationof ProjectOutcomes

1.Cancellationof Concessions

          395. Bank Staff claimed that among the Project's successes i s the cancellation o f
                 4 million hectares o f land under concessions.298As noted above, the QERo f
                 the Project carried out in October 2003 also records the 4 millions ha
                 reduction inareas under concession among the successes o f the FCMCPP.

          396. The table below presents a summary o f the concessions cancelled and/or
                reallocated from 1994 to 2005.

               Reuters; and PhnomPenhPost.

          397. The table above shows that 26 concessions covering 6.5 million hectares
               were cancelled prior to the commencement o f the Project, and only 6
               concessions covering 1.6 million hectares were cancelled after the Project
               commenced. Thirteen concessions covering 2.7 million hectares were still
               current as at November 2005.

         398. The Management Response states that "Concessions of*around one million
              hectares remain under review."299However, this figure ignored the other
              seven concessions that are still current. It i s claimed by some observers that
              almost all o f the concessions that were cancelled no longer have a
              significant volume          of commercial timber that                 i s attractive   to
              concessionaires.300It is the Panel's view that a natural attrition has been
              taking place, and it is arguable whether the Project played a significant
              role inreducingthe number of concessions.

         399. In addition, one of the 2003 ESIAs notes the following with respect to the
               timing o f concession systems and the onset o f illegal logging inthe 1990's:

                         "Almost concurrently with the development of the concession
                         management system in 1994, illegal logging on commercial scales
                         began to appear,fuelled in part by the "Permit to Collect" system
                         and thefieedom of provincial andpara-military units to seek their
                         own revenue. Most of these collectionpermits were not issued by
                         the Forest Admini~tration."~~~

         400. It became widely acknowledged that there were many vested interests
               (national and international) involved inconcession and other logging inthe
               country. Capacity withinthe Government to manage the vested interests and
               a concession system covering such a vast area o f the country was extremely
               limited, and by 2000 the situation had developed to the stage where it was
               described as "a total system failure, resulting fiom greed, corruption,
               incompetence and illegal acts that were so wide spread andpervasive as to
               de& the assignment ofprimary blame."302

         401. The Panel also notes the statement by Management, inits Response, that the
               Bank does not take sides regarding existing investment contracts between
               its members and the private sector.303Management indicates how this
               position limited its ability to pursue options relating to the concession
               process.304

        402. In the context o f potential grounds for cancellation of concessionaire
               contracts, Management states that the Bank encouraged the Government to
               seek legal advice on its options, but did not urge the Government to breach
               existing concession agreements, nor did the Bank encourage any such
               breach.305Management said that in the past, it had been alleged that Bank
               involvement inreview o f contracts betweenmembersand the private sector
               amounted to tortious interferen~e.~'~       Therefore, Management indicated that
               reform could only occur gradually and as a result o f Government, not Bank,
               action.

        403. At the same time, however, Management also attributed the significant
               reduction in concessions directly to the FCMCPP.307The Bank states that
               "much of the information and standard-setting arisingfrom Bank projects

                  has influenced the cancellatio~ts.~'~~~ this view, Bank action had a
                                                             Under
                  direct effect on the cancellation decisions ultimately made by the
                  Government, and furthermore, this effect was desirable.309

          404. As noted above, the Panel found that natural attrition i s taking place in
                  concessions. The fact that the Bank is willing to portray substantial
                 influence on Project outcomes, however, while also implying that the Bank
                 did not seek cancellation of concessions, is notable. The Panel notes that
                 this could be viewed, perhaps, as sending mixed signals. It also raises the
                 question o f whether Bank concerns regarding potential liability intort were
                 well-founded, or rather functioned to justify a more limited, modest
                 approach to concession reform.

 2. Assessingthe Project

          405. The Panel observes that there are at least three different points o f view in
                 assessing the World Bank Forestry Project in Cambodia in implementing
                 the Bank's policies and procedures. These emerged from discussions with
                 Management and Staff and other experts.

          406. The first point o f view i s that the Project has been a success. In line with
                 Bank policies, it intervened in the forestry sector at a critical period when
                 there was widespread destruction of forests and focused successfully on
                 canceling forest concessions, significantly slowing illegal logging and
                 obtaining the public disclosure of the concessionaires' sustainable forestry
                 management plans. In this view, the Project could have been even more
                 successful in achieving the objectives o f Bank policies if those who
                 conceived and implementedit initially hadbeenable to continue to focus on
                 reforming the concession system. The LIL was an appropriate instrument
                 for providing support quickly inthe forest sector.

          407. The second point o f view i s that the Project was consistent initially with
                 Bankpolicies, because it resultedinthe cancellation of a significant number
                 o f forest concessions that did not meet criteria established pursuant to Bank
                 policies, and because it slowed illegal logging; but after this initial success,
                 the focus of the Project should have shifted to other ways of achieving
                 sustainable forest management in line with the objectives o f Bank policy.
                 These include community forestry which, while formally within the scope
                 o f the Project, was not implemented.

         408. The third point of view i s that the Project unintentionally contributed to the
                 continued destruction o f the forests because o f its nearly exclusive focus on


308ManagementResponse, p. 27.
309See ManagementResponse, 7 53, states: "No other country has ever, inpercentage terms, so radically
reduced the claims of the commercialprivate sector overforest lands in so short a time as has Cambodia
over the last tenyears."


                                                                                                   112

      reforming the concession system, which resulted at least in part from a
      failure to comply with Bank policies. According to this view, the Project
      did not result in significant cancellation of concessions that would
      otherwise have continued operations, and it appeared to legitimize the
      operations o f concessionaires who had not yet drafted acceptable
      sustainable forestry management plans but could tout approval for the
      concession process from the World Bank. Inthis view, the exclusive focus
      on reforming concessionaires led to the neglect o f other approaches to
     reform inthe forestry sector, such as community forestry. Associated with
     this view is the belief that the LIL was an inappropriate instrument for the
     Project, because it was used as an instrument of convenience for getting
      support quickly to the country and led to bypassing normal safeguard
     procedures, rather than as a learning instrument for the application of results
     on a broader scale.

409. The Panel finds that the World Bank's willingness to become involved
     in the forestry sector at a time when others would not was
     commendable. It recognizes the dedication o f Staff and the risks that
     they took. However, the Panel also finds that the third point o f view
     has some merit. Certainly inthe design and implementationof the Project,
     the Panel detected a nearly exclusive focus on reforming forestry
     concessions, a view that this could be done effectively on a technical basis,
     and a reduced emphasis on compliance with safeguard policies. Thus the
     necessary national strategic policy discussion that Bank policy requirements
     would have triggered did not occur. This may have unintentionally
     contributed in the long run to prolonging a bad situation. In addition, the
     Project's focus on concession management to some degree served to
     legitimize the concessions.

410. The Panel finds that the LIL was not designed for the kind o f forestry
     project for which it was used in Cambodia, and the use o f the LIL,
     while enabling the funds to be disbursed quickly, facilitated Project
     classification as Category B and lesser attention to Bank safeguard
     policies and procedures, which in the long runproved costly.

411. It i s easy to judge inhindsight, and the Panel would like to reiterate that no
     Project could have produced perfect outcomes in the extremely difficult
     environment inCambodia. The Panel is particularly impressed that there
     may now be an important opportunity for Bank involvement in the
     forestry sector with a different and more diverse range o f activities.

412. The Bank's November 2005 letter to the Government o f Cambodia i s
     especially noteworthy in this regard. In this letter, the Bank stated that, in
  ' light o f the independent evaluations o f the SFMPs and based on ongoing

     "take appropriate action in accordance with the rights available to it under
     Cambodian law and under the concession contracts (including any right it
     has to terminate these contracts) to bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs
     to a quick conclusion." The Bank further urged the Government to planfor
     sustainable management o f areas that will be liberated from concession and
     to conduct an assessment o f these areas, especially those particularly
     threatened by illegal logging and land grabbing. In addition, the Bank
     recommended the Government to consider "expansion of community or
     commune-basedforest protection and/or land titlingfor small holders."

     and ongoing dialogue on these matters, reflected in this letter, and
     considers that the November 2005 letter outlined productive ways of
    Bank support for the forestry sector which are consistent with the
    findings of the Panel's Report.

                                         Dr.PaulMichaelTaylor

           This Annex to the World Bank Inspection Panel's report on Cambodia's Forest
  Concession Management and Control Pilot Project (FCMCPP) summarizes recent
  literature, cited below, about the designation or classification of indigenous peoples of
  Cambodia. The World Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 (par. 3), which was the policy
  ineffect at the time ofthe FCMCPP, defines "indigenous peoples" as "social groups with
  a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that makes them
  vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process."                 The same Directive
  (par. 4) notes that "national constitutions, statutes, and relevant legislation" of many
  member countries "include specij9c definitional clauses and legal frameworks that
provide a preliminary basis for identifiing indigenous peoples." The subsequent
 paragraph, after admitting that "[blecause of the varied and changing contexts in which
  indigenous people arefound, no single definition can capture their diversity," provides
  substantial additional guidance:

          Indigenous people are commonly among the poorest segments of a population.
           They engage in economic activities that rangefrom shifting agriculture in or near
          forests to wage labor or even small-scale market-oriented activities. Indigenous
          peoples can be identlfed in particular geographical areas by the presence in
          varying degrees of thefollowing characteristics:
          (a) a close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in
          these areas;
          (3) self-identijkation and identijkation by others as members of a distinct
          cultural group;
          (c) an indigenous language, often different from the national language;
          (4presence of customary socialandpolitical institutions; and
          (e) primarily subsistence-orientedproduction.
                                                                (Operational Directive 4.20, par. 5)

          The policy recognizes that the definition of "indigenous peoples" is not clear-cut,
and it states that "Task managers (TMs) must exercise judgment in determining the
populations to which this directive applies;" adding that they should also "make use of
specialized anthropological and sociological experts throughout theproject cycle."

         While much advocacy and anthropological literature on indigenous peoples has
concentrated on the Americas, a considerable body of recent literature also assesses the
concept o f "indigenous peoples" in Asia.310 There i s also ample precedent within
Cambodian ethnology, past Constitutions, and past and current legislation and political

practice since the French colonial period for special consideration of the vulnerable status
o f Cambodian indigenous peoples in development projects, including those populations
mentioned inthe FCMCPP Requestfor Inspection.

         Cambodia's difficult, war-torn recent history, with changes in government
associated with substantial changes in national legislation, has had significant
implications for the status of Cambodia's ethnic minorities. And yet, as Ovesen and
Trankell (2004) point out, Cambodia i s unusual within Southeast Asia for its small ethnic
minority populations, both inabsolute numbers and as a percentage of the population. O f
Cambodia's approximately ten million inhabitants, almost 90 percent are ethnic Khmer.
Furthermore, although the historic ethnic composition of Cambodia during the Angkor
kingdom i s unknown, the dominance o f this historic Khmer kingdom within and beyond
the current boundaries of Cambodia has very probably entailed many centuries of
significant linguistic and ethnic "Khmerization" (or convergence o f other languages and
ethnic traditions toward those o f the Khmer who were historically dominant in the
region).

         Much o f the literature on minority populations within Cambodia contrasts images
of minority groups with those of Khmer. Such literature has often emphasized the image
o f Cambodia, or o f the Khmer, as an agrarian society whose primary crop i s paddy rice.
Ovesen and Trankell note that for many Khmer "the ideal society is one of rice-farming
peasants,for whom cities are alien and unnecessary."

         This ideal was most explicitly pursued by the Khmer Rouge, but has been implicit
         through all postcolonial regimes. Apart from being the sites of royal palaces and
        religious monuments, cities do not figure positively in the Khmer imagination.
         Trade and commerce was traditionally theprovince of womenandforeigners, and
        state administration used to be handled by the semidivine king and his appointed
        mandarins (until the French took over, but in any case it was not the affair of
        ordinary Khmer people). Thus there is an implicit association between urban life
        andforeign, non-Khmer customs. The traditional `tforeigners" in Cambodia are
        the Chinese and Vietnamese, and these have always to a large extent been urban
        populations (...). The rural-urban opposition is thus a signijkant dimension of
        ethnic relations.
                                                               Ovesen and Trankell2004:244

        Although Cambodia's Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese are ethnic minorities, and
are the subject o f considerable literature on ethnic relations, these minorities do not fit the
standard definitions of indigenous populations and have not been considered as such in
other World Bank projects.

        The ethnographic study o f Cambodia's other non-Khmer populations has a long
history, and the French colonial government employed ethnic categories it its
administration while French ethnologists extensively studied the linguistic and cultural
classification o f the non-Khmer ethnicities (Bourdier 1996; see also bibliographies o f
studies on each ethnic group inLebar, Hickey, and Musgrave 1964).Edwards (1996) has



                                                                                           129

 argued that such classifications were marred by the blurring o f ethnic and racial (or
 biological) characteristics, and that this French colonial legacy was passed on to many
 contemporary Cambodians who may think o f other indigenous ethnic groups primarilyin
 terms o f innate racial characteristics rather than cultural differences. Whether or not this
 i s the case, inlegal matters Cambodians did recognize that individuals might modify their
 own ethnic identification, most commonly through processes that might be considered a
 continuation, in recent times, of the historic "Khmerization" process. For example,
 Ovesen and Trankell (2004:243) note that in the Sangkum or "People's Socialist
 Community" period under Sihanouk (1953-1970, from independenceto the LonNo1coup
 d'e`tat it was officially recognized that any minority could "become Khmer" (or "coul
 kmae" in the Khmer language) by adopting Khmer language and customs. Thus during
 the Pol Pot regime the persecution of non-Khmer minorities often didnot extendto those
 who "converted" to a Khmer identity (Ovesen and Trankell 2004:243). Kiernan
 (1996:266-7) also describes, in reference to the Cham minority, Khmer Rouge
 instructions "to force Cham people to carry out orders just like normal Khmers"; and
 instructions that "everybody is to join the same, single, Khmer nationality" (Kiernan
 1996:269, cited inOvesen and Trankell).

          As mentioned above, OD 4.20 (par. 4) suggests that Bank staff look to "national
 constitutions, statutes, and relevant legislation" within borrower countries for "specijk
 definitional clauses and legalframeworks thatprovide apreliminary basisfor identijjing
 indigenouspeoples." Inattempting to apply this standardto the definition o f Cambodia's
indigenous peoples, Bank staff undoubtedly confronted recent Cambodian history andthe
numerous changes to Cambodia's legislation and constitutions with regard to ethnic
minorities.

          Infact, Cambodia's first postcolonial ruler, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, aimed to
promote national unity and to counteract the perceived economic dominance o f the
Vietnamese and Chinese minorities by devising an ethnic classification scheme in the
 1960saccording to which some non-Khmer ethnic minorities were to be included as bona
fide Khmers (Ovesen and Trankell, 2004:245). Minority groups including the Kouy who
lived in the northeastern provinces were labeled "Khmer Loeu" ("upland Khmer"); the
Muslim Cham who speak an Austronesian language and are found inthe central area of
the country were labeled "Khmer Islam;" and Khmer-speaking ethnic Khmer living inthe
Mekong delta but on the other side o f the Vietnamese border were labeled "Khmer
Krom" (or "lowland Khmer"). The plain "Khmer" (without any adjectival modification)
were the vast majority o f (Khmer) Cambodians living in the center and most o f the
country (ibid).

         However, besides re-defining indigenous populations as a type o f "Khmer," this
classification often assumed that upland and other Khmer would become more like the
majority Khmer. That process o f "Khmerization" (a term applied by scholars, not usedby
the Cambodian government) was helped by government programs encouraging Khmer
peasant and soldier families from the lowlands to settle in the sparsely populated hill
areas inthe northeast. "In returnfor being allowed by the government to help themselves
to land, these (pioneers' were supposed to provide a good examplefor the uplanders to



                                                                                         130

follow, such as cultivating paddy and wearing proper clothes" (Ovesen and Trankell
 2004:246). White (1996:344) also notes that other government programs targeted upland
 youths to `persuade their elders to transform their archaic way of life."311

          Scholarly discussions of treatment of minority populations during the Khmer
 Rouge period (or "Democratic Kampuchea" period under Pol Pot, 1975-79), like most
 other discussions o fthat period, have focused on its well-documented atrocities. Chandler
 (2000:3-4) notes that events o f this period led French author Jean Lacoutre to coin the
 term "autogenocide" to differentiate these Cambodian events (inwhich the great majority
 of victims, as well as perpetrators, were ethnically Khmer) from prior pogroms,
 holocausts, purges, etc. "In less thanfour years, more than one million Cambodians, or
 one in seven, probably died porn malnutrition, overwork, and misdiagnosed or
 mistreated illness. At least one hundred thousand, andprobably more, were executedfor
 crimes against the state" (ibid.) Nevertheless, Chandler finds this less like "genocide"
 and more parallel to China's Great Leap Forward in the 1950s or the Soviet
 collectivization o f Ukraine in the 1930s. Kiernan (1996), by contrast, considered
 "genocide" to be an appropriate term precisely because some non-Khmer groups
 (particularly Vietnamese) suffereddisproportionately.

          In any case, according to Ovesen and Trankell, indigenous upland minority
people were treated as distinctunder the Khmer Rouge.

          The indigenous upland minorities in the northeast held a special place in Pol
         Pot S revolutionary imagination. They represented the Khmer ideal of purity
          because they were the least contaminated by foreign influences; their society
         could be taken as an example of the `)primitive communism" of Karl Marx's
        fantasies, not yet touched by the slavery and feudalism stages in the universal
         historical materialist scheme. Pol Pot actually spent ayear or so in the late 1960s
         among these people (..,) while he imbibed the "Ur-communist" tenor of their
         social institutions. Khmer Rouge admiration of the uplanders did not go sofar as
         general cultural acceptance, however, and most of their religious institutions,
         notably animal sacrijkes accompanied by large quantities of rice wine - concrete
         manifestations of the social and ecological solidarity that characterizes their
         worldview -were rigorously suppressed.
                                                                (Ovesen and Trankell2004: 248-9)

         Another major change inthe ethnic "map" o f Cambodia during this periodwas an
unintended result of the massive expulsions of the population out of cities and into the
countryside, further resulting in the mixture of Khmer population in formerly largely
indigenous villages inmany parts of Cambodia.



311Sihanouk's approach to these indigenous population minorities contrasts with his approach to the large
Chinese and Vietnamese ethnic minority. Despite a long history o f living within Cambodia, Chinese and
Vietnamese communities were categorized as "foreign resident" Cambodians who were not entitled to
Cambodian citizenship. A process was developed by which they could become Khmer through ethnic tests
proving fluency inthe Khmer language, etc. Fromthis contrast, one can recognize an implicit distinction
between "indigenous peoples" andnon-indigenous minority populations duringthis period.


                                                                                                       131

         During the subsequent period o f the People's Republic o f Kampuchea (1979-89)
 under Vietnamese "Guidance" (the ten-year occupation following the January 1979
 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and overthrow o f the Khmer Rouge), anti-Vietnamese
 policies o f prior governments were removed from the agenda toward national minorities.
 Furthermore, distinctions among types of minority populations were removed from the
 Constitution. In reference to OD 4.20's guidelines on the definition o f indigenous
 peoples, there would no longer be a justification within the constitution or national
 legislation to distinguish "indigenous peoples" from other national minorities (a fact that
 i s relevant to OD 4.20's requirements to look at constitutions and legislation o f
 borrowing countries). These differences in Constitutional approaches to minorities are
 among the changes documented in Jennar's (1995) book, The Cambodian Constitutions,
 1953-1993.Thus Article 5 of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea's Constitution
 seems to bothprohibit special treatment o f any ethnic group by individuals or groups, and
 to insist that the State has special responsibilities for certain minorities or communities,
 as follows:

         The State carries out a policy of unity and equality among the people of all
         nationalities living in the national community of Kampuchea.
         All nationalities must love and help each other. All acts of discrimination against,
         oppression of and division among the nationalities areprohibited.
         The State takes care of ethnic minorities so that they can rise to the common level.
         The State pays special attention to the development of economy, education,
         culture, social affairs, health and communications in the mountainous regions
         and remote areas.
                                               (Constitution as quoted inJennar 199593-94)

         A party conference on Policy toward Ethnic Minorities in 1984 stated that "the
minorities are always considered as an integralpart of the Kampuchean nation," andthat
they should be "encouraged to participate in collectivization and to join solidarity
groups." Furthermore, ina policy that was parallel to domestic Vietnamese policy toward
their own ethnic minority regions, lowland Khmers were (again) encouraged to settle
among ethnic minority communities (Vickery 1986:167-168, cited in Ovesen and
Trankell2004:250).

        This issue of the potentially special status of indigenous ethnic minorities was
only slightly modified under the new constitution o f the State o f Cambodia (1989-93).
One such modification required that "the languages and scripts and the morals and
customs of ethnic minorities be respected'' (Jennar 1954:113). This respect did not extend
to religion; despite the fact that some ethnic minorities are not primarily Buddhist,
Buddhism was reinstated as the state religion as it had been until 1975. The status of
minorities was not directly addressed during the UnitedNations period, other than very
indirectly (mostly for the Vietnamese, Thai, or Chinese minorities) by UNTAC decisions
on eligibility to vote for the establishment o f the new government after the 1993
elections.




                                                                                        132

         The Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia (after 1993) says nothing about
 ethnic minorities. There was some concern expressed by human rights group that the
 constitution only refers to "Khmer citizens" while the Cambodian territory is referred to
 as "Cambodia" ("Kingdom of Cambodia"). However, article 31 paragraph 2 of the
Kingdom o f Cambodia's current constitution makes it clear that "Khmer citizen" does not
 imply ethnicity (or imply that non-Khmer speakers are not citizens). That article states
that "Every Khmer citizen shall be equal before the law (...) regardless of race, colour,
sex, language, religious belieJ political tendency, birth origin, social status, wealth or
other status."

         Inthe organization of government ministries and their departments, and also in
several pertinentareas o f legislationor draft legislation, the current Royal Government o f
Cambodia does effectively recognize the distinctiveness o f its ethnic minority
populations in ways that are applicable to OD 4.20's definitional requirements for
indigenous peoples. Cambodia's Ministry o f Religious Affairs formerly included a
Departmentof Ethnic Minorities, which in 1992 developed a list of 36 recognized ethnic
minority groups totaling 309,000 persons (approximately 3.5 percent o f the then-total
population of 8.9 million), including Vietnamese and Chinese. After the dissolution o f
that Department, the Ministry o f the Interior in 1995 and the National PopulationCensus
o f 1998 developed other estimates o f ethnic minority populationusing different methods.
The formation of a Royal Cambodian Government Inter-Ministerial Committee for
Highland Peoples' Development (IMC 1997)' and particularly the on-going efforts that
have developed draft legislationrelating to indigenous peoples within the Ministry of the
Interior, indicate that the Bank's guidelines for seeking confirmation o f "indigenous
peoples" status within the borrowing country's constitution and legislationcan be met. O f
the Ministry of the Interior's legislative and draft legislative efforts on behalf of
indigenous peoples, particularly relevant i s Chapter 3 Part 2 (articles 23-28) o f the Royal
Cambodian Government's Land Law o f 2001 ("Part 2; Immovable Property of
Indigenous Communities"), which defines "indigenous community'' (literally "original
ethnic minority" in Khmer) for purposes of the legislation, while postponing a precise
determination on which communities qualify:

       An indigenous community is a group ofpeople that resides in the territory of the
       Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest ethnic, social, cultural, and
        economic unity and who practice a traditional lifestyle, and who cultivate the
        lands in their possession according to customary rules of collective use.
       Prior to their legal status being determined under a law on communities, the
       groups actually existing atpresent shall continue to manage their community and
       immovableproperty according to their traditional customs and shall be subject to
       theprovisions of this law.
                           (Royal Cambodian Government, Land Law o f 2001, Article 23)

       This brief overview indicates that despite the lack o f recognition in the present
constitution for indigenous peoples as a special category, there i s ample recognition in
past and present Cambodian government practice and legislation for the status o f some
ethnic populations as having a "social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant



                                                                                         133

 society that makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process"
 (the definition used in OD 4.20). The highland minority populations o f northern and
 northeastern Cambodia especially (including Kouy, Kreung, and others), whose
 indigenous status has been emphasized in the Request for Inspection, have long been
 recognized as indigenous peoples.

           In addition to Cambodia's own past practices and legislation recognizing
 indigenous peoples, as well as scholarship about the ethnolinguistic makeupo f Cambodia
 that includes many minority languages and peoples, there are two other sources to which
 we may turn for recognizing Cambodian ethnic groups as "indigenous peoples" underthe
 definition usedinOD 4.20. These are: first, that this is the practice o f other organizations;
 and second, that the World Bank itselfhas acceptedthe applicability o f OD 4.20 for some
 Cambodian ethnic minorities (including those raised inthe Requestfor Inspection).

           Turning first to the comparative example of the Asian Development Bank, which
 uses a definition o f "indigenous peoples" very similar to that o f the World Bank, we find
 that the ADB has also listed the highland ethnic groups o f Cambodia to which its
 definition applies (and it does include all those ethnic groups named in the Request for
 Inspection). There i s no reason to think that the definition used by the World Bank
 would, ifproperly applied, arrive at any smaller number o f ethnic groups.

          In1998, the AsianDevelopment Bankapproved its PolicyonIndigenous Peoples,
requiring that the ADB's interventions in development support or assistance not affect
indigenous peoples' situation negatively, and that adequate and appropriate compensation
be provided ifnecessary. The ADB uses the term "indigenous peoples" inthe sense of its
own working definition (ADB 1999) to include "those with specific social or cultural
identity distinctfrom the dominant or mainstream society, which makes them vulnerable
to being disadvantaged in theprocess of development."

          The Asian Development Bank's recently carried out a study of Cambodia's
indigenous peoples (ADB 2002). It provides a list o f indigenous peoples in northern and
northeastern Cambodia, by language. But it does not review the legal status in reference
to past Cambodian legislation, and it notes the lack o f population studies and the
consequent difficulty in quantifying the number o f ethnic groups in Cambodia. It also
notes that many indigenous peoples straddle the borders o f Cambodia as well as Thailand
and Laos, due to the fact that the border was imposed by the French in 1903 and has
artificially divided these groups and restricted their movements. It further raises many
pertinent questions about the use of language (or statedprimary language) as a proxy for
ethnic identification, for example in the National Population Census.                         The report
specifically notes that many Kuy, Saoch, or Stieng people, "who live closely with the
mainstream population, would not be likely to tell outsiders their true identity" as
indigenous peoples, for example when answering a census question about what language
i s their mother tongue (ADB 2002 Chapter 2 p. 6).312Also, while the report documents


312 The report thus notes large discrepancies inpopulation estimates for indigenous people. For example,
Bourdier (1996) considers the whole country's indigenous populationto have been 142,700 in 1995; in
contrast, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Highland Peoples' Development (IMC 1997)estimated a total


                                                                                                      134

 and emphasizes the distinctiveness of indigenous peoples from the "mainstream"
 Cambodian population, it also notes that some speakers o f linguistically unrelated
 indigenous languages (e.g. the Jarai, who speak a language o f the Austronesian phylum,
 and the Tampuon who speak a Mon-khmer language - thus languages as linguistically
 unrelated as English and Chinese) live near each other and intermarry frequently, thus
 have become culturally very similar. Turning to other ethnic terms used in self-
 identification, rather than a linguist's classification of the languages, the report also notes
 that census reports do not include some named indigenous grou s, "such as Saoch in
 Sihanoukville, Suoy in Kampong Speu, or Pour in Pur~at."~ Finally, the report       P
 emphasizes the ethnic groups o f northern and northeastern Cambodia314but does not
 consider the Muslim, Austronesian-speaking Cham people of lowland central Cambodia,
 who form Cambodia's second largest ethnic group after Khmer, to be indigenous people.
 But the report does include the Jarai (of Ratanakiri) and Rhade (of Mondulkiri), who
 speak Chamic languages.

          The second reason for recognizing Cambodian ethnic groups as "indigenous
peoples" under the definition used in OD 4.20 is that the World Bank itself, while it has
 not publisheda definitive list o f groups to which its definition applies (unlike the ADB),
has funded projects affecting indigenous peoples o f Cambodia and has in several cases
 developed Indigenous Peoples Development Plans under auspices o f those projects
 (though not for the FCMCPP). Thus, for its lack of attention to indigenous peoples'
 issues, the FCMCPP was rather unusual among World Bank projects in Cambodia that
affect areas inhabited largely by indigenous populations.

          The World Bank did in fact develop Indigenous Peoples Development Plans for
affected ethnic groups mentioned in the Request for Inspection in other Cambodian
World Bank projects. In doing so, relevant Project documents sometimes cite the
difficulties o f relating the definition and characteristics o f "indigenous peoples" found in
OD 4.20 to the somewhat contradictory definitions of ethnic minority status in
Cambodia's recent legislative and political history. For example, the Bank's "Cambodia:
Rural Investment and Local GovernancePr~ject"~has developed a "Highland Peoples
                                                                  l5
Development Plan" which includes a section on Cambodia's "Highland Peoples and OD
4.20":



105,000 inthree northeasternprovinces o f Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri, and Stung Treng. Provincial sources in
the same provinces and the province o fKratie provided an estimate of 102,000.
313Despite the caveats inthis report about linguistically dissimilar groups that live near each other and have
become culturally similar, most classifications since the Frenchperiod do classify by linguistic criteria, and
for classificatory purposes subsume self-identified groups under those criteria. Nevertheless, self-
identification and linguistic classification often yield different results. To take an example fiom Europe, a
linguistmight classify speakers o f Spanish and Portuguese as speakers o ftwo dialects o fthe same
language; they would be considered one "ethnolinguistic group" insuch a classification. But o f course this
would have no bearing on self-identification o f the populations as members o f separate ethnic groups.
314The report notes that the "northeastern region o f Cambodia" is "home to the ethnic groups o fthis study"
(Chapter 2 p. 6), andrefers to the "sparsely populated areas o f the north and northeast" along the Thai, Lao,
and Vietnamese border, as the "predominant dwelling areas o fthe indigenous populations" (ibid., p. 5).

          The Cambodian government does not maintain oflcial statistics regarding its
          ethnic minorities, and available estimates of ethnic demographics and geographic
          distribution are scarce and contradictory. In 1992,prior to its discontinuance, the
          Department of Ethnic Minorities listed 35 ethnic minority groups and estimated
          their total share of the national population at about four percent. The same
          proportion was estimated in 1995 by the Ministry of the Interior.
          The largest ethnic minority groups, including Vietnamese and Chinese
          descendants, Muslim Chams and ethnic Lao, generally are not considered to be
           "indigenous peoples" in the Cambodian context, and do not generally exhibit
          characteristics of potential vulnerability as listed in OD 4.20. The Khmer
          majority, however, does generally consider a set of minorities known generically
          as "Khmer Loueu" (or upper Khmer, or "Highland Peoples" in common English
          usage) to be indigenous and distinctive in their cultural and economic practices.
          These groups generally exhibit most or all of the characteristics of potential
          vulnerability listed in OD 4.20 (,..).316

          Nevertheless, the Plan makes clear that as a condition o f involvement the Bank
will require that OD 4.20's policy requirements apply to the highland minority
populations affected by the Project, the purpose o f which i s "to support expansion of the
Royal Government of Cambodia's Seila Program (,..) within a broader oflcial campaign
promoting decentralization ox and heightened local-level participation in, development
planning." Further noting that "[alt present, Seila objectives and procedures do not
explicitly consider program impacts on the various ethnic minorities residing within
program                     the Plan insists that, as a condition of Bank assistance to the
Cambodian government for that project, the Project's activities must conform to OD
4.20's requirementsinsofar as "Highland Peoples" may be affected:

          The Bank has determined that OD 4.20 applies with reference to "Highland
          Peoples " who maintain cultural and socioeconomic practices different than [sic]
          thosepracticed by the Khmer national majority. This document describes actions
          taken, or to be taken, by the Royal Government of Cambodia to ensure that
          project arrangements meet the requirements of OD 4.20.318

          Thus, in contrast to the procedure that Management used with FCMCPP, Bank
management has paid considerable attention to indigenous peoples issues in other
projects. The FCMCP and the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project319
both o f which received a "B" EA classification, had no IPDPs available. By contrast, the
Health Sector Support Project320has no IPDP but does now have an initial EA, Social

 Project32' i s especially relevant since it includes issues o f land tenure (including those
 among indigenous and non-indigenous people); this project does include an "Indigenous
 Peoples Policy Framework" as well as environmental and Social Safeguard reports. The
 Bank's Provincial and Peri-Urban Water and Sanitation                             which i s the only
 project given an "A" level environmental classification, includes an "Ethnic Minorities
 Development Strategy and IndigenousPeoples Framework" as well as an Environmental
 Assessment and a Resettlement Plan. The Rural Electrification and Transmission
              has developed a "Highland PeoplesDevelopment Plan." Except for the A-level
 Provincial and Peri-Urban Water and Sanitation Project, all these projects were given a
 "B"-level EA classification.

          The discussion above thus far has summarized recent literature on the status of
 ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples o f Cambodia, especially with regard to their
 status within the changing legal frameworks o f Cambodia's difficult recent history. It has
 also examined the application o f the concept o f indigenous peoples inother Bank projects
 as well as by the Asian Development Bank (which uses a slightly different definition o f
 indigenous peoples). It may now be useful to review estimates o f the current distribution
and size o f minority ethnolinguistic populations o f Cambodia. This is not intended as a
definitive list but rather a summary drawn from existing sources of information.
"Primary language spoken'' is often usedas a proxy measure o f ethnicity. Inidentifying
indigenous peoples for purposes of Bank policy (at the time o fthe FCMCPP), this applies
also to the definitional criterion in OD 4.20 par. 5c, namely a population's use o f "an
indigenous language, often differentfrom the national language."

          A comprehensive attempt to develop a classification of Cambodia's ethnic groups
according to the primary language spoken i s provided in the Ethnologue listing of the
world's languages (Gordon 2005). According to this source, 12,601,706 or 94.3 percent
o f Cambodia's 13,363,42 1people speak Austro-Asiatic languages (including Khmer, the
national language, as well as almost all languages spoken by indigenous peoples), while
only 235,000 or 1.76 percent of them are speakers o f unrelated indigenous Austronesian
indigenous languages (such as the Jarai o f northeastern Cambodia and the Muslim
speakers o f Cham incentral Cambodia, the latter not generally considered an indigenous
people). In addition, there are speakers o f additional languages that are not considered
those of indigenous peoples: especially Lao (17,000), Mandarin Chinese (350,000), and
Vietnamese (393,121). O f Cambodia's known languages, all are living languages (since
no record o f extinct spoken languages has survived).

         Thus, based on this ethnolinguistic clas~ification~~~only (fully recognizing that
use o f an indigenous language is only one o f the definitional criteria), one example o f a

this InspectionPanel Report (p. 24). This ethnolinguistic list, however, includes Cham, a
large and well established minority language spoken in both Cambodia and Vietnam.
 Cham was presumably not considered (due to size of population and integration into the
national economy) vulnerable or likely to be disadvantaged in development projects, and
was not treated as an indigenous people inBank documents. The relatively small number
o f remaining native speakers of other minority languages, and the small size of
communities, i s one source of the vulnerability of these unique Cambodian peoples to
language extinction or to other forms o f culture-loss.
