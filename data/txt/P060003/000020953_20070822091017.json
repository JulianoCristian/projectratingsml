Some lessons learned\n            included: (a) The project design was based on optimistic\n            views of the speed with which the Borrower's\n            performance could be enhanced; (b) The project\u0092s design\n            under-estimated the difficulties of working with private\n            sector partners (concessionaires) who had signed contracts\n            with the government before the project was conceived; (c)\n            When the original basis for consensus amongst partners in a\n            very difficult and sensitive sector erodes - for any reason\n            - it is better to pause and work to rebuild some level of\n            consensus than to charge ahead in the absence of that\n            agreement; (d) The potential for technical assistance to\n            lead to rapid improvements in practical capacity in the\n            field for forest managers was overestimated; (e) The\n            problems of working with a borrower agency whose staff did\n            not have appropriate incentives to pursue project goals were\n            under-estimated; (f) The difficulties of applying learning\n            or introducing innovations in a LIL of this type were\n            under-estimated; and (g) The situation can improve only if\n            countries develop broad-based participatory institutions\n            that offer equal voice to local constituencies, especially\n            the vulnerable, and only if they can find the resources to\n            forgo the short-term exploitation of forest."}, "docdt": "2007-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
