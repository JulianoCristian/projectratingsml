Forest\n            Concession Management and Control Pilot Project (FCMCPP) to\n            the Board. On May 16, 2006, Management submitted its report\n            and recommendations in response to the inspection\n            panel's Investigation report. Since the project closed\n            before the inspection panel report was completed, no\n            project-specific actions were possible. Management's\n            action plan therefore acknowledged the inherent and\n            continuing challenges to increasing public participation in\n            the forest sector in Cambodia, and laid out a strategic and\n            forward-looking agenda to support the development of a more\n            equitable and socially-inclusive approach to natural\n            resources management. The Management action plan included\n            specific actions to be taken at two levels: (a) across the\n            Bank to mainstream improvements in environmental screening\n            and classification and to expand the use of strategic\n            environmental assessment with targeted training to\n            familiarize Bank staff with these tools; and (b) by the\n            within the region (EAP) to complete: (1) community\n            consultation guidelines; and (2) the legal and regulatory\n            framework for indigenous peoples' land rights in\n            Cambodia. Recognizing that a sustained effort will be\n            required, the management action plan also included a section\n            outlining a phased approach to building a broad consensus\n            with Government and other development partners on the way\n            forward in the forestry sector. The present report follows\n            the structure of the original action plan, detailing recent\n            progress and challenges in the text and summarizing progress\n            since June 2006 in table form."}, "docdt": "2010-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
