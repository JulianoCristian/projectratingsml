Introduction

1.      OnMarch30,2006, the InspectionPanel submitted its InvestigationReport No. 35556-
KHonthe Cambodia:ForestConcessionManagementandControlPilotProject(FCMCPP) to
the Board. OnMay 16,2006, Management submitted its Report andRecommendationsin
responseto the InspectionPanel's Investigation Report (INSP/R2005-0001/3). Since the project
closedbefore the InspectionPanelReport was completed, no project-specific actions were
possible. Management's Action Plantook a pragmatic approach, however, recognizing the
inherent and continuing challengesto increasing public participation inthe forest sector in
Cambodia while at the same time layingout a strategic and forward-looking agenda for dialogue
and exploration of new approachesto develop more equitable andsocially responsible natural
resourcesmanagement. Section VI1o fthe Management Report contains anAction Planproposed
to address the Panel's findings. This Action Planis presentedinAnnex 1o fthis ProgressReport.

2.      OnJune 30,2006, the Boarddiscussedthe abovereports. The Boardendorsedthe Action
PlanproposedbyManagementand askedthat Management report onthe progressin
implementing this Action Plan again insix months. Management submitted its ProgressReport
to the BoardinMay 2007 and, at that time, Management committed itselfto report on
implementation progressto the Boardagain after one year, hencethe timingo fthe present
ProgressReport.

3.      Sincethe Report of last year, Management has mademodestprogresswith the
government innaturalresourcesmanagement(NRM)issuesand, more specifically, inthe forestry
sector. Key accomplishmentsinclude continuing work on community consultation guidelines;
Indigenous Peoples' communal landrights; development o fthe NationalForest Program; land
registration and forest demarcation; landtitling; economic and social landconcessions;
environmental management; andProtectedArea (PA) management. Challengesremainas the
Bankworks with government counterpartsto strengthenthe legal andpolicy framework,
overcome inherent difficulties ofworking on issuesrequiringa highdegree o finter-ministerial
coordination and communication and, most importantly, to closethe large gaps betweenthe legal
andpolicy framework andwhat is actually happening at the field level.

ActionPlanImplementation

4.      The implementation o fthe project andthe Panel's review raiseda number o fimportant
issues relatedto project design, technical versus broader integratedlivelihood approaches, and
environmental and social assessment. Management's Action Planwas designedto addressthese
issuesandconsists o ftwo parts. The first, which covers SpecificActions to addressissues arising
from project implementation, includes actions across theBank (up-dating guidance onproject
screeningandclassification especially for technical assistanceprojects, promotingthe use o f
strategic environment assessmentsand applyingbroader lessons inthe forest sector globally) as
well as actions within the Region (to strengthencommunity consultation and foster tenure

security for indigenous communities inCambodia). The secondlays out a two-phaseApproach
MovingForward basedonthe development o fan integratedNatural ResourcesManagement
Framework. It outlines a longer-term approachto buildingconsensuson options and strategiesfor
more equitable, sustainable andtransparentmanagemento f forests and other naturalresourcesin
Cambodia.

5.      The following paragraphsprovide anoverall assessment o fprogressmadeon
implementingthe Action PlansinceMay 2007. A more detailed assessment i s provided inthe
matrix following paragraph28 ofthis Report.

6.      Becausethe Request to the InspectionPanelandthe resulting Panel recommendations
were broad andraised issuesrelatingto the Bank's safeguardcompliance and environmental
categorization o f forest sector operationsingeneral, the ManagementAction Planincluded a
section on actionsto betaken acrossthe Bankas well as specific actions to betaken within the
East Asia andPacific (EAP)Regionand, specifically, inCambodia itself.

 Specific Actions acrossthe Bank

7.      Inthe lastyear, the Bankcontinuedto promotethe useof StrategicEnvironmental
Assessment (SEA) as a tool for sustainable development and encourages its use as a key means o f
integrating environment into the sectoraldecision-making andplanningprocesses. For instance,
inKenya, the SEAthat waspreparedin2007 for theKenyaForestBillhelpedstrengthenthe
national policy dialogue regarding the sustainableuseo f forest andnaturalresources for national
development. A SEA i s beingpreparedfor the forestry sector inLiberiathat is examining
strategic aspects for forest management (commerce, environmental protection andcommunity
forestry) as well as the challengesposedbythe interrelationship betweenthe forest sector as a
whole andother sectors (such as agriculture andmining). Inthe Democratic Republic o f Congo
(DRC), anEnvironmental Impact Assessmenti s beingconducted for the NationalForest and
Nature Conservation Program which also coversthe Bank's support to DRC inthe forest sector.
Terms o fReference(TORS)       are also beingpreparedfor forestry and naturalresources SEASin
Yemen and Mozambique.

8.      The OperationsPolicy and Country Services QualityAssurance and Compliance Unit
(OPCQC) carried out a Bank-wide review on safeguardsimplementation inforest sector
operationsand incorporatedkey findings into the Sector StrategyImplementation Update (SSIU)
-ThirdReview,whichwassubmittedtoCODEinSeptember2007.Regardinglegalmatters,the
Environmental andInternationalLaw unit o fthe LegalDepartment (LEGEN)publishedin2007 a
book entitled "Forest Law and SustainableDevelopment: Addressing Contemporary Challenges
through LegalReform". It analyzesthe wide range o f issues that should be taken into account in
forest-related legislation, stressingthat forest law mustbeunderstood inthe context o fthe
broader legal framework governing landuseandlandtenure, as well as international obligations
relatedto trade, environmental protection, andhumanrights. OPCQC, with the support ofthe
SustainableDevelopment Network (SDN) and LEGEN, also prepared sections on indigenous
peoples (IPS)and forests for the Forests Sourcebook(2008). The Forests Sourcebookalso
provides guidance on landscapemanagement, conservation, establishing protected areas and
usinginformation systems (including mapping, satellite andremote sensing) to manageforests
more effectively. Finally, OPCQC has also presentedseminarsandtraining sessionsonlessons
learnedinforest governance, incorporating lessons learnedfrom the Cambodia FCMCPP, as well
as two forestry operations inDRC that were also investigated bythe InspectionPanel and
discussedbythe BoardinJanuary2008.

Specific Actions within the Region (EN)

9.      There hasbeensome furtherprogressover the past year on implementingthe two specific
actions inCambodia. Withrespectto community consultation, the Bankhas contracted a local
non-governmental organization (NGO; Community-Based NaturalResourcesManagement
Learning Institute), selectedinconsultationwith the Forest Administration, to develop a field
manual andtrainingmaterials designedto strengthenboththe understanding o fthe processand
the actual consultation skills o f field-level staffto ensurethat community concerns and interests
are adequatelyassessedand incorporatedinto forest managementplanning andaddressconcerns
relatedto chance finds ofphysical cultural resources. The consultant is expectedto deliver the
field manual and associatedtrainingmaterials byMarch2009.

10.     Withrespectto the access ofindigenous peoplesto land, thepolicy dialoguehasmoved
forward inthe past year but significant challenges remain. Following stakeholderworkshops and
an e-consultation a draft policy hasbeensubmitted to the council o fMinisters. The Council for
LandPolicy (CLP) hasindicatedthat adoptionofthis policy is expectedoncethe new
government i s formed. A draft Sub-DecreeonProcedures for Registration o fLando fIndigenous
Peoples(IPS)has also beenpreparedandcirculated bythe government for public comment. The
Bankandother DevelopmentPartners(DPs) havewritten collectively to the CLPproviding
commentsand suggestedamendmentsto ensurethe consistency o fthe draft Sub-Decreewith the
LandLaw (2001). Inparticular, DP commentsfocusedontwo key areas:

        (a) Protection of indigenous landpending registration proposing that any indigenous
                                                                    -
        community that hastaken the initial step o f establishing community by-laws may lodge
        an application for the registration of collective title, prior to its final registration as a legal
        entity; and

        (b) Joiningand leaving an indigenous community -proposingthe draR Sub-Decreebe
        amendedto remove the requirement to integrate private landinto collective title and
        proposing insteadthat this issue should beregulatedby community by-laws.

11.     Progressi s beingmade onthe provisional registrationo fthree pilot villages by:
promotingmeasuresto enhancethe protection o fIPS' landsthrough the Poverty Reductionand
GrowthOperation (PRGO) policy dialogue; and facilitatingdiscussion withthe government and
other donors onthe implementation andmonitoringo fpilots for IPS'communal titling. Recent
discussions convenedbythe Ministryo fFinance with counterparts fromMinistries o fbothLand
andInteriorhavehighlighted the needto expandinterimprotective measuresorganizedbythe
HighlandPeoplesAssociation (covering 13 villages inRatanakiri) andto replicate and
disseminatemore broadly a letter sent recently bythe ProvincialGovernor of Mondulkirito
communal chiefs informingthem that it i s illegal to sigdcertify the sale of landwithin the
communal areas andthat suchlandsales are illegal.

12.     Remaining challengesinclude: (i)      inherent difficulties informally registering indigenous
communities (ii) inter-ministerial communication and coordination and (iii)        growingpressureon
community membersto sell landto outsiders. Despite these challengeswe expect that oncethe
policy andregulatory frameworks are inplace androles andresponsibilities o f government
agencies are formally agreed (with budgets agreedand lead focal points defined) it will be
possible to scale-up the programo f communal landtitlingfor indigenous communities.

Approach Moving Forward

PhaseI:Deepeningthe NaturalResourcesManagementDialogue and BuildingConsensus

13.      Management's Action Planalso proposeda dialogue with the government and other
stakeholdersto helpdefine the way forward onthe various dimensions o fNRMinCambodia.
Withsupport fromkey seniorgovernment officials, andbasedonthe continuing dialoguewith
other DPs inthe relatedTechnical Working Groups (TWGs), progressis being made on a number
o f issues. However, despiterecentadvances, major challengesremain interms o ftransparency,
governance andinter-ministerial coordination.

14.      The addition o f aNaturalResourcesManagement Pillar to the continuing PRGO series
hasprovided an important opportunity to raise key issues andto foster discussionamong partners
on inter-ministerial coordination inrelationto statelandmanagementandmeasuresto safeguard
IPcommunity lands. The PRGO alsoprovides anopportunity to review with government
counterpartstheir efforts to review andrevise Economic LandConcession(ELC) agreements and
to bringthe largest o fthese inline with the relevant sub-decree.

Dialogue on the Forest Sector
15.      Duringthepastyear, theprocessofdevelopingaNationalForestProgram(NFP) for
Cambodia has gainedmomentum. The government has formally establisheda task force with
membership from all o fthe relevant Ministries and DPs andrepresentativesfromthe NGO sector
(NGO Forum, Wildlife Conservation Society). The Bankhasbeenaskedto play a key role inthe
formulation o f sub-programs onForest Law Enforcement and Governance(FLEG), andthe
Forest Conservation andManagement. Formulationo fthe Community Forestry Sub-program i s
beingsupportedbyaJapanSocialDevelopment Fund(JSDF) h d e dconsultant. As detailed in
the attachedmatrix, the government has chosento prioritize many o fthe key outstanding issuesin
the forest sector, includingdefining the role and scopefor commercial forestry, completing the
process o f forest concessionreform, defining the role o fannual coupes, assessing the statuso f
forest law enforcement anddefining new approachesto improving forest governance(including
independentmonitoring), andto do this ina very public andparticipatory manner. The timeline
for completingthe NFP is December 2008 and, while the final outcome o fthis processcannot be
anticipated at this point, the generalapproach o fincluding civil society and other Ministries inthe
processof drafting andpublicly vettingthe NFP i s encouraging. This inclusive and participatory
approachembracedbythe government andbroadlysupportedbyDPs should help to rebuilda
consensusonthe way forward inthe sector among a broadrange o f stakeholders. This dialogue
will buildon and address someo fthe key issuesidentifiedinthe NRMFramework document that
was highlightedinthe first Boardupdatepresentedlast year.

16.      The Bank continuesto support the expansion o f CommunityRartnership Forestry in
Cambodia with a JSDF grant implemented through the Regional Center for CommunityForestry
Training (RECOFTC). This grant i s designedto foster the government's efforts to expand
participatory approachesto forest and landmanagementandto monitoringat the local level. This
grant also provides support to community-based forest monitoringandnetworking at the national
level, buildingon and strengthening self-initiated groups that are already operating at the
provincial levelandbelow. Duringthe past year 41 Community Forestry Agreements havebeen
signed and another 130havebeensubmitted for formal review bythe ForestAdministration. The
JSDF programhasbeeninitiated inall 5 target cantonmentsandapproximately 200 villages are
engaged.




                                                - 4 -

17.     However, market forces inthe region, includingthe rapidly-expanding wood products
processingindustryand proposals for large-scalecommercial plantations, are bringingnew
pressuresto bear on forests inCambodia. A recentreview o fVietnamese customs data has
shownthat large quantities o fwood arebeingimportedfrom bothCambodia andLaos despitethe
existing bans onround-wood exports from thesetwo countries. The Bankand other DPs are
encouragingthe rapidimplementation o fbilateral agreementsthat havebeensignedbetween
Cambodia andVietnam to ensureadequatemonitoringandreporting on cross-bordertrade in
wood andwood products.

Dialogue in theLand Sector
18.     The Bankcontinues to work closely with government counterparts and other DPsinthe
landsector, with the dialogue focusing ona broadrangeofissues including secureaccessto land
for ruralpoor families; expanding and extending the government's landtitlingprogram;
supporting participatory boundary identification and demarcation as part of government's state
landregistration efforts; andfostering appropriatemechanismsto review andpublicly disclose
decisions relatedto ELCs.

19.     Working closely with counterpartsinthe Ministryof LandManagement, UrbanPlanning
and Construction (MLMUPC), the Bankhas extendedbytwo years the ClosingDate ofthe Credit
supporting the LandManagement and Administration Project. Underthis program more than one
million landparcelshavebeen surveyedand adjudicated with titles distributed to beneficiaries.
TheCanadianInternational Development Agency (CIDA) andthe Bankare supportingthe
expansiono fthis program into three new provinces this year. Management also has encouraged
the development o fa new program o f support for the issuanceof social landconcessionsthat will
transfer statelandto poor landless andland-poor families andprovide livelihoodsupport andboth
interimand long-term tenure security.

20.     Despite the progressnoted above, severalchallengesremain inthe landsector. Inthe
context o fthe PRGO discussions, the government has highlighted the continuing difficulties of
ensuring conformity with the ELC Sub-decreeprovisions for screeningo f ELCs o f lessthan
1,000 hectaresbefore approval byprovincial authorities. Dialogue is now focusing on
mechanismsto ensurecompliance andreporting at that level, as well as continued review o f
remainingELCs grantedat the national level. The programo f systematiclandtitling has
proceededmore slowly inurbancomparedto rural areas. Rapidincreasesinlandprices are
drivingspeculativeinvestments andreports ofdisplacementespecially from high-value urban,
peri-urbanand coastalareas are increasing.

Dialogue on Biodiversity Conservation
21.     A ProtectedAreas (PA) Law was signedinFebruary 2008 establishing the institutional
mandatesand legalrequirements to secureCambodia's system o fparks andprotectedareas in
perpetuity. Bank efforts to support conservation inCambodia arenow poisedto buildonthis
decision. The BiodiversityandProtectedAreas ManagementProject (BPAMP) closed in
December2007, and, at the requesto fthe government, a new operation is currently under
preparation. Fundinghasbeenprovidedto the government both for project preparationandto
maintain protection efforts within the Virachey NationalPark duringthe preparationperiod.
Under the new operation, the government has requested support for conservationand capacity
buildinginenvironmentalmanagementand for the development of subsidiarylegislation required
bythe new PALaw. Subsidiarylegislationwill include detailedguidelines ondefiningand
demarcating"utilization" zones within national parks,including core conservation areas where
economic activities suchas miningwould be excluded.



                                               - 5 -

22.      Duringthepastyear, withInstitutionalDevelopment Fund(IDF)grant resources,the
Bankhas sought to develop a mutual understandingwith the government onthe existing capacity
to undertake environmentalmanagementand impact assessment at the national andprovincial
levels andto develop a related capacity-building program. Despite initialprogressin
implementing this grant, there i s concernthat challenges are expanding at a faster rate thanthe
government's capacity to assessandmanageenvironmental threats. One area that deserves close
attention i s inrapidly expanding mineral exploration licenses. Inthe coming year, the challenges
andopportunities inthe miningsector will bereviewed as part o f sector work onpotential
"sources o f growth" inCambodia.

Demandfor Good Governance
23.      The Bank continues working on a number o f initiatives inrelationto the demand for
good governance (DFGG) agenda, which refers to the ability o fcitizens acting alone or
collectively to holdthe state accountableandto make it responsiveto their needs. This has
involvedwork onthe design of improved dispute resolutioninitiatives for landissuesand support
for a series o fradioprograms on landrights andthe resolution o f landdisputes. A DFGGproject
has now beennegotiatedthat wouldprovide competitive grant funds directlyto civil society
groups engagedininformationdissemination andmonitoringand alsoto groups working on land
andNRMissues.

24.      As explainedearlier inthis report, anddetailedinthe attachedmatrix, the governance
agenda has also addressedIPS'rights. The Bankis supporting and encouraging government
efforts to secureland andresourcerights for IPSthrough: (a) facilitating discussionwiththe
government andother donors on implementation andmonitoring o fpilots for IPS'communal
titling; and(b) supportingthe establishmentofaplatformfor participation ofIPSinthe
implementation o fthe statelandmanagementSub-Decree.

PhaseII:Approachfor Re-Engagement
25.      As indicated inthe ManagementAction Plan, the Bankwill only considernew operations
inthe forest sectorinCambodia ifsubstantialprogressismadeinthepolicyandoperational
activities reviewed above. Moreover any expansiono fBank engagementwill bebasedonthe
completion o fthe NFP agreed amonggovernment, donors and civil society representativesactive
inthe sectorandonup-.front analytical work andor pilotingthat adequatelyensures thereisa
sharedunderstanding o fpolicy issues, constraints andopportunities to informproject design.

Summary of Progress Achieved on the Action Plan and Proposed Next Steps
26.      Management would like to emphasizethat while progresshas beenmadewith
implementation o fthe Action Planduringthe past year, morework and dialogue are still needed
to complete and seek broad stakeholder endorsemento fthe NFPand government commitment
towards its implementation. For the moment, the Bank's engagementinthe NRMsector in
Cambodia will continue to foster transparencyand efforts to narrowthe gap betweenpolicy and
the legal .frameworkand actual practice.

27.      Projects underthe CAS for Cambodia referenced inthis ProgressReport are fully
consistentwith the principles for re-engagementinthe forest sector inCambodia outlined inthe
Action Plan. Theprinciples havebeenapplied to all forest sector activities recently prepared
(community forestry JSDF, forest boundary demarcation) andto those currently beingprepared
(Environment andProtectedAreas Management). Inaddition, the principles are applied inthe
context o fpolicy discussions, suchas the dialogue onthe National Forest Program.



                                               - 6 -

28.      Despite the progressreported inthis update, the situation inCambodia remains very
challenging. The Banki s committed to staying engagedwith the government and other
stakeholdersto confront these challenges andprogressively to strengthentenure and foster greater
public engagementinNRMplanning, monitoringand decisionmaking. PendingAction Plan
activities will take some additional time to complete andare dependent ona continuing
government commitment to strengthentenure, improve transparency, foster decentralization and
increasecommunity control over natural resources.

28.      Basedonthe progressmadeto date on implementingthe Action Plan, Management
reiterates its commitment to work with the government and other DPsto implement actions
already proposed, to continue to deepenthe existing dialogue onNRM,andwill report againto
the Boardonthe implementation o fthe Action Planintwelve months' time.

Annex 1

ProposedManagementAction PlanasPresentedinthe ManagementReportand
RecommendationsinResponseto the InspectionPanel's InvestigationReport

        The ManagementAction Plani s dividedinto two parts:the first, SpeczjicActions,
addresses measures arisingspecifically fromthe project andbroader institutional actions that
Management could apply to other similar projects inthe Bank.The secondpart, Approach
MovingForward: NMFrarnework outlines a longer-term approachto dealing with forestry and
other natural resourcesinCambodia.

A. SPECIFICACTIONS

        The project raised anumber o fimportant issues relatedto its design, analytical tools, and
environmental and social assessment, which the Panel addressedinits findings. Drawingfrom
lessonslearnedand specific commitments that couldbeundertaken, eventhough the project has
closed, Managementproposesto do the following (a) across the Bank and (b) within the Region
(EAP):

Across theBank:

    0   Review and updatethe "Guidelines for Environmental Screeningand Classification"
        issuedby QACUin2005 to provide additional guidanceon classification and appropriate
        methods o fundertaking environmental and social safeguardrelated actions intechnical
        assistanceprojects. This would include guidanceto Bank staff on appropriate analytical
        approachesandproceduresfor consultations required for projects that support "process
        orientedtechnical assistance" inthe naturalresourcesmanagementsector.

        Promote the useo f SEASandrelated methodologies to support the preparation and
        implementation of selectedNRMprojects to provide more informationonbaseline
        environmental and social trends andconditions.

        Take steps to ensurethat approaches, such as landscapelevelbiodiversity management,
        best managementpractices for ProtectedAreas, andinformation-sharing (e.g., mapping,
        gap analysis, review o fthe ProtectedAreas system) are introduced infuture projects o f
        this type.

Withinthe Region(EM):

        Supportthe finalization o fthe draR Community Consultation Guidelines inCambodia;
        also ensuring that the Guidelines explicitly include a referenceto the legalframework in
        Cambodia and provide guidance regarding the appropriate authorities to informwhen
        "chance finds" occur.

        Recognizing the urgency o f securing landandresourcerights for Indigenous Peoples,
        make a strong andimmediate effort (including providingtechnical assistance) in
        collaboration with other donors andthe Government under the TWG for Land, to
        finalize, as a matter o fpriority, the legal and enabling implementing proceduresrequired
        for makingthe provisions o fthe LandLaw a reality for indigenous communities in
        Cambodia.

B.APPROACHMOVINGFORWARD:NRMFRAMEWORK

Governanceand NRM

         InMay2005, theBoardendorsedanew CAS for Cambodia.Drawingonextensive
consultations withthe Cambodianauthorities, NGOs, and civil society, this new CAS focuses on
governance, improvingdonor coordination andpartnerships, andresults. As withthe previous
CAS, the focus ofthis CAS on governanceincludes specific efforts to improve the management
of natural resources, especially land and forests. The proposedprogram consists o f aUSD 10
million IDA grant for a LandAllocationfor Social andEconomic Development Project
(scheduledfor FY08) that aims to provideland andor greater security o ftenure and agricultural
services to the poor andlandless. Inaddition, the Banki s preparing aUSD 10millionIDAgrant
for a LandManagement and Administration Project I1(LMAP11,FY09) as a follow-up to the
current support for landtitling from the first LMAP(approved inFY02) that i s providingaround
25,000 landtitles permonth. Project work is beingcomplementedby Analytical andAdvisory
Activities (AAA) on land, forestry and agrarian structure issues that aimto buildconsensus
among all concernedstakeholders (government, donors, civil society, and communities) onthe
way forward inthese critical areas o fNRM.Annual Poverty Reduction Support Operations
(PRSOs), commencing inFY07, will provide momentumto reforms, not only inthe natural
resourcessector, but ingovernance, private sector development, andpublic financial
management.

         Buildingonthe strategyoutlined inthe CAS as well as the experiencewiththe FCMCPP,
the Bank's November 2005 letter to the Government of Cambodia outlined a strategy for going
forward inthe forest sector, includingconcessionmanagement, monitoring, and a range o f forest
managementoptions. Considering the complexity o fissuesrelatedto sustainableforest, landand
biodiversity management inCambodia, the Bankhas initiated a process o f engagementwiththe
Government o f Cambodia, donors, local stakeholders, and civil society representativesina
sustaineddialogue onpoverty alleviation andNRM.

         InMarch2006, atthe ConsultativeGroupmeetingfor Cambodia, donorsagreedthat,
while significant progresshadbeenmade on severalgovernanceissues, reforms neededto be
steppedupina number o f areas, includingNRM.Onthe one hand, the paceo f landtitlinghas
pickedup, andtransparencyo f informationregarding economic landconcessionshas improved
following the concertedefforts o fthe donor community. Onthe other hand, however, land
grabbingbythe richand powerful continues unabatedandthe Government does not seemto have
the politicalwill to enforce its own laws onkeepingthe size o f economic concessionsto a
maximumo f 10,000 hectares, as requiredbythe LandLaw. Currently, for example, it i s reported
that the Government i s considering awarding a concessionof 60,000 hectaresto a Chinese
company to start arubber plantation, which would be inviolation o fthe LandLaw. The
InspectionPanelreport highlighted the problems the Bankhas faced inthe forest sector, and
giventhe lack ofpoliticalwill to fight forest crimes, a consensushasyet to emergeon a clear way
forward.

NRMFramework

Drawingon lessonslearnednot only from the project, but from other lending andpolicy
activities, anNRMframework is beingput together that is basedonthe general Governance
Framework inthe CAS and focuses onthe following three pillars:




                                               - 16-

        Transparency -Bank engagementwill promote increasing public participationin
        decision makingand improve public access to informationinsupport of accountability.

       Decentralization and Local Empowerment-Bankengagementwill include support at
        sub-national levels: (i)to expandcommunity and commune levelplanningand
        management o fnatural resources; and (ii)to strengthenthe voice o flocal stakeholdersin
        the governance o fnatural resources.

        Partnerships -The Bank will work closely with partnersindeveloping programmatic
        approaches andintegrating forest managementdecisions into broaderNRMplanning and
        implementation efforts. Partnerswill include TWGs for land; fisheries; agriculture and
        water; and forestry and environment; as well as the private sector, the media, local and
        international NGOs and other civil society representatives.

PHASEI:DIALOGUETO BUILDCONSENSUS

        Inordertoreachacommonunderstandingonthewayforward, amajordialoguewiththe
Government and other stakeholderson forestry andrural development options is already
underway anddrawing, where appropriate, onrecent analytical work undertakenbythe Bank and
others.10 This dialogue now needsto be deepenedand would proceedwiththe explicit aim o f
exploring boththe short-term imperative to addressconcerns related to access to natural
resources by the ruralpoor, illegal logging andforest land encroachment,and continuingforest
loss andthe longer-term optionsfor sustainable managementof forest resources andwill attempt
to balancethe competing objectives o fbiodiversity conservation and expanding opportunities for
economic growth.

        Theproposeddialogue willtouchonseveralkey issuesincluding:

        Improvingthe availability of informationonnatural resourcesandtheir management
        (addressing the quality, completeness, and frequency of data collection, and improving
        the transparencyo fmechanisms for monitoringand reporting, includingpublic disclosure
        anddissemination)

        Development o f a national vision statementbuildingonthe existingForest Policy
        Statemento fthe Government o f Cambodia andpreparationo faNationalForestPlanto
        guide implementation ofthe existing legal framework, to identify viable and sustainable
        forest managementoptions, andto foster a broader national consensusonpriority actions
        inthe short andmediumterm.

         Mechanisms to foster inter- ministerialcoordination and strengthengovernanceofnatural
         resourcesand efforts to clarify roles andresponsibilities amongcentral, provincial, and
         commune level authorities.

         Consideration o frenewedand expandedengagement onthe part ofthe Bank would only
commenceoncethere was a clear understanding and commitment onthe part o frelevant
authorities within the FA, the MAFF,and other Ministrieswith overlapping mandates(Land,
Environment), anduponconsultations with other stakeholders.

PHASE11:POTENTIALPRINCIPLES,APPROACHFORRE-ENGAGEMENT

         Dependingonthe outcomes o fthe aforementioned dialogue and onany new national
consensusthat may emerge, the Bankwould consider a new operation with forestry inCambodia.
Any significant expansionofBank engagementwould bebasedonup-front analytical work
and/or piloting adequateto ensurethat there i s a sharedunderstandingofpolicy issues,
constraints, and opportunities to informproject design.

         Lendingfor projects or project componentsunder the proposedengagement would only
take place for designs that are consistent with the following principles;

        Active and Informed Participation of Primav Stakeholders(those most directly aflected
         by implementation) -Development and dissemination o fclear andconcise guidelines for
         community consultationto ensuremutual understandingo f overarching objectives and
         rights and obligations consistent with the existing legal framework.

         Conferral of SecureRights to Land and Other Natural Resources-This includes
         associatedresponsibilities for conservation and sustainableuseto communities and or
        householdsconsistent with and supportive o f a developingrole for localgovernment.

        resourcesthough integrated planningand development o fnew sourceso f income for
         forest fringe communities through improved productivity and economic returns from
         forests, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries.
