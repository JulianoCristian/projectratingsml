Since the project closed before the Inspection\n            Panel Report was completed, no project-specific actions were\n            possible. Management's Action Plan took a pragmatic\n            approach, however, recognizing the inherent and ongoing\n            challenges to increasing public participation in the forest\n            sector in Cambodia while at the same time laying out a\n            strategic and forward looking agenda for dialogue and\n            exploration of new approaches to develop more equitable and\n            socially responsible natural resources management. This\n            report outlines progress in both dialogue and implementation\n            of the Bank's program in natural resources management\n            (NRM), but also attempts to provide a realistic assessment\n            of the continuing challenges as the Bank works with\n            Cambodian Government counterparts to strengthen the legal\n            and policy framework, overcome the inherent difficulties of\n            working on issues requiring a high degree of\n            inter-ministerial coordination and communication, and most\n            importantly, close the large gaps between the legal and\n            policy framework and what is actually happening at the field\n            level in respect to forestry."}, "docdt": "2007-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
