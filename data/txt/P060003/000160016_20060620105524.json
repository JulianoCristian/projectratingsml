The Request for\n            Inspection was submitted by the NGO Forum o f Cambodia\n            acting on its own behalf and on behalf of affected local\n            communities living in the districts of Tbeng Meanchey in\n            Preah Vihear Province; Siem Bok and Sesan in Stung Treng\n            Province; and Anlong Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province,\n            Cambodia (the \"Requesters\"). Challenges to the\n            project were focused on two key objectives: concessional\n            planning and management, and forest crime monitoring and\n            prevention. The Panel's findings, along with\n            Management's responses, are described in detail in\n            Annex 1. Management concludes that the Bank made every\n            effort to apply its policies and procedures to pursue its\n            mission statement in the context of the project; and\n            specifically addresses the issues identified in Panel's\n            Report in the section on Lessons learned and the proposed\n            Action Plan. Among the specific actions it cites are\n            proposals for: 1) reviewing and updating the\n            \"Guidelines for Environmental Screening and\n            Classification\" to provide additional guidance on\n            classification and appropriate methods o f undertaking\n            environmental and social safeguard related actions in\n            technical assistance projects; 2) promoting the use of\n            Strategic Environmental Assessments and related\n            methodologies to help prepare and implement selected natural\n            resources management projects to provide more information on\n            baseline environmental and social trends and conditions; 3)\n            taking steps to ensure that approaches, such as landscape\n            level biodiversity management, best management practices for\n            Protected Areas, and information-sharing are introduced in\n            future projects o f this type; 4) supporting the\n            finalization of the draft Community Consultation Guidelines\n            in Cambodia; and ensuring that the Guidelines explicitly\n            include a reference to the legal framework in Cambodia and\n            provide guidance regarding the appropriate authorities to\n            inform when \"chance finds\" occur; and 5)\n            recognizing the urgency of securing land and resource rights\n            for Indigenous Peoples in order to make a strong and\n            immediate effort to collaborate with other donors and\n            Government under the Technical Working group for Land, to\n            finalize, as a matter o f priority, the legal and enabling\n            implementing procedures required for making the provisions\n            of the Land Law a reality for indigenous communities in Cambodia."}, "docdt": "2006-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
