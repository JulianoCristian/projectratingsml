The Panel found the following: In the\n            project's focus on concessions, the Bank ignored or at\n            least marginalized other aspects important to the Bank\n            program in Cambodia and to the Government during the\n            planning process. The project did not give adequate\n            attention to vital interests of local communities and\n            indigenous peoples in forest resources, and to the contested\n            nature of forest domain. Rather the Bank gave primary\n            emphasis in project design to the technical and financial\n            aspects of concession reform at the expense of environmental\n            and social aspects. The Panel also expressed concern, that\n            certain parts of the guidelines about the concession review\n            process developed under the project do not meet Bank\n            safeguard policy requirements ad do not provide adequate\n            framework for the Government to decide on any future\n            forestry concessions. Unless this is remedied, the project\n            will not achieve one of its main objectives to demonstrate\n            and improve effectiveness of comprehensive forest management\n            and operational guidelines in the forest concession area.\n            The panel also addressed the choice of the Learning\n            Innovation Loan (LIL) as a financing instrument;\n            identification and protection of forests of high ecological\n            value, of natural habitats, of the affected population and\n            the project area, and of cultural property (spirit forests\n            and archeological sites); the need for an environmental\n            assessment, the project's environmental categorization;\n            the need for a social assessment; impacts on local people of\n            illegal logging of resin trees; consultations with affected\n            people during project preparation; preparation of an\n            indigenous peoples development plan; technical assistance\n            that was provided; and the adequacy of Strategic Forest\n            Management Plans (SFMP) and Environmental and Social Impact\n            Assessments (ESIA)."}, "docdt": "2006-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
