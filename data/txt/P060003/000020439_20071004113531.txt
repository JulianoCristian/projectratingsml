    IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programsand activities of theWorld Bankfor two purposes:first, to
ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe expected
results, andsecond, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe disseminationof lessons
drawnfrom experience. As partof this work, IEGWBannuallyassesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lendingoperations
through fieldwork. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to thosethat are innovative,large, or
complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank
managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate importantlessons.
     To preparea ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents,interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operationwith the government,and
other in-countrystakeholders,and interviewBank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand in local
officesas appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subjectto internal IEGWB peer review,Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto the
document that is sent to the Bank's Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessmentreport has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethods offers both rigor and a necessarylevelof flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument,projectdesign,or sectoral approach.IEGWB evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto arrive at their
project ratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluationcriterion (additional informationis
availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions:relevance,efficacy,and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectivesis the extent to which the project'sobjectivesare
consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bankcountry and sectoralassistance
strategiesand corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,CountryAssistance Strategies,
SectorStrategy Papers, OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extentto which the project's design is
consistentwith the statedobjectives. Efficacyis the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved,or are
expected to be achieved, taking into accounttheir relativeimportance.Efficiencyis the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capital and benefitsat leastcost
compared to alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is not appliedto adjustment operations. Possibleratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or expected
outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized).Possibleratings for Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: HighSignificant,
Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effectiveimplementationthroughappropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequatetransition
arrangements for regularoperation of supportedactivities after loanlcreditclosing, toward the achievementof
development outcomes.The rating has two dimensions:qualityat entry and quality of supervision. Possibleratingsfor
BankPerformance: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extentto which the borrower (includingthe government and implementingagency
or agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand agreements,toward
the achievement of developmentoutcomes.The rating has two dimensions:government performanceand
implementing agency(ies)performance.Possibleratingsfor BorrowerPerformance:Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory,ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) onfour projects approvedbythe
Boardbetween 1997 and 2001 for the Kingdom o f Cambodia.

The Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project, estimated at appraisal to cost
$35.1 million, was approved inFebruary 1997 for an IDA credit o f SDR 18.8 million
(equivalent to $27.0 million) with IFAD co-financing o f $4.75 million equivalent. Total
project costs at completion were $27.2 million, o f which IDAprovided SDR14.5. SDR 3.5
milliono f the IDA credit was cancelled on January 28,2004. The project closed on
December 31,2005 with an undisbursedbalance o f SDR 0.755 million which was also
cancelled as o fApril 30,2006.

The Northeast Village Development Project, estimated at appraisal to cost $6.33 million,
was approved inMay 1999 for an IDA Learning and InnovationLoan o f SDR 3.6 million
(equivalent to US$4.98 million). Total project costs at completion were $5.38 million o f
which IDAprovidedUS$4.68 millionequivalent, and the Government o f JapanUS$0.50
million. The project closed on June 30,2004.

The Forest Concession Management and Control Pilot Project, estimated at appraisal to
cost $5.4 million, was approved inJune 2000 for an IDA Learning and InnovationLoan o f
SDR3.6million (equivalent to US$4.8 million). Total project costs at completionwere $4.94
million o fwhich IDAprovided $4.68 million. Following two extensions, the project closed
on Dec. 31,2005.

The Flood EmergencyRehabilitationProject, estimated at appraisal to cost $40.4, was
approved inMarch 2001 for an IDA credit o f $35 million. Total project costs at completion
were $43.4 o fwhich IDA provided $37.5. The project closed on June 30,2005.

This report is basedonthe review o fthe ImplementationCompletionReports (ICRs) for the
projects prepared by the East Asian Pacific Region as well as StaffAppraisal Reports,
Project Appraisal Documents, credit and legal agreements, implementationreports and
project files at the World Bank's headquarters. Discussions were also heldwith Bank staff in
Washington and Phnom Penhas well as with regional staff inBangkok, andwith Borrower
representatives and other stakeholders inCambodia inJanuary 2007. The cooperation and
assistance o fthe government officials, management and staff o f the implementing agencies
and other parties concerned are gratefully acknowledged.

This PPARwas undertakento provide an overview o fBank-supportedactivities inthe rural
sector to support preparationo f IEG's Country Assistance Evaluation to Cambodia over the
previous decade.

Following standard IEGprocedures, the draft o fthis PPARwill be sent to the Borrower for
comments before it i s finalized. The Borrower's comments on the ICR canbe found in
Annex B.Inaccordance with the Bank's disclosure policy, the final report will be available
to the public following submission to the WorldBank's Board o fExecutive Directors.

Summary

1.      The rural sector o f Cambodia-which accounts for the majority o fpopulation,
production and employment inthe Cambodianeconomy as well as the great majority o fpoor
people -continues to struggle under the consequences o fwar-torn infrastructure and
displaced communities. The four projects reviewed inthis report represent an important
effort bythe Bank to assist the Government to address these critical infiastructureand
capacity buildingneeds directly related to the well being o fpeople inthe rural sector.

2.      The Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project, approved in 1997,was
intended to enhancethe capacity o fthe Ministryo f Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to
implement acoordinated nationalprogramto help improvethe quantity andquality ofthe
technical, human andphysicalresources requiredto promote sustainable agricultural
development improvements inCambodia. Seven components addressed a range o fneeds
associatedwith the different sub-sectors from crops andhorticulture to livestock and
fisheries. The project generally achieved its capacitybuildingobjectives within the Ministry,
albeit with an extension o f 42 months inthe closing date. However, there was inadequate
attentionto the manner inwhich the Ministry's capacity would be usedto deliver services to
producers ina sustainable manner. Training and demonstrations fundedby the project did
result insignificant adoptionlevels insome areas such as small-scale irrigation, integrated
pest management and animalhealth, but overall there was inadequate attentionto building
agricultural extension into the Ministry's activities, even after the Mid-TermReview when
this inadequacy inthe design o f the project was clearly identified. The overall outcome i s
rated moderatelyunsatisfactory and the risk to development outcome i s rated significant
due to this inadequate attentionto agricultural extension.

3.      BothBankand Borrowerperformance are rated moderately unsatisfactory. Several
factors inthe design predisposedthis project to implementationproblems, and Bankstaff and
managersbecame overly pre-occupied with implementationdelays andprocedural issues. The
Borrower was unable to resolve counterpart fundingdelays, complex decision making
procedures, andprocurement irregularities inthe implementationo fthe project.

4.      The NortheastVillage Development Project, approved in 1999,was intended to
introduce decentralized, participatory, and poverty-focused approaches to rural development
insome ofthepoorest areas ofCambodia. Approved as alearningandinnovationloan(LIL),
the project providedtraining to the national andprovincial offices o fthe Ministryo fRural
Development to support the development o fvillage-level organizations. Investments, based
on participatoryplanning at the village level, were mainly to rehabilitateor improve physical
infrastructurethat contributeddirectly to economic activities. The overall outcome is rated
satisfactory bothinterms o fits contributions to the Government's decentralizationprogram
as well as the achievement o f its institutional andphysical targets. Although the focus of
local planning inCambodiahas since shifted from the village to the commune level after the
commune council elections in2002, the momentum of local government development is
firmly established, andthe riskto development outcome is rated moderate.

5.      BothBank and Borrower performancewere satisfactory. The consistency o f the
Bank's commitment to the project (while adapting to changes ingovernment policy

concerninglocal government and rural development) was a positive factor inthe outcome of
the project. Similarly the Government showed solid commitment to the village-level pilot in
local governance and gave it the support and latitude to develop before facilitating absorption
o f its lessons and its trained people into the commune-levelmodel.

6.        The Forest Concession Management and Control Pilot Project, also a LILand
approved in2000, was intendedto lay the groundwork for a comprehensive set o foperational
guidelines and controlprocedures for sustainable forest management inconcessionareas, and
to establish an effective forest crime monitoringandpreventioncapability. Inspite o fthe
extensive multi-donor sector work, and the expressed intent o fthe Government to introduce
sound management to the forest industry, reform efforts largely failed. The implementing
agency (the Forest Administration) andthe Bank quickly found themselves ina multifaceted
struggle betweenpowerful political and financial interests. Vested interest wanted to retain
the laissez-faire administration around logging. Conversely, an outspokengroup o f
organizations incivil society viewed any phased or negotiated program o f improvement as an
unacceptable compromise inrelationto the protectiono f a natural resource. After two
extensions o fthe closing date, and a number o f attempts to gain commitments andprogress
from concessionaires and senior political stakeholders, the project closedwithout any
approved concession management plans or a forest crime monitoring and prevention
capability. Therefore, the overall outcome is rated unsatisfactory and the risk to
development outcome i s significant.

7.        BothBank and Borrower performanceare rated unsatisfactory. Respondingmore to
the needs o fthe other donors and the NGOs, the Bank failed to distinguishbetween
legitimate concerns and weaknesses that could have been addressedwithin the context o fthe
ongoing operation andthe blanket criticism on political and ideological grounds that brooked
no compromise. The Borrower assuredthe Bank o f its commitment to reforming natural
resource management, but then failed to deliver on specific commitments under the project.
The reform interests inthe Forest Administration andtheir supporters were unable to
surmount the patronage and informalrelationships that hadtraditionally dominated the
forestry sector.

8.        The Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project, approved in2001, was intendedto
rehabilitate the economic and social infrastructuredamagedby the 2000 floods and to assist
the Government informulating a long-term strategy aimed at reducing the country's
vulnerability to flooding. To these ends it included the rehabilitation o froads, rural
infrastructure, flood control and irrigation systems andprimary and secondary schools, as
well as undertakinga set o fmanagement resources andbackgroundstudies. The overall
outcome i s ratedsatisfactory since the project contributed significantly to the restorationo f
economic and social infrastructure, particularlyinrural areas. Notwithstandingdelayed
procurement andpayments to contractors, the use o f local levels o f government and a
NationalProject CoordinatingCommittee that smoothed inter-ministerialdealings were
important factors inthe timely completion o fthe project's activities. The risk to development
outcome is moderate.

9.       BothBank and Borrower performancewere satisfactory. The Bank's commitment o f
a sector staffmember to the project, based inPhnomPenh, with the orientation and
flexibility to work with localimplementing agencies inthe development o fprocedures,

                                               x i


training and oversight greatly smoothedproject implementation. The Borrower's
commitment to working through sub-national units for procurement and the decentralized
selection o fworks, procurement and supervisionwere also key factors inthe success o f the
project.

10.    Under the conditions that prevailed inCambodia duringthe review period, these
projects had difficulty overcoming the very constraints that they were intendedto relieve:
limited institutional capacity, poor communications and access, and uncertainty and
ambivalence as to roles andrelationships. This was made more complex by the shift toward
market-driven economic decisions andthe decentralization and deconcentration o fpublic
services. There are five lessons from this experience:

       Useofthe LearningInstrumentLoan. While it is understood that LILs or other
       simplified instruments should not require the same amount o f analysis as standard
       investments loans, the risk review analysis carried out at the concept review stage
       shouldidentifyany particular fiduciary or safeguards that wouldrequire regular
       preparationand appraisal. The case for both L I L s inthis review was reasonable, but
       the deferral o f the social impact assessment inthe Forest Concession Project left the
       Bank andthe Government vulnerable to the criticism o f extreme elements incivil
       society beyondwhat might have been expected inan informeddebate. That the Bank
       has now introducedthe use o f framework analyses inL I L s as an interimmeasure
       when deferralo f hllanalysis i s appropriate shouldreduce such risks inthe future.

       The Importanceof ContinuousContactfor EffectiveImplementation.The fragile
       institutional framework inpost-conflict Cambodia and the limited counterpart pool
       underminedthe effectiveness o fperiodic Bank supervision andcredibility.
       Knowledge transfer, consensus buildingand decision-making were all seriously
       hampered, evenwhen teams came frequently from Bangkok. This constraint was
       partially alleviated when the Bank established a small resident mission in2001.
       Growthinthe effectiveness o f in-country Bank staff since 2003 was the critical factor
       that moved the dialogue and operations forward.

       Sector andCountryStrategiesas a ManagementTool for Operations.Sector or
       country strategies are often seen as the leading edge for policy dialogue and the
       identification o f investment opportunities, but their usefulness duringproject
       implementationmay not be as widely recognized. When ambiguity or disagreements
       arise inimplementation, particularly with the evolving focus or importance o f an
       activity, an agreed strategy canbecome an effective management tool. Revisiting
       country strategy might have led those working on the Agricultural Productivity
       Project to look more closely at how the Ministrywas going to use its enhanced
       capacity. And it might have kept those working on the Forest Concession Project
       from losing focus on their task amid the barrage o fpublic criticism.

       A GradualApproachto Change. Institutionsgenerallyrespondmore favorablyto
       moderate or gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when power or
       stature is beingthreatened. The Forest Concessions Project was designed to take a
       step-by-step approach to reforming the industrialexploitation o fthe country's timber
       resources. Deeplyrootedrightsandpractices were at issue, andthe challenge to

                                           xij


achieving a resource management focus inthis lucrative industry took time and
persuasion. Buildinga partnership for change amongthe stakeholders thoughbetter
exploration o fthe gradualist approach adopted may have averted support for an
unrealistic alternative.

Dealing with InformalTransaction Costs as a Development Issue. To an outsider,
informal transactions costs may be seen as corruption, but to a participant they may
be an expected form o f sharing or ameans o freaffirming one's role ina group. While
fiduciary accountabilityrequires correct procedures and oversight, the development
impact o f the Bank's approach to the issue i s very much linkedto the sensitivity with
which it introduces the desirable qualities o ftransparency and cost-effectiveness in
procurement transactions. This is a time-consuming process that depends on mutual
trust that i s very difficult to build either long distance or inthe context o fpublic
criticism or embarrassment. The collaborative approach o f the Region, the Bank's
Department o f Institutional Integrity(INT), and the Borrower prior to May 2005 had
resulted inthe introduction o f guidelines andprocedures that steadily increased the
degreeo ftransparency procurement. Incontrast, the acrimonious standoff that
prevailed for over a year following the release o f INT's findings o fwrong-doing to
the public was the result o f inadequate consultation.

                                                 1


1.       Background

1.1      The Kingdom o f Cambodiahas made significant political, social and economic gains
since peace was restored in 1993, but the economic base i s still narrow and 35 to 40 percent
o f the country's 14millioninhabitantsstill live inpoverty. Most o fthe real growth inper
capita income (which averaged 3.4 percent a year since 2000) has been intextiles and
tourism, while agriculture and other industryand service sectors progress more slowly and
inconsistently. Average per capital income i s only slightly more than $300 per year. Interms
o f its need for development support, Cambodiai s still characterized as a post-conflict, low-
income country.

1.2      Eighty-five percent o f Cambodians are dependent on agriculture andnon-timber
forest extraction for the major part o ftheir livelihoods, althoughthese activities only account
for about one-third o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Opportunities inother sectors, while
promising, are inadequate to absorb the 250,000 new entrants into thejob market each year
and there are significant opportunities to improve the productivity and the sustainabilityo f
traditional activities inthe rural sector. Unfortunately, productive infrastructure, technology,
markets and commercial services remainweak inthe rural sector and agricultural output
retains the volatility and weather dependence characteristic o f a subsistence production
pattern. Addressing these problems has been central to the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for the last ten years, which explains the importance attached to the four
projects that are the subject o f this report.

1.3      Although the specific issues and opportunities addressedby each o fthese projects
differ, they all have important circumstances incommon. A narrow but dynamic economy
spearheadedbytourism, textiles and extractive industries has emerged over the last ten years,
fueled bythe optimism o fregional investors and the untapped resources o f the country.
Direct foreign investment and recordper capital levels o f Official Development Assistance
contributedto growth rates o f 9 to 13 percent per annum inthe official economy. Inparallel,
the expanding informal economy sought to avoid the regulatory pitfalls and the economic
rents associated with official transactions. The narrow base o f official growth interms o f
economic activities and share o fpopulation remaineda concern throughout the review
period, and the development focus was mainly on buildingthe institutional framework,
humanresources and infrastructure for broader participation inthe recovery.

1.4      These efforts to broadenand stabilize the base o f the economy have faced several
pervasive constraints:

     0   The devastation arising from 30 years o fcivil war reducedthe capacity of
         implementingagencies and beneficiaries to use the resources placed at their disposal.
     0   Political stability was occasionallytenuous duringthe implementationperiod and
         remains a constraint on the rate at which essential reforms can take place inthe public
         sector.
     0   Inadequate communications andtransport infrastructurecompoundedthe challenges
         o f extendingdevelopment efforts beyond a narrow corridor betweenmajor population
         centers.

                                                 2


    e   The uncertainty o f emergingroles andresponsibilities amongpublic agencies was
        compoundedbythe extensive use o fNGOs and expatriate organizations by donors to
        compensate for the limited capacity o f line agencies.
    e   The large number o f donors andNGOs converging on the economy placedheavy
        management and coordinationdemands on government agencies at a time whentheir
        capacity was at its lowest level, so that agencies were often not inthe positionof
        leadership indetermining the agenda or the direction o f development efforts intheir
        respective sectors.

1.5     These factors influencedthe implementation o f the projects under review, and their
effectiveness was to a great extent determined by how well design and staff support during
implementationreflected the corresponding conditions.


2.      The Projects

Objectives

2.1     The projectsunder review representedcomplementary aspects o fthe Bank's and the
Government'sdevelopment strategy as it evolved over the period from 1997to 2000. Inthe
context o fpriorities on rural economic activity and on the development o fhumanresources,
the projects were designed (a) to develop the capacity o fthe MAFF to deliver technical
support for enhanced agriculturalproductivity, (b) to buildthe capacity o f local government
to select and manage infrastructure and facilities, (c) to improve the sustainable management
o f one o fthe country's major naturalresources, and (d) to restore and strengthen rural
infrastructure (Table 1).

2.2     N o changeswere madeto the objectives o fthe projects duringimplementation,
althoughinone case, Agricultural Productivity ImprovementProject, it became apparent that
the objective didnot provide adequate guidance on the linkbetween capacity and its
application. The objectives o f each o fthe first three projects derived from the analysis and
strategic conclusions o f Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) for 1995, 1997 and2000 and,
by inference, the investments o fthe FloodEmergencyRehabilitationproject do as well.
Evidence o fthese linkages appears below inthe discussion o fthe relevance o f eachproject.

Components, Costs andImplementation

2.3     Components While the specific components differedineachproject, they alluseda
similar set o f instruments to pursuetheir objectives, reflecting three pervasiveneeds in
Cambodia's rural sector:

    0   A combinationo ftraining, process development andfacilities to buildthe capacity of
        target institutions;
    0   Surveys and analysis to develop sector knowledge; and
    0   Productive assets andinfrastructureto support economic activity.

ImplementationArrangements.All four projectsuseda form o fproject management unit
to concentrate management andproceduralresources and to circumvent the difficulties posed

                                                         3


bythe very limited capacity ofmost lineunitsinthe host organizations. Efforts to buildup
management capacity below the nationallevel, notably inselecting investments, procurement
 and contract management, were successfbl inthe two operations that had a local government
 focus: NVDP and FERP.

1. The StaffAppraisal Report had a broader statement o f the objective which was more like a general goal for
the agricultural sector as a whole: "The sustainable andbroad-based improvement o f smallholder agricultural
productivity as a means to improved food security and increased rural incomes." This PPAR is based on the
statement o f objectives inthe DCAbecause this is closer to the implicit objectives conveyed by the project
design and components.'


2.4      Implementation Experience. Each o f the projects underreview experienced one or
more o fthe following implementationproblems:

     0   Delays incounterpart funding
     0   Difficulties inachieving compliance with safeguards, particularly the social impact
         andresettlement safeguards
     0   Difficulties incompliance with Bank procurement guidelines
     0   Motivation andperformance issues linked to the low levels o fpublic service
         compensation and operating budgets.




1. Inits comments, the Region states that "It is clear from the SAR itselfthat there was confusion at the time of
project preparation and loan approval about whether the project was an "institution-capacity building" project or
a "productivity improving" project. Adhering to the Guidelines meant that the ICR evaluated the project in
terms ofits productivity objective."

                                                 4


2.5     Implementationdelays ranged from 6 to 42 months and averagedjust over two years.
Excluding the FEW, the average delay was 35 months. Such delays, which were most often
related to procurement or other administration constraints o fthe Borrower, were common to
the Bank's portfolio duringthe period andto the experience o f other donors as well.

3.      Agriculture ProductivityImprovementProject
        (APIP)

Componentsand Costs

3.1     This project had a number o f components designed for implementationby the major
departments o fMAFF, some at the national level, others with the direct involvement o f
provincial and district offices.

        Agronomy, Seeds and PlantProtection($10.2 million at appraisal, $6.6 million

   (7)    ProjectManagementUnit ($3.3 millionat appraisal, $2.7 million actual). Funding
          the PMUand training its staff.

ImplementationArrangements

3.2       Formalresponsibility for the implementation o fAPIP was given to the Ministryo f
Agriculture, Forestry andFisheries.2 Inrecognitiono fthe limited capacity o f line units inthe
ministry, aProjectManagement Unitwas established at PhnomPenh, reportingto the
Secretary o f State for Agriculture, who also chaired a Project Steering Committee. The PMU
coordinated all budgets and implementationplans, oversaw national and international
procurement, performed project accounting and ensured appropriate auditing, monitoring,
evaluation and progress reporting, and hadoverallresponsibility for coordinating day-to-day
execution o f the project. Under this general management framework, individual project
components were undertaken within the competent Department o fthe Ministry.

3.3       Four components were implementedthrough the provincial directors o f agriculture
(agronomy, animal health, irrigation and agriculture services). The provincial offices
concerned were requiredto submit annual work plans andbudgets to the Provincial
Department o f Agriculture, althoughresponsibilityto approve budgets remainedat the
nationalPMUPSC.




2. The subsequentcreationof the Ministry o fWater ResourcesandMeteorology andthe transfer of the small-
scale hydraulics component to it created additional communications and coordination difficulties but these were
not critical to the outcome o fthe project.

                                                6


ImplementationExperience

3.4     Implementationwas initially delayedsix months becauseofpolitical unrest inmid-
1997 but slow planning and decisionprocesseswithinthe Ministryand the PMUcontinued
to delay progress andit was only inMarch 1999 that implementation appeared near a normal
rate. Legal amendments at that time rescheduled all key IDA and IFAD dates by two years,
including the Closing Date. At 30 months, disbursementswere again lagging 52 percent
behindthe revisedestimate and constructionhadnotbegunonmucho fthe infrastructure
plannedfor the project, includingMinistry facilities as well as irrigation schemes. It was only
withthe appointment ofa full-time Executive Project Coordinator in2000 that theproject
finally achieved a normal implementation rate.

3.5      The mid-term review in2001 notedthat progress varied among components from
highlysatisfactory to highlyunsatisfactory. A devaluation o fthe SDR since approval(from
US$1.44 to US$1.25) led to a reductioninboth the IDA credit andthe IFAD loan (from
US$27 millionto US$23.7 millionand from US$4.7 to US$4.2 million, respectively). The
MTRnotedthat the following achievements were among the factors that constituted "a solid
foundation for future agriculturalgrowth" and, by inference, grounds for continued support
o f the project, despite its delays:

     0  National strategies on seedproduction, animal health andproduction, water resources
         and agricultural education hadbeen drafted
     0  Laws hadbeendrafted onwater and fisheries
     0   Sub-decrees hadbeen issued on several sub-sectors
     0  4,000 farmers hadbeentrained inIntegratedPest Management (IPM)
        A hydrology information system hadbeenestablished
     0  The physical and humanresources o fthe ministries hadbeenimproved.

3.6      Onthis basis, project implementationwas assessedas satisfactory bythe MTR, and
the delays indisbursement were attributed to the decision to defer productive investments
untilsub-sector strategies hadbeendeveloped. (Onlyabout 21percent ofcredit's proceeds
hadbeen disbursed at that time, after four years.) However, linkingthe delays inproductive
investment to the slow development o f sub-sector strategies only appears indocumentation
after the MTR and seems to be more as a matter o f convenience thanaccuracy inaccounting
for the procedural difficulties inrolling out such a multifacetedproject. Following the MTR
four sub-sector components were regrouped into an Agricultural Educationcomponent that
would be implemented as a national strategy.

3.7     InDecember 2002, implementationprogress andcompliance was ratedunsatisfactory
for the first time, as was compliance with procurement procedures. Disbursement was only
38 percent o fthe IDA credit andimplementation was proceeding at halfthe pace anticipated
inthe MidTermReview. Nevertheless, the Governmentrequestedanextension ofthe project
by 18months to "extend the benefit o fproject activities to awider numbero fsmall farmers."

3.8     InMay2004, the implementationmissionnotedthat, "Since October 2003,
implementationhas continuedto proceed satisfactorily." The decisionwas taken that three
components would close on schedule June 30 2004 (Fisheries, Agricultural Educationand
HumanResource Development) while the remaining five components wouldbe extendedto

                                                7


December 31,2005. The last o fthe components was closed on December 31,2005, after 8.5
years and the cancellationo f23 percent o fthe original credit amount.

MonitoringandEvaluation

3.9      The design o fthe monitoring and evaluation system for this project reflects the range
o f objectives, from efficient implementationto impact onbeneficiaries and the lack of clarity
onhow the outcomes would be achieved. For each objective, measurable indicators were
identified, including a control sample for the impact assessment, and a specialist was
contracted to assist the borrower agencies to establish andmanage the monitoring system.
The indicatorswere a combination ofoutputs (quantity o f seedproduced, farmers trained,
and small-scale irrigation schemes completed) and outcomes (reduced mortality rates for
livestock; adoption rates for IPM).Inpractice, inadequate baseline data preventedex post
evaluationof some components. The effect o f these factors was that the M&E system proved
to be a goodmanagement tool for tracking inputs and outputs, but was less effective for
assessing outcomes.

3.10     The monitoring system was used effectively to flag issues for supervisionattention
and it provided a goodbase for the Mid-TermReview. Assessing outcomes, however, proved
more difficult, andonly limitedsurveys appear to have beenconducted to determine actual
adoption or performance rates to compare with appraisal targets (Table 2). Also with respect
to outcomes, no attempt was made to distinguish project effects from other complementary
initiatives or externalities inthe generally improving situationthat prevailed at the time o f
project completion. Financialreporting and compliance with financial covenants was
considered satisfactory throughout project implementation. The fact i s that the linkbetween
outputs and outcomes as reflected inthe statement o f objectives was very tenuous, and it is
only inthe few components with direct smallholder contact that such a linkcouldhavebeen
made. To that extent, monitoring and evaluationperformance was also a victim o fthe poor
formulation o f objectives. Insummary, the quality o fthe monitoring and evaluation is rated
modest indesign and implementation, substantial inutilization, andmodest overall.

Project Ratings

RELEVANCE
3.11    At a Consultative Group meetinginJuly 1996, the Government announced that its top
priority inthe development strategy was early and sustainable improvements inagricultural
production and the reductiono fpoverty inrural areas. The 1997 CAS specifically referred to
this project as animportant element o fits strategy o f enhancing rural development and
natural resource management. "This project i s designed to reach the small farmer directly
through improving agricultural support services.. .An important feature o f this project i s that
it is designedto help strengthenthe institutional capacity ofthe Ministryo fAgriculture."'
The CAS also referredto the importance o f strengthening humanresources, insupport of
which the project offered extensive training for MAFFpersonnel. The principal deficiency in
the relevance o f the project was the secondary importance implicitly attached to how the new

sustainability were also not adequately addressed.

3.12     By2000, the CASprioritieshadshiftedtoward "increasing accessto services and
productive a~tivities."~While capacity buildingto enhance the delivery o f these services was
still acknowledged, the focus was on delivery and on facilitating private sector investment in

                                                 9


income-generating activities. The dialogue during supervisionmissions shifted inthese
directions, but neither during the Mid-TernReview nor at any other time was a change in
project's objectives considered, nor was there any significant shift inresources or activities to
bringabout better communicationswith farmers. Almost five years after the project was
approved, the Project Status Report (PSR) o fMarch 2002 stated, "The project is ..   .preparing
actions leading to pilot testing o f effective mechanisms for interactionwith farmers." Why
was such an important issue broached so tentatively, so late? Because o fthe failures to
respond to the recognizedconcern o fhow the expanded MAFFcapacity would beused, and
to reflect the change inCAS priorities, the relevance o fthe project i s rated modest.

EFFICACY

3.13    The caliber o f training and facilities delivered under the project was appropriate and
the output targets o fmost activities were realized (Table 2). However, the issues o f
maintaining and exploiting the Ministry's capacity so as to generate "the sustainable and
broad-based improvement o f smallholder agriculture" were not adequately addressed.
Inadequate attentionwas paidto what programs, channels and resources would be usedto
reachthe small farmers who were supposed to be the maintarget o fthe enhanced service
capacity. The impact o f the project on agricultural productivity generally suffered from this
constraint, althoughnotable exceptions have also occurredwith respect to integrated pest
management, animalhealth (IFADcomponent), and small-scale irrigation. Also o f concern
interms ofrealizingobjectives is theunresolvedissueofterms ofemploymentinthepublic
sector and the risk o f large-scale movement o f qualified personnel to other employment,
either inthe private sector or amongdonors andNGOs. Interviews with MAFF leadership
duringthe IEGmissionconfirmedthat staffretentionis anongoing issue. Inaddition,
however, these visits reinforced the concern that the Ministryviewed capacity development
as an end initselfandnot interms o fthe relationship that needed to exist between the
Ministryandits clients.

3.14    At the time o fappraisal there wouldhavebeenvery little byway ofalternatives to the
Ministryas institutionaldeliverychannels for support to the agriculturalsector. There may
also have been some cohesive effect o f involving so many units within the Ministry inthe
project. Nevertheless, inview o fthe limited success o fpublic sector technical services to
agriculture, it mighthave been more effective to focus the project's support to the Ministry
on regulatory and strategic framework capacity and focus service delivery efforts on
developing alternatives such as local agencies, farmers' organizations, civil society and
private sector suppliers. Giving the Ministrya training and technicalbackstoppingrole in
relationto other delivery channels would have been one means of freeing the capacity
developed under the project from the constraint o fpublic funding that has so adversely
affected the sustainable impact o fwhat was accomplished.

3.15    The list o f project achievements is impressive, but they are outputs bynature, not
development results. The project did achieve a significant degree o f capacity buildingin
participating departments and a strengthened regulatory and strategic framework for
agricultural activities, andhence the capacity to contributeto the development o fthe rural
sector. However, beyond the demonstrations and training funded by the project, little thought
was given as to how that capacity would be used and only three components continue to have
a significant direct impact on smallholder productivity:

                                                     10


         The widespread adoption o fintegratedpest management
         The country's increased ability to fight contagious disease outbreaks among livestock
         Small-scale irrigation rehabilitation that significantly improved the lot o fparticipating
          producer^.^

3.16     Inrelationtotheelements intheproject's development objective, theoutputs are
distinctly clustered infavor o f "improving the quality and quantity o ftechnical, human and
physical resources." Concerning"assisting the Borrower to implement .                ..a coordinated
nationalprogram," the planned sub-sector strategies and background analysis wouldhave
beenmost usefulbut the achievement there was very modest, with most strategies not
adopted or implemented. But the poorest level o f achievement i s inthe area o f "promoting
sustainable development improvements" because o fthe failure to focus adequately onhow
the MAFFresources would beused to reach growers andhow they would be maintained in
the face o fbudgetaryconstraints and relatively poor conditions o f employment inline
ministries. Onbalance, achievement o f objectives i s rated as modest.

EFFICIENCY
3.17     The four sub-projects that were expectedto have a direct impact onproducers were
subjected to an "indicative" economic analysis at the time o f appraisal: animal health and
production, small-scale agricultural hydraulics, seed production andintegratedpest
management.

    0    AnimalHealthand Production.This component was given an estimated ERRo f36
         percent inthe S A R but no attempt was made inthe ICRto calculate a rate o f return.
         The ICR concluded, "The overall impact .particularly onpoorer farming
         households, hasbeen substantial       ...it     ..
                                                     i s unfortunatethat more attentionwas not paid
         to identifying a better means to quantify this result."6 Anecdotal evidence during
         PPAR field visits confirmed the significant improvement inanimal health that
         resultedfrom the project, particularly inthe control o f contagious diseases.

         Small-scaleAgricultureHydraulics. Eightout o ften schemes sampled hadERRSin
         excess o f the 25 percent estimated at the time o f appraisal.'

         SeedProduction.Givenanestimated ERRo f 17percent for first roundbenefits and
         38 percent for second roundbenefits at the time o f appraisal, this activity performed
         muchbelow expectations, andwould have had a strongly negative returnover 15-20
         years.

         IntegratedPestManagement(IPM). The base caseERRfor this activity inthe
         S A R was 26 percent. No overallreturn was calculated post-project, but two studies of
         sample areas confirmedpositiveresults. One study of farmers insix provinces
         showed net incomes 8.3 percent higher among IPMpractitionersindry-season

5. An economic analysis of a sample of ten small schemes indicates acceptable to very highrates ofreturn to
nine of them. (ICR, page 21)

        cultivation. Another study o f 247 farmers inseven provinces that adopted a range of
        practices from the project including IPMshowed increased incomes from several
        crops including a 13 percent increase innet income from vegetable production.

3.18    While three o fthe four foregoing components probably didmeet or exceed expected
returns, the failure o f other components to includeplans for their sustainability and their use
means that, overall, the investment inMAFF capacity buildinghasnot beencost-effective in
contributingto the objective o fimprovementsinsmallholder farmer productivity. The project
is therefore ratedmodestwith respect to efficiency.

OVERALL     OUTCOME
3.19    The statement o f objectives inthe S A R was very far reaching andmore inthe nature
o f a goal than that inthe D C A (Table 1).As implementationproceeded, staffbegan to come
to terms withthe fact that, to have animpact, capacity hadto be used, and PSRs, while cited
the S A R objective, went on to add the following: "building institutional capacity within
MAFF as ameans of(i) experience inthe planning, organizationandmanagement of
                           gaining
agricultural development programs, (ii)    adapting, testing and demonstrating improved
agricultural technology, and (iii) developing MAFFunderstanding and responsiveness to the
needs o f its client base." The PPARreview applauds the shift infocus o f staff efforts during
implementationtoward making effective use o f the increased capacity, but this was not
reflectedina change indevelopment objective or inincreased attentionby the Ministry to the
issues that would limit its ability to reach growers more effectively.

3.20    Withconsiderable delays andprocedural difficulties the projectdidcreate significant
improvements inthe technical, humanandphysicalresources o fthe ministry, but it didlittle or
nothingto addressthe programming, organizational or financial constraints to usingthose
resources for development. Most o fthe productive assets created bythe projectprovedto be
financially andeconomically satisfactory, but they have not served as a model for further
works bythe Ministry.The project didnot address issues o fdelivery mechanism, terms o f
employment, operating budget constraints andpublic/privatepartnerships, all o fwhich remain
serious challenges to the use o fthe capacity o fMAFFto affect change at the level o f
smallholder agriculture. Many o fthe personnel trained under the project havemovedonto
other positions inthe public andprivate sectors. Finally, the development objective refers to a
coordinated nationalprogramalthough the majority o f actual project activities were focused on
smaller geographic areas. Perhapsrampingup o fthe initial works was the strategy towardthe
nationalprogram, together with the results o fthe strategic studies, hadthey been adopted, but
limitedprogress inthese respects effectively precluded a coherent nationalresult o fthe project.

3.21    Inlookingatwhat was accomplishedundertheprojectandhowsustainableitsresults
maybe, one is faced withthe fact that very little thought appearsto have been givento how the
Ministry would actually useits increasedcapacity, beyondthe training andpilot demonstrations
fbndedbythe project. As aresult, the project cantake neither credit norblame for sector
performance, butit isusefulto note that Cambodia continues to have the lowest yieldo fall major
crops among SoutheastAsian countries andthe secondlowest rate ofgrowthinagricultural
productivityfor the decadeendingin2000. Morerecent growthhasbeenbetter, but still lessthan
other countries (andmainlyweather related), and employment inthe sector is growing at only 1.6
percentper annum.

3.22     The challenge now confronting the Government now insustaining andusingthe capacity
createdunderthe project i s two-fold: (a) obtaining adequatebudgetarysupport to maintainstaff
andfacilities andenablethemto operateeffectively, and(b) gaining the ownership andpolitical
commitment of stakeholdersto implementthe regulatory andstrategic fi-amework measures
developedunderthe project. The project didnot addressthe sustainableuse o fthe created
capacity early enoughduringimplementation andthe belated effort didnot become a significant
focus o fimplementation. Incontrast, IEGfinds that the last part ofthe project objective "to
promote sustainableagricultural development improvements throughout the Borrower's
territory" emergedas the critical element as the CAS andgovernment prioritiesshifted to
delivery o fservices. Inthe 16months sincethe project closed, there are indications that neither
the financial nor the ownership challenge i s beingsatisfactorily metbythe Borrower. Withthis
failure to adjust its objectives to clarifyits development focus, to become sustainable andto
remainrelevant, the overalloutcome o fthe project i srated moderately unsatisfactory. This
overall ratingis also consistentwiththe individualratings o frelevance, efficacy, andefficiency
(Table 3).

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT           OUTCOME

3.23     There are several significant risks to the development outcome o fthis project.
Principalamongthese i s the uncertainty o fpublic sector funding for the maintenance and
effective use o f the capacity created inMAFF.Public sector reforms are also a matter o f
continuing debate inCambodia because the compensation o fministerial staffi s too low to
permit incumbents to dedicate full time and effort to their work. This inturnhas givenrise to
a culture o f low expectations and diffbse responsibilities that are not conducive to
performance or accountability. While this is not a problem unique to this project, its long-
term results will be determinedto a great extent by the outcome o fthis issue.

BANKPERFORMANCE
3.24     The IEGmissionconfirms the finding inthe ICRthat three factors predisposed the
project to implementation problems: (a) its ambitious and complex design, (b) its vague and
hard-to-measure development objective, and (c) insufficient consideration o f sustainability
issues.8The ICR adds that an opportunity was missed at MTR to make substantive changes


8. ICR,page 27.

                                                      13


intheproject.BecauseBank staffandmanagersbecamepre-occupiedwithimplementation
delays andproceduralproblems, they didnot adequately reflect adequately on the direction
andpotentialimpact o f the project.

3.25     Overall, the Bank's performance i s ratedbeen moderatelyunsatisfactorydue to the
failure o fthe Bank to reflect lessons from earlier operations with respect to simplicity in
design, the failure to link capacity-building efforts inmost components to effective means o f
deliveringresults to growers, the failure to havebaseline data anda monitoringplaninplace
to assess results, and the apparent resignationto continuing donor fimding as the basis of
sustainabilityfurther support a critical rating for Bank performance. While the success o fthe
IPMandsmall-scale irrigationactivities offset this ratingto some extent,' theseactivities can
equally be said to have contained lessons for other components that were not picked up,
important among which was the active participation o fbeneficiaries. Finally, it appears that
the Bank reacted to the poor institutional capacity o fpost-conflict Cambodia with
conventional support to a line agency without consideringhow that capacity wouldbe used
or rendered sustainable, or how, infact it might have facilitated the development o f
alternative channels andmechanisms for the delivery o f services andproducts to the target
growers.

BORROWER       PERFORMANCE
3.26     The Borrower's performancehad an adverse impact on the project inseveral specific
ways, none uniqueto this project: counterpart hndingwas generally delayed, decision-
makingprocedures were complex andtime-consuming, particularly when financial
commitmentswere at issue, and overlappinglayers o fmanagement obscured authority and
added to delays. The procurement irregularities that surfaced late inthe project also had an
adverse impact onproject implementation. Overall, the Borrower's performance i s also rated
moderatelyunsatisfactory.

Componentsand Costs

4.1      Inpursuitofits development objectives, NVDP's components consistedofthe
following:

  (1)    ParticipatoryPlanningandInvestment($4.4 millionat appraisal, $3.6 million
         actual). Project investments that were mainly for rehabilitationor improvement of
         physical infrastructurethat directly supports economic activity wouldbe based on
         participatory planning at the commune andvillage levels, with the formation of
         Commune andVillage Development Committees (CDCsNDCs).

  (2)    InstitutionalStrengtheningand ProjectManagement($2.0 million at appraisal,
         $1.8 million actual). Comprised four sub-components: (a) fixed-price contracts for
         technical andmanagerial support, (b) rehabilitationo f government offices,

9. The other notable success, animal health, was designedby IFADand a Swedish consultant, and funded by
IFAD.

          (c) purchase o f vehicles and office/communicationequipment, and (d) incremental
          project operating expenses.

ImplementationArrangements

4.2       A Project ImplementationUnit (PIU)was set upinthe Ministryo fRural
Development (MRD) to manage this project and five person-years of TA were provided,
including an Institutional Development Advisor who would be ChiefTechnical Advisor. A
Project Operations Manual was to be submittedto IDAbefore sub-project disbursements
began. Also there were small ProvincialPIUs inthe four project provinces, including
additional TA funded by Japanesebilateral aid. (Provincial PIUSwould be under the
jurisdiction o fthe existingProvincialRural Development Committees, chairedby the
Governor): They would haveprimary responsibilityfor:

     0    Day to day implementationand oversight o f Commune Development
          CommitteesnTillage Development Committees"
     0    PRA training activities
     0    Sub-project development
          Provincial training andmonitoring.

4.3       CDCs and VDCs would implement sub-projects, including tendering, with the help of
local leaders and organizations. Terms o freference for all TA positions were included inthe
PAD. The implementationperiodwas initially seento bemid-1999 to October 2001.

ImplementationExperience

4.4       The NVDP was one o f several initiatives indecentralizationand the development of
local government capacity to plan and oversee development activities.' Othershad, over the
period since 1996 beenincorporatedinthe overall framework o f the SEILA Program, a
government initiative that evolved from a UNDP project CARERE into a framework for all
donor initiatives insupport o f decentralization and deconcentration.              l2 Despite its objective o f
supporting the development o f local government, the SEILA programtended to be top-down
initsapproachand, perhaps becauseofthe range ofdonorrequirements, to bevery
management-intensive. The Bank took the view that these were not the right qualities for a
program inremote under-served areas such as the targeted Northeast andthe Government
agreedto an LILto test a less management-intensive approach that worked directly with
local communities as well as with ProvincialRuralDevelopment Committees.l3

such a negative view of the Seila Program. At the time that NVDP was designed there was a legitimate
question about whether the locus for localplanning and development should be at the village or the commune

4.5      The PSR immediately following Effectiveness set the stage for the implementationo f
this project when it said that the Ministryo fRural Development (MRD) "is making a serious
effort to get the project offto a good start and, inparticular to ensure efficiency and full
transparency o f its operations, giventhe risks inherent inthe Cambodian en~ironment."'~But
byDecember 2000, 13 months after effectiveness, the supervisionmissionnoteddelays in
most activities. There hadbeen a change inthe Bank's Task Manager, and floods earlier in
the year hadmade the project area inaccessible, but within the project there were other
factors: Manualswere slow to be completedand the recruitment o f technical assistancewas
delayed. Prior approval o fprocurement plansby the Ministryo f Economic and Finance
(MEF) andits tendency to "micromanage" were cited as specific issues, inthe context ofa
general staff andmanagement capacity constraint inMRDthat hadbecome apparent when
the Secretary o f State hadreduced his personal involvement as the Project Steering
Committee Chairman." Facedwith the slowdown, he renewedhis strong support for the
project by committing to a series o f remedial actions. Formalities were initiated for the
transfer o f $500,000 o fproject proceeds to similar activities under a pilot military
demobilizationproject intwo additional provinces.16

4.6      With the renewed involvement o fthe Secretary o f State, implementationwas
satisfactory over the following 18 months and the Bank agreed to an extension o f the Closing
Date to account for the initial delays inprocurement and start-up. The Project Steering
Committee was replaced by a full time Project Director and DeputyDirector and as o f May
2002 disbursements were less than 2 percent behind the revised schedule. ByDecember
2003, all village-level training and all 120infrastructure projects hadbeencompleted,
construction o fthe latter was considered satisfactory, as was the environmentalassessment o f
each. The Bank agreed to a six-month delay inthe closing date to permit the use ofproject
proceeds to access alternative mechanisms to continue to provide support to village level
initiatives. This was useful not only inthe context o f the project's LIL status, but also inview
o fthe Government's decisionto shift the focus of its decentralizationefforts from the village
to the commune level. The project was closed on June 30,2004, after 5 years and 1month,
with total cost unchanged at US$ 6.3 million.

14. PSR, 12/22/1999, Current Project Status.
15. Inits comments, the Region states that "Part o f the reason for the reduced involvement of the Secretary of
State was that he became Minister and had less time for direct engagement inthe project. That is the main
reasonthat the Project Steering Committee Structure was replacedwiththe Project Director and Deputy
Director."

16. Other donors had agreed to a Bankrequest to shift resources from several of their projects to support a pilot
project inmilitary demobilization, the condition being that the activities of their own local rural development
projects would notbe left under-funded. The Bank subsequently arranged the transfer o fNVDPfunds to fill this
gap.

Project Ratings

RELEVANCE

4.9      NVDP's relevance interms o f the Bank's andthe Government's strategy duringthe
periodhinges on the fact that bothparties recognized that decentralizationand
deconcentration o f government were essential to development beyond a narrow corridor
between urbancenters. And it was inthese rural areas that poverty and the development gap
were most prominent. Specifically, the project supported three goals inthe prevailing CAS of
1997: (a) enhancing rural development and natural resource management, (b) improving

                                                17


human resources andreducingpoverty, and (c) strengthening institutional capacity. Inits first
FiveYear Socio-Economic DevelopmentPlanfor the period 1996 to 2000, the Government
committed itself to decentralized rural development using a participatoryandbottom-up
approach. Duringthe life o fthe project, the Government's strategy for the delivery o frural
services evolved from several pilot initiatives to a nationwide program o f elected
Communes/Sangat Councils (C/SCs) as the cornerstone o f local government with planning,
budgetingand implementation authority.

4.10     Fundingfor development inrural areasis still essentially a nationalresponsibility,
withonly a smallportionofresources devolvedto localunits,17 but the patternhasbeen
established andthe general consensus i s that the share o f resources managed at local levels
will continueto increase. Against this backdrop, the members andofficers ofthe 120VDCs
supportedbythe project have importantroles to play as an initial core o f experienced
participantsinthe C/SCs. A limitingfactor inthe relevance o f this project i s the fact that the
plannedfull-scale follow-on project was not developed but, instead, a Rural Investmentand
Local Government Project (RILGP) was developed which conforms more directly to the
commune-based structure that the Government has adopted. Nonetheless, giventhe project's
contribution to the Provincial RuralDevelopment Committees and its effectiveness within
the new system o f persons and organizations formed locally under the project, the relevance
o f the project i s ratedsubstantial.

EFFICACY
4.11 The project had substantial achievements inintroducingparticipatorypoverty-focused
rural development approachesinunderserved areas and ingaining and disseminating
experience inthe management o f such programs. It worked with local communities to
establish the structure andbuildthe capacity for participatoryplanning o f local infrastructure
and facilities. Contrary to the concern over the political base o f emerging local government,
the Government saw the VDCs and other local entities as a promisingvehicle to deliver
services and gainrecognitioninthe heretoforewidely inaccessible hinterland o fthe country.
The success o fNVDP and similar operations has been animportant factor inconsolidating
the support o f ruralpopulations for the current Government. Another important feature o fthe
project was its achievement inusingprovincial "promoters" and detailed proceduralmanuals
to work with localpopulations intheir efforts at self-determination. The "Local Development
Process" codifiedbest practices into a series o f guidelines that couldbe taught to village
populations, andusedby themto comply with the regulations o f government and donors
without the costly layers o f centralized specialists. The efficacy o fthe project i s rated
substantial, falling short o f a highratingonly bythe limited extent to which specific results
such as the local development process couldbe mainstreamed into the rapidly evolving
structure o fthe Government's decentralizationand rural development strategy.

EFFICIENCY
4.12    No rate o freturnanalysis was done either during appraisal or uponcompletionbut
surveys o f sub-project beneficiaries indicatevery highlevels o f satisfaction. Onthe
institutional development side, several observations offer subjective evidence o frelative

17. The Commune/SangkatFundis the inter-governmental fiscal transfer mechanismfrom the
national to the commune level. It fundsbothdevelopment andadministrationat the commune level.

efficiency. The project operated inone o fthe most inaccessible and underserved parts ofthe
country; floods duringthe first year caused serious delays instart-up; and mostproject
villages hadno development councils beforeproject start-up. Despite these significant
impediments, the project achieved its output and development objectives within budget. In
the years since the C/SCs came into being, many representatives o f villages trained under
NVDP have risento places o f leadership and responsibilityinthe newly elected government
bodies. Perhaps o f equal importanceis the fact that village and commune committees
supported bythe project have beeneffective representatives o f local needs and interests in
the dialogue surrounding the growing importance o f the ProvincialRural Development
Committees. While anecdotal innature these are important indications o fthe results o f the
preparatory work conducted by the project and o f the sustainable impact o f the project onthe
role o f local representatives indetermining the development priorities o f their communities.
Efficiencyis rated substantial.

OVERALLOUTCOME
4.13       This project met the preponderance o f its development objectives fully. It introduced
decentralized participatory poverty focused approaches to rural development infour
underservedprovinces inthe north. The experience gained under the project has contributed
to the nationalprogram o fcommune-levelplanning and contractingunder elected C/SCs and
to the links between commune committees and their member village development
committees. The project also trainedpractitionerswho have found an active role inthe
Government's evolving programo f localplanning and development. The only dimension o f
its objectives on which it fell short was the extent to which the tools developed under the
project were disseminated to and adopted by the mainstreamgovernment program for
decentralization andrural development that followed the project.

4.14      The anticipated follow-on projectwas not developed for a variety o freasons, not the
least o fwhich was the Government's decision to focus local development at the commune
level, each commune consistingo f several villages.I8 Nevertheless, the VDCs supported by
the project continue to play an important role inlinking official planning to the village level
and inproviding trained and experienced members to the C/SCs. Despite initial delays in
start up, due inpart to the 2000 floods as well as the typical procedural delays encountered in
most projects duringthe period, the project achieved all o f its tangible outputs, including
local infrastructure and facility sub-projects in 120 villages infour Northernprovinces.
Villages intwo additional provinces inthe Northwest also receivedsub-projects. The overall
outcome o fthe project i s ratedsatisfactory (Table 5).

R I S K TO DEVELOPMENT          OUTCOME
4.15      The risk to development outcome is moderate. The commune development councils
andtheir overseeing Provincial RuralDevelopment Committees are the mainelements o fthe
Government's decentralization and deconcentration program. These are gaining recognition
and momentum and so far have not raisedpolitical concerns. An Organic Law has been
draftedthat sets out the sharing o fresponsibilitiesamong different levels o f government, and

18. Infact, the Rural Investment and Local Governance Project couldbe considered as the sequel to NVDP in
that it drew fiom the initial experience under N V D P and adapted its structure andprocedures to the commune-
level and the growingrole ofthe Provincial Rural Development Committees.

                                                 19


it is expectedto reinforce the role o fthe C/SCs. These developments point to apromising
future for sustaining the institutional and humandevelopment that took place under NVDP.
Its villages and its trainees are finding active participation and leadership at the commune
level incontinuationo fwhat was initiated under the project, and its Provincial Rural
Development Committees will gradually receive more authority and resources to apply the
experience andprocedures they have gained.

4.16     It shouldbe notedthat the ICRwas completedinJune 2005, at a time when the future
outlet for the developments under NVDP were not as clear. The planned full-scale follow-up
to the project hadnot materialized and the ICR shared the concern o f some Borrower
commentators that the sustainabilityo fthe project was indoubt. "The prospect o fbroader
sustainability was diminished largely becausethere has beenno follow-up financing to the
LIL,rather thanto a specific shortcomingofNVDP." Developmentssincethat timein
furthering the role o f C/SCs and illustrating the relevance o fNVDP people andprocedures
have mitigated this concern to a great extent.

BANKPERFORMANCE
4.17     The Bank's performance was satisfactory inpreparationand supervision. The project
concept was effective ingivingrural populations an active part inthe development o ftheir
respective communities andindelivering resources to widely scattered locations inthe
country. This PPARparticularly notes o f the work o f the responsible regional staff during
supervision, for their extra efforts to include remote areas intheir regular supervision
itineraries and for the collaborative and helpful approach taken to addressing implementation
problems with the counterpart units at different levels. This extra effort was no doubt a
critical factor inthe success o fthe project and o fits integrationinto the overall
decentralization program o fthe Government.

BORROWERPEWORMANCE
4.18     The Borrower's performance was also satisfactory-working closely with the Bank
team duringpreparation andperformingits management role duringimplementationina
timely and effectivemanner.The poor performance bythe initialtechnical assistant addedto
the burdeno fthe Ministryand its decentralized PIUS,but a sense o f collaborationbetween
the Bank and the Borrower seems to have carried participating officers through the extra

challenges. The commitment o fthe senior leadership o fthe Ministryo f Rural Development
duringtheperiodofproject implementationwas also a positive factor.

        An Independent Monitor o fForest Crime (Global Witness) was initially supportedby
an FAO/UNDP grant inturn fundedby Germany andDenmark. When Global Witness's
contract was terminated inDecember 2002, recruitment o f another monitor was initiated, and
the Bank agreed to the Government's request that the new monitor be funded out o fproject
proceeds. Societe Genkrale de Surveillance (SGS) was selected.

5.3     The project was modified slightlyinDecember 2003, following the mid-termreview,
to fund landuse planning andprotection activities by the Wildlife Conservation Society
within a former concession area andto improve the consultative process with communities in

These are only available by expenditure category: works, goods, services, etc.

and near forest concessions, particularly vulnerable communities whose well-being was tied
to the future o fthe concessions.20

ImplementationArrangements

5.4      The Department o fForestryandWildlife, Forest Administration Directorate, worked
with local governments and concessionaires to implement this project, usinga P M Ufor
overall control and coordination and different directorates for each component. Donor grants
were placedina Trust Fundfor the forest crime component, whichwouldbe overseen by an
inter-ministerial committee. For financial management and auditing, the then-current practice
was that all payments requiredpre-authorizationby the Financial Controller inthe Ministry
o f Economy andFinance before commitment. To overcome weaknesses at the Department
level, the project undertook to establish a Project Accounting System at the level of the
PMU, fashioned after a model developed underan Asian Development Bank (ADB)project.
The PMUwould hire a Project Accountant andinternational auditors acceptable to IDA.A
special account would be established at the National Bank or an authorized commercialbank
andmanaged bythe PMU. Disbursement would be based on withdrawal applications
supported by full documentation or Statement o f Expenditures. The MEFwould also
establish a separatebank account to ensure the timely availability o f counterpart funds.

ImplementationExperience

5.5       Inits PSRofDecember 2000, lessthantwo monthsafter theprojectwas declared
effective, the Regionreported that the Forest Administration (FA) was "advancing on a number
o ffronts to performits expanded functions." Recruitmento ftechnical assistanceandthe
development o f a draft Forest Law proceededwell duringthe first year, with some minor
delays inthe Forest Crime component due to differingprocedural requirements among donors.

5.6       Thetone ofthe PSRs duringthe first 18monthspositiveinterms o fbothprogress and
the commitment o fthe FA. But the PSR o fJune 2002 signaled an ominous development -the
resurgenceo fillegalloggingwithin concessions andthe reluctance o fthe Government to apply
credible sanctions-andincreasedthe summary risk rating o fthe project from substantial to
high.The report notedthat, althoughthe "mechanical" implementationoftheprojectwas
proceeding well, there was no indicationthat the development objectives were beingpursued,
which would inthe first instance have requiredthe exercise o f"reasonable remedies inthe face
o fconcession abuse." Compliance with safeguard policies was rated for the first time int h s
report, and all applicable ratings were satisfactory, although indigenous people, natural
habitats, culturalproperty and environmental assessmentswere all, at the time, subjects of
criticismbyrepresentatives o f civil society.

5.7      ByDecember of2002, implementationwas ratedas unsatisfactory ineveryreported
category other than procurement procedures. The FA hadrelaxed several o fthe requirements
for Forest Management Plans, resisted disclosure o f the plans and their associated



20. Resin collectionreceived a great deal o f attention inthe debate over this project, butthere are multiple
forms o f non-timber forest gathering that comprise an important component ofthe income o f many
communities near or withinthe concessions.

                                                       22


Environmentaland Social Impact Assessments, andhadnot enforced a sound approach to
consultationwith affectedcommunities.

5.8      The PSRreportedthat relationswithNGOshad"deteriorated intomutualmistrust
and animosity." There are some 1600 active national and internationalNGOs inCambodia.
Freedomo fthe press and the close relationship o f these NGOs with donor projectshave
given them an unusually strong voice inCambodian affairs and the momentum o fpublic
opinion began to take on a life of its own, independent o f the actual issues facing the project.

5.9      The NGO that hadbeen contracted as the Project's Independent Monitor of forest
crime engaged ina widespread public information campaign against the project, depicting
the FA and the Bank as accomplices inthe abuses o fthe forest concession system. Global
Witness released its views as well as its reports directly to the press andpublic rather than to
the FA and other authorities charged withproject implementation. At the end o f 2002, the FA
terminated the contract o f Global Witness and, inNovember 2003, following agreement with
the Bank to use project proceeds, it recruited SGS as the new Independent Monitor.21
Following the termination o f its contract, Global Witness remained inCambodia, actively
investigating activities inforest regions and organizing opposition to the project.22

5.10     Interms offorest concessionmanagement, this periodcontinuedto beacontrast
between modest progress indeveloping a regulatory and logistical framework andthe slow
progress against illegal logging. It i s important to note amidthe negative rhetoric and
problems o fthis project that it was infact makingprogress insome important aspects o f
developing and implementing a forest concession management framework. InDecember
2001, the Government hadissueda decree suspending loggingpermits untilthe approvalo f
new forest concession management plans. It also required an inventory o f logs felled prior to
that date and the cessation of logtransport permits. The result was a significant reduction in
the level o f illegal logging andhadthe Bank andthe Borrower been able to focus at that time
on getting concessionaires to fbrther their management plans, the break inlogging could have
had a very positive effect on the long-term sustainabilityo f the industry. Inthe first halfo f
2003, a mid-term review o fthe project was conducted and an actionplan developed and
agreed with the Government to return the project to satisfactory status.23Eventhough two o f
the elements o f this plan were more effective community consultations and public
informationdisclosure, relationswith civil society continued to deteriorate.

5.11 An internalBank review conducted inlate 2003 at the request o fthe Region found
that the project continued to offer a usefulbasis for capacitybuildingand procedural reform.,
althoughit did go on to criticize the shortcomings o fthe Bank and the Government inthe
handlingo fpublic relations surrounding the project.



21.Global Witness continuedworlung inCambodia, with funding fromUSAIDfor about 15 months, and
waging its campaign against the project and the concession system.
22. Fundingfor these activities was provided byUSAIDfor about 15 months after the project contract was
terminated.
23. The Bank hadproposedand all concerned had agreed that other donors wouldparticipate inthis review, but
as public criticism of the project mounted, donors gradually withdrew and ultimately the review was conducted
onlybythe Bank andthe Government.

                                               23


5.12    A consultative workshop heldinNovember 2003 with stakeholders includingNGOs
and other donors resultedin"strong support for the continuation o fthe project."24 Under
Current Project Status, the 12/03 PSR notes, however, that "a few NGOsvoiced opposition
to any continuationonthe basis o f governance weakness anddoubts about the good faith
intentions of the government."

5.13    Notwithstandingthe outspoken criticism o f the project from civil society onone hand
andpressure from senior levels o f government for continued ad hoc waivers on the other, the
FAtook animportant decisionto regainsome development impact for the project: it
reinstated the requirement that concessions prepare five-year compartment plans as part o f
their strategic forest management plans. These compartment plans are the critical component
o f forest management packages, on which actual logging operations are based.

5.14    Onthe basis of agreements reached duringthe mid-term review, the project was
formally restructured, with the addition o fpost-concession area management and the
recruitment o f a community forest specialist. The Bank agreed to a six-month extension o f
the closing date to permit further follow throughwith concessionaires who hadproduced
reasonable first drafts o f their management plans and the FA agreed to an independent review
o f concessionaires' Sustainable Forest ManagementPlans, commissionedby donors. In
addition, the Bank and the Government agreed to an independent review o f the forestry
sector. Implementationpickedup andthe status o f the project with respect to its development
objective was upgraded to satisfactory.

5.15    Inthe earlymonthsof2004, the focus ofcriticism oftheprojectwas increasingly on
affectedcommunities, o f which many consisted o f indigenous peoples. The FA engaged a
sociologist to assist indevelopingmore effective means o f consultationwith affected
communities andthe supervision missionrecommended the preparationo f a Highland
Peoples Development Framework. A social impact analysis that would normally have been
conducted as part o fproject appraisal hadbeen deferred for inclusioninthe detailed work of
the compartment management plans o f concessionaires on the grounds that it was only inthis
context that specific circumstances wouldbe known. Nevertheless, the decisionnot to
conduct this analysis prior to the project made it vulnerable to charges o fneglect inthis
sensitive area. The decisionto conduct a framework analysis following the Mid-Term
Review was a constructive attempt to capture issues inforest communities as far as the
information at that point would permit, but it didnot satisfy civil society oppositionto forest
concessions.

5.16    Inthe final supervisionreportbeforethe procurement problemsbrokeacross the
Bank's Cambodia portfolio inthe first half o f 2006, the Regionreported good progress in
most areas o f implementation and initial discussions about the conditions andthe broadened
scope o f a follow-up operation for the Bank inthe forestry sector. While this mayhave been
an accurate reflection o f discussions andprogress within the FA, it didnot reflect the rapidly
deteriorating sentiment toward the project withincivil society, or toward the Bank as an
accomplice to what was perceived as abuse o f the country's forest resources.

alleged to have arisen as a result of the Bank having ignored its own operating policies and procedures.

5.18      IEG's assessmenti s that the InspectionPaneldidnot fully appreciate the technical
merit ofthe project or the complementarity ofother Bank initiatives affecting the forest
sector (see Bank Management's comment 1inTable 6), but correctly pointed out the fact that
the interest o f forest communities within or near the concessions hadnot been adequately
considered or protectedup to the point o f its investigation.

5.19      The project was extended twice, initially 18months to continue the forest sector
reformprocess and then an additional six months to continue support for the new
independent forest crime monitor (SGS). It was closed on December 31,2005.

Monitoring andEvaluation

5.20      The PAD correctly commentedthat implementationmonitoringwould "pose few
difficulties as there (were) a limitednumber o f essential procurement actions and technical
assistance assignments." But interms o f impact it referredto policy dialogue and the
voluntary submission o f concessionaires to independent audit byqualified external experts.
This degreeofoptimism originatedperhaps from the experience o fconcession forestry in
some OECD countries where the public supervisiono f concessions tends to be rigorous, but
ithadno bearingonthe situationthe project would encounter. Finally, the PADreferredto
joint monitoring o finitial project phaseswith ADB inanticipation o f the latter developing a
follow-on project for full-scale implementationo f the results o f the FCMCPP. The
development o f such a project didnot materialize.

management) were not rated inthe following two years. An unsatisfactoryrating o f financial
management inDecember 2002 brought a renewed focus on this aspect o f implementation,
andratings from December 2003 to the end o fthe project were considered satisfactory. A
more rigorous approach to settinginterimperformancetargets and linkingthem to strategic
outcomes would havebeena useful exercise indesign discipline, but the political
circumstances surrounding the project wouldprobably have limited the effect o fthis effort in
terms ofimproved implementation. The quality o fmonitoring and evaluation i s ratedmodest
indesign, implementation, utilization, andoverall.


Project Ratings

RELEVANCE
5.22     The relevance o f the project i s rated substantialboth interms o f economic
development potential and inrelationto the Bank's andthe Government's strategic priorities.
The 1997 CAS identifiednaturalresource management as one o fits priorities, along with
strengthening institutional capacity. The 2000 CAS, indraft at the time o fproject approval,
saidthat "the government has made forestry reform a top priority andhas adopted a detailed
reform program endorsed at the highest level. Forestryreform is ...being implemented in
partnership with IDA, the ADB, the FAO, UNDP, Australia and the UK."27It went on to
emphasize the importance o fbuildingthe foundations o f sustainable development as its
strategic priority, among which it listed good governance. Its second strategic priority was
enhancing natural resource management. The Bank's StructuralAdjustment Credit of that
year included the drafting o f a new ForestryLaw as part o f the policyreformpackage and the
FCMCPwas to be the investment vehicle for the development o fregulations andprocedures
for the application o fthat legislation.

5.23     Timber represented a valuable asset for the Cambodian economy at the time o f
project approval, with the civil war having ineffect protectedthe forests from 30 years of
exploitation that hadreduced the forests o f other countries inthe regionto a fraction o ftheir
1960's value. Interms o f the environment, there were also important biodiversity and
ecosystem considerations, some o f which, such as water retentionandrunoff, extended far
beyond forestry landto affect other segments o fthe economy. People inandnear
concessions had developed complex cultural and economic relationshipswith the forests.
Withthe lowlands fullypopulatedandutilized, the stewardship o f forestry lands represented
the future o f expansion for most land-based economic activity. Evidence o f this today canbe
taken from the fact that it i s reported that 70 percent o fEconomic Land Concessions are on
Forest Land.

5.24     Some earlier reviews, includingthat o f the Bank's InspectionPanel, found the
FCMCPP to represent an unbalanced approach to the forest sector bythe Bank, one that left
critical aspects o f the sector unaddressed. This PPARconcludes on the contrary that this
project was infact an appropriate and important pieceo f a broader Bank approach to the
sector. It was, for a time, the most visible component, but it was a logical follow-up to
strategic measures inforest law andpolicythat the Government had committed to under the

 Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC); it addressedthe most urgent and highlyvisible threat to
the forest sector; and it was the result o f careful sector analysis under the auspices o f FAO,
UNDP and the Government as well as the Bank. The issueso fbiodiversity andprotectedarea
management were the subject o f a separate operation conducted inparallel (Bio-Diversity
 and Protected Area Project). Initial support for community forestry and localparticipation in
 resource management were addressed as part of other projects that focused on
 decentralization and local capacity building.

 5.25     Forest concessions had initially beengranted on virtually all forest land, butby 2000
most o fthe areahadbeenrecognizedas unable to support industrial forestry and about three
millionharemainedunder concession. Improperly managed logging for processing and
 export represented an imminent threat to forestry resources inthese concessions and it was
 consistent with government priorities andthe analysis o f the Bank andother donors that an
 operation shouldbe undertaken to focus on forest concession management.

 EFFICACY
 5.26     The project didnot succeed indemonstrating or improving the effectiveness o f a
 comprehensive set o f forest management and operations guidelines and control procedures.
Nor didit establish an effective forest crime monitoringandprevention capability. The
 efficacy o f the project i s therefore rated negligible inrelation to the achievement o f its two
 objectives.

 5.27     The urgencyo fintroducingrationalmanagement into forest exploitation was also a
 factor inthe choice o f lendinginstrument but, inretrospect, the Bank and the project paid a
 highpricefor the choice ofthe LILfor this operation. Simplifiedprocessing meant more
 rapidproject approval and there was a clear logic to the underlying assumption that detailed
 environmentaland social impact assessments needed to bemade inthe context o f concession
management plans andnot as a general exercise inappraising the project. After all, the
project was to develop the framework andprocedures for sustainable concession
management plans, and it was inthe subsequent application o f that framework that
 environmentaland social impact assessmentwould be important. However, the deferral o f
 this analysis gave more scope for criticism duringimplementationand, more importantly,
normal safeguardswere compromised as a result o fthe delays and the poor quality o f the
 analysis that was eventually performedby concessionaires as part o f the draft management
plans.28

 5.28     Global Witness and other NGOs focused on the importance o fnon-timber forest
resources inthe livelihood o f local communities, and the infringement o f concession logging
on those activities (Box 1). Supervisionmissions endeavored to improve the local
consultative process to be used inthe development o fmanagement plans, and the mid-term
review ledto some strengthening o f these consultations but public opinionwas drivenby
other factors: the continuedneglect o fthe interests o f local communities inthe ongoing legal
 and illegal loggingoperations and the inadequate response o f concessionaires inapplying the
consultation guidelines.

5.29      These vulnerabilities inthe project -addressing the highlycontroversial issue o f
industrial logging and deferringsocial impact assessment -occurred inthe environment o f
a very active civil society, non-transparent awards to forest rights, and extremely limited
oversight capacity. The result was a rapidly escalating public campaignby civil society to
condemn the concession system and those organizations that were seen to support it,
including the Bank.Unfortunately, this level o fpress attentionplacedheavy demands on the
time and focus ofthe Bank's countrymanagement team and senior management at a critical
time inproject implementation

5.30      This PPAR finds that, while sensitivity to social andpolitical concerns earlier inthe
project implementationmight have reduced the level o f criticism, the strategic error interms
o f development impact was the failure o fthe Bank to insist on the value for the project o f
developing a sound management framework for an important part o f the forestry sector. The
rhetoric against the concession system o f forest management flies inthe face o f successful
experience inmany economies with a significant forest sector. It i s the lack o f a sound
management system and the legal and administrative framework for enforcement that gives
rise to the abuses that are associated with this form o fmanagement insome developing
countries, and creating that framework was the object o fthe project.

Box 1. Global Witness as an IndependentForestCrime Monitor
This UK-basedNGOwas not selectedfroman international competitionbutwas appointed -a procurement
aberration that resulted from the peculiar funding arrangements for the contract (UNDP sponsoredbut GTZ
funded). The organization didnothave experience inforestry management and operations and the IEGmission
found that the fmdidnot recruit people for this assignment that hadprofessional training or experience in
forestry operations. The Forest Administration (FA) formally advised the Bank o f its concern as to the
competence o f the team soon after the contract began. The main strength o f GlobalWitness (GW) was its
ability to establish an information network among widely scattered rural communities and to establish
relationships that would encourage the flow o f information through that network. Infact, GW did achieve a
remarkable level o f information flow concerning forest crime inCambodia.

However, GW chose to go beyond its mandate o f assisting the client to "systematically and regularly monitor
illegal logging and to launch effective prevention activities", and initiated an aggressive public campaign o f
exposure and criticismtargeting all parties associated withthe concession system. Inaddition to operating
outside its terms o f reference, GW: (a) lackedthe qualified staff to conduct a realistic analysis o f commercial
options and to gain the confidence o fprofessionals within concessionaire f m s or government agencies, and
(b) was unable to recognize the merits of gradual andpartialsolutions to resource exploitation issues. Its
approach to protection left little roomfor compromise and GW soonbegan to act as though all the FA and
visiting Bankpersonnel were culprits. Itrefusedto circulate its findings internally for discussion or adaptation,
preferring insteadto release reports and charges directly to the public or to the press. By the end o f 2002,
communications withthe FA hadbasically ceased, and the latter terminatedthe contract.

EFFICIENCY
5.3 1 No financial or economic analysis was conducted as part o f appraisal for this
operation andno quantitative analysis was done upon completion. The genesis o fthis project
interms ofsector work, policy dialogue andstrategic consultations was very efficient inits
collaboration among donors and its consultative process. Indesign, it was a logical
investment link to SAC conditions. While the risks attendant to the project objectives were
highunder any circumstances, the decisionto usethe LILinstrumentresulted ingreater
vulnerability to criticism and distraction from implementation. Inretrospect, a framework
analysis o f environmental and social issueswould have flagged concerns to bebuilt into the

                                                      29


design o f management plans and would have illustratedthe Bank's awareness o fthose issues
before criticism gained momentum. Itwould also have beenuseful interms o fresponding to
concerns about the Bank's approach to forestry to have introducedmore visible consultation
and cross-referencing amongthe several projects that were being implemented during the
same period. Finally, it wouldhave been a useful indication o f government commitment to
rational forest management to require the issuance o f a prakas (ministerial order) at the time
o f approval or effectiveness, putting concessionaires on notice as to the importance of the
management plan process. As it was, time was lost and quality suffered from the posturing of
concessionaires who hoped that this imposition wouldjust go away. The efficiency o f the
project is therefore rated as negligible.

OVERALLOUTCOME
5.32     Theproject fell significantly short on bothobjectives o f (a) demonstrating or
improving the effectiveness o f a comprehensive set o f forest management with operational
guidelines and control procedures, and (b) establishing an effective forest crime monitoring
andpreventioncapability. Nevertheless the elements o f a concession management system
were developed and corresponding review and approvalprocedures introduced. FA staff and
managers were trained intheir oversight roles and at least some o fthe concessionaires made
credible first attempts at developingmanagement plans. The suspension o f logging on all
concessions pending approval o fmanagement plans didresult ina reductioninthe rate of
forest depletion, althoughthis effect is diminishing with the continuedpassage o f time.29
Illegal and uncontrolledlogging i s still at lower levels than pre-project, and aimed at
satisfying only domestic timber demand.

5.33     Thehiatus inorganization andmanagement ofthe forest sector since the suspension
o f concessions i s itself an indication o f the pivotal role the project was playing. Finally,
recent government petitions to the Bank to consider re-enteringthe forest sector indicate
recognition on the part o f the client that the Bank has demonstrated its credibility and its
capacity to foster more rational exploitation o ftimber resources.

5.34     At the time ofproject appraisal, itwas already knownthat a significant number of the
concessions were not viable becauseo f their inadequate resource base or were inappropriate
because o f their overlap with densely populated areas o fmultipurpose forest land. The task
team took the view that arbitrary cancellation o f unsuitable concessions would behighly
contentious andtherefore didnot discriminate among concessions, leaving selection to the
guidelines that would be developed for the management planningprocess. While this was a
technically rational approach, it didnot take advantage o f available informationto limit
social and environmentaldamage duringthe periodwhen the management plans would be
developed. It also lee the project muchmore vulnerable to criticism on these grounds than it
wouldhave been ifit had focused on a sub-set of concessions that hadmore appropriate
resources and circumstances for concession operations.

5.35     The restructuringo fthe project that occurred after the MTRwas an attempt to ensure
better consultations with communities affectedby the concessions, but it was a statement o f

29. More than three years on, economic interests have found a way around the suspension, by acquiring
Economic LandConcessionsfor whichuse controls are not beingenforced, and usingths avenue to gain access
to timber, 70 percent of such ELCs beinglocatedon forest lands.

intentthat was not effective inthe remainingproject periodto address community concerns.
The suspension o f legal logging, the shift to economic land concessions as an alternative to
forestry concessions, and the rapidly polarizedpublic opinion on forestry effectively
preemptedmeaningful consultationinthe remainingproject period. The overall outcome of
the project is therefore ratedunsatisfactory (Table 8).

5.36     The major risk identified at the time o f appraisal was the commitment andthe
capacity o f the Government to enforce rationalmanagement o f forest resources on
concessionaires and that risk didmaterialize, with concession operations being characterized
byunsustainable cutting rates andpractices, evasion o froyalty payments and delayed
response to the development o f management plans. Eventhe ban on logging, declared in
response to strong public objectionto the situation inthe concessions, could not be fully
enforced. Another important risk which developed duringproject implementationwas the
risk that the Bank (and the Government) would become distracted by activist groups and
public opinion advocating either ideal solutions or cessation and lose sight o fthe practical
strategy o fmaking gradual progress inthe extremely difficult environment o f forest
exploitation. Therefore, the risks to development outcome are rated significant.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.37     To appreciate the overallperformance o f the Bank as a development organ inthis
case it i s necessaryto look at the distinct roles and conduct o f each o f several units. There
was broadconsensus and good collaboration among units during the analyticalphase leading
upto project identification, whenthe Bankworked with other donors on sector analysis and
the development of a forest sector strategy. This was also a periodduringwhich the
consultation process with the Government was effective. With the start o f implementation,
however, different elements and interests within the Bank began to emerge, related to several
circumstances surrounding the project:

    0    Actions under this project were disbursement conditions for the release o f the second
         tranche o fthe SAC, and these became a major concern for those interested inthe
         structural adjustment process.

    0    Forest exploitationi s a lighteningrod for environmental interests groups and the
         Bank, to its credit, hadbeenwilling to take on a difficult task. While other donors
         collaborated on specific components, their roles were less visible and less strategic.

                                                        31


     0   The coalition Governmentbroke down inarmed conflict inmid-1997 and, while
         elections in 1998 restored the democratic process, the legitimacy o f continuing to
         supportthe government was a periodic subject o fpublic debate insome Bank
         member countries, andthe result was a shift ingeneral sentiment toward more
         rigorous performanceand safeguard standards than might have been insistedon under
         different circumstances.

     0   Deferred consideration o fthe social impact o f forest concessions contributedto
         puttingproject activities inconflict with the non-timber use o f forests by forest
         villagers who enjoyed strong NGO support.

     0   Concessionaires included companies that hadbeenprominent logging interests inthe
         forests o f other countries inthe region, the degradationo fwhich was widely known,
         and a stock theme o f advocacy NGOs.

     0   Procurement irregularities had surfaced inthe Cambodiaportfolio, so that fiduciary
         concerns demanded a significant degree o f staff and management attention.

         As a small country inthe EAPregion, Cambodia didnot have either aresident
         mission or full-time sector personnel inthe field until2001. Oversight and technical
         support were providedby missions from Washington and Bangkok, andmissions
         were not as widely staffed as would be the case with larger projects and c~untries.~'
         As aresult, itwas more difficult for the Task Team Leader to acquire and update
         information duringimplementation, develop good working relationships with
         implementing agencies and foster a consistent pace o f implementation.

     0   Duringthe first halfofproject implementationthe Bank was unsuccessful inits
         facilitation o f communications with the Government inPhnom Penhdue to
         unfamiliarity with Cambodia. This not only caused delays but also created
         misunderstandings betweengovernment representatives and the Bank sectoral staffin
         Washington. This situation improvedmarkedly after 2003 with the posting o fmore
         experienced and senior Bank staff.

5.38     The result o fthese developments inthe first instance was that different parts o f the
Bank became preoccupiedwith different issues surroundingthe project and these various
substance andprocess concerns appear to have hamperedthe coherence between country and
sector strategies. Indeed, an internalreview o fthe project carried out in2003 pointedto the
failure o f the country team to develop, and coalesce around, a shared strategy.

5.39     A senior management representative o fthe FA commentedduringthe IEGmission
that "the Bank responded to the donors andthe NGOs instead o fthe needs o f the country."
While the Borrower maynot fully appreciate the importance o f maintaining the Bank's
working relations with its development partners, this criticism can be taken as a sign o f a

30. When an agriculture andrural sector staffmember was assignedto PhnomPenhin2000, his role was not
related to specific projects inthe portfoliobutrather to the development o f capacity to identify, prepare, and
oversee development operations. This role was adaptedin2002 to include direct supervision o fthe Flood
EmergencyRehabilitationProject, which IEGfinds was a significant factor inthe successfulimplementationof
the project.

                                                       32


missed opportunity. Ifthe Bank's collective energy on this project hadbeendirected to
siftingthroughcriticism to distinguishbetween the rhetoric o fstereotypical detractors and
constructive concerns regardingparticular issues within the project as it unfolded, the Bank
couldhave stayed on messagewith this important innovation. It could have made mid-course
adjustments such as the framework social assessment and used its influencemore effectively
to persuade the Government to adhere to its commitments under the project so that Cambodia
mightwell havethe makings o f at least several workable concessions today. Instead, the
official hiatus inforestry operations has concealed awholesale shift intimber extractionto
the protective cover o f economic land concessions (Box 2), and the Government is no closer
to a system for sustainable exploitation o f its timber resources than it was whenthe project
was presented to the BoardinJune 2000. Advocates o f social forestry have attempted to fill
the breachbypushingthe limits o f that form o f forestry organizationbeyondits provenrole.
The Government has introduced annual cutting auctions instead o fmulti-year leasesbut these
also ignorethe underlying need for forest resource management that should be the
cornerstone o f sustainable concession forestry.

Box 2. Economic Land Concessions
Intended generally for the development o f agribusiness enterprises, economic land concessions began to be
offered shortly after the move to a market economy in 1992. Some 96 contracts have beennegotiated with
MAFF since 1992, for concessions inexcess o f 1000ha each. Thirty have since beencancelled, nine remain
unsigned and 57, covering some 943,000 ha, are active. Seventy percent o f these concessions are on land
officially designated as forestry land.

Provincial governors have the authority to approve concessions o f less than 1,000 ha each and there has beena
rapid increase inthe number and coverage o fthese smaller concessions inrecent years. There is presently no
reporting system to maintain accurate records on the scope o f this type of concession country-wide.

While there is an official requirement that MAFF must approve a use plan for all concessions, this i s not
rigorously enforced. There is no intentionto sustain forestry as part o f suchplans, and there is negligible
follow-up once exploitation has begun.

5.40      The Bank was ineffective indistinguishingbetween legitimate concerns andthe flow
o fpublic opinion, and inusingits diverse resources to adapt the project to legitimate
concerns. It didnot make effective use o f its influence to secure government compliance
with its commitments underthe project or inassistingreform-minded elements withinthe
government to withstand pressure insupport o f destructive forest practices. For these
reasons, the Bank's overallperformance inthis project is rated unsatisfactory.

BORROWER        PERFORMANCE
5.41     Inview oftheinitialprogress madebythe FA, itis difficult to imaginethat its
relaxing o frequirements on concessionaires following project start-up was simply the result
o f a change o f attitude by officials within that department. Although civil society began to
depict the FA and the Bank as facilitators o f the abuse o f forest resources, several sources
interviewedbythe IEGmission commented on the strong pressure that hadbeenput on the
FAby senior levels ofgovernment to relax controls onthe concessionaires. The actions taken
bythe FA onits owninitiative cannot beisolatedfrom those taken as aresult ofdirect
instruction from senior government levels, but there i s at least anecdotal evidence that certain
FAofficials recognizedthe needto bringorder to forest exploitationinconcessionsbutwere
unable to resist pressure to resume the laissez-faire approach to concession logging. Inany

                                               33


event, the FA was unable to effect the timely recruitment o ftechnical assistance, ensure the
timely delivery o f Sustainable ForestManagement Planguidelines and training to
concessionaires or the timely assembly andreview o f draft management plans. Duringthe
same period, the FAwas unable to effectively police logging inthe concessions or the
movement o f logs leaving concessions or to resist pressure from senior officials for non-
enforcement o f regulations for favored clients. Finally, royalty collections were significantly
below the assessedrates for logs extracted.

5.42    Against this generally limited performance inproject implementation, the FA did
demonstrate strength and strategic foresight inseveral instances. The decision to ban logging
untilsatisfactorymanagement planshadbeenput inplacewas a decisive response to
extensive illegal logging and strong public opinion. The subsequent cancellation of an
important Malaysianconcession for continuing to logwas a politically courageous decision.
Hadremedial action beenable to follow ina timely manner so rational logging could be
resumed, the course o fthe project and the industrywould have beenvery different.

5.43    Onbalance, the Government was not able to use project resources ina timely manner,
enforce conditions on the exploitation o fconcessions, or oversee the delivery o f outputs to
which it was committedunder the project. Nor was it able to containillegal logging. Its
performance must also therefore be considered unsatisfactory.

6.      Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (FEW)

Components and Costs

6.1     Background. FloodinginCambodia during the 1999-2000 rainy seasonwas the
worst in30 years. Two separate flooding episodes struck the country, first inJuly 2000 and
again at the end o fAugust. Some 3.4 millionpeople were affected in20 provinces, with
84,000 families havingto be evacuated. Pre-appraisal estimates inDecember2000 included
damage to 1500 school buildings, 120health centers and hospitals and thousands o f
kilometers o frural roads together with small bridges and culverts. The Government put the
damage estimate for public and private property at US$161 million. Consultations between
the Government andprincipal donors resultedina range o f assistance. The Bank's response
was to approve the present emergency credit, add a supplemental credit o f $10 million
equivalent to the Second Social FundProject, and to authorize the use o fresources from on-
going and future IDA operations to develop strategies, technologies andprograms to reduce
the countries long-term vulnerability to flooding.

6.2     To achieve its objectives the FEW consisted o f the following components:

  (1)   The rehabilitation of damaged sections of nationalprimary and secondary roads
        ($12.3 million at appraisal, $12.9 million actual).

  (2)   The rehabilitation of rural infrastructure ($8.1 million at appraisal, $8.1 million
        actual).

  (3)   The rehabilitation of flood control and irrigation systems ($9.3 millionat
        appraisal, $11.6 millionactual).

                                                34


  (4)   The rehabilitation of primary and secondaryschools ($9.4 million at appraisal,
        $9.4 million actual).

  (5)   Project managementand financial assistance to carry out studies to help RGOC in
        the development o f a long-term strategy to reduce vulnerability to flooding ($1.3
        million at appraisal, $1.3 million actual).

ImplementationArrangements

6.3     The projectwas coordinatedby the National Project Coordinating Committee
(NPCC), abody chairedbythe Minister o fPlanning and comprised o f all agencies involved
inthe implementationofdonor-financedemergency projectsrelatedto the2000 floods. A
Project Monitoring and CoordinatingUnitunder the NPCC would be responsible for day-to-
day management including the review and approval o f all sub-projects that were above a
threshold specified inthe Operations Manualby which implementationwouldbe guided.
Implementationwould beby four ministries, each carrying out work on infrastructurewithin
its purview: Public Works and Transport for national and provincial roads; Water Resources
andMeteorology for irrigation and flood control; RuralDevelopment for rural roads and
rural water supply; and Education, Youth and Sports for schools. Eacho fthe four
implementing agencies would have a PMO or PKJ.

ImplementationExperience

6.4     Initial selection andplanningo f works went well and the project got off to a good
start, particularly inschool and irrigation rehabilitation. Disbursementwas slow initially
becausemost contracts inthe first year were for small works. Problems inprocurement
procedures caused delays intwo large contracts for nationalroads in2003 but these were
resolved. Delays inreceipt o f counterpart funds causeddelays inpaymentsto contractors,
reachingas long as eight months inlate 2003, but this was not a project-specific issue.
Despitethese payment delays, the implementationo f sub-projects proceeded well and the
devaluation o f the SDR against the dollar generated a surplus for which the Government was
asked to prepare a reallocationproposal. By the end o fDecember 2004, the original Closing
Date, the nationalprovincialroads component and the primary and secondary school
component were expected to be fully completed, as were the initial subprojects underthe
rural infrastructure, irrigation and flood control components. However, additional
expenditures under reallocatedproceeds needed additional time. Therefore, a six-month
extension o fthe ClosingDate was agreed for this purpose. The project closed on June 30,
2005, after 4 years and 3 months, with total project cost unchanged at $40 million.

MonitoringandEvaluation

6.5     The quality o fmonitoring and evaluationi s rated substantial indesign,
implementation andutilization. The haste with which this operation was mountedresulted in
somewhat less design and monitoring framework beinginplace at start-up than i s typical o f
infrastructure projects, but this was quickly overcome. The smooth implementation o f the
project inspite o fthe numbero f agencies and locations was due certainly inpart to an
effectivemanagement information systembasedon tactical indicators such as design,
contracting, construction and completion, as well as on the development andperformance o f

                                                          35


PIUcapacity. Uponcompletion, the project was able to clearly present the physical and
financial results o f its operation and economic analysis was conducted on the impact of
works on samples o fbeneficiaries. For example, localroad constructionresultedina
14percent increase insmall trader activity duringconstruction and an increase o ftraffic on
completed roads o f27 percent. Other works, from schools to irrigation schemes were
similarlytracked and evaluated. Compliancewith financial covenants as well as the
successor indicator, financial management, was considered satisfactory throughout project
implementation.

Project Ratings

RELEVANCE
6.6     The major investments under the project were ineconomic infrastructure(roads and
irrigation) and social development (schools). The Government's Platform on Second Term
(1998 to 2003) has citedbuildinghumancapacity and strengthening infrastructureas two of
its priorities andthe 2000 CAS emphasized the importanceo fbuildingthe foundations for
sustainable development andpoverty reduction as its mainobjective. To do so, it identified:
"buildingphysicalinfrastructure.. particularly inruralandprovincial areas, andrebuilding
                                             .
humanresources by investingineducation and skills development." A prompt resuscitation
o f economic activity following the 2000 floods and a returnto the development o fhuman
resources were pivotal to the strategies o fboth the Government and the Bank. Work done
under the project to reduce the vulnerability o fthe country's small rural infrastructureto
future flood damage (upgraded technical specifications, relocation, and operation and
maintenance arrangements) was also o fhighrelevance interms o f its contribution to
sustainabilityo f economic growth, particularly inrural areas. An ancillary feature o fthe
project was its work with sub-national units o fparticipatingministries at a time when the
policy o f decentralization was placinggreater importance on the performance o f these units.
The overallrelevance o f the project i s rated as substantial.

EFFICACY
6.7     The project was highly effective inrehabilitating and enhancing infrastructure
damaged inthe floods o f 2000 (Table 9). To achieve its outputs, the projectwas also
effective inintroducingprocurement and contract management procedures among PIUs at
different levels infour ministries and overseeing their effective conduct to avoid regulatory
delays with MEF and the Bank. The project contributed modestly to a longer-term strategy to
reduce vulnerability to flooding by increasingthe specifications o f vulnerable infrastructure.
Finally, it funded the study o f flash flood behavior ina vulnerable area as a background for
the ongoing development o fmeasuresto reduce the country's vulnerability to flood
damage.31




31.Although IEGwas unable to findunambiguous evidence onthe efficacy o fthe irrigation rehabilitation
component, the Region comments: "one significant outcome was made from rehabilitating irrigation systems
which resulted in increased yield, food security and incomes among benefitedpoor villages. This outcome
couldbe used as a generic and valuable experience for the future development o f irrigation inCambodia, which
demonstrated that the availability o f irrigation, which was less than 15 percent o f the cropped area inthe
country, i s the closest correlate o f lower ruralpoverty rates. Inaddition, the availability o f agricultural

                                                        36


6.8      Some reviews, including the ICR, raised concerns about the sustainability o fcertain
ofthe rehabilitatedinfrastructure, notably the flood control and irrigation schemes. However,
the issuesraisedinthis context are o f a development nature, and require different resources
and relationships than are typically found inan emergency project. For example, it i s
currently accepted practice that beneficiariestake responsibility o fthe operation and
maintenance costs o f irrigation facilities (at least secondary and tertiary components inthe
case o f large schemes) through membershipinwater-users groups and Cambodia has adopted
this approach for the development o fits irrigation sector. However the achievement of this
localresponsibilityrequires effective organization, grower commitment and technical
services andmarket access to ensure that growers have the motivation and the financial
resources to satisfy their obligations. These are beyond the capacity o f an emergency
rehabilitation project to provide, but it is noteworthy that inthis case efforts were made to
draw attentionto these needs and initiate efforts inthe Ministries o fAgriculture andWater
Resources to provide technical and organizational support to beneficiaries. For achieving its
stated objectives and addressing such sustainability issues beyond its normal scope, efficacy
of the project i s rated as substantial.

EFFICIENCY
6.9      No financial or economic analysis was done aspart ofappraisal andthere was limited
quantitative analysis uponcompletion. Increasesintraffic as aresult o froadrehabilitation and
increasesinagricultural yields as aresult o fflood controlstructures andirrigation schemes were
estimatedas indicative o fthe changesthat would have generatedfinancial benefits. The
methodology usedinthe socio-economic impact assessment was clear andthe assumptions
reasonable, butthe benefits from differentcomponentswere not uniformly important so that

OVERALLOUTCOME
6.10    Works were completedina timely manner, thereby permittinga returnto economic,
social development and administrative activities. Inter-ministerial coordination and
bureaucratic constraints led to initial delays and to the exclusiono f some individual works
identified for the project, but these were subsequently replacedby suitable alternatives. In
addition to its rehabilitationfunction, the project has had a development impact inseveral
important ways: (a) works were designed to be more flood resistant than those they replaced,
(b) schools andirrigation systems were o fgreater capacityto accommodate short-term
expansion needs, and (c) the project contributed to reduced vulnerability to floods through
early warning systems, flood protectioninfrastructure, and a case study on flash floods to
enhance the national strategy on flood prevention.

6.11 Finally, among its development outcomes the project can count significant
institutionalcapacity buildingamong ministries that needed to develop the capacity to
design, contract and oversee a large number o f individual infl-astructureprojects. The
Ministryo fPublic Works andTransport was already competent inthis respect, butother
agencies, which were not as ade t at implementing construction activities efficiently within
budget, didso underthe project.!3          An importantpart o fthis development inthe context o fthe
trend toward decentralization was the capacity developed below the national level. Although
there were a numbero f factors contributing to the success o fthis project, the presence o f a
sector staffmember incountry was an important contribution, one which pointedthe way for
the current situation o f sector staff assigned to the Resident Mission. The overall outcome of
the project i s rated as satisfactory (Table 10).

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT             OUTCOME

6.12    The risk to development outcomes i s rated moderate. The civil works carried out by
the project incorporatedpast lessons concerningtechnical specifications, siting and local
involvement inconstructionand operations. The risks to development outcome inany of
these respects are not significant. Beyondthe persistent risk of cyclical flooding, the
principal risk to development outcome concerns the maintenance and operation o f irrigation
infrastructure rehabilitatedunder the project. While not unique to facilities o fthe project, the


33. The poor condition o f infrastructure after 30 years o f civil war contributedto hgher costs than anticipated at
appraisal for many works, but construction was generally achieved withinthese revised figures.

                                                 38


financial viability and the commitment o f farmer-based organizations chargedwith
maintaining small irrigation schemes i s an important issue. The capacity and the willingness
o fmembers to incur costs and effort for the upkeep o f these facilities is a function not only of
capacity but also o f willingness, andthere is a great deal o f technical support and institution
buildingtypically requiredfor the establishment o fviable water users groups. Itwould be
unrealistic to expect an emergency project to incorporate such capacity, but the issue
highlights the needfor complementary development efforts under different initiatives.

BANKPERFORMANCE
6.13    The Bank's performance is ratedsatisfactory. While more advancedplanningbefore
project approval might have contributedto smoother start-up, better cost estimates and faster
implementation, this needs to be seen inthe context o fthe emergency nature o f the operation
and the inevitable trade-offs ina rapid gearing-up process. To the credit o f those working on
project implementation (both inthe Bank and inthe participatingministries), implementation
issueswere addressedandresolvedreasonably well as they arose. Particularlynoteworthy
were the issues ofprocurement procedures and safeguards requiredbythe Bank that were not
part o fthe regular procedures o fthe concernedministries. Two factors inthe Bank's efforts
inthisprojectwould seemto havecontributeddirectlyto its successful outcome: (a) the
flexibility inthe definition and selection o fsub-projects to be funded, and (b) the work done
byresident as well as visiting staffandconsultants to coach andtrain counterpart staffin
procurement procedures and contract management. There was no formal training component
intheproject, butthose chargedwithoverseeing its implementationrecognized that this was
a critical needandthe Regionaccepted the additional Bank budget implications o fproviding
the necessary resources.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
6.14    The Borrower's performance i s rated satisfactory. The Borrower's efforts to work
withBank staffindevelopingthe project andthen its positiveresponse to theprocedural
requirements during implementation are the principalbases for this assessment. Government
agencies generally completed their work ina manner consistent with the time andprocedural
requirements o fthe project. Duringimplementation, however, there were frequent cases
where bureaucratic procedures, particular ininter-ministerial issues, were an impediment to
project implementation.Delays incounterpart payments to contractors and complications in
the clearances o fparticular sub-projects for rehabilitation were the two most important
examples o f this issue. While the project i s still fiesh ineveryone's mindit would be useful
to consider it as a case study o f interagency communications and approvals, to identify
constraints that could be addressedto improve future collaboration.

7.      Looking Forward and Lessons Learned
7.1     Project design and implementation ina low-income post-conflict country continue to
present a unique set o f issues for the Bank or any development agency. These projects are
highlyvisible as animportant shareo fthe total capital flow into a sector; they tax the limited
capacity o f the Borrower's institutions and infrastructure, there i s often very little local
experience on which to build, and they challenge the emergingregulatoryand administrative
framework within which they are to be established. Experience with the four projects

                                                     39


reviewed inthis report point to the importance o f particular aspects o f design and
implementationthat could strengthen the Bank's effectiveness inthis type o f environment.

 (1)    Use of the Learning Instrument Loan. Two o f the four projectsreviewedinthis
        PPARwere LILs: the NortheastVillage Development Project and the Forest
        Concession Management and Control Pilot Project. While the case was made for
        usingthis instrument inboth appraisal documents, it was a contributing factor inthe
        problemsencounteredbythe forestryproject. Usingthe LILpermitted the deferralo f
        the social impact assessment. Itwas logical to defer social impact assessmentsto the
        context o fthe individual concession management plans that wouldbe producedunder
        the project, rather than to conduct a hypotheticalassessment ex ante based on average
        or exceptional conditions among all 14concessions to be treated under the project.
        Nevertheless, this deferral left the project vulnerable to criticism on safeguard issues
        and, inpractice, as the InspectionPanelReport noted, "a safeguardpostponed i s a
        safeguard denied."34The Bank has since introduced the use o f framework
        assessmentsto be conducted beforeproject approval to addressbroad issues that will
        be more specifically attended to duringthe course o f implementation and this would
        almost certainly have flagged the muchvaunted issue o fresin trees as well as other
        competing claims inconcession areas.

        Infbture, the useofLILs or anyinstrumentthat circumventsany oftheusual
        safeguard investigation duringpreparationshouldbe subject not only to the normal
        tests o f eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these technical or the
        likelihood o f adverse public opinion.

  (2)   The Importance of Continuous Contact for Effective Implementation. A problem
        which arose due to o f the Bank's small portfolio inCambodiawas that a resident
        office was not established until2003, so that most project development, appraisal and
        supervision prior to that time was conducted through visiting missions. When coupled
        with the fragile institutional framework inpost-conflict Cambodiaandthe limited
        counterpart pool, this periodic mission approach to relationships and task
        development was very inefficient. Credibility, knowledge transfer, consensus
        buildingand decision-makingwere all seriouslyhampered, evenwhen teams came
        frequently from Bangkok. Where the client is not familiar with Bank operations and
        procedures or i s confronting serious impediments to its ability to act on that
        knowledge, continuous presence o f competent Bank representatives i s a critical factor
        inmovingdialogue andoperations forward. Theresults o fthe FEW,which didhave
        the benefit o f a resident sector staffmember, confirm this benefit.

 (3)    Sector and Country Strategies as a Management Tool for Operations. Sector or
        country strategies are often seen as the leading edge for policy dialogue and the
        identification o f investment opportunities, but their usefulness duringproject
        implementationmaynot be as widely recognized. As long as operations are set
        initially ina sound strategic context andtheir implementationproceeds smoothly,
        nothing is lost by temporarily setting strategy aside. Butwhen ambiguity or
        disagreements arise inimplementation, particularly with the evolving focus or

        importanceof an activity, an agreed strategy canbecome an effective management
        tool. Inthe case o f the two projects whose overall outcomes were unsatisfactory,
        usingthe strategies inthis way duringthe course o fimplementationmighthave given
        staff and counterparts the basis for reorientingtheir efforts and increasingthe efficacy
        o fthe operation. Revisitingthe country strategy might have ledthose working on
        APIP to look more closely at how the Ministrywas going to use its enhanced
        capacity.35And it mighthave kept those working on the FCMCPP from losing focus
        on their tasks amid the barrage o fpublic criticism.36

        Mid-termreviewshave beenan important innovationinBankwork, basically
        intendedto reflect on objectives and strategy inlight o f implementationexperience.
        Usingcountry and sector strategy as part ofimplementation support takes this a step
        krther by keepingthe collective eye o f stakeholders o n where the tasks at hand are
        intendedto take the Borrower.

  (4)   A GradualApproach to Change. Institutions generally respondmore favorably to
        moderate or gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when power or
        stature are being threatened. The FCMCPP was designed to take a step-by-step
        approach to reforming the industrial exploitation of the country's timber resources,
        and this review concurs with the Region's contention that this was the correct
        approach. Deeply rooted rights and practices were at issue andthe challenge to
        achieving a resource management focus inthis lucrative industrywas going to take
        time andpersuasion. A firm and resolute explanationo f the gradual approach might
        have appealed to calmer heads andmitigatedthe groundswell o f support for the
        unrealistic alternative.

  (5)   Dealingwith InformalTransaction Costs as a Development Issue. To an outsider,
        informal transaction costs may be seen as corruption, butto a participant they may be
        an accepted form o f sharing or a means o freaffirming one's role ina group. While
        fiduciary accountability requires correct procedures and oversight, the development
        impact o fthe Bank's approach to the issue i s very much linkedto the sensitivity with
        which it introduces the qualities o f transparency and cost-effectiveness as desirable
        qualities inprocurement transactions. This is a time-consumingprocess that depends
        on mutual trust that i s very difficult to buildeither longdistance or inthe context o f
        public criticism or embarrassment. The collaborative approach betweenthe Region,
        the Bank's Department o fInstitutional Integrity(INT), and the Borrowerprior to
        May 2005 hadresulted inthe introduction o f guidelines andprocedures that were
        steadily increasingthe degree o ftransparency inproject-relatedprocurement, in
        contrast to the acrimonious stand-off that prevailed for over a year following the
        release o f INT's findings o fwrong-doing to the public.

                                 MANAGEMENTRESPONSE
     FOREST CONCESSIONMANAGEMENTAND CONTROL PILOT PROJECT
                                    PhnomPenh,22 June 2007
                                           **********

The following notes are brief responses from the management o f the Forest Concession
Management andControlPilotProject(FCMCPP), ForestryAdministration (FA).Onbehalfo f
FA and the project management, we highly appreciate the effort made by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) o f the WB from which the outcome o f this PPAR could be a good
source o f information and lesson learnt from good andbad experiences to which boththe WB
andthe Borrower willbe benefitedinthe future.

ImplementationExperience

5.7 "By Dec 2002...The FA had relaxed several of the requirements for Forest Management
Plans, resisted disclosuve of the Plans and their associated environmental and Social Impact
Assessments, and had not enforced a sound approach to consultation with affected
communities."

To thisparagraph, it was truefor some reason, however FA did not agree with the idea that
FA resisted disclosure of the Plans and associated Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment. Actually, an office call Public Affair Unit was established by F A to givefree
access to communities and stakeholders who are interest with enquiry or access to
information.


Monitoringand Evaluation

5.21 ...The quality of Monitoring and Evaluation is rated modest in design, implementation,
utilization, and overall."

Themanagement of theproject acknowledgesthat during thedesignedphase,monitoring and
evaluation were not properly taken into account. However, in the due course of
implementation, the Task Team Leader (TTL) together with FA management team had
regularly met to check theprogress and agreed to revisefrom time to time.


ProjectRatings

Efficacy

5.26  'I... Theproject did not succeed in demonstrating or improving the effectiveness of a
comprehensive set of forest management and operation guidelines and controlprocedures. No
did it establish an effectiveforest crime monitoring andpreventioncapability. Theefficacy of the
project is therefore rated negligible in relation to the achievement of its two objectives.

                                                  55                             Annex B


To this, the management acknowledges that it is true at certain circumstances. However, the
strong oppositionsfrom some NGOs and Civil Societies have stopped and interrupted this
process before reaching itsgoals.


Efficiency


' I . . .The efficiency of theproject is therefore rated as negligible."

Withinthisjudgment, theproject management rated higher efficiency than is wasratedby the
IEG.


TheBank and Borrower Performance Rating

Theproject managementfeels that the evaluation on theBank and Borrower's performance
in general is quitefair though there were some misleading at a certainpoints. However, we
think that this is a good lesson learnt for both Government and the Bank for future
development. We agreed tlzat developing project as conditionality to CAS is not a good
strategy. Tobuild ownershipand continuity,thedevelopmentofproject duringthepreparation
phase should be responded to the real need and intention of its counterpart with issues
understandable by allparty involved andpolitical commitmentfrom all levels.
