                         All ten (10) of the FY2008/09 DLIs for the SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment.

                         In June, 2010, after a careful review and assessment of the data and documentary evidence submitted/facilitated by the Education and Literacy Department and the Reform Sector
                         Unit (RSU), the World Bank concluded that eight (8) out of the ten (10) FY2009/10 DLIs for SEP werefully met, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher
                         recruitment. Additionally, DLI 1 (Fiscal and Budget Management) and DLI 5 (School Management Committees) were partially met. Consequently, the Jan and July 2010
                         disbursement amounts were proportionately adjusted for the price of the eight DLIs met and the World Bank's discretional decision to authorize the withdrawal of up to fifty percent
                         (50%) of the price of the two partially-met DLIs, in recognition of the strong effort made by the Government of Sindh.

                         By August 31, 2010, after a careful review and assessment of additional data and documentary evidence submitted/facilitated by the Education and Literacy Department and the
                         Reform Sector Unit, the World Bank concluded that the Government of Sindh had fully metDLI 1 and DLI 5, and the disbursement amount withheld is expected to be released shortly.

                         Looking forward, the Government of Sindhis committed to and expects to maintain momentum in program implementation, making adjustments on the ground where needed as a
                         result of the recent widespread flooding and heavy rains. An assessment of the extent and nature of adverse effects on service deliveryiscurrently underway. Regular implementation
                         of the program may need to be supplemented with specific interventions that addresstheeffects of the floods; the World Bank is working close with the Government of Sindh to
                         examine what strategies to pursue withinthe education sector in this regard.
