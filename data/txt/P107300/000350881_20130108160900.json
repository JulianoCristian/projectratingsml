outcome was\n            substantial, and both the Bank and the Borrower performance\n            were satisfactory. Some important project lessons learned\n            were: (1) A results-based investment operation that\n            disburses against Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLIs) with\n            predefined implementation progress and performance targets\n            can be a good vehicle to influence medium-term reforms and\n            performance outcomes such as improved sector governance and\n            increased accountability, and help change the nature of the\n            dialogue to focus on development outcomes. (2) Strong\n            political commitment and ownership are critical for\n            successfully steering a sector wide reform program and for\n            addressing governance and accountability constraints to\n            effective service. (3) Continuous and intensive Bank\n            engagement across the reform program and technical and\n            advisory support can help keep momentum and provide the\n            needed support at critical points. (4) Simultaneous focus in\n            Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) on inputs and reforms\n            to improve the quality of learning is likely to be more\n            beneficial in meeting the school participation objectives of\n            attracting and retaining both boys and girls in school. (5)\n            A realistic assessment of the capacity is important to\n            inform the design and sequencing of the reform programs for\n            optimal. (6) Regular diagnostic assessments for tracking\n            student achievement are good initial steps towards improving\n            student learning outcomes. (7) Availability of timely and\n            reliable data is essential for choosing the results\n            indicators to measure the achievement of the development objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
