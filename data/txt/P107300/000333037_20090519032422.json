     Government of Sindh's Medium Term Education Sector\n            Reform Program (SERP). The objectives of SERP are to\n            increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban\n            disparities, increase progression, and improve the\n            measurement of student learning. There are two components to\n            the project, the first component of the project being\n            financing of SERP.  This component finances key Eligible\n            Expenditure Programs (EEP) up to capped absolute amounts,\n            with disbursements based on the achievements of agreed\n            indicators. These disbursement linked indicators (DLI)\n            reflect intermediate outcome or implementation performance\n            indicators that are critical to the achievement of the\n            project's education development outcomes. The SERP\n            activities and sub-programs fall within four broad thrust\n            areas which aim to improve: 1) fiscal sustainability and the\n            effectiveness of public expenditures including in education;\n            2) education sector management; 3) access to quality\n            schooling with a particular focus on rural children and\n            girls; and 4) the quality of teaching and student learning.\n            The second component of the project is the technical\n            assistance.  This component finances capacity building and\n            strengthens fiduciary, safeguard, and monitoring and\n            evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "2009-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
