                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to support the Government of Sindh's Medium Term Education Sector Reform Program (SERP). The
                         objectives of SERP are to increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban disparities, increase progression and improve the measurement of
                         student learning.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) was approved by the Board on June 4, 2009 and became effective on June 11, 2009. The total credit amount is USD300 million. The
                         project closes on June 30, 2012. The project is performance based with annual implementation progress/performance targets (Disbursement Linked Indicators or DLIs) against which
                         project disbursements are made.

                         The Additional Financing for Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP AF) for US$50 million was approved by the Board on March 24, 2011 and signed by the government on May 19,

                         2011. The project development outcomes under SEP AF are identical to those of SEP. The AF supports the implementation of three critical reform activities for government schools
                         under the Sindh Education Sector Reform Program: the (1) rationalization of teachers across schools and the formal allocation of teaching posts to schools; (2) preparation and
                         management of school-specific non-salary budgets; and (3) extension of the existing district Education Management Reform (EMR) initiative to additional districts.

                         All ten (10) of the FY2008/09 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment.

                         All ten (10) of the FY2009/10 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment. The
                         achievement of two DLIs -- fiscal and budget management and school management committees -- had lagged beyond FY2009/10 but were subsequently satisfactorily met in
                         FY2010/11.

                         7.5 out of ten (10) of the FY2010/11 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment. At
                         present, 2.5 DLIs remain outstanding. The DLIs are in three subprograms: (1) fiscal and budget management; (2) Annual School Census; and (3) public-private partnerships under
                         the Sindh Education Foundation. To meet these remaining DLIs, the implementation actions mainly comprise of releasing the FY2011/12 allocation for the Promoting Private
                         Schooling in Rural Sindh (PPRS) Scheme under the Sindh Education Foundation, providing contracts to the operators of new schools under Phase 3 of the PPRS program; and
                         taking agreed confidence-building measures and preparing and notifying an agreed remedial action plan to improve ASC data quality in the upcoming exercise. The government is
                         also expected to continue to ensure full compliance with the legal covenants under SEP and SEP AF.

                         All three (3) of the DLIs for SEP AF were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh. The full credit amount (US$50 million) has been disbursed.

                         With respect to SEP, a sum of US$275 million has been disbursed. The current undisbursed balance (related mainly to the 2.5 remaining DLIs) is US$34 million. Due to exchange
                         rate fluctuations between USDs and SDRs, there is currently a gain of around US$9 million against the signed amount of US$300 million.

                         Meeting these DLIs have contributed to improving (1) fiscal sustainability and the effectiveness of public education expenditures, (2) education sector management; (3) access to
                         quality schooling in rural areas and for girls; and (4) the quality of teaching and student learning. Impacts at the service delivery level arise from several interventions, including
                         supporting the setup and operation of public-private partnership schools in underserved localities; teacher recruitment that is merit based and the local placement of teachers in
                         needy schools (understaffed schools) under fixed-term, school-specific contracts; the rehabilitation of schools at record pace combined with careful independent screening, full
                         completion, and adherence to minimum construction quality standards; and the activation of and provision of grants to school management committees (parent-teacher associations)
                         across the province, including the rollout of a capacity building initiative for school management committees.
