           its objectives, by demonstrating considerable potential for\n            saving electricity; project outcome is thus rated\n            satisfactory with project sustainability rated likely.\n            Because of adequate project preparation and supervision, the\n            World Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance is satisfactory on balance , on the\n            strength of the demand-side management (DSM) unit's\n            performance, notwithstanding the lack of effective\n            government support. Key lessons drawn for this project are:\n            The government and the major energy sectors must foster a\n            supportive policy environment through strong and proactive\n            commitment. There is a potential conflict between the narrow\n            goal of maximizing electricity supplies and a DSM program.\n            The implementing agency must have adequate managerial and\n            financial autonomy. Public awareness and promotional\n            campaigns are critical. Energy efficiency audits in the\n            industrial, commercial, and residential sectors need to be\n            properly financed if the audit recommendation are followed\n            up. Prospects for sustainability are enhanced if revolving\n            fund mechanisms to recycle consumer repayments are\n            incorporated n the project design and adhered to."}, "docdt": "2000-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
