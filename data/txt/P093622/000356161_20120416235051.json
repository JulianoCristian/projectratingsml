were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: attempting a\n            radical transformation of agricultural services with the\n            attendant institutional reforms is risky, transaction\n            intensive, requires adequate staff and budget, and requires\n            long-term involvement by the World Bank. Within the\n            framework of an agricultural services project, support to\n            producer organizations is crucial. One key issue in\n            agricultural services projects is the level of funding that\n            beneficiaries should provide. Evaluating the effects of\n            agricultural services projects is a complex and\n            methodologically challenging task."}, "docdt": "2012-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
