                         from Chimtallah substation to Kabul North; supply and installation work of optical fiber ground wire from Pul-e-Khumri to Chimtallah 220 kV transmission line; and rehabilitation of 110
                         kV North-West substation, have been completed and the facilities are in use and providing the desired services. However there could be a delay of up to 12 months (except the Naglu
                         Hydropower Plant rehabilitation component) in completing the balance components, due to difficulties in transportation, route selection and appropriate endorsement from the
                         concerned bodies, security, etc.

                         The Naglu hydropower plant rehabilitation work is the one component that needs a longer period to complete - estimated at September 2012. The rehabilitation of the first turbine unit
                         is completed and is in the process of taking over by Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS). The second unit has already been handed over to the contractor in September, and the
                         disassembling work is going smoothly, with a plan to complete the rehabilitation work within 8 months. The worsening security contributed to much of the delay compounded by slow
                         custom clearance process.
