                         Chimtallah 220 kV transmission line; rehabilitation of 110 kV North-West substation; and rehabilitation and extension of the 110kV North substation have been completed and the
                         facilities have entered service. The 110kV single circuit transmission line from North to East substation is incomplete, with the overground part still requiring some tower placement
                         and conductor stringing, and the underground part requiring splicing and connection into the existing 110kV circuit from East substation. Most of the subprojects have yet to achieve
                         Operational Acceptance and only two - the OPGW retrofit and the Chimtallah to Kabul North West substation - have been handed over to DABS. None of the contracts have yet
                         been closed and they are approximately two years behind schedule.

                         The Naglu hydropower plant rehabilitation work has been further delayed. One Unit - No. 4 - has been rehabilitated and commissioned, although a number of minor tasks remain to
                         be completed. Handover of Unit No. 3 was delayed by several months by DABS, and dismantling has now been completed. It is unlikely that the refurbishment of all three remaining
                         units will be completed within the revised project closing date of September 2012. The contract is approximately 8-12 months behind schedule based on the revised timings agreed
                         in April 2010.

                         The rehabilitation of the MV system in central Kabul is now complete and the overhead portions have been handed over to DABS. The underground sections are complete except for
                         about one km of undergrounding and the installation of 20kV switchgear in three Junction Stations. The absence of the switchgear is constraining testing of the underground circuits
                         already in place, and will delay completion of the work. Completion is expected in August 2011, about 27 months behind schedule.

                         Technical assistance work is complete and DABM has now been corporatized and transformed into Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The IDA Credit and ARTF Grant Closing Dates of September 30, 2012 will not be further extended. Focus is therefore on ensuring all contracted work is completed by that date, or
                         where it cannot be completed to bring contracts to a close in an orderly way with minimal impact on the project objectives.
