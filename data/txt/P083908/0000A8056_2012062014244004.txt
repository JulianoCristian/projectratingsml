                         Rehabilitation of the 110kV transmission line from Naghlu to Kabul; and the supply and installation work of optical fiber ground wire for Pul e Khumri to Chimtalla 220 kV transmission
                         line are complete but the contracts are not yet closed. Technical assistance work to coroporatize Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) has been completed. The pace of
                         implementation of other components has picked up in recent months and overall progress is rated moderately satisfactory in view of the expected completion of all but one before the
                         project closing date of September 30, 2012.

                         Progress in the implementation of the Naglu hydropower plant rehabilitation work has picked up. Two Units - Nos. 3 and 4 - have been rehabilitated and commissioned. Unit No. 2 is
                         being rehabilitated and is expected to be commissioned by September 2012. Unit No. 1 has been dismantled to allow the use of the rotor shaft in Unit No. 2. The bent rotor shaft,
                         originally in Unit No. 3 but which will be required to complete the rehabilitation of Unit No. 1 must be repaired or replaced which will take 9-14 months and cannot be completed before
                         the project closing date of September 2012.

                         The rehabilitation of the MV system - underground and above ground - in central Kabul is now complete and handed over to DABS. Equipment for Junction Station 2 has arrived in
                         Kabul and inspected. Equipment for Junction Stations 7 and 12 is ready for factory acceptance testing. Completion is expected in September 2012.

                         Two of the three sections of the 110kV transmission line from Chimtallah to Northern Kabul have been completed and have entered service. The third section, from Kabul North
                         substation to Tower E31 on the route to Kabul East substation has been delayed because of the need to seek an alternative right of way. Kabul North and Kabul Northwest
                         substations have been rehabilitated and are in service but have not yet been commissioned and handed over to DABS.

                         Selection of a new consultant to act as Project Management Firm (PMF) was completed in January 2012 and is under way. The consultant has focused on ensuring certification of
                         physical progress and invoices to allow contractors to continue (and in some cases restart) work, with the resulting in pickup of project activities. Some of the lost time has been
                         regained.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The IDA Credit and ARTF Grant Closing Dates of September 30, 2012 will not be further extended. Focus is therefore on ensuring all contracted work is completed by that date.
                         Separate financing arrangements will be put in place for Naghlu.
