                         Rehabilitation of the 110kV transmission line from Naghlu to Kabul; and the supply and installation work of optical fiber ground wire (OPGW) for Pul e Khumri to Chimtalla 220 kV
                         transmission line are complete. Contracts for the OPGW installation are closed. Thnical assistance work to coroporatize Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) has been
                         completed. The pace of implementation of other components has picked up in recent months and overall progress is rated moderately satisfactory in view of the expected completion
                         of all but one before the project closing date of March 31, 2013.

                         Progress in the implementation of the Naghlu hydropower plant rehabilitation work is ongoing. Two Units - Nos. 3 and 4 - have been rehabilitated and commissioned. After some
                         delays due to problems with Unit No. 3, Unit 2 is being rehabilitated, and expected to be commissioned before the project closing date. Unit No. 1 has been dismantled to allow the
                         use of the rotor shaft in Unit No. 2. The bent rotor shaft, originally in Unit No. 3 but which will be required to complete the rehabilitation of Unit No. 1 must be repaired or replaced
                         which will take 9-14 months and cannot be completed before the project closing date of March 2013.

                         The rehabilitation of the MV system - underground and above ground - in central Kabul is complete. However, due to concerns on quality of some material, an inspection of the
                         material was carried out and a Corrective Action Plan is now prepared to which the Contractor needs to respond. Equipment for Junction Station 2 has arrived in Kabul and inspected.
                         Equipment for Junction Stations 7 and 12 is ready for factory acceptance testing. Government funds will be used for cofinancing any outstanding work between project closing and
                         completion, currently is expected in August 2013,.

                         Two of the three sections of the 110kV transmission line from Chimtallah to Northern Kabul have been completed and have entered service. The third section, from Kabul North
                         substation to Tower E31 on the route to Kabul East substation has been delayed because of the need to seek an alternative right of way, which has now been resolved. The
                         remaining section will be completed before the project closing date. Kabul North and Kabul Northwest substations have been rehabilitated and are in service; commissioning is
                         ongoing before formal hand over to DABS.

                         A new consultant to act as Project Management Firm (PMF) was hired in January 2012. The consultant has focused on ensuring certification of physical progress and invoices to
                         allow contractors to continue (and in some cases restart) work, with the resulting in pickup of project activities.
