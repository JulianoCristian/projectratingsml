                         The project objective is to provide an improved and more reliable power supply to the people in Kabul. The outcome indicator is a 70% increase in grid-supplied power
                         consumption by customers in Kabul.

                         Rehabilitation of the 110kV transmission line from Naghlu to Kabul; and the supply and installation work of optical fiber ground wire (OPGW) for Pul e Khumri to Chimtalla 220 kV
                         transmission line are complete. Contracts for the OPGW installation are closed. Thnical assistance work to coroporatize Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) has been
                         completed. The pace of implementation of other components has picked up in recent months and overall progress is rated moderately satisfactory in view of the expected completion
                         of all but one before the project closing date of March 31, 2013.

                         Three Units of the Naghlu hydropower plant - Nos. 2, 3 and 4 - have been rehabilitated and commissioned arenow in service. The rotor shaft originally in Unit No. 3 but which will be
                         required to complete the rehabilitation of Unit No. 1 will take 9-14 months to rehabilitate or repair. Naghlu will operate at 75MW of capacity until the repair is completed; a planned
                         ARTF grant will finance the rehabilitation of Unit No. 1 and other civil works.

                         The rehabilitation of the MV system - underground and above ground - in central Kabul is complete. There are however concerns that the project development objective cannot be
                         sustained because of transformer failures in the Kabul distribution system brought about by overloading and poor quality equipment. An inspection of the material was carried out and
                         a Corrective Action Plan is now prepared to which the Contractor needs to respond. Most of the corrective actions concern the parallel contract financed under Kabul, Aybak and
                         Mazar-e-Sharif Power Project which supplied Low Voltage equipment and, in particular, transformers. Completion of the rehabilitation of Junction Stations 2, 7 and 12 is delayed.
                         Government funds will be used to finance the outstanding work between project closing and physical completion, currently is expected in August 2013, but this means that there is
                         some loss of contribution to the project development objective

                         Two of the three sections of the 110kV transmission line from Chimtallah to Northern Kabul have been completed and have entered service. The third section, from Kabul North
                         substation to Tower E31 on the route to Kabul East substation is now in final stages of construction with towers erected and conductor being strung The remaining section will be
                         completed and commissioned before the project closing date. Kabul North and Kabul Northwest substations have been rehabilitated and are in service; commissioning is ongoing
                         before formal hand over to DABS.
