were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: policy based lending operations should be\n            conducted in ways that reinforce government ownership and\n            political support for the reform program. The experience\n            with Croatia's PAL program demonstrates once again the\n            lesson that smooth and successful program implementation\n            depends critically on government ownership, including the\n            government's ability to maintain adequate political\n            support for the program. But the experience also suggests\n            that it is possible to achieve significant positive outcomes\n            from an ambitious program even when the government is not\n            able to maintain sufficient support to implement all aspects\n            of the program fully. It is worth considering several ways\n            in which the PAL program sought to contribute to these\n            positive outcomes by reinforcing government ownership and\n            containing the political risks. The PAL program was closely\n            aligned both to the government's own program and to the\n            European Union (EU) accession agenda, in addition to\n            reflecting the Bank's analytical work. The linkage of\n            the program to the goal of EU accession, along with EU and\n            Bank support, was intended to help the government offset\n            pressures to delay needed reforms."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
