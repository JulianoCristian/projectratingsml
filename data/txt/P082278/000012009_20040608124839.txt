Country Background
:
Croatia’s economy has undergone a profound transformation since the 
country gained independence.  Market laws and institutions have been introduced and the real 
output decline in the first war-torn years of independence has been recovered.  In April 2004, the 
European Commission issued its opinion on Croatia’s application for European Union (EU) 
membership, recommending the European Council to open negotiations with Croatia.  The 
European Council is expected to decide whether and when to open negotiations in June 2004. 
Since the 1999 recession, economic growth has picked up and inflation remained in single digits 
in Croatia.  The real GDP growth registered 5.2 percent in 2002, but declined to 4.3 percent in 
2003, and is projected to slow further below 4.0 percent in 2004.  
The economic recovery has been accompanied by growing external current account deficit, 
which has been financed primarily with external debt.  As a result, the external debt has sharply 
risen and increased external vulnerability of the Croatian economy.  Despite significant FDI 
inflows, external debt soared from 60 percent of GDP to 83 percent in 2003.   
At the same time fiscal performance has been disappointing.  The Government gradually reduced 
the fiscal deficit (including grants) from 8.1 percent of GDP in 1999 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 
2002.  These gains were, however, partly reversed in 2003, as the Government went on a 
spending spree at the time of elections and the fiscal deficit jumped to estimated 5.0 percent of 
GDP.  The higher deficit was largely financed through foreign borrowing: total public and 
publicly guaranteed debt as a share of GDP rose from about 51 percent in 2002 to about 56 
percent in 2003.

The size of the state remains significant and would need downsizing.  Private sector accounts for 
about 60 percent of the economy in Croatia, while for example in Poland, Lithuania, and 
Bulgaria the private sector share is 70 percent and in the Slovak Republic 75 percent.  In Croatia, 
a
large share of public and state-owned enterprises still remain to be privatized or liquidated, and 
direct state aid to the enterprise sector is high.    
To achieve sustained private sector led growth, the Government would need to create conditions 
that attract private investment and produce growth.  It has made substantial progress in adopting 
market and EU compatible legislation and regulations, reforming the banking sector, and 
liberalizing the trade, but serious weaknesses remain that would need to be addressed for Croatia 
to eventually accede EU.    
Project Objectives and Description: 
The proposed Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) 
would aim to support enhanced economic growth in Croatia through (i) promoting 
macroeconomic stability (in particular fiscal adjustment) and (ii) improving the investment 
climate.  Also, fulfillment of EU accession criteria calls for intensive structural and institutional 
reforms.  The proposed PAL would support the government in this effort
.
PAL would specifically support: 
 
·
Improvements in the investment climate
 by re-launching the privatization or liquidation of 
state-owned enterprises; improving financial discipline of enterprises; reducing the cost of 
doing business; and strengthening the judiciary. 
 
Efforts to improve governance
 by rationalizing and enhancing public administration; and 
improving public expenditure management.  
 
·
Enhancing sustainability of sector spending 
by improving sustainability of health financing; 
rationalizing and targeting social protection; improving sustainability of the pension system; 
and fiscal sustainability of railways operations.
 
Project Financing:  
Expected IBRD funding is to be determined. 
 
Environmental Aspects:
 
The proposed operation is an adjustment operation that does not 
require an ISDS or environmental assessment.  The Government will be addressing any potential 
environmental liability issues related to the privatization process and, as needed, the Bank will 
provide guidance on how this can be done in an effective manner.
