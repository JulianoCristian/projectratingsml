Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
 The objective of the PAL series is to enhance economic growth in Croatia through (i)
improving the investment climate, and (ii) reducing the size and improving the efficiency
of the public sector. This requires fiscal adjustment and consolidation, a central theme of
the operation. The PAL series also supports the Government in its EU accession and
integration efforts, and helps ensure that key economic reforms under the acquis are
effectively implemented and enforced.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design1

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Croatia is a middle-income country with a per capita income of US$12,250 (Atlas method) in 2008
(US$7,030 in 2004, when PAL program formulation began) and population of 4.4 million. It has become
a member of NATO Alliance in April 2009 and has advanced its negotiations on EU membership with
targeted accession date in 2012.
After declaring independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991, Croatia faced a
period of intense regional conflict, suffering substantial human losses and destruction of infrastructure as
well as sharp declines in output and high inflation. With the restoration of more peaceful conditions,
economic recovery began in the mid-1990s as the Government took steps to stabilize the economy, open
it to world and regional trade, and start structural reforms to complete the transition to a market economy
and prepare for EU accession.
The economy grew in response, but at a pace considered below its potential. Economic policy-making
and reform implementation were uneven, leading to episodes of excessive fiscal expansion (especially in
the run-up to the 1999 and 2003 parliamentary elections) and a rapid rise in external debt. More cost-
effective public expenditure programs, particularly in health, social protection and transport, were seen as
critical to contain high levels of public spending and thereby reduce the persistent fiscal pressures. The
record on structural reforms was also mixed: while substantial progress had been made in pension system
(by introducing multi-pillar system and undertaking parametric reform of PAYGO system) and financial
sector reforms, especially after the banking crisis in 1998-99, the privatization process that began in the
1990s had serious flaws and had lost momentum. The public sector continued to absorb a large share of
the economy's resources, crowding out the private sector. And the development of a more professional,
efficient public administration was hindered by a large number of political appointees, as well as a salary
scheme that was not merit-based and led to a brain drain from public administration to the private sector.
Since 1993 through 2004, the Bank support for Croatia had included reconstruction and investment loans,
and two policy-based operations, as well as analytic and advisory activities that became increasingly
important in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The outcomes of the two policy-based operations were
mixed: the FSAL in FY97 was rated as moderately unsatisfactory (with poor outcomes in privatization
offsetting good outcomes in financial sector reform); and the SAL in FY02 was rated as satisfactory,
despite challenges faced by the Government in implementation. A Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE),
which assessed Croatia's development priorities and the Bank assistance program through 2003,
recommended that the Bank's future assistance strategy focuses on three areas that would assist Croatia to
achieve EU membership and improve its growth performance: i) rationalizing public expenditure
programs to improve their effectiveness, to contain the growth in public spending and debt, and to create
more space for the private sector; ii) improving the environment for private sector development and
restarting the privatization process on a sound basis; and iii) strengthening the judicial sector and
reforming public administration to make it less politicized and more professional in line with the needs of
EU membership and the needs of a modern market economy.2
Following elections in November 2003, a new coalition government was formed with a one-vote majority.
The new government reaffirmed that EU accession was Croatia's overriding priority and adopted an
ambitious reform program focused on meeting EU accession requirements, including fiscal consolidation,
accelerating privatization and improving the climate for private investment, and strengthening the

judiciary and public administration, including public expenditure management. 3 The European
Commission (EC) responded in April 2004 with a favorable Opinion on Croatia's application for EU
membership, which set out an agenda for accession negotiations that closely paralleled the government's
program and led to Croatia being granted candidate status by the European Council, with formal
negotiations to start in 2005.
Also in 2004, Croatia entered into a Precautionary Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF which supported
the government's program. Meanwhile, the World Bank worked with the government on a new CAS,
drawing on a stock of relevant analytical and advisory work as well as lending experience (Box 1), that
put the Bank in a good position to support the government's development program. There was very close
alignment between the new CAS, the recommendations of the CAE, the government's new program, and
the accession agenda identified in the EC Opinion.4 A series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PAL) in
support of the government's strategy for growth and reform for successful EU accession were the
cornerstone of the CAS. Like the government's own program and the EU accession agenda, they focused
on an ambitious set of reforms (Section 1.2-1.3 below) with associated "stretch" goals5.

    Box 1: Analytic Underpinnings of PAL Program
    The following were among the analytic and advisory activities most relevant to the design and
    implementation of the PAL Program:
    1. The 2003 CEM: Strategy for Growth through European Integration. This integrative report linked the
    reforms needed to enhance growth and complete the transition to a modern market economy to the structural
    reforms needed for successful EU accession. Its coverage was broader than that of the PAL, facilitating a
    selective approach in specifying the PAL Program agenda.
    2. The 2001 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review provided more detailed analysis of key
    expenditure programs and areas for potential expenditure reduction or refocusing. This was updated and
    supplemented during PAL implementation by the 2008 Public Finance Review, whose initial draft findings
    informed the dialogue from early 2007.
    3. The 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment and the 2004 Country Procurement Assessment
    provided background on public financial management and procurement issues and risks, and was
    particularly relevant for the internal audit and financial controls and procurement components of the PAL
    agenda for public expenditure management.
    4. A FIAS study of barriers to foreign investment in 2000 and a 2004 Cost of Doing Business assessment of
    Croatia in 2004 provided input on the PAL components aimed at improving the investment climate.
    5. A 2000 Poverty Assessment and a 2006 Regional Development and Living Standards Assessment
    provided background information before and during the Program on the implications of alternative policies,
    such as social benefit programs, on different income groups.
    6. The findings of a 2006 Poverty and Social Impact Assessment of shipyard restructuring informed the
    government's preparations for privatization and restructuring and possible social remediation options.
    7. Policy Notes provided a flexible way to provide specific analyses to guide specific aspects of program
    design.
    8. Workshops provided opportunities to disseminate findings of studies and to share lessons learned from
    other countries with different types of audiences and stakeholders on topics relevant to the PAL agenda.

  Stretch goals used in the program were not supposed to be used rigidly and in isolation as measures of the program
results, since factors beyond the control of PAL had been affecting their achievement as well.

The Bank was fully aware that Croatia's previously uneven track record in policy reform, and the
government's fragile, one-vote majority, posed serious risks of policy slippage for these operations, but
saw those risks being limited due to several factors. First, the close alignment of the CAS and the PAL
measures with those of the government's own program, as well as the EU accession agenda and the
Precautionary Stand-by Arrangement, was seen as reinforcing government ownership. In particular,
strong public support for EU accession was seen as strengthening the government's hand in introducing
difficult reforms needed to function effectively as an EU member. Second, as a series of single-tranche
operations based on an agreed program of prior actions and triggers, the PAL program would be self-
regulating, allowing for adjustments in content and timing consistent with the government's ability to
make progress on the reform agenda. Finally, the CAS was designed with triggers that would move
Croatia from a base case lending program to a low case program if progress in implementing the PAL
program was inadequate.
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objective of the PAL series was to enhance economic growth in Croatia through: (i) improving the
investment climate, and (ii) reducing the size of and improving the efficiency of the public sector. This
was to be implemented through fiscal adjustment and consolidation, a central theme of the operation. The
PAL series was also seen as supporting the Government in its EU accession and integration efforts, by
helping to ensure that key economic reforms under the acquis were effectively implemented.
The overall PAL outcome indicators, identified in the program documents as "stretch goals" were:
          General government expenditures declining from 51.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 46 percent of
          GDP in 2008, and the fiscal deficit declining from 6.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.0 percent of
          GDP in 2008;6
          The private sector's share in GDP rising from 60 percent in 2003 to 70 percent in 2008; and,
          FIAS and Cost of Doing Business assessments indicating an improved investment climate by
          2008.
The policy measures and actions to achieve these objectives were grouped into three inter-related pillars:
 i) improving the investment climate (through SOE privatization and liquidation, increased enterprise
      financial discipline, reduced cost of doing business, and strengthening the judiciary);
 ii) improving governance (through reforms in public administration and public expenditure
      management); and
 iii) improving the fiscal sustainability and efficiency of selected sector programs (specifically health
      care, pensions, social benefits and the railways).
    These pillars are presented in Section 1.4 below. An assessment of the relevance of the PDOs and policy
    pillars is in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 assesses the outcomes, including the maintenance of an appropriate
    macroeconomic policy framework, against the key indicators associated with them. Annex 3 presents
    the policy matrix for the full PAL Program, with prior actions, benchmarks and outcome indicators
    specified.

 The 2003 base period spending and deficit numbers given here are the revised estimates presented in the PAL2
Program Document in May 2007 based on the actual data. The PAL1 Program Document used preliminary estimates
of 50.5 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. The 2008 outcome goals were not changed.


                                                      7
The Program's main policy areas were organized in three pillars:
Pillar 1 -Improving the Investment Climate through:
         Privatization and liquidation of State-owned enterprises (SOEs), by selling or liquidating state's
         enterprise holdings, including agro-kombinats and shipyards;
         Improving financial discipline of enterprises by reducing state subsidies to enterprises and
         containing enterprise arrears;
         Reducing the cost of doing business by reducing administrative and regulatory barriers; and
         Strengthening the judiciary by rationalizing the court system, reducing case backlogs,
         accelerating court proceedings, and strengthening enforcement of judgments, contracts and
         bankruptcy procedures.
Pillar 2 -Strengthening Governance through:
         Rationalizing and improving efficiency of public administration by reform of public employment
         legislation to enhance professionalism and decrease politization in the civil service, and
         reforming the salary system towards merit-based rewarding and promotion; rationalizing
         organizational structures; and strengthening the policy process; and
         Improving public expenditure management by building internal audit and financial control
         capacities, improving tools for budget planning and execution, and strengthening public
         procurement.
Pillar 3 -Enhancing the Fiscal Sustainability of Sector Programs:
         Health financing reforms to improve efficiency and contain drug and hospital expenditures;
         Reform of social benefits, by consolidating them and improving the targeting of cash social
         benefits;
         Improving the fiscal and social sustainability of the pension system by adopting a sustainable
         pension indexation formula; and,
         Improving the fiscal performance of railways, through reforms to reduce the railway's fiscal
         deficit.
1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
There were no revisions in policy areas supported by the program, though there were some modifications
in specific policy actions discussed in Sections 2 and 37.
1.6 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule,
and funding allocations)
While there were no significant changes in objectives or policy areas, there were changes in design, loan
amounts and timing from the original program concept of three single-tranche operations, each for
US$150 million, between FY05 and FY07. First, PAL1 was not approved until FY06 (September 2005)
as the government needed additional time to complete the prior actions. The amount of the loan was
higher than originally planned in the CAS: 150 (US$184.9) million instead of $150 (about 122) million.
The delay in PAL1 meant that PAL2 was not negotiated until the following fiscal year (January 2007),
with the government facing Parliamentary elections in November 2007. During negotiations, the
government requested that PAL2 be converted into a two-tranche operation to allow for the government

anticipated Board presentation in May 2007, and probably not before the elections in November 2007. In
this case, a delay in Board presentation of PAL2 was not seen as a workable option, since the Croatian
Parliament would be in recess from July until December, after the November elections, and unable to
ratify the loan. The government anticipated that a delay in approving PAL2, with its prior actions, might
increase the risk of policy slippages in the pre-election period. In addition, the possibility of a new
government could mean substantial delay in reestablishing the program. The government felt, and the
Bank agreed, that the proposed approach offered the best chance to make progress on the reform agenda,
by implementing the reforms that were possible by May, and by providing a clear incentive to complete
the remaining reforms.
The Bank also agreed to the government's request to raise the loan amount to 150 million, the same euro
amount as PAL1, on account of the government's proposal to strengthen the privatization prior action by
specifically including three large loss-making firms in the metal industry, and to upgrade the benchmarks
on shipyard privatization and adoption of the new law on civil service salaries to second tranche release
conditions. The split of the loan amount between the two tranches (100 million first tranche and 50
million second tranche) provided an incentive to continue the reforms and reduced the Bank's exposure in
the event the reforms did not materialize. Moreover, the Minutes of Negotiations recorded that reversals
of the PAL-supported reforms would put the entire Bank assistance program into the low case scenario,
with sharply reduced lending levels.
Following the Board presentation in May 2007, PAL2 encountered a series of implementation problems
(discussed in Section 2.1 below), delaying its effectiveness until April 2008, and the disbursement of the
first tranche by May 2008. Though the closing date was extended (from June 30, 2008 to October 31,
2008) to allow for additional time to complete the second tranche conditions, they were not fully
completed by that date9. The government and the Bank agreed to let the loan close at the end of October
2008, without disbursing the 50 million second tranche. As a result of these changes, the Program
consisted of two operations (one of which had two tranches), each for 150 (or a total of US$382.3)
million in commitments, in FY06 and FY07. Total disbursements amounted to 250 (US$335.5)
million.10

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)
This Section focuses on issues which arose in specific parts of the Program during implementation, and
hence is not a balanced picture of overall performance. Section 3 contains an assessment of overall
Program performance in terms of outcomes.
Table 1 provides an overview of the PAL series, while Table 2 lists PAL1 and 2 prior actions and PAL 2
second tranche conditions. Annex 3 contains the full PAL policy matrix as presented at PAL2 Board
Presentation, with outcome indicators and goals specified.

PAL1 to PAL 2 Board presentation (September 2005 to May 2007): All PAL1 prior actions were met
before Board presentation in September 2005 (Table 2). PAL1 also indicated prior actions and
benchmarks for subsequent operations, establishing the medium-term policy and institutional reform
program that was closely aligned with the government's own program and the EU accession agenda. For
the reasons indicated in Section 1.6, PAL2 was a two-tranche operation, supporting the overall program
both through prior actions completed before the Board presentation in May 2007, and through additional
actions to be completed before second tranche release (Table 2).
During preparation, PAL2 prior actions had been modified somewhat from those initially presented to
reflect implementation experience and shifts in government priorities. First, one of the key Pillar 3
reforms, the adoption of a more sustainable pension indexing system, originally a PAL2 prior action, was
implemented in July 2005, much earlier than expected. Thus the benefits from this reform (a gradual
improvement in pension finances and reduction in government spending) started more than 18 months
before PAL2 was approved. Second, the privatization actions were strengthened during PAL2
negotiations by adding three specific large loss-makers to the privatization action that were a PAL2 prior
action. In addition, at the government's request, the privatization of one shipyard was elevated from a
PAL2 benchmark to a condition for second tranche release. Due to implementation delays, the
privatization of three subsidiaries of the Railway Company (HZ), a part of the Pillar 3 reforms to improve
Railway financial sustainability, was moved from a PAL2 prior action to a second tranche release
condition. Third, two Pillar 2 Administrative Reform benchmarks (a new job classification system and a
new law on civil service salaries) were combined and made a Second Tranche release condition. Fourth,
since the new Health Insurance Act (a PAL2 prior action under Pillar 3) did not fully meet the policy
objectives, the government adopted, and incorporated in the prior actions, several additional measures to
contain demand and costs. Finally, the prior action related to social welfare spending was modified by
adding a spending cap (4% of GDP) to limit the potential additional spending for family and child
allowances anticipated in 2007 due to a National Population Policy adopted by the government to address
acute demographic problem.11

    Second Tranche Release Condition

From PAL2 Board Presentation to Effectiveness (May 2007 to April 2008): While much of the PAL
program continued to make good progress, several important implementation problems arose in the
months following PAL2 Board presentation, in part reflecting pressures on the Government in the run-up
to the November 2007 Parliamentary elections. First, the June 2007 Supervision Mission learned that the
government was likely to agree to railway union demands for a substantial wage increase and that the
Railway Company (HZ) had substantially slowed the pace of net staff reductions. Both factors seriously
jeopardized the improvement targeted for HZ's finances both in 2007 and beyond, implying greater
pressures on government spending. Second, in July 2007 the government agreed with its coalition partner


                                                              12
(the Pensioner's Party) to enact several amendments to the Pension Law that would increase pension
benefits and costs, again putting pressure on government spending. Third, at about the same time, the
Bank learned that the revised 2007 Budget did not provide for the increase in the means-tested component
of social benefits targeting the most vulnerable, as it was planned under the Social Benefit Reform
Strategy and was a part of the prior action for Board presentation.12 Finally, also at about the same time,
the Bank learned that following the government's final contract award decisions for the sale of three large
loss-making firms in April 2007, the normal routine process of signing them had been interrupted by an
anti-corruption investigation of the Croatian Privatization Fund (CPF). In the course of that investigation,
the Prosecutor General's office arrested three of CPF's four top managers and sequestered most of CPF's
documents, including those related to these sales.
The Bank and government worked together to assess the impact of these developments and to identify
ways to ensure program objectives were achieved. In the meantime, the government withheld submission
of the Legal Opinion for the PAL2 Loan Agreement, and the Bank extended the effectiveness deadline,
initially to end-December 2007 and later to end-June 2008. The delays in the sales of the three large loss-
making firms were rectified soon after the Prosecutor General's office released the necessary
documentation, with two of the sales contracts signed in July and the third in December.13 There have
been no findings of corruption associated with these sales (or any other sales managed by CPF and
monitored under the PAL), but there were cases of misconduct found for privatizations under preparation.
On the other issues, the Bank and government agreed to postpone effectiveness until appropriate action
could be taken to increase the means-tested social benefits. The pension issues and railway financing
issues would be reviewed in the course of regular Program supervision and the review of overall Program
progress prior to release of the second tranche. As the PAL2 slipped into the problem project status, the
overall Bank lending program was put into the low case.
Following the elections, a new coalition government was formed in January 2008, with the same party in
the lead position and the same Prime Minister, but with different coalition partners and a somewhat larger
majority in Parliament. A substantial degree of continuity was maintained in PAL-related ministries,
particularly Finance, Economy, Transport, Public Administration, Judiciary and Environment. The new
government reaffirmed its commitment to EU accession and the pursuit of structural reforms, including
completing the privatization process, railways' restructuring and judicial and public administration
reforms. Upon a visit by the new Country Director in early 2008, the government also reaffirmed its
commitment to working with the Bank to achieve the PAL objectives, and the Bank responded with
continued close monitoring and supervision missions in March, June and September 2008.
In March 2008, a new issue arose with the abolition of the administrative fee for health services, a step
incorporated in the new government's coalition agreement. This fee was a small flat charge on different
medical services that was part of the package of prior actions in PAL2 aimed at containing demand and
raising revenues for health. While this step would cause some reversal in health system finances, the
government argued that the fee caused a range of administrative difficulties and that a new package of
health sector reforms was being prepared that would improve health system finances in a more



12
   See Section 3.2, Pillar 3, (b), (c), and (d) for an assessment of these measures and their impact on outcomes for
social benefits, pensions, and railways.
13
   During the PAL program, the Bank had been monitoring the government's award of contract as the point of
privatization, since before this decision (endorsed by the cabinet and signed by the PM) all due diligence had been
completed and all terms and conditions settled, so the sales contract was usually signed in a matter of few weeks and
was a formality handled by the CPF. The Loan Agreement, however, used the phrase "has privatized", without any
additional defining language, and the Letter of Development Policy used the phrase "completed the privatization".
To avoid any potential misunderstanding, the government prudently withheld the legal opinion on the Loan,
postponing effectiveness and disbursement of the first tranche.


                                                        13
sustainable manner. The Bank agreed with the government that the fee had not been ideal solution and
that it would review the progress in designing and implementing the proposed new reforms in connection
with release of the second tranche, or extension of the Loan closing date, should that prove necessary.
A positive development was that the new government's coalition agreement also included an increase in
the means-tested social benefit, the remaining effectiveness condition. Before implementing this increase,
however, the government felt it was important to put in place a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
system to improve targeting and prevent leakages, and also to help its broader social benefit reform
strategy. The benefit increase was authorized by the government in March 2008, with effectiveness from
November, and the legislation for the PIN was passed in April 2008. The Loan was declared effective on
April 28, 2008 and the first tranche disbursed in May 2008.
From Effectiveness to Closing (April 2008 to October 2008): As the original closing date (June 30,
2008) approached, the Bank and government focused on actions to meet the three second tranche release
conditions (privatization of one shipyard, privatization of 3 HZ subsidiaries, and a new civil service salary
law 14 ) and actions needed for a satisfactory review of the overall program prior to tranche release
(particularly additional health sector reforms to offset the abolition of the administrative fee, and actions
in HZ restructuring to reverse the deterioration in its finances following the wage increases and lower
layoffs after mid-2007). Following discussions with a supervision mission in June, the government
requested, and received an extension of the closing date to October 31, 2008.
However, following discussions with a supervision mission in September 2008, it was agreed that the
conditions for releasing the second tranche were unlikely to be met by end-October, even though some
progress had been made (notably the divestiture of three HZ subsidiaries). Consequently, the Loan closed
and the undisbursed second tranche (50 million) was cancelled on October 31, 2008. The government
continued implementing the reform program, including the passage of a new set of health reform laws in
December 2008, that took effect in January 2009, and the submission of the new Law on Civil Service
Salaries to Parliament in December 2008 for a first reading. Work on the shipyard privatization has
continued in the context of EU negotiations with a final clearance of privatization tenders by the EC
received in June 2009. These developments are discussed in the context of the outcomes of the overall
program in section 3.2 below.
As noted above, this section has focused on the issues that arose during implementation. These affected
only a subset of the Program's components. Section 3.2 places these issues in the context of the total
Program and its outcomes, providing a more comprehensive and balanced view of Program achievements.
2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
Program content. By design, the PAL Program was ambitious, with several elements that were
particularly challenging politically, including pension and social benefit reform, railway restructuring and
shipyard privatization. Consequently, the program documents drew attention to the difficult agenda and
described the outcome objectives as "stretch" goals. At the same time, both the government and the Bank
saw these reforms as steps critical to complete the transition to a modern market economy and to
complete the process of EU accession. Excluding difficult reforms might have made PAL easier to
implement, but it is difficult to see how it would have made it easier to achieve the objectives of the
reforms.
Political pressures. The 2003 coalition government, with its fragile one-vote majority, has faced strong
political pressures in the run-up to the 2007 elections. Consequently, in response to politically powerful
railway unions' and the Pensioner's Party's requests, it approved a double-digit railway wage increase
and changes in pension benefits that ran counter to PAL Program objectives and lead to spending

     A new civil service job classification system had been adopted in July 2007.

increases. These decisions appear to have been taken without systematic consideration of their costs and
alternatives by the government's professional staff. Such risks had been explicitly anticipated in the PAL
Program Documents, and during negotiations of PAL2, when the government and the Bank sought to
minimize these risks through the timing of PAL2 and by introducing a second tranche (See Section 1.6).
Uneven government commitment. Initially it was clear that there was a high degree of commitment to
and ownership of the PAL Program at the highest levels of government and in all ministries and agencies
directly involved in implementation. All ministries and agencies involved in implementing the Program
participated in negotiations of PAL1 and 2, and the Council of Ministers reviewed and endorsed each
operation. This commitment was reconfirmed at PAL2 negotiations. However, commitment in different
parts of the government varied over time, both in the pre-election period discussed above, and in dealing
with the more politically difficult issues such as downsizing railways and privatizing shipyards. The
commitment was strongest and most consistent in the Ministry of Finance, as was demonstrated by its
satisfactory implementation of the Program elements under its direct authority, and by its constructive
efforts to get the Program back on track after the partial policy reversals discussed in Section 2.1.
Satisfactory progress was also made in a number of other areas, including those under the responsibility
of the CPF and the Ministry of Justice. But the results for other reform areas where political sensitivities
were high (such as railway restructuring and shipyard privatization) were less consistent.
Coordination arrangements. Although the government assigned responsibility for coordination of the
PAL reforms within the government to the Ministry of Finance, this was not accompanied by any
delegation of authority, as most decision-making remained centralized with the Prime Minister. The
Ministry of Finance was at times put in the awkward position of reporting to the PM on shortfalls in areas
that were the responsibility of other line ministries. Finance Ministry officials feel this arrangement was
not always effective and led to occasional strains on the Ministry's relations with other ministries. At the
same time, given content of the program and the government management set-up, it is not clear what
alternative arrangement would have been more effective.
Investigation of CPF. Notwithstanding its potential impact on Croatia's fight against corruption, the
investigation of CPF described in the previous section had an adverse impact on the wider privatization
process, effectively suspending most activities until early 2008.15
EU Accession Process. EU accession has been the critical motivating force for the initial reforms and for
continued implementation. The EC's annual Progress Reports as well as Pre-Accession Economic
Programs (PEP) have helped Croatia formulate and monitor overall progress towards accession as well as
specific elements of the PAL program which became almost an integrated part of the PEP. EU has also
provided substantial financial and technical assistance in a number of aspects of the program, especially
judicial reform and public administration reform, including the development of internal audit and
financial control capacity, as well as environmental impact assessment. EU accession remains an
important impetus for reform, though there is a sense that this impetus has weakened somewhat as Croatia
draws near to EU membership.
IMF Program. The IMF supported the Government's program through an SDR 97 million (subsequently
raised to SDR 99 million) Precautionary Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) in place from August 2004 to its
successful conclusion in November 2006, and through its subsequent surveillance and Article IV
consultations. No drawings were needed under the SBA, and as Croatia's external debt began to stabilize,
the government did not see a need for a subsequent arrangement. The IMF continued to reinforce
government efforts to reduce fiscal pressures and reduce its exposure to debt, although in some areas like
the health reform, a position of the IMF has softened the proposed 2006 reform package which later on
had to be accompanied with additional demand- and supply-control measures as agreed under the PAL2.

The IMF also provided support in the areas of budget formulation and debt management, allowing the
public expenditure management component of the PAL to focus on improving internal audit and budget
implementation mechanisms.
Other donor support and other Bank resources. Other donors and the World Bank helped reinforce
government capacity to implement the Program through technical assistance targeted at specific critical
needs. SIDA provided a substantial trust fund of approximately US$1 million that supported public
administration reforms, particularly the drafting of legislation and regulations for the public service
reform, and the design and implementation of functional reviews to help line ministries and state offices
at the county level design strategies to rationalize their organizations. DfID also provided support for
public administration reform and the UNDP funded the development of the methodology for Social
Impact Assessments. USAID provided assistance on privatization, particularly assessments of shipyard
restructuring plans. The Bank provided assistance in developing the benchmarking study for shipyards
and Enterprise Subsidy Reduction Plan through the Technical Assistance II project, and supported the
development of the innovative Fiscal Impact Assessment through an IDF Grant for Strengthening Budget
Management.
Sound background analysis. The availability of timely, relevant analytic work (See Box 1) was a key
factor in program design, particularly in identifying the priority program areas and the rationale for the
specific policy actions supported.
External environment. The external environment was generally favorable for most of the Program
period, helping Croatia achieve a higher growth in GDP, tax revenues and direct foreign investment, as
well as supporting buyers' interest in the SOEs tendered for privatization. A possible negative effect was
that the buoyant revenues may have dampened the pressure for spending consolidation. In late 2008, the
external environment began to deteriorate sharply as the effects of the global economic recession were
felt on the Croatian economy. Among the negative effects is a reported decline in buyers' interest in SOEs
tendered for privatization and liquidity problems of the metal industry. At the same time there is renewed
pressure to find efficient ways to reduce public spending.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The main reform areas of the PAL Program were formatted in a detailed policy matrix with specified
outcome indicators, sequencing, next steps and responsibilities, based on the PAL Policy Matrix (see
Annex 3). Progress in implementing policy actions and in moving toward quantified outcome goals was
systematically recorded in the matrix, along with responsibilities for next steps. This was used by the
Bank in supervision missions and intermediate program reviews with the government, and also by the
government in its own reviews of the program. This matrix was also a valuable tool in preparing the CAE
and this ICR.
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
Follow-up on much of the PAL Program agenda will continue through the ongoing EU accession
negotiations, particularly in such areas as privatization of shipyards, subsidy reduction (including
railways) in line with the EU competition policy, judicial reform, improvements in public administration
and public expenditure management, and strengthened internal audit, financial control and procurement.
As noted, the government is continuing to implement reforms in these and other areas. The Bank's 2008
Country Partnership Strategy provides scope for follow up through programmatic public expenditure
reviews and other analytic and advisory work (including on the investment climate, governance, health
and fiduciary issues), as well as further Development Policy Lending should the government's program
require and justify such operations. An operation to support further implementation of the judicial reforms
is also under preparation.

                                                    16
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities, and
Bank assistance strategy)
The PAL Program was designed to support reforms that would enhance Croatia's growth performance
while maintaining macroeconomic stability and meeting the institutional and structural requirements for
successful EU accession. Reforms under Pillar 1 aimed at improving the regulatory framework and
judicial sector to facilitate private sector activity, while reducing the role of the state in production
through privatization of SOEs and containing enterprise subsidies. Pillar 2 was focused on improving the
effectiveness of public administration, making it less political, more professional and more efficient, and
on strengthening public expenditure management, particularly in managing budget execution and in
internal audit, financial control and procurement. Pillar 3 focused on improving the fiscal sustainability of
public spending in four areas: health, social benefits, pensions, and railway operations, all areas where
previous public expenditure analysis had indicated scope for reducing fiscal pressures. Within these areas
the PAL Program was designed to complement activities of other development partners, particularly with
the EU in such areas as judicial and public administration reform and with the IMF in public expenditure
management.
As noted in Section 1.1, these reforms were fully consistent with Croatia's development needs and its
priorities as stated in its own program, the EU accession agenda, the CAS and the CAE evaluation of the
Bank's earlier assistance strategy.
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal linkages
between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes)
Overall Program Development Objectives and macro-economic framework:
Croatia achieved robust growth and maintained macroeconomic stability over the Program period (Table
3), though in the last quarter of 2008 the global economic recession led to a sharp deceleration of growth,
and GDP is expected to fall by around 3 to 3.5 percent in 2009.

Between 2004 and 2008 real GDP growth averaged 4.7 percent, well above the 3.2 percent average
growth for the five years before the program. Growth was sufficiently rapid to reduce Croatia's
stubbornly high unemployment rate by over 4 percentage points. With population stable, most of the GDP

  growth translated into a substantial rise in per capita incomes and a reduction in Croatia's relative poverty
  rate (income below 60 percent median).16
  The acceleration in growth, a central objective of the Program, reflects a number of factors, including a
  generally favorable external economic environment for much of the period. It also reflects a substantial
  rise in private sector activity, another key Program objective, which can be seen in the growing share of
  private sector investment in GDP and in the substantial levels of net FDI (Table 3). The private sector's
  share in GDP rose to 70 percent by 2008, in line with the Program objectives (Table 4). The growth in the
  private sector was facilitated by a generally favorable, and improving, business environment (see
  discussion of Pillar 1 below), and was accommodated by a consolidation of the public sector (another key
  program objective), with public spending, the fiscal deficit, and public total and external debt all declining
  as a share of GDP (see Table 3 and discussions of Pillars 2 and 3 below).

  Although the reduction in spending was more gradual than targeted and greater progress in this area
  would have placed Croatia in a better position to deal with its current economic crisis, the reduction in the
  fiscal deficit was on target and the macroeconomic stance was sufficiently restrained to maintain a
  reasonable degree of stability during the Program. Inflation remained around 3 percent p.a. until 2008
  when the high import commodity prices caused a short-term spur in domestic prices. By late 2008,
  inflation had subsided to the 3-4 percent range, reflecting lower import prices and softening domestic
  demand. The widening current account deficit was a source of concern, but has also reflected rising
  import prices since 2007. It also reflected growing private sector investment demand, part of which was
  financed by the growing FDI. The current account deficit is expected to decline in 2009, as imports
  contract in response to lower domestic demand. The decline in public sector external borrowing made
  room for a substantial increase in private borrowing, while stabilizing total external debt to GDP (at
  around 90 percent) during the Program period (Table 3). This was a sharp contrast to the period
  immediately before the PAL program (2001 and 2004) when total external debt as a share of GDP rose by
  more than 27 percentage points. Croatia's successful placement of a 750 million Eurobond issue in May
  2009 indicates the positive view in international financial markets of Croatia's economic performance and
  prospects.
  Nevertheless, the global economic crisis has exposed the Croatian economy to increased risks which will
  require careful economic management and further spending reductions to overcome. Although the debt
  level has been fairly stable, it is high and could be costly to refinance or increase further. Projected

    This is also consistent with significant declines recorded in the number of people eligible for means-tested social
  assistance.

  revenue shortfalls due to the slowdown in economic activity are likely to make more borrowing necessary
  unless further spending reductions are achieved. The unfinished PAL agenda could provide a starting
  point for such reductions.
  Pillar 1: Improving the Investment Climate:
  a)       Privatization/Liquidation of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs): The overall outcomes for
  divestiture of state ownership in enterprises were moderately satisfactory over the course of PAL1 and
  PAL2. In total, 1030 SOEs were privatized or liquidated, substantially exceeding the prior actions and
  benchmarks for PAL 1 and 2, and modestly higher than the overall Program goal of 1,000. These
  divestitures included 156 firms with majority state holdings, all but one of the remaining agri-kombinats
  (for which no buyer has yet been found), and three large loss-making enterprises in the metal industry.
  The processes followed (through tender or auctions, limited use of purchase conditions and no repurchase
  provisions) sought to avoid the serious deficiencies of the privatization program of the early 1990s, which
  relied excessively on employee or manager buyouts, and gave scope for political interference, continued
  subsidization, and even re-nationalization. The approach followed appears to have led to more sustainable
  privatization outcomes, although the recent economic crisis will put stress on a number of the recently-
  privatized enterprises.
  The one notable shortfall in this part of the Program was the inability to privatize one shipyard, originally
  a PAL2 benchmark, but made a condition for second tranche release during PAL2 negotiations at
  government request. Although the Government was convinced that it would complete this privatization in
  2007, the process is taking much longer. This was in part due to political sensitivities, as per the EU
  request shipyards need to shut down part of production capacity to compensate for the illegal state aid
  received in the past; but also in part due to a complex maritime land issue which needed to be resolved in
  a way that could also be applied to the other four shipyards scheduled to be privatized. By late 2008, it
  was clear that this sale could not be completed without a further substantial extension of the closing date.
  Shipyard privatization remains an important priority in the Government's Pre-accession Economic
  Program and in its EU accession negotiations, and work on this process continues with the final
  compensation schemes and privatization tenders approved by the EC. The sale is likely to be further
  complicated by the world-wide excess capacity in shipping which has emerged clearly in the global
  economic recession.

  b)       Improving Enterprise Financial Discipline: The outcomes are satisfactory for the overall
  Program. The MoF prepared and consistently implemented its Corporate Sector Subsidy Reduction Plan
  in line with agreed prior actions for PAL1 and 2, reducing enterprise subsidies from 3.08 percent of GDP
  in 2004 to 1.8 percent at end-2008, below the Program target of 2.0 percent. A further decline is budgeted
  for 2009, although this will be put under pressure with a global economic decline and real sector problems.
  This was one of the most important contributors to fiscal consolidation. Overdue public enterprise
  receivables from customers and government declined by 38 and 63 percent, respectively between 2004
  and 2008. The outcome for arrears to suppliers was more mixed, due entirely to a large increase in the
  arrears of the Croatian Electricity Company (HEP) after 2007, reflecting higher energy costs and delayed
  energy price adjustments. Without the rise in HEP arrears, public enterprise arrears would have fallen
  from 0.65 percent of GDP to 0.30 percent; but with HEP's increase included, they only declined to 0.49
  percent of GDP.
  c)        Reducing Cost of Doing Business: The outcomes for this component are satisfactory. Private
  investment rose to over 28 percent of GDP in 2008, exceeding the Program goal of 25 percent. Foreign
  Direct Investment also rose substantially over the period from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2004 to 9.1 percent
  in 2007 before declining to about 4.9 percent with the global economic slowdown in 2008. The specific
  regulatory reform benchmarked in PAL2 -- the streamlining of construction permits, has been
  implemented and is reported to work smoothly after overcoming some initial delays due to early
  implementation problems (the issuance has been delegated to county offices). These positive outcomes
  result not only from PAL Program measures, but also from the Government's broader efforts to reduce
  administrative and regulatory barriers and from a generally buoyant domestic and world economy over
  much of the program period. The annual Doing Business reports are consistent with these outcomes. As
  shown in Table 4, Croatia's percentile ranking rose from the bottom 24 percent in 2005 (the first year of
  cross-country rankings) to 42 percent by 2008, during a period when many other countries were also
  trying to improve their business environment.17 Doing Business team selected Croatia as the best reformer
  in the region (second best in the world) in 2006-07. While noting this progress, a 2008 FIAS review
  emphasized the need for additional reforms if Croatia is to maintain and further improve its ranking, as it
  still lags behind a number of its regional comparators.18
  d)      Strengthening the Judiciary: The outcomes for this component are satisfactory, a rating
  consistent with the annual Progress Reports of the European Commission, which note the substantive
  progress made, as well as the need to complete the broader reform agenda and step up the pace of

implementation.19 The main outcome indicator for this component, the backlog of court cases, showed
significant improvement over the program, declining from 1.64 million cases in 2004 to 0.83 million in
late 2008, despite an annual inflow of about a million new cases. Not all of this improvement can be
attributed to the PAL Program alone, as there were earlier operations by the Bank and other donors and
ongoing assistance from the EU. Nevertheless, the PAL-supported reforms contributed to the outcome by
reducing the non-judicial and administrative burdens on judges, particularly (a) in registration of land and
commercial firms, which is now simplified and highly automated, and which has also reduced
administrative barriers for entry of new firms, and (b) in enforcement, by moving non-contested claims to
public notaries. These measures have freed judges to focus more on contested cases. Recently-introduced
procedures, operational in 13 commercial court jurisdictions, allow commercial firms to be registered on-
line, usually in less than 24 hours, not only at commercial courts but also at the offices of public notaries
and Financial Agency. New caseload and workload norms, combined with improved data systems, have
permitted a more efficient distribution of work among judges, monitoring of progress, and identification
of bottlenecks. A professional election body has been established requiring less time of judges for election
monitoring, in particular for national elections.
After piloting the approach, rationalization of the court network has begun with the functional merging of
municipal courts in July 2008, reducing their number from 108 to 67, allowing pooling of overheads and
more efficient distribution of workloads. A similar consolidation of misdemeanor courts (from 110 to 60)
has been submitted for parliamentary approval, following the rationalization of the number of States
Attorneys' offices. These measures are expected to bring efficiency improvements in the medium term. A
new Bank-financed project is under preparation to support continued implementation of these reforms, as
well as further automation of case management, enforcement of judicial decisions, and better targeting of
legal aid for the vulnerable. This will support reforms planned by the Government to improve
enforcement of court decisions, and to shorten the duration of court procedures, which are still lengthy by
EU standards.
Pillar 2: Strengthening Governance:
a) Strengthening Public Administration: Progress in the specific areas of public administration reform
(PAR) supported by the PAL program (civil service reform, functional reorganization of ministries and
mandatory impact assessments of new laws and regulations) has been slow, but some significant steps
have been taken. With one critical exception, the PAL prior actions and benchmarks have been met,
establishing some of the key building blocks of Croatia's strategy to modernize public administration in
line with prevailing EU standards. These reforms were supported by a number of donors, particularly
through ongoing TA from the EU and a substantial trust fund from SIDA administered by the Bank that
specifically supported PAL-related reforms in this area.
In civil service reform, a new Civil Service Law was passed in 2005 (a PAL1 prior action), establishing
the legal basis for a modern, professional civil service with merit-based pay, and reducing the scope for
political appointments. Supplementary legislation and amendments, including a new job classification
system (a PAL2 second tranche condition adopted in July 2007) have been enacted to harmonize with the
new law. In line with the Civil Service Law, following the 2007 elections, only the top two levels of
administration (minister and state secretary) remained as political appointments, with some 200 high-level
positions transferred to the Civil Service and filled through a competitive process based on qualifications,
tests and interviews by a selection panel, with the minister in charge making the final selection from the
shortlist. This process was well underway at the closing of PAL2, with roughly 90 percent of the
advertised positions filled, despite delays reported in some ministries. This is an important step in
ensuring a stable core of professionals at the top levels of government administration, even though, as
discussed below, it will take time for the effects to be felt. The key element still missing from Croatia's

  civil service reform is the proposed Law on Civil Service Salaries (a PAL2 second tranche condition). By
  early 2007, the Government had drafted a law consistent with EU best practice incorporating the
  principles of fiscal responsibility, equal pay for equal work, performance-based pay, and decompression
  to allow more competitive salaries for top level staff. However, protracted discussions with social partners
  (civil service unions) delayed presentation of the law to Parliament until late 2008, after PAL2 had closed.
  Although the law has passed its first reading in Parliament, the timetable of its approval is unclear at the
  time of writing the ICR.20

     Economic crisis and union discontent (including a strike of public sector employees in mid-May) over the

  of this bill.


                                                                   22
ministry (the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MHSW)) and the county level offices. MHSW
reports that its new structure is better aligned with its functions, while it has not led to significant
reduction in staff. The functional review process has been extended to an additional 10 ministries/state
administrative bodies and five county offices. The results have been consolidated by the Central State
Office for Administration (CSOA), with implementation in progress and a presentation of project results
pending the Cabinet meeting, expected in mid-2009. Based on the functional review results a new staffing
organization decree has been drafted and state administrative offices at the county level have been
reorganized following the new rules.
The introduction of mandatory impact assessments, particularly the Fiscal Impact Assessments (FIAs),
has been an important step towards enabling Parliament and other policy-makers to base decisions on an
objective assessment of their effects and costs. Government procedures have been amended to require
fiscal, social, environmental and regulatory impact assessments in line with methodologies that have been
developed and piloted/implemented under the PAL Program. FIAs, developed with assistance from a
World Bank IDF grant for Strengthening Budget Management, have provided the Ministry of Finance
with a strategically important tool: they are required for all proposed new laws, strategies and regulations
and must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. Rather than being merely an additional pro forma
requirement, the process has strengthened the role of the Ministry of Finance during budget preparation
and management.21 The FIAs have been adapted to be integrated more closely with other improvements
in public expenditure management (see following section) being introduced in 2009, particularly the
increased role of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF),22 and the introduction of a more
strategic approach to budget preparation that will link budgets to program objectives and outcome
indicators.
While significant steps have been taken, they are still incomplete and too recently adopted to have had a
measurable impact so far in terms of leading to a smaller, better paid, and more highly skilled
professional civil service. These reforms can reasonably be expected to produce such results only in the
medium term, after the new procedures, organizations, incentive structures and management tools have
been completed, internalized and integrated into regular practice. This will require more time, continued
committed leadership, and a shift in management culture from a decision-making process that is relatively
ad hoc and centralized at the highest political levels, to one that makes more systematic use of the
professional expertise that already exists and that the ongoing reforms are intended to strengthen. Thus,
while public sector wages were contained, declining as a percent of GDP to below the Program goal of 10
percent, this outcome is attributable more to the Government's fiscal prudence and wage restraint than to
the public administration reforms implemented so far.
The overall outcomes for the PAR component are rated as moderately satisfactory, with highly
satisfactory progress on the Fiscal Impact Assessments and satisfactory progress in most other areas
(particularly the new Civil Service Law and the depolitization process) moderated by the continued delay
in adopting the new Civil Service Salary Law. This assessment is broadly consistent with that of the EC
Progress Reports, which record the significant areas of progress that have been achieved, but also note the
slow pace of reform so far and the substantial unfinished agenda.23
b) Improving Public Expenditure Management: There has been good progress in the areas of public
expenditure management (PEM) supported by the Program (i.e., internal audit and financial control,
coverage of the Treasury Single Account, and Treasury financial management information systems), with

all benchmarks met.24 As noted in the previous section, the FIAs are also assisting the MoF in expenditure
management. A new Budget Law has been enacted in July 2008 strengthening the links between strategic
and budget planning processes, as well as making the MTEF mandatory for Parliamentary approval. In
addition, public procurement has been strengthened with the enactment of a new Public Procurement Law
consistent with the EU directives (originally a PAL3 benchmark) in January 2008.
Croatia has established financial management and control (FMC) capacities and internal audit units
(IAU) which are now functioning in all line ministries, state administrative bodies, extra-budgetary funds,
and a growing number of large local government units. 25 A Central Harmonization Unit within the
Ministry of Finance supports the practical implementation of FMC and IA throughout the public sector,
identifying issues, providing guidelines and coordinating training and technical assistance from donors,
mainly the EU. Improvements in this area were called for in the Bank's CFAA and have been particularly
important for the EU, which sees them as critical for the effective use of EU financial assistance, as well
as Croatia's own public resources. The satisfactory results in developing these capacities is indicated by
the EC's assessment of "good progress" in this area, and the positive assessment in a recent SIGMA
report of the Ministry of Finance's commitment and capacity to support the ongoing strengthening of the
FMC and IA system.26
The Ministry of Finance has been successful in widening the coverage of the Treasury Single Account
(TSA) to include all line ministries, the major extra-budgetary funds (health, pensions, employment), and
most other budget entities in 2006. These organizations have now closed the separate bank accounts that
they had maintained. Only a few budget-users (e.g., universities, courts, and some extra-budgetary
agencies) are not yet in the TSA, but they are expected to join with the implementation of the Treasury
Reform Strategy. 27 Reports on TSA balances, inflows and outflows are available on a daily basis,
enabling the Ministry of Finance and budget users to monitor budget implementation closely.28
A program to rationalize and integrate the different financial management information systems (FMIS)
currently used by the Ministry of Finance, line ministries and other budget entities had been prepared in
2006 but implementation was delayed until 2008 due to technical difficulties and lack of funding for
implementation. It also became part of the comprehensive Treasury Reform Strategy adopted by the
Government in 2008. Implementation of FMIS integration began in 2008 with EU assistance. A contract
has been awarded to a major international IT company to develop the integrated system and user interface.
The outcomes in the areas of PEM supported by the PAL Program have been satisfactory. This
assessment reflects the partial achievement of the "stretch goal" for reduction in public spending as a
percent of GDP, and good progress in all benchmarks and intermediate outcomes. Although the decline in
consolidated general government spending (to 49.0 percent of GDP) was more gradual than targeted (to
46 percent of GDP), as discussed above, the spending levels coupled with a significant reduction in public
and publicly guaranteed debt remained consistent with macroeconomic stability, generating greater space
for the private sector. Deviations between budgeted and actual spending were relatively small, well below
5 percent, except in 2008 when revenue shortfalls due to the global economic recession required a 5.9
percent cut in budgeted spending. Much improved capacities for fiduciary oversight of public spending



24
   In line with an agreed division of labor with Government, IMF, EU and other donors, the PAL focused on these
specific areas of a broader PEM reform effort that also fed into the development of the Government's Treasury
Reform Strategy. See PAL2 Program Document, p. 25-26.
25
   The only exceptions at the state level are a handful of agencies whose small size does not justify a dedicated IAU.
Alternative arrangements are being developed for these few cases.

are now in place throughout the public sector, and the tools for budget monitoring and implementation
have been strengthened. The EC 2008 Progress Report concludes that in the area of financial and
budgetary provisions "...Croatia has reached a good level of alignment with and capacity to implement
the acquis."29
Pillar 3: Fiscal Sustainability of Sector Programs:
a)       Health Financing Reform: The outcomes in health financing reform are moderately satisfactory.
Prior actions for PAL 2 included a new Obligatory Health Insurance Act, combined with a package of six
additional measures to contain demand and reduce costs (including an administrative fee that acted as a
flat copayment). The Act, together with these other measures, had a positive initial impact, reducing
public spending on health (at 6.3 percent of GDP in 2004) to 6.1 percent of GDP by 2006, on an accrual
basis (Table 7). After 2006, spending stabilized at 6.0-6.1 percent of GDP (close to the Program goal of
6.0 percent), with the measures in place to contain spending offsetting continued upward pressures on
health costs (including an aging population and rising incomes), and the cancellation of one element of
the package (the administrative fee which proved difficult to administer because of the small amounts
involved) in March 2008. Other reforms remained in place, including measures that reduced the number
of people exempt from copayments by over 500,000 (a 34-percent reduction) since 2004, a revision of
drug lists that encouraged use of lower cost options, the introduction of improved provider payment
mechanisms (DRGs for hospitals), and work on a hospital master plan as a step towards hospital network
rationalization. Moreover, after the closing of PAL2, additional reforms were introduced in 2009 to
contain costs on the supply side, and to dampen demand and raise revenues for health through increased
copayments, introduced health insurance contributions for pensioners, reduced sick leave rates and other
measures. Preliminary data indicate that these reforms were already having a positive impact on health
finances and access to health services in the first quarter of 2009, as health system arrears were falling
significantly (by 0.3 percent of GDP) and waiting lists have been reduced.
b)      Reform of Social Benefits: The outcomes for social benefit reform were moderately
unsatisfactory. In line with PAL 1 benchmarks and PAL 2 prior actions, the Government prepared and
adopted a strategy with the dual objective of reducing total spending on social benefits as a share of GDP
over the program period (with a specific spending cap of 4 percent of GDP for 2007), while increasing the
share spent on the program best targeted to the poor -- the means-tested social support allowance (SSA).
The overall reduction was expected to come from program consolidation (eliminating overlapping and
duplicating benefits) and containing the growth of poorly-targeted categorical benefits. The Government
managed to keep total social welfare spending below the cap, but between 2004 and 2008 it showed no
clear downward trend, oscillating between 3.8 and 3.9 percent of GDP, in part reflecting the introduction
in 2007 of new categorical benefits aimed at promoting population growth (Table 7). For most of the PAL
program period little was done to increase the relatively well-targeted SSA. As a result, its share in social
assistance spending fell after 2006, as new population-related categorical benefits were added, and as the
number of potential beneficiaries of social support shrank, due to their nominal incomes rising above the
very low HRK 400 per month eligibility threshold (less than 25% of the 2004 nominal poverty line).
However, in early 2008, the SSA benefit and its threshold were raised to HRK 500, though
implementation started only from November 2008 (after the PAL2 Loan had closed). Preliminary data
indicate that this change prevented further erosion of the numbers of SSA beneficiaries (as more people
remained eligible due to the higher threshold), increased their cash benefit by over 25% and partially
reversed the decline in the share of SSA in total social welfare spending. If the economic crisis deepens in
Croatia, this benefit could become increasingly important. Counterparts made it clear that the agreements
in the PAL helped prevent a greater increase in spending on non-targeted programs, and also helped in
obtaining the eventual increase in SSA. The PAL also promoted the introduction of a Personal

  Identification Number intended, among other things, to make possible the better targeting of social
  benefits and avoidance of systems abuse. In addition, MHSW reports consolidating some 17 benefit rights
  into 10, though little has been done to consolidate the dozens of programs run by other ministries.
  c)        Improving Fiscal and Social Sustainability of Pensions: The key pension policy instrument
  supported by the Program ­ the introduction of a more sustainable pension indexing method ­ was
  initially a prior action for PAL 2, but was adopted and implemented before PAL 1 was approved, and the
  end-program spending goal was made slightly more ambitious in PAL2 (11.45 percent of GDP instead of
  "below 12 percent"). Preliminary data indicate that pension spending in 2008 was about 10.8 percent of
  GDP, well below the revised goal, and about 1 percent of GDP below the 2004 pension spending level
  (revised to 11.8 percent of GDP) (See Table 7). This reform thus provided significant support to the
  overall fiscal consolidation objective of the PAL, while improving the sustainability of the pension
  system and providing some fiscal space for a second pillar, by putting spending on the PAYGO pensions
  (as a percent of GDP) on a gradually declining path. However, during the summer of 2007, after the
  Board presentation of PAL 2 and during the run-up to the elections, the Government adopted several
  policy measures that partially offset these gains. These measures included, inter alia, reducing the
  decrement for early retirement, adding a pension supplement for pre-1999 pensions, and raising the
  minimum pension for those with more than 30 years of service. The 2007 policy reversals are estimated to
  shift pension spending upwards by about 0.3 percent of GDP, bringing the total to about 11.1 percent of
  GDP in 2009, after which spending is projected to stabilize at around 11 percent before declining further
  as the impact of the indexation formula continues to reduce spending. This assumes that further policy
  reversals are avoided, an assumption that appears reasonable given the Government's efforts to deal with
  the current economic crisis. The implementation of a recent Constitutional Court decision to equalize the
  retirement age for women and men should provide an additional balancing impact on pension finances.
  The partial reversals were unfortunate not only because they reduced, at least temporarily, the fiscal
  impact of the indexing reform, but they also complicated the process of transition to a second pillar by
  changing the relative benefits of the first and second pillars, and introduced a distortion in the labor
  market by increasing the incentive for early retirement. Nevertheless, outcome for pension sustainability
  is rated moderately satisfactory overall, given that even taking the partial policy reversals into account,
  the outcome goal for this component was exceeded.

  *Total revenue includes operating revenues and subsidies.

  d)       Improving Fiscal Sustainability of Railways: The outcome for improvement in the fiscal
  sustainability of Croatian Railways (HZ) was moderately unsatisfactory overall. During 2005 and 2006,
  HZ made good progress in implementing its medium-term business plan which was agreed as a PAL 1
  prior action, reducing net employment by over 1,000 (out of 14,770) and containing wage increases in
  line with the plan. These measures, along with increases in rail traffic and revenue, reduced its working
  ratio (WR) from 243 percent in 2004 to 190 percent in 2006.30 HZ adopted measures in its 2007 business
  plan to reduce the WR to 170 percent by end-2007, with further reductions in subsequent years. However,
  as the November 2007 elections approached, HZ was not able to adhere to its plan: starting in July 2007,
  HZ and the government agreed to a series of wage increases. HZ also substantially slowed down the pace
  of net staff reductions (from a planned 530 to 339). As a result, the WR rose to 193 percent by end-2007.
  Despite HZ plans to reverse this trend in 2008, the full year impact of the wage increases and a further
  slowdown in net staff reductions (130 vs. a plan of 328), resulted in labor costs 14 percent higher than in
  2007, and a further deterioration of the WR (to 199 percent). Despite these setbacks, some progress has
  been achieved since 2004: HZ staffing has been reduced by nearly 1,600 (10.8 percent), a wage freeze is
  in place for 2009, and fiscal operating subsidies have declined modestly as a percentage of both GDP and
  HZ's total revenue (Table 7). As a result the WR is still substantially below its baseline. In addition,
  although the progress of non-core asset divestiture has been disappointingly slow and inefficient, HZ has
  by the end of the program succeeded in divesting itself of 3 subsidiaries (a PAL2 Second Tranche
  Condition) which should have a positive effect on financial performance in the medium term. HZ has
  projected a decline in the WR (to 188 percent) for 2009, reflecting the wage freeze imposed on HZ this
  year and a sharp reduction in the amount budgeted for HZ operating subsidies. This outcome, however,
  depends on HZ revenue forecasts that seem to be overly optimistic. Moreover, given HZ's high staffing
  levels (more than 60 percent higher than competitive operators of similarly-sized systems) its financial
  performance will remain vulnerable to future wage increases. In the medium-term, as Croatia becomes
  increasingly integrated into the EU, the railway system will face increasing pressures to restructure as it
  faces increased direct competition from other carriers.
  3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
  Rating: Moderately satisfactory for both PAL1 and PAL2.
  Under the PAL-supported Program, Croatia made significant progress towards achieving the Program's
  development objectives and associated outcome goals, despite some setbacks and the inability to
  complete some policy actions, which led to the cancellation of the Second Tranche. In terms of the overall
  Program Development Objectives, Croatia was able to achieve a higher rate of growth while reducing the
  fiscal deficit by about 2 percent of GDP, in line with the program deficit reduction goal. Public spending
  reduction was about 1.3 percent of GDP, well below the Program's ambitious "stretch" goal, but still
  accounted for over half of the decline in the fiscal deficit. In the areas of spending on which the PAL
  focused (notably enterprise subsidies in Pillar 1 and sector programs in Pillar 3), the total spending
  reduction was about 2.5 percentage point of GDP, indicating that reductions and restraint in these areas



  30
    The working ratio [operating costs as a percentage of operating revenues, excluding fiscal subsidies] was the main
  indicator used to track HZ's progress towards financial sustainability.


                                                                 27
helped offset less spending discipline in areas that were not part of the PAL program.31 Doing Business
reports indicate an improved investment climate, a finding consistent with increased shares of private
sector output and investment in GDP, in line with the Program's outcome goals.
Under Pillar 1, the overall goals for SOE privatization and reduction in state enterprise subsidies were
met and slightly exceeded. Procedures for construction permits were streamlined, reducing administrative
barriers for firms. Significant improvements were recorded in the judiciary through simplified procedures
and transfer of non-judicial administrative tasks away from judges, freeing them to focus on contested
cases and contributing to a substantial reduction in the backlog of court cases. At the same time, the
simplified procedures have reduced the barriers to entry by new firms. The indicators of the growing
share of private sector activity in the economy, discussed above, and the growth in net FDI all point to a
reasonably satisfactory investment climate. The one shortfall under this pillar was the government's
inability to privatize one of the five remaining state-owned shipyards, a condition for the release of the
second tranche. The technical and political difficulties associated with this privatization proved to be too
difficult for the government to resolve before the PAL2 Loan closed. As shipyard privatization is also an
issue that must be resolved in the context of Croatia's accession and the EU's competition policy,
negotiations on this are ongoing with the EU with the recent approval of privatization tenders by the EC.
Overall progress under this pillar is rated as satisfactory.
Under Pillar 2, the new Civil Service Law was enacted, establishing the basis for a professional,
depoliticized civil service, consistent with EU practice. The depolitization process began in 2008 and is
about 90 percent complete, with some 200 top-level posts now recruited competitively. A new Law on
Civil Service Salaries (a PAL2 second tranche condition) was drafted and submitted to Parliament, but
not yet passed, and remains a missing piece of the civil service reform agenda. A methodology for
functional reviews of the organizational structure of central ministries was developed and piloted, paving
the way for subsequent reorganization of one ministry and country offices with a potential further
expansion of the process. Methodologies were developed and procedures modified to mandate the
assessments of policies in terms of their fiscal, social, environmental and regulatory impacts. The Fiscal
Impact Assessments appear to have become a valuable tool in budget preparation and implementation.
Internal audit units and financial control capacities have been established in all line ministries and appear
to be developing in a satisfactory way. The coverage of the Treasury Single Account is now virtually
complete, providing up to date information on overall budget balances and flows. Work is also underway
to integrate the different financial management information systems used by the Ministry of Finance and
the line ministries and allow for commitment-based accounting. The overall outcomes for Pillar 2 are
rated moderately satisfactory.
Under Pillar 3, health policies have led to a small decline in spending as a percent of GDP, despite
abolition of a fee intended to reduce demand and net spending and despite continued upward pressures on
cost from an aging population and rising incomes. There has been a 34-percent reduction in the number of
people exempt from copayments. A new set of health reforms was passed in late 2008 and appears to be
having a positive effect on health finances. There was less progress in social benefit reform: while total
spending was kept below the 4 percent of GDP ceiling, new categorical benefits were introduced in 2007.
However, the increase in the Social Support Allowance, while not implemented until November 2008,
now provides a substantially larger benefit to the most vulnerable. In pensions, the early introduction of
the new pension indexing formula (initially a PAL2 prior action), placed pension spending (as a percent
of GDP) on a gradually declining path, and contributed significantly to the PAL fiscal consolidation
objective. The partial reversals in pension policy before the 2007 elections caused a spending increase,
which has cut into those gains temporarily, but over time the indexing formula is expected to return



31
  If the reduction in the public sector wage bill of about 1% of GDP is included, the total rises to about 3.5%, but
this could include some double counting as the lower wages also affected health sector program.


                                                          28
pension spending to a gradually declining path. In railways, HZ prepared, and began implementing, an
ambitious restructuring plan to improve its competitiveness and financial sustainability. After good
progress up to 2007, those gains were partially reversed, as HZ slowed the pace of surplus staff reductions,
and the government agreed to substantial increases in railway wages, causing HZ's financial indicators to
worsen, and partially reversing the gains made in the previous two years. HZ's financial outlook is
unclear, but a wage freeze introduced for 2009 should limit potential deterioration. While Pillar 3 was
affected by a several partial policy reversals, these were not significant enough to offset the overall
impact of the reforms under this pillar, which are rated as moderately satisfactory.
Progress in the above areas also helped Croatia make substantial progress in its EU accession agenda.
3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
There are several aspects of the PAL operation that relate to poverty and social development impacts.
First, the more rapid economic growth over the Program period has led to a decline in Croatia's relative
poverty rate. Additional evidence of this can be seen in the decline in the number of people eligible for
the means tested Social Support Allowance (SSA) and for the income-tested exemptions from health
copayments.
Second, the Program supported an increase in the size of the SSA and in its eligibility threshold, thus
providing increased protection to some of the most vulnerable households in Croatia, whose very low
nominal incomes had begun to exceed the even lower (and unchanged for many years) eligibility
threshold.
Third, the Program supported the development (with UNDP assistance) and introduction of Social Impact
Assessments as one of the key mandatory impact assessments to be required for all proposed laws and
policies submitted to Parliament.
Finally, the PAL team used a range of participatory approaches and stakeholder consultations in
developing the PAL Program in order to assess the potential poverty and social consequences of
privatization and other PAL related reforms. These included (but were not limited to) consultations with
trade unions regarding health and social benefit reforms and a PSIA for shipyard restructuring.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Institutional change is a key part of the PAL Program and has several dimensions. First there are
institutional changes associated with the Public Administration Reform agenda. The new Civil Service
Law, including its depolitization provisions and their recent implementation, is perhaps the most
fundamentally important of these, as it sets the legal framework for a modern, professional service in line
with EU standards. The introduction of mandatory impact assessments of the fiscal, social, environmental,
and regulatory impacts of proposed laws and policies is an institutional innovation that appears likely to
improve the quality and fiscal affordability of proposed policies. The Fiscal Impact Assessment already
appears to be having an impact in raising the quality of budget processes.
Second, in the area of Public Expenditure Management, the establishment of internal audit and financial
control capacities throughout the government is a major institutional change to reduce fiduciary risk.
Another institutional reform, the expansion of the Treasury Single Account, enables much closer
monitoring of trends in major budget aggregates.
Third, the judicial reforms supported by the Program appear not only to be improving the efficiency and
lowering the cost of the judiciary, but also reducing obstacles to firms doing business in Croatia.




                                                    29
Finally, there are a variety of smaller institutional developments that have emerged in the course of
program implementation, ranging from enhanced MoF capacity to monitor enterprise subsidies to
introduction of a Personal Identification Number system (initially to facilitate social benefit reform, but
with much wider public policy applications).
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Significant risk
The Program Documents clearly indicated the substantial political risk faced by a democratically-elected
coalition government in implementing the politically challenging Program. Going forward, the political
risk that future policy reversals will jeopardize the Program's outcomes appears relatively high, as
demonstrated in the past and during PAL Program implementation. However, there are several factors
that mitigate the risk, justifying the less risky "significant" rating.
First, the government has continued to make progress on the PAL agenda following the closure of the
loan, including adoption of new reforms (in health) and continued implementation in other areas (such as
the judicial, public administration, public expenditure management reforms and shipyards' privatization).
Second, as part of the accession process, the EU is monitoring progress in these and other areas, as well as
providing technical and financial support. The EU is continuing to work with the government in difficult
areas such as shipyard privatization, reduction of enterprise subsidies and railway restructuring in the
context of EU competition policy. The political consensus in Croatia in favor of EU membership is likely
to provide a counterbalance to any political pressure to reverse reforms, and could provide an impetus for
further reform. Third, the Bank will continue to engage with the government on these issues, through
project lending (as in the case of judicial reform), through analytic and advisory work (as in the
governance assessment and proposed programmatic public expenditure analysis), and through the
possibility of policy-based lending should conditions justify it. Finally, while the global economic crisis
itself poses moderate to significant risks for the development outcomes, for Croatia, as it seeks to manage
its emerging external borrowing requirements, the crisis has also created strong pressures to reduce public
spending, potentially offsetting political pressures in the other direction.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory
The Bank responded effectively to the government's request to support its far-reaching program to
enhance growth while making progress towards EU accession. The strategic relevance of the approach
was documented in the 2004 CAS and consistent with the Country Assistance Evaluation
recommendations. The Bank and government were able to draw on timely and highly relevant analytic
work (see Box 1) in developing specific program components from a broader agenda. The reforms thus
focused on (i) improving the climate for private sector investment and (ii) reducing the size and
improving the efficiency of the public sector, while assisting Croatia in meeting EU accession criteria.
The program was also designed to complement, and avoid overlap with, activities of the EU, the IMF, and



                                                    30
other development partners. Several counterparts expressed appreciation for the cooperative way in which
the Bank team worked with them to prepare and implement the operation.
Both the government and the Bank clearly recognized that the resulting program was still ambitious, with
a number of politically challenging components. This ambitious approach was clearly understood as such,
and appears to have been justified in this situation. Counterparts confirmed that the agenda was
appropriate to Croatia's objectives, and expressed doubt that a less ambitious program would have
achieved better results.32 On the Bank side, the Regional Operations Committee endorsed the content of
the proposed Program, and advised the PAL team to "...err on the side of ambition, and incorporate
stretch targets into the program."33 Accordingly, the Program Documents clearly highlighted the political
risks to the program, particularly in the period leading up to the 2007 elections.34 The close alignment
between the Program and the EU accession agenda was expected to mitigate the risks somewhat, as were
CAS triggers that would put Croatia into a low case lending scenario if the PAL Program went seriously
off track. The Program Documents also note that the "...outcome targets are stretch goals. They should
not be used rigidly and in isolation to measure the results of the proposed program...."35
The PAL Program policy matrix was noteworthy for its clarity in setting out the objectives, sequencing,
baselines and expected outcomes of Program reform components, and it was widely used among
implementing ministries and agencies to monitor progress. As indicated in Section 2.1, however, it would
have been preferable if the privatization conditions had indicated clearly that government decision on the
winning bid was the step being monitored for fulfillment of these conditions. This lack of clarity did not
cause any adverse outcomes in this case, but it underscores the need for care in designing conditionality in
general and privatization conditionality in particular.
(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Ratings: Satisfactory
In what was a challenging operation, the Bank team maintained a clear focus on development impact and
worked diligently to help the government achieve the Program objectives and resolve problems that
threatened those objectives. Though there have been three Task Team Leaders since PAL preparations
started in 2004, continuity has been maintained since the current TTL has been a team member since the
beginning. The well-designed policy matrix, with clear objectives and outcome indicators helped both the
PAL team and the government to monitor progress and identify responsibilities for next steps.
In addition to regular monitoring and supervision missions, the PAL team helped mobilize and coordinate
technical support for implementation, both from Bank resources (such as the IDF that helped develop the
Fiscal Impact Assessment, the Technical Assistance Loan-2 that supported formulation of the subsidy
reduction program and benchmarking of shipyards, PSIA fund for shipyards and Policy Notes budget for
drafting a railways' restructuring note) and from other development partners (such as the SIDA Trust
Fund that supported public administration reform, EU that helped develop the Environmental Impact
Assessment and the UNDP grant that helped develop the Social Impact Assessment). The team also
participated actively with government in direct stakeholder consultations on a number of politically and
socially sensitive reform areas including shipyard privatization, railway restructuring and health and
social benefit reforms.




32
   As noted in Section 2.1, one of the more ambitious program elements, privatization of a shipyard, was raised from
a PAL2 benchmark to a condition of second tranche release at the government's request.

The Bank showed flexibility in agreeing with the government request during negotiations of PAL2 to
adopt a two-tranche approach to reduce the risks of policy slippage during the pre-election period in 2007,
and to make pragmatic modifications in health and social benefit reform prior actions that kept the focus
on achieving outcome objectives. The focus was on getting the measures that could be implemented
before the election period as PAL2 prior actions, while allowing more time for the other measures
(notably shipyard privatization, HZ privatization and the Civil Service Salary Law) to be put in place after
the elections. This was particularly important as the PAL2 prior actions were critically important for
achieving overall Program outcomes.
The Bank responded quickly to the policy slippages that emerged in the pre-election period after PAL2
had been approved, and worked with the government to assess their impact and reduce the threat they
posed for program objectives. One positive outcome of this process was the increase, albeit delayed, in
the amount of the means-tested social support allowance (SSA).
The Bank demonstrated appropriate flexibility in extending the Program closing date from June 2008 to
October 2008 to allow the government more time to implement the agenda and make progress towards
program outcomes. Some progress had been made toward the tranche release conditions (notably the civil
service job classification system and the privatization of HZ subsidiaries) and the means-tested SSA had
been increased. Additional health reforms were under preparation, an appropriate civil service salary law
had been drafted and was being discussed with social partners, and the government felt it could make
adequate progress on these and other issues by October. However, in September 2008 a supervision
mission reviewed the program and determined that despite some progress it was unlikely that the
conditions for a successful second tranche release would be met in the near future. Consequently, the
PAL2 loan was allowed to close at the end of October 2008 and the undisbursed 50 million second
tranche was cancelled. This decision appears justified. While the government continued to make progress
in some areas after the closing of PAL2 (notably in enacting new health financing reforms, submitting the
civil service salary law to Parliament and receiving the EC approval of privatization tenders for
shipyards), it remains unclear when those and issues in other areas of reform (e.g., getting railway
restructuring back on track) will be resolved.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory36
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory
Government commitment to the PAL-supported reforms was strong initially and was reconfirmed by the
participation of all implementing ministries and agencies in preparation and negotiation of each operation
and by the review and endorsement of each operation by the Council of Ministers. However, as described
in Section 2.2, commitment varied over the course of implementation and across implementing ministries,
particularly for the more politically challenging reforms, and in the run-up to the elections in November
2007. Though the risks this posed to the Program had been anticipated (and, at the government's
suggestion, the loan design modified to reduce them), there were policy slippages (in pensions, social
benefits, railways and health) and unmet conditions (completion of a shipyard privatization and passage
of the civil service salary law).




36
  ICR guidelines require that a Moderately Satisfactory rating for quality of entry combined with a Satisfactory
rating for Supervision results in a Moderately Satisfactory rating for Overall Performance.


                                                         32
Despite these shortcomings, government performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, taking into
account the significant progress it made toward achieving the ambitious goals of the PAL Program. This
rating reflects the fact that the partial policy reversals and unmet conditions, while unfortunate, were not
substantial enough to offset the positive impact of the Program-supported reforms that the government
had adopted.
The rating also reflects that the Program, by design, was ambitious, with politically unpopular
components that posed difficult challenges for a democratically-elected government, particularly in an
election year. It is important to note that the government continued to make progress on the PAL-
supported agenda after closing of the program, in particular by enacting health reforms to further improve
health finances, by submitting the Civil Service Salary Law to Parliament, and by concluding negotiations
with the EU regarding shipyard privatization tenders.
(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory
This rating focuses on the performance of the Ministry of Finance in the design and implementation of
this Program. Since policy decision-making in Croatia is concentrated at the highest political level,
sometimes without the full involvement of the professional staff of the responsible ministry/agency, it is
not possible to separate completely the performance of individual ministries from that of the government.
However, it should be noted that the Ministry of Finance played a central and very positive role in the
design, implementation and coordination of the PAL Program. It implemented the Program components
under its direct authority in a satisfactory manner. Particularly important were the subsidy reduction
program (which made a major contribution to the fiscal consolidation while reducing distortions in the
enterprise sector), the development of internal audit and financial control capacities throughout the
government, and the implementation of Fiscal Impact Assessments, linked to other budget innovations.
While the coordination within the government at times posed difficulties for the ministry, it is not clear
that alternative arrangements would have been more effective given the content of the Program and the
current management organization of the policy-making process in Croatia. The Ministry worked
effectively with the Bank at all stages of the Program, anticipating issues and seeking constructive
solutions.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory, in line with the ratings for Government
performance and Program outcomes.
6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
1.      Reinforcing Ownership. Policy based lending operations should be conducted in ways that
reinforce government ownership and political support for the reform program. The experience with
Croatia's PAL Program demonstrates once again the lesson that smooth and successful program
implementation depends critically on government ownership, including the government's ability to
maintain adequate political support for the program. But the experience also suggests that it is possible to
achieve significant positive outcomes from an ambitious program even when the government is not able
to maintain sufficient support to implement all aspects of the program fully. It is worth considering
several ways in which the PAL program sought to contribute to these positive outcomes by reinforcing
government ownership and containing the political risks.
        Program content: The PAL program was closely aligned both to the government's own program
and to the EU accession agenda, in addition to reflecting the Bank's analytical work. The linkage of the



                                                    33
Program to the goal of EU accession, along with EU and Bank support, was intended to help the
government offset pressures to delay needed reforms.
        Lending operation design: The initial design of the program (and of PAL1) as a series of one-
tranche operations, was modified to make PAL2 a two-tranche operation at the request of the government,
in order to help it resist policy slippages in the 2007 pre-election period and to avoid potential program
delays in the case of a change in government. In addition, the CAS was designed so that significant
slippage in the PAL agenda put Croatia into a lower case lending scenario.
         Program preparation and monitoring: In the course of program preparation and monitoring,
various activities reinforced government capacity to design and implement the reform program, including
a) collaborative work with the government to develop critical aspects of the program (such as the subsidy
reduction program, the civil service salary law, and the fiscal impact assessment), drawing on technical
assistance funds from the EU, SIDA and other donors, as well as from the Bank; and b) joint monitoring
of the program, using the Program matrix, which laid out clearly the sequence of reforms and
responsibilities for next steps, along with objectives and indicators of expected outcomes.
        Participatory approaches: A range of stakeholder consultations were undertaken in different
reform areas (including a PSIA for shipyard restructuring, railways' restructuring and consultation on
social benefit and health reforms) in the course of the PAL Program. These consultations are important in
this context as they have the potential of identifying ways to mitigate adverse social and political impacts
of reforms while still meeting program objectives.37
2.      Program Scope. In some cases it is appropriate and even necessary for a program to support a
broad and difficult reform agenda. The PAL policy agenda was wide-ranging and politically challenging
and not all of its components were achieved. This should not suggest that more could have been achieved
with a narrower agenda, excluding some of the more politically sensitive components. The government's
program, the EU accession agenda and the Bank's own analysis found that these reforms were consistent
with Croatia's development needs at the time. At the same time it was recognized that the full agenda
would be difficult to achieve. While the government was not able to maintain sufficient political support
to achieve the whole program, it was able to do enough to achieve a reasonably positive outcome. If some
elements had been excluded, such as railway restructuring or shipyard privatization, there is no evidence
to indicate that there would have been better outcomes in other Program areas, or in terms of Croatia's
overall development needs. On the contrary, excluding some of these components would have probably
meant that even less would have been achieved in those areas. Looking ahead, however, given the
experience with and the progress made under the PAL Program, and in line with the 2008 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), it may make sense to consider a series of DPLs focused on a narrower agenda,
particularly in areas where the PAL reforms remain incomplete, provided that there is a clear government
commitment to complete these reforms and that effective reform champions can be identified. Depending
on the opportunities that emerge, these areas might include completion of the privatization agenda, further
reforms of sectoral expenditure programs, particularly social benefits, and continuation of the public
administration and public expenditure management reforms, within an appropriate macroeconomic
framework.
3.      Follow-up analysis, dialogue and possible lending. It is important to keep the analytical base
for potential policy based lending updated and relevant to emerging issues. One of the strengths of the
PAL Program was its grounding in relevant analytic work, particularly the 2003 CEM that set forth a


37
  For example, in two areas of stakeholder consultations, social benefit reform and the shipyard restructuring PSIA,
there were indications that those affected by the reforms were not rigidly committed to the status quo and were able
to see the potential advantages of the reform beyond their own short term interests. Since these are two areas of the
program with little progress, obviously such views are not enough to guarantee success, but they suggest that there
may be ways of building on these approaches to reduce political opposition.


                                                         34
reform agenda for growth and EU accession, and the analyses of public expenditures in 2001 and 2007
(see Box 1). In order to prepare the analytic underpinnings and identify the opportunities for the potential
development policy lending indicated above, it is important that the Bank continues updating its analyses
and keeps a current dialogue with the government on the progress on the PAL agenda, as well as other
important areas for reform that may emerge. This has been anticipated in the CPS, which sets out plans
for governance assessment, programmatic public expenditure analysis and public sector reform policy
notes. The CPS also mentions potential lending in the railway sector which would also need updated
analysis to restart a restructuring program to make the railways competitive and reduce their dependence
on government subsidies.
4.      Technical support. In implementing a reform program of this scope, it is important to ensure that
adequate funds are available to provide the government access to highly-skilled technical support as
needed to carry out the policy agenda. As noted previously, technical assistance was critically important
in helping the government augment its capacity, and bring international best practice to implement
substantial parts of the PAL Program (See Section 2.3). The Bank and government helped mobilize such
funding for this from a variety of sources.
5.      Fiscal Impact Assessments. It would be worthwhile to consider introducing this innovation in
other countries with programs to improve public expenditure management. The FIAs, introduced in
conjunction with other PEM reforms, appear to have become very quickly a useful tool for the Ministry of
Finance in budget preparation and management.
