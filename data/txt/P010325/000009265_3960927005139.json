Specific project components include : (i) a canal\n            and a square conduit to bring water from the Indus river,\n            four pumping stations, two direct filtration treatment\n            works, storage reservoirs, and the expansion/rehabilitation\n            of the distribution network; (ii) three new sewage treatment\n            works together with trunk sewers, cleaning of existing\n            sewers and the provision of small bore sewers to low-income\n            areas; and (iii) technical assistance to KWSB to enable it\n            to plan and execute large scale projects, improve operation\n            and maintenance, and improve and extend sanitation in the\n            city and coastal areas. The objectives of the project are\n            to: (a) increase potable water by 100 million gallons per\n            day and further augment water availability strengthening\n            loss reduction measures; (b) improve the financial avail of\n            the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) through\n            increased reven cost reductions, and increased operational\n            efficiency; (c) improve the organization and management of\n            KWSB; and (d) improve sanitation in Kar including its\n            low-income and coastal areas. The project has three mai\n            components: (a) water supply, including transmission works,\n            pumping s direct filtration treatment works, storage\n            reservoirs, distribution ma strengthening of the\n            distribution network; (b) institutional strengthe KWSB; and\n            (c) sanitation, including three sewage treatment works toget\n            associated trunk sewers, repair and cleaning of existing\n            sewers, and small-bore sewers for low income neighborhoods.\n            The project will plac increased emphasis on leak detection\n            and water loss reduction, contain operating costs, enhanced\n            revenue mobilization efforts, and an in-dept examination of\n            possible options for public/private sector participatio\n            provision of water and sanitation services."}, "docdt": "1988-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
