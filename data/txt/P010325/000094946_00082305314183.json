Despite a\n            modest institutional development impact, both performances\n            by the Bank, and Borrower were unsatisfactory. Considering\n            the current quality assurance standards, project preparation\n            was deficient, with appraisal of works based only on\n            preliminary engineering designs, with very narrow remedial\n            action, particularly as it regards the underestimated\n            project cost increase of approximately seventy three\n            percent. Lessons show that the lack of a regulatory\n            framework, hindered the possibilities for the Karachi Water\n            and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to make full use of the support\n            provided by the project in strengthening the institution.\n            There was no regulatory action to give KWSB the autonomy to\n            exercise changes, neither in private sector involvement,\n            tariff adjustments, nor collection enforcement, changes\n            which could have improved service quality, in addition to\n            providing a sustainable management capacity, to offset\n            continued leaks, and prevent inequalities in resource\n            allocation. Furthermore, this lack of autonomy translates\n            into the financial covenants' limitations to assure\n            compliance, thus the usefulness of financial undertakings is\n            questioned, in the absence of governance, and adverse\n            commercial incentives, obstacles which could have ensured\n            the adequacy of water supply."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
