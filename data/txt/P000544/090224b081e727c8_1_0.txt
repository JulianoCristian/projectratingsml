(b) The Borrower undertakes that, except as the Bank shall
otherwise agree, if any lien shall be created on any assets of the

and eight per cent (8%) in each of fiscal years 1978 through 1980.
(b) For the purposes of this Section and of Section 5.05:

fiscal year next preceding such incurrence or for a later twelve-
month period ended prior to such incurrence, whichever amount is
greater, shall be not less than 1.25 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt, including
the debt to be incurred. For the purposes of this Section:
(a) The term "debt" shall mean all indebtedness of the Bor-
rower, maturing by its terms more than one year after the date on

prevailing lawful rate of exchange at which such foreign currency
is, at the time such valuation is made, obtainable by the Borrower
for the purposes of servicing such debt or, if such foreign currency
is not so obtainable, at the rate of exchange that will be reason-
ably determined by the Bank.
Section 5.07. The Borrower shall not, without the prior con-
sent of the Bank, modify its Investment Plan for 1974-1978, except

Section 5.08. (a) The Borrower shall not later than December 31,
1978 (or such other date as may be agreed with the Bank) establish

forth in the table in paragraph I above, if the Bank has reasonably
estimated that the amount of the Loan then allocated to any Cate-
gory will be insufficient to finance Ull expenditures in that Cat-
egory, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, reallocate to such
Category to the extent required to meet such estimated shortfall
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures.

ment of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures for
such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and the
Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting any other right,
power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by notice to
the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as  i the Bank's rea-
sonable opinion, represents the amount of such :<ienditures which
would otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds
of the Loan.

Procurement
A.   General Procedures
1.   Except as provided in paragraphs A.2 and A.3 hereunder, con-
tracts for carrying out Part A.1 and Part D.8 financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan shall be let under procedures consistent with
those set forth in Part A of the "Guidelines for Procurement under
World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in August
1975 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding.
2.   The Borrower may award building contracts for carrying out
Part A.1 of the Project on the basis of competitive bidding adver-
tised locally and in accordance with local procedures acceptable
to the Bank.
3.   The Borrower may procure railcar bogies and radio equipment
for Part E of the Project through negotiated purchases which shall
have been approved by the Bank.
B.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods, Preference for
Domestic Manufacturers
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the


﻿-35 -
ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and
similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and
(iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other expendi-
tures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of their use
or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in the People's Republic of the Congo may
be granted a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject
to, the following provisions:
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the infor-
mation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be fol-
loved in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in the
People's Republic of the Congo if the bidder shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower
and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of such
goods includes a value added in the People's
Republic of the Congo equal to at least 20% of
the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manufactured
in the People's Republic of the Congo.


﻿- 36-
(3) Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evaluated
bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared
with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from
group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected for the
award.
(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids shall
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A
after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered
in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further comparison
only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties and other
import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the
importation of the goods offered in such group C bid; or (ii) 15%
of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and
taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in such further
comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if
not, the bid from group C which as a result of the comparison under
paragraph (c) is the lowest evaluated bid shall be selected.
C.   Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.   Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts.


﻿- 37 -
With respect to all contracts for Part A.1 and Part D.8 esti-
mated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more:
(a) Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank, for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and
the specifications and other bidding documents, together with a
description of the advertising procedures to be followed for the
bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said documents
or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's con-
currence before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower
shall, before a final decision on the award is made, inform the
Bank of the name of the bidder to which it intends to award the
contract and the reasons for the intended award and shall furnish
to the Bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report
on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together
with the recommendation for award and such other information as the
Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines
that the intended award would be inconsistent with the Guidelines
or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and state the reasons
for such determination.
(c) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, with-
out the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those on which
bids were asked or prequalification invited.
(d) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the submission


﻿- 38 -
to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from
the Loan Account in respect of such contract.
2.   With respect to each contract to be financed out of the pro-
ceeds of the Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, promptly after its execution
and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first application
for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such
contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together with the
analysis of bids, recommendations for award and such other informa-
tion as the Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it
determines that the award of the contract was not consistent with
the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and
state the reasons for such determination.
