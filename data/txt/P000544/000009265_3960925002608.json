The objective of the project was to\n            safeguard the continuing functioning of the existing ATC\n            (Agence Transcongolaise des Communications) system by\n            improving its operations and providing increased capacity.\n            Implementation of the project ran into numerous and serious\n            difficulties. Shortly after the contractor had mobilized, an\n            armed commando group attacked the site camp in January 1977,\n            kidnapped the contractor's local manager and two other\n            staff, killed a number of workers, took hostages, and\n            destroyed most of the construction equipment. Cost of the\n            renegotiated contract jumped substantially, and considerable\n            time was lost before the contractor resumed work. The\n            important lessons to be learned from the Second Railway\n            Project are: (a) only experienced owners should be placed in\n            charge of a major civil engineering job involving high risk\n            work; (b) feasibility studies, design, and supervision\n            should be entrusted to experienced consultants who are also\n            given the full responsibility for the day-to-day direction\n            of the work; (c) final design should be based on thorough\n            topographic and geological studies and soils\n            investigations;( d) if co-financing is involved, funds\n            should be pooled and tied procurement should be avoided, and\n            the role of the agency (in this case, the Bank) responsible\n            for overall donor coordination should be clearly defined and\n            agreed upon by all co-donors; and (e) on any project\n            involving major and complex civil engineering works in which\n            many co-donors are participating, the Bank should insist on\n            the appointment of a project coordinator, and if the Bank is\n            selected, it should place a senior technical representative\n            on site for the duration of the works. The conclusion drawn\n            from this project is as follows: The detailed engineering of\n            the realignment was not soundly based. As a result, the cost\n            estimates were far too low, contingencies were inadequate,\n            and the time allowed to execute the work was badly underestimated."}, "docdt": "1989-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
