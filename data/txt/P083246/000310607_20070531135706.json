Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) for Ghana had the same\n            following ratings: the outcome was satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned were: 1. There was a clear impact on Government\n            ownership of the reform program; 2. The increased\n            harmonization among the development partners (DPs) under the\n            Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) framework contributed\n            to the successful implementation of PRSC 1-3 and thus had\n            high returns; 3. The PRSCs also -- by enabling Government\n            ownership of the reform program and by not relying on\n            prescriptive means to reach the outcomes agreed to by the\n            DPs and the government -- gave the Government greater\n            flexibility and opportunity to experiment with different\n            approaches; and 4. As a way to induce reform, the MDBS\n            framework has an important advantage over a\n            conditionality-based mechanism."}, "docdt": "2007-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
