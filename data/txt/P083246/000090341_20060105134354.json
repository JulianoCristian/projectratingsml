Lessons learned from the\n            project: The two main lessons learned in the implementation\n            of the first two operations (PRSC-1 and PRSC-2) are the\n            importance of ownership of the reform program for the\n            satisfactory implementation of the country's poverty\n            reduction strategy, and the very high returns from the\n            harmonization among development partners around the MDBS\n            framework. The approach of ensuring government ownership of\n            the program, and assuring continuous involvement and support\n            from development partners, appears to be yielding positive results."}, "docdt": "2005-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
