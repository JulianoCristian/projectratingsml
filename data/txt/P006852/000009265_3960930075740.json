The project\n            supports the MDP through the following components:  (a) a\n            line of credit administered by FINDETER to finance about 300\n            subprojects to improve urban infrastructure and strengthen\n            beneficiary local governments; (b) a program to strengthen\n            FINDETER and develop its lending pipeline; (c) the\n            development of sector training agencies and the delivery of\n            a training program to sector staff; and (d) a program to\n            update cadasters nationwide."}, "docdt": "1991-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
