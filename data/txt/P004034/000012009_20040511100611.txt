   OED Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The Operations Evaluation Department assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
 purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is
 producing    the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
 Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger evaluation
studies.
      A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for      onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral   approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED           website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.          h t m l ) .
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and           sectoral  assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible      ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to             b e achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible        ratings:  High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible          ratings:  High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability= The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnsfitufional   Development Impact: The extent to which a project improves `the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible   ratings:   High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,    Unsatisfactory,  Highly   Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance; The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported    implementation   through   appropriate  supervision (including  ensuring  adequate   transition  arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,   Highly   Unsatisfactory.

Preface

           This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Cambodia
Disease Control and Health Development Project (Cr. NOOS-KH), which was approved
on December 24, 1996 and became effective on June 23, 1997. It provided financing for
expansion of Cambodia's health infrastructure and support for national disease control
programs for tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and HIV/AIDS. The $35.6 million project was
supported by an Interim Trust Fund (ITF) credit of SDR 20.6 million (US$30.4                                   million
equivalent in 1996). The credit was closed on December 31,2002, following a g-month
extension of the original closing date. It was 98.7 percent disbursed, with the final
disbursements taking place on May 9,2003.*                       The Disease Control and Health
Development Project (DCHDP) was the first Bank-supported health project and the first
decentralized operation of the Bank in any sector in Cambodia.

           The PPAR findings are based on: a review of the project's files and the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR); review of published and unpublished
literature or evaluations on health and infectious disease in Cambodia; interviews with
current and previous task managers, project staff and technical advisers, central and
provincial government officials in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the national disease
programs, the Social Fund of the Kingdom of Cambodia (SFKC), nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs),            and other donors; field visits to Phnom Penh and three provinces;
and analysis of available data on program expenditure and epidemiological outcomes. An
OED evaluation mission visited Cambodia`.in May 2003. The mission interviewed
Provincial Health Directors, AIDS, TB, and malaria staff in Kampot and Sihanoukville
provinces and visited six health centers, four of which were built or renovated by the
project, in Kampot and Kampong Speu provinces. OED expresses its appreciation to all
of those who made time for interviews and provided information.

           This is the fifthof a series of PPARs that will be undertaken on the "first
generation" of completed Bank-financed HIV/AIDS projects, as background for a larger
OED evaluation of the development effectiveness of the World Bank's AIDS assistance.*
In light of that purpose, relatively more material has been presented in this "enhanced"
PPAR than is the OED standard. In addition, the dataset on NGO grants supported by the
project will be posted on the OED AIDS evaluation website
(www.worldbank.org/oed./aids).

           Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR was sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. Comments have been
taken into account in the text and are included as Annex G. Following transmittal to the
World Bank's Executive Board, this will be considered aIpublic document.

1. The disbursement rate is based on the SDR value. Because of changes in the dollar-SDR exchange rate, the US
dollar value of the disbursed credit was $26.8 million at the close of the project.

2. The other projects assessed to date include the Kenya Sexually Transmitted Infections Project, the Zimbabwe
Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention and Care Project, the first    India'National AIDS Control Project, and the
first and second Brazil AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Projects.

 Summary

          The Disease Control and Health Development Project (DCHDP) was the first World
 Bank health operation in Cambodia and the first donor-funded project to substantially invest in
 the capacity of the Ministry of Health to implement public health programs. It was also the first
 decentralized World Bank project in any sector in Cambodia. As the project was being prepared
 in the mid-1990s, Cambodia was emerging from more than two decades of conflict that destroyed
 the country's infrastructure and severely depleted its human resources. Health conditions were
 among the lowest in Southeast Asia. The public health system was extremely weak and NGOs,
 financed by donors, were an important source of medical care.

          The project adopted a two-pronged strategy of strengthening government health
infrastructure and decentralizing health management in 11 provinces, while financing
complementary disease control programs for malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS nationally. Among the
project's key achievements: the piloting of Health Management Agreements as a basis for
decentralized management and implementation of health services, a model that has been extended
nationwide; substantial expansion of health infrastructure and improvement in drug availability in
the 11 project provinces; investments in capacity building that enabled the Ministry of Health to
launch, coordinate, and lead a national response to HIV/AIDS; capacity building of national
NGOs for action on HIV/AIDS; extension of ambulatory DOTS for TB treatment to rural health
centers; and experimentation with social marketing of insecticide-impregnated hammock nets.

          The project design was complex; it suffered in the early years from inadequate training of
Cambodian implementers in procurement and financial management and an inability to get                  .

resources to the provinces. However, flexibility and learning on the part of the Bank and the
Government helped to ident@ and mitigate the constraints, contracting complex civil works and
NGO sub-components. The project was fully implemented and the credit nearly entirely
disbursed with only a g-month extension of the completion date.

         The DCHDP sponsored many monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities within each of
the national programs. The project's M&E design, supported by strong government commitment
to evidence-based decisions in public health, encouraged use of results to improve
implementation and outcomes. Over the project period: there was a marked increase in condom
use in commercial sex, a reduction in use of commercial sex, and decline in HIV prevalence in
high-risk groups; the number of treated TB cases jumped as ambulatory DOTS was extended to
health centers, indicative of an increase in the case detection rate; and reported malaria mortality
dropped substantially. These achievements cannot solely be attributed to the project's impact on
the implementation capacity of the MOH, given the enormous parallel investments by other
donors in health during the same period. However, unlike most other donor programs, the '
DCHDP financed the basic functioning of the MOH in most of these activities, enhancing the
leadership in setting national health strategy and enabling government workers to implement that
strategy, including initiatives supported by other donors through technical assistance or parallel
investments.

         The project also included national baseline and end-point household health surveys,
conducted in coordination with the parallel ADB-financed Basic Health Services Project.
Unfortunately, the baseline did not capture important indicators for tracking progress on HIV and
malaria behaviors; the end-survey used a sampling frame based on communities with better
access to health care and a questionnaire with reference periods and reporting conventions for
morbidity and use of health care that were not comparable with the baseline questionnaire. As a
result, the two surveys combined could not accurately monitor trends in morbidity and access to

                                                    X


health care and the end-survey is inadequate as a baseline for the follow-on Health Services
Support Project (HSSP).

         OED rates the project's outcome and the performance of the Bank      and borrower as
satisfactory. Institutional development impact is rated high. Sustainability is rated as likely, based
on evidence of increased implementation capacity founded in stronger institutions, greater financial
commitment to health by the Government, and follow-on multi-donor projects and finance to
implement the national health strategy. However, the 8-month gap between the closing of the
DCHDP and effectiveness of the follow-on Health Sector Support Project (HSSP) and lack of a
detailed implementation plan prior to HSSP effectiveness detract from sustainability of the benefits
of DCHDP.

         The DCHDP produced lessons for Cambodia and the Bank that may be relevant to other
countries with similar initial conditions:

    l    Health Management Agreements are a promising framework           for decentralized

         assured.

         In addition, a number of lessons lend insight to OED's evaluation of the Bank's
HIV/AIDS assistance:

         Investment in institutional development can have a dramatic impact on the ability of the
         Government to define and lead the national AIDS agenda.

         Promoting government commitment to fight HIV/AIDS and embrace a public health
         approach    requires  continuing efforts.

         Cambodia's HIV/AIDS strategy focuses scarce capacity on preventing transmission
         among high-risk groups, where programs can make the biggest difference.

         A strong HIV/AIDS program in the MOH provides the foundation on which multi-
         sectoral efforts can be built.

         Building capacity of NGOs is a prerequisite to their mobilization but doesn't assure that
         they will undertake cost-effective activities or complement government action.

         Tracking HIV prevalence and behavior is necessary but not sufficient for monitoring
         outcomes in a mature epidemic and must be linked with inputs and outputs to establish
         plausible causality.

 1 0        Introduction and Background

 1 1        At the time that the Disease Control and Health Development Project
 (DCHDP) was being prepared (1994-96),                        Cambodia was emerging from more than
two decades of conflict that destroyed the country's physical infrastructure and
 decimated its human resources. During the brutal rule of the Khmer Rouge regime
 (197578), an estimated 3 million Cambodians died as urban dwellers were forced to
work in the countryside (NIS et al. 2001); health facilities, schools, equipment, and
textbooks were destroyed; and an estimated 75-80 percent of all teachers and
 secondary school students either fled or were murdered (World Bank 1999). Even
after the Khmer Rouge was defeated in 1979 and fled to the countryside, internal
insurgency continued in the west and northwest border areas while the country tried
to rebuild. As of the early 199Os,               Cambodia's health and education infrastructure was
physically destroyed from years of conflict or, if still standing, non-functional due to
neglect and the dearth of trained professionals. An estimated 4-6 million unexploded
landmines littered the countryside, hampering reconstruction and economic recovery
(World Bank 1999a).

 12         Despite efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s to rebuild, the health conditions
of Cambodia's roughly 11 million people were among the lowest in Southeast Asia.
Life expectancy was under 50 years (World Bank 1994) and infant mortality was
estimated at 115 per 1,000 live births, compared with the regional average of 42 per
 1,000 (World Bank 1996). Morbidity and mortality from preventable communicable
diseases were among the highest in the world. More than half of the population was
infected with the tuberculosis bacillus, a leading killer of young adults, with an
estimated 35,000-40,000               active cases. Malaria transmission was concentrated in the
forested and mountainous areas covering two-thirds of the country's land area, home
to a estimated 17 percent of the population with the least access to health services
and the destination for a transient population of forest workers highly vulnerable to
the disease. The first case of HIV in Cambodia was detected in 1991 through blood
screening and the first AIDS case was reported in 1993 (see Figure l), but the
epidemic had already taken off years earlier, fueled primarily by commercial sex.
Between 1992 and 1996, HIV prevalence3 among brothel-based sex workers rose
from 9 percent to 41 percent; by 1996, more than 5 percent of police and the military
and 1.7 percent of women attending antenatal clinics were infected (NCHADS
undated).4      Recent models suggest that in 1995 nearly 145,000 Cambodians were
living with HIV/AIDS and more than 3,000 had died since. the beginning of the
epidemic (Cambodia Working Group 2002).

4. From March 1992September          1993 roughly 20,000 UN peacekeeping forces from nearly 100 countries were
temporarily stationed in Cambodia as part of the United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTAC), in advance of
elections. In addition, from March 1992 to March 1993 the United Nations High Commission on Refugees
assisted in repatriation and resettlement of 365,000 refugees and displaced persons, reaching a peak of 40,000
persons per month in early 1993. Both of these factors are potentially important contributors to the rapid increase
in HIV in Cambodia in the early      1990s. See Annex F for a    timeline of key events in Cambodia's response to
AIDS.

 .       Total government health spending in 1993 was about JS$7 million, less than
$1 per capita (World Bank 1994). The public health care system in the early 1990s -
to the extent that it was functional - was heavily biased in favor of Phnom Penh and
provincial capitals, with very few personnel or functioning facilities in the
countryside. Services suffered from lack of equipment, drugs, and trained staff, and
low staff salaries that gave rise to widespread informal user fees. Much decision-
making on health priorities and resource allocation was decentralized to the
provinces, leaving weak capacity at the central Ministry of Health (MOH)              and large
variation in spending priorities and quality of care across provinces (Word Bank
1994). International donors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)                 were directly
funding activities and health facilities at the local level, relying heavily on expatriate
management. While some of these initiatives were promising, the donors generally
bypassed the Government in terms of implementation, resulting in an "uncoordinated
patchwork" of activities (World Bank 1994).

14      Yet, Cambodia was firmly on the road to reconstruction and relatively greater
political stability. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords led to United Nations-sponsored
elections in 1993 and the formation of a national government. With the support of
WHO and UNICEF, the MOH published the "National Health Development Plan
1994-1996," which called for strengthening primary health care to meet the needs of
communities. At the periphery, the plan proposed, creation of "operational districts"
(ODs), comprising a network of health centers (HCs)             and district referral hospitals
(RI%). Health centers serve a catchment area of 8,000-12,000            people with a
"minimum package" of basic public health and curative services (MPA),               and are
supported by district referral hospitals with a "complementary package" of public
health and clinical services (CPA). The operational districts were to be supported by

                                                            3

                                                                                                        c-    __
Provincial Health Directorates (PHD), provincial hospitals for referrals, and other
provincial health programs. The PHD was to provide the key link between the ODs
and the central MOH, which was responsible for coordination, policy-setting, and
running the national institutes, disease programs, and hospitals.

 15        The plan also called for strengthening national disease programs for malaria,
TB, and HIV/AIDS - previously run as vertical programs with separate management
structures at the central and provincial levels - and integrating them into the general
health system at the provincial and district levels.


l     The National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP), established in 1980, is
      managed by the National Anti-Tuberculosis Center (CENAT). Until 1993 the
      NTP endorsed a hospital-based treatment strategy of extended inpatient treatment.
      In 1994, this was replaced with hospital-based Directly Observed Therapy, short-
      course (DOTS), which involved a 2-month in-patient stay followed by 6 months
      of drug therapy on an ambulatory basis. By late 1995, more than half of public
      hospitals were equipped and trained to provide' DOTS (World Bank 1996).

l     The National Malaria Program (NMP), also established in 1980, is managed by
      the National Malaria Center (CNM). At the time that the DCHDP was
      underpreparation, the NMP strategy was to improve access to accurate diagnosis
      and prompt treatment of malaria, expand use of insecticide-impregnated bednets,
      and improve community knowledge of prevention, recognition, and treatment.

      Cambodia's National AIDS Ofice (NAO) was established in 1993 in the MOH.
      WHO's Global Program on AIDS (GPA) collaborated with the NAO to
      implement an "outreach" program to sex workers in urban centers,' launched in
      all provinces in 1995 and HIV epidemiological surveillance in high-risk groups
      was supported by technical assistance from the U.S.' Agency for International
      Development (USAID).            In parallel, USAID        and the U.K. Department for
      International Development (DFID) funded Population Services International (PSI)
      in launching a social marketing program of "Number One" brand condoms for
      disease prevention in late 1994. Aside from GPA, there was very little funding
      available for the government HIV/AIDS program, and when GPA was
      discontinued in 1995, little more was forthcoming.6 The bulk of HIV/AIDS
      activities were being undertaken by donors and international NGOs,                        which were
      keeping the NAO informed. There was little capacity or finance for a
      government-led program.




5. The objective of the program, designed and initially financed by WHO, was to reduce HIV transmission by
raising condom use among primarily brothel-based commercial sex workers     (CSVV) through education about
HIV/AIDS and STDs, training on the importance of condom use and negotiating skills with clients. The program
covered Phnom Penh and the provinces and used provincial outreach    workers who recruited and trained 2-3 peer
educators per province (NCHADS      and Oppenheimer 1998).

6. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) reports that commitments from the then newly formed Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for 1996 and 1997 amounted to only $150,000 annually.

    2 0      Project Design and Objectives

    21       The Cambodia Disease Control and Health Development Project ($35.6
   million) was approved by the World Bank in December 1996, fLnded by a SDR 20.4
   million (US$30.4        million equivalent) credit and a planned government contribution of
   US$5.2     million. It was the first free-standing health project in Cambodia financed by
   the World Bank and became effective in June 1997.

   22        The objective of the DCHDP was to support the Government of Cambodia in
   pursuit of two of its principal health sector objectives: (i) to reduce death and illness
   from preventable diseases, especially malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS; and
   (ii) to rehabilitate the health system infrastructure so as to deliver basic health
   services and disease control programs more effectively down to the community level.
   The project had two main components:

   23        Component 1: Support for three national communicable disease programs to
   cbntrol malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS (US$13.0                   million equivalent base cost),
   including provision of drugs and laboratory supplies, impregnated bednets,                         training,
   logistical support, and technical assistance, in order to expand and increase the impact
   of these programs.

   24        The AIDS subcomponent ($6.5 million) supported eight main activities:
   institutional development of the National AIDS Office (which was to be funded and
   elevated to the level of a department as a condition of the credit); information,
   education and communication (IEC) to the general population on HIV transmission
   and prevention; civil works, training, and reagents for the blood transfusion service;
   outreach to sex workers using peer educators; condom promotion in the outreach
   program and in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics; introduction of syndromic
   management of STD7 and construction of STD referral clinics; monitoring, research,
   and evaluation (including annual HIV sur-veillance and program evaluation); and a
   small grants program for NGOs. The broad goal was to reduce transmission of HIV;
   there were no specific outcome targets.

   25        The TB subcomponent ($3 million) had the dual objectives of: (a) improving .
   the quality and accessibility of TB services in health centers and referral hospitals,
   including case diagnosis and management; and (b) strengthening the institutional
   capacity of CENAT through improved management, training, and research. The three
   main activities were: disease management, involving finance of diagnostic
   equipment, reagents, and supplies; program management, with staff training,
   technical assistance, upgrading of offices, office equipment, and vehicles for
   supervision at the provincial level; and evaluation and research, including a national
   TB prevalence survey, annual surveys of drug resistance and HIV infection among
   TB patients, and tuberculin skin test surveys every five years. Three key project                         _
targets    were:



   7. An approach by which clinicians diagnose and treat STDs based on standardized protocols based on presenting
   symptoms. The project collaborated with  VVHQ which was promoting this approach.

        l    A cure rate for pulmonary smear-positive cases8 of more than 85 percent

        l    An increase in the case detection rate to 70 percent by 20009

        l    A relapse rate of less than 5 percent

  2 6        ?`he objective of the malaria subcomponent ($3.5 million) was to support the
  &M to implement the national malaria program, the objective of which is to reduce
  malaria transmission and case morbidity and mortality through treatment and
  community-based prevention. Four strategies were pursued: improve access to
  diagnosis and treatment; expand community use of impregnated mosquito nets in
  high- and medium-risk areas; pilot testing of social marketing of impregnated
  mosquito nets;       and increasing the capacity of the            CNM       to manage, supervise, and
  monitor the program, including evaluation and research. The only specific project
  target was 80 percent coverage of bednets                 in 347 highly endemic communes. Surveys
  of bednet coverage of high-risk groups and areas of the country were to be conducted
  at the first and final years.

  2 7       Component 2: Strengthening of the basic health infrastructure (USS 18.1
  million equivalent base cost) to ensure the effectiveness of the disease control
  programs by restoring acceptable standards for facilities, equipment, and drug supply
  of the health system, particularly at the provincial level and below. The five activities
  financed were: (i) construction and rehabilitation of health centers and referral
  hospitals; (ii) medical equipment, furniture, and transportation;                      (iii) essential drugs
  (including TB, STD, and malaria drugs); (iv) in-service training; and (v)
 strengthening of the A4OH, including a nationwide baseline health survey, technical
  assistance, a provincial supervision fund, and Health Management Agreements                                  .
  (HMAs)      between the MOH and the provinces as the basis for decentralized
  implementation.

 28         This component included $10.8 million for construction or rehabilitation of 26
 referral hospitals and 230 health centers. In light of the shortage of MOH staff,
 equipment, supplies, and management, the project selected 10 priority provinces'* for
 implementation in two phases over five years. The provinces were selected based on
 disease patterns, management capacity, accessibility, population size, and the
 presence or absence of other donor activity. The Asian Development Bank's (ADB)
 Basic Health Services (BHS) Project intended to strengthen health infrastructure in
 five additional provinces. Together, the Bank and ADB projects covered basic health
 services for provinces that accounted for 80 percent of Cambodia's population.



 8. Most TB control programs, including Cambodia's, focus on detection and treatment of pulmonary       smear-
 positive TB cases because these are the most infectious to others and where the benefits of treatment occur in
 terms of preventing the spread of TB in the population. Other cases include pulmonary smear-negative cases and
' extra-pulmonary TEL   The program does not discriminate among smear-positive and smear-negative cases for
 treatment.

 9. This goal was postponed in the 2001-2005 National   Tl3 Strategy to the year 2005.

 10. The selected provinces included: Battambang, KampotKep,       Kandal, Kampong    SPW    Kampong Thorn, Kratie,
 Phnom,Penh,     Pursat, Rattanakiri, Siem Reap.

                                                         6


29.        There were several key policy-related agreements made in the course of
negotiations: (a) the NAO was to be elevated to the level of a department in the
MOH, similar in status to the TB and malaria programs and with an administrative
and financial officer; (b) an evaluation of the HIV/AIDS outreach program was to be
prepared following two years of implementation; (c) an HIV/AIDS Project Grant
Committee was to be formed; (d) provinces had to enter into an HMA with the MOH
as a condition of approval of expenditures on civil works and medical equipment; (e)
technical performance audits of the implementation of the HMAs were to be
randomly conducted annually; (f) a social marketing strategy for bednet distribution
and treatment was to be developed and reviewed by IDA; (g) health centers and
referral hospitals for upgrading were to be identified; and (h) a national policy on user
fees for health services, including policies on retention of fees, setting and adjusting
the fees, and allowable expenditures of fee revenues, was to be developed. An
agreement was also reached that a final evaluation survey would be conducted.
Finally, the Government (with donor funding) agreed to finance the cost of food
supplementation for TB patient hospitalization and, resources permitting, for
ambulatory chemotherapy.

2.10      Aside from the parallel ADB Basic Health Services project, several other
donors had a high profile in support of the national disease control programs: the
European Union (malaria and STD); JICA (TB); USAID (HIV/AIDS); and WHO
(malaria and TB)." Many of these donors had their own technical consultants to the
programs. What largely differentiated the Bank's support from that of other donors
was the Bank's direct financing of government implementation, in addition to
complementary inputs like drugs, bednets,                and technical assistance.



3         Implementation

31        The project became effective on June 23, 1997. Implementation was managed
by a central Project Coordination Unit (PCU)                in the MOH, which also served the
ADB Basic Health Services (BHS) project, and by 11 Provincial Project Units (PPU).
Implementation was considerably slower than envisioned due to a number of factors:

l    Weak procurement and financial management skills and lack of familiarity with
     World Bank procedures in the PCU, the Ministry of Economy and Finance
     (MEF), and the provinces. To expedite delivery of goods and with an eye toward
     possible technical assistance in management and procurement, UNICEF was used
     as the procurement agent for $2 million of essential drugs and $1.3 million in
     laboratory equipment. However, the UNICEF procurement proved extraordinarily




11. The International Committee of the Red Cross, French Cooperation, and Pasteur Instituted assisted in the
design of the blood bank sub-component.

                                                          7


      slow - a one-year delay for delivery of essential drugs and over two years' delay
      for price quotations for the equipment.12


l     Micro-management by the MEF of project expenses and delayed counterpart
      funding. The MEF had a much lower threshold for prior review of expenditures
      than did the Bank, leading to scrutiny of many small expenditures.13

l     Inability to channel funds to the provinces. Within the first year, go-day advance
      accounts were set up for the three national disease programs and for each of the
      project provinces. However, because there were no banks in the provinces, these
      accounts were all in Phnom Penh. Officials had to travel with their cash budgets
      back and forth from the capital.

l     Lack of MOH experience to implement the civil works and NGO small grants
      programs. Both involved many small transactions, which took up a huge amount
      of staff time. During the first year of operation, only 3 grants were made to NGOs
      following the procedures in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).


l     A coup d'etat in July 1997 and, in 1998, elections and an epidemic of dengue
      fever that preoccupied the CNM.

32          With this early experience, the Bank and Government decided to simplify
project management by sub-contracting two key sub-components. In. May 1998
implementation of civil works was contracted to the Social Fund of the Kingdom of
Cambodia (SFKC) in a Project Cooperation Agreement between MEF, MOH, and
SFKC.14     The SFKC is an autonomous state entity that had substantial national
experience in constructing civil works (including 78 health centers and one referral
hospital) as part of the first Social Fund Project (Credit 2739~KH),                      which was coming
to a close. The agreement allocated $6,427,000                   for the DCHDP civil works and an
additional $499,877 for consultant services, salaries, fees, and operating costs. A
special account was created and project funds could be withdrawn directly by SFKC
from the special account, without going through MEF?

33          The second sub-component to be contracted was the small grants for
HIV/AIDS prevention. The Khmer HIV/AIDS Alliance (Khana),                              an affiliate of the
International HIV/AIDS Alliance, was awarded two contracts in August 1999 - one
for the NGO grants ($550,000) and one for capacity building and supervision in
support of the NGO grant component ($97,000).


12.    These delays were attributed by informants to problems  at,the  UNICEF/Copenhagen headquarters during a
period of reorganization, and a lack of communication and responsiveness to the   UNICEF/Phnom     Penh office.
The PCU eventually executed 70 percent of the equipment procurement.

13. These interventions by MEF were contrary to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
establish.ed between MEF and MOH in early 1997 that would reduce red tape and allow MOH to take the lead in
decision-making with respect to implementation.

14. According to informants, several other NGOs in Cambodia also bid for the civil   works contract. The use of
SFKC for civil works had been floated as a possibility during project preparation.

15. The credit agreement was revised in June 1998. First disbursements to SFKC were in December 1998.

34 .             The PCU was unsuccessful at contracting ~0 major tasks as planned - the                           ,
social marketing of insecticide-impregnated hammock nets and the information,
education, and communication (IEC) activities for HIV/AIDS. A cooperative
agreement with the PCU allowed WHO and CNM to integrate the social marketing
activity into WHO's ongoing Malaria Control Project (CAM/CTD/OlO),                                       which had
been active since 1992. A total of $335,800 was made available to WHO and CNM
for the malaria IEC and social marketing tasks, while the PCU remained in control of
international procurement of commodities and consultants. The government AIDS
program directly implemented IEC activities, but on a reduced scale. -

35               These measures helped to speed up disbursements, particularly of the civil
works component, by early 1999 (see Figure 2)? HMAs had also been concluded in
all 11 project provinces. However, the problems of lack of experience with
procurement and financial management, slow counterpart funding, and inability to

channel resources to the provinces remained. A June 1999 supervision mission
recommended on a pilot basis that funds for provincial and district-based activities of
the national disease programs be channeled directly from the PCU to the provincial
health departments in the 11 project provinces (rather than through the national
programs) to accelerate decentralization of the malaria, TB, and AIDS activities. The
mission was also successful in getting the MEF to agree to cut the red tape and allow                                       .
the MOH to take the lead in project implementation as foreseen in the MOU.

16. The SFKC, in contrast, was not subject to prior review    by the MEF - only by the Bank-expediting
disbursements.

          3 6     By the mid-term review (MTR) in December 1999, only 29 percent of the
          ciedit had been disbursed. Yet there were signs that implementation was improving.
          The SFKC had launched construction or renovation of 54 health centers, one referral
          hospital, five ODs, and the national AIDS office. Concerns about the quality of the
          work and the lack of supervision by the PCU led to creation of a unit within the
          SFKC for the health project and hiring of one new engineer per province for
          supervision. User fees were being collected at health facilities with exemptions
          defined by village health committees; half of revenues were allocated to recurrent
          costs, 49 percent as salary supplements (boosting the morale of poorly paid health
          workers), and 1 percent to the MEF, All vehicle procurement had been completed. A
          National Health Survey (NHS) of women of reproductive age had been conducted in
          1998 by the ADB and GTZ to serve as a baseline for both the DCHDP and the BHS
          projects. The AIDS component had finally taken hold with the reorganization and
          elevation of the National AIDS `Program to the National Center for HIV/AIDS,
          Dermatology and STD (NCHADS) in early 1998, a new director, the arrival of
          project-sponsored technical assistance, and launching of an l&month work program.

          37
           .      A few adjustments were made at the time of the MTR. The in-service training
          sub-component, originally to develop curricula for and train surgeons, obstetricians,
          and anesthetists in emergency obstetric and surgical care in each of the full referral
          hospitals upgraded under the project, was scaled back to train surgeons and surgical
          nurses only. The sub-component on the syndromic management of STD was scaled
          batik because other donors (UNFPA,     WHO, and a major EC project) had stepped in to
          finance these activities. The project retained $400,000 for an STD prevalence survey,
          supervision and training, and reallocated remaining funds to training of health
          professionals in AIDS care, for which the need had become more apparent since
          appraisal, and to additional research and evaluation.

     .    38      Among the remaining problems in implementation were lack of electricity,
          running water, transport, or equipment in some constructed health facilities (due to
          the slow UNICEF procurement contract) and the inability to get money to the
          provinces for implementation of decentralized activities. It wasn't until late 2000 that
          the project was able to set up accounts physically in the provinces. This was made
          possible by ACLEDA, a microfinance NGO supported by the International Finance .
          Corporation, which got a fullretail banking license in that year with branches in
          provinces. Once the ACLEDA accounts were opened for the DCHDP, other World
.         Bank projects followed suit. The activities of the three national disease programs
          were extended to all 24 provinces in October 2000, requiring the establishment of 13
          additional PPUs (SBK 2002).

          39     The project was briefly classified as "at risk" of not completing its
          development objectives, from August until December 2000, at which time nearly half
          of the credit was disbursed and both the health strengthening component and the three
          national disease subcomponents were rated as satisfactory, with the exception of
          equipment for HC, which was not expected to arrive before the close of the project.

                                                                   .

  3.10       Based on the momentum gained in disbursements, the project closing was
  extended by 9 months to December 2002: 98.7 percent" of the credit had been
  disbursed, and almost all of the planned activities had been implemented. Considering
  the complexity of the project and the very low implementation capacity at the outset.,
  this is a remarkable achievement. The Government contributed only $1.37 million (26
  percent) of its planned contribution of $5.2 million; both the Implementation
  Completion Report (ICR) and supervision reports claim that this did not adversely
  affect the project's performance. `* The final report prepared by the borrower attributes
  this result to the accounting program used by the PCU, which considers only
  counterpart funds managed by the PCU and the SFKC and excludes government
  spending on all of the units (salaries and running costs) (PCU 2002).

  BASICHEALTHSTRENGTHENING

  41         The project greatly expanded the coverage of the health system in the 11
  project provinces. Health centers were acompletely new type of health facility.
  According to the SAR, the target number of HC for these 11 provinces under the
  health coverage plan was 455, of which 32 were already in existence either through
  the Government or other donors. The project's target was to construct or renovate 230
  HC, or more than half of the 423 needed. It succeeded in constructing or renovating
  198, or 86 percent of targets (Table 1). In addition, the project aimed to renovate 26
  of the 28 total referral hospitals required for 10 provinces, which was 85 percent
  accomplished. I9         Three of the five planned STD clinics and all of the provincial blood
  banks were built or renovated, 160 percent of the targeted OD, and 11 district
- pharmacies were built/renovated, not originally a project target. Based on the
  catchment area for a HC, the project effectively increased access to basic health
  facilities to 2.8 million people. The BHS Project, which financed construction or
  renovation of 197 HC and 13 RH in five provinces, provided access to another 2.4
 million people (Sheladia 2001). The civil works sub-component was fully disbursed;
 reallocation of expenditure across types of facilities was due to negotiations with
 provinces in the HMA, changes in the unit costs of construction, and new information
  about the feasibility of renovations.




  17. This is in terms of Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Because of changes in the SDR-U.S. dollar exchange rate,
 the credit funds available in dollars had declined from $30.4 million to $27.1 million by October 2002, two
 months before closing, of which $25.4 million had been spent. Of this amount, $9.45 million (37 percent) was
 spent by SFKC and $15.94 million (63 percent) by MOH.

  18. This share is increased to 37 percent in terms of Cambodian currency (riel), if the nearly 50 percent
 depreciation of the riel against the U.S. dollar over the life of the project is taken into account. That part of the
 counterpart firnds identified for maintenance of the completed health facilities apparently was forthcoming.

 19. According to the SAR, because the five        RHs required for Phnom Penh were in an otherwise relatively better
 served urban area, none were targeted for renovation by the project. Many of the           RHs could not be renovated and
 new facilities had to be constructed.

42        Decentralization of planning, budgeting, and financing of health care through
the piloting of HMA in the 11 provinces was one of the major achievements of the
project. The first HMA were negotiated between the PHD and the PCU for all 11
project provinces in 1998, lasting for 12 months (July F-June                           30). The 2001 HMA
was set for a period of 15 months (Jan 2001-March 2002).

43        HMA are viewed by both the MOH and Provincial Health Directorates as
beneficial, as they set out the responsibilities of both parties and serve as the basis of a
work program. These benefits are largely responsible for the extension of the HMA
concept to all 24 provinces in the follow-on Health Sector Support Project (HSSP). The
second audit of the HMA, in 2001, identified the main problems they continue to face:
(a) lack of incentives for non-compliance by either party or rewards for good
performance; (b) the work plans of the provinces depend on procurement managed by
the MOH, the timing of which the provinces cannot control; and (c) slow approval of
work programs and budgets, which delay implementation. Nevertheless, the audit
found, in general, "an improvement in the [provincial] planning of activities and
budgets from the previous year.. ." (SBK 2002, p. 6) The one-year time frame for the
HMA was found to be too short; subsequent HMA were set for 15 months to overcome
some of these problems, and the respondents to the audit suggested a somewhat longer
time frame to allow procurement and implementation of the planned activities.

44        The extent to which the extension of the health infWructu.re and decentralization
of the health system in fact improved access to services depends on the extent to which
the HC were fully staffed with trained workers, equipped, and stocked with drugs, and
the catchment population was not dissuaded by user fees. The project's supervision files
indicate that while the drug supplies were forthcoming and training occurred, many of the
health centers were lacking in medical equipment up to the close of the project. (This was
not the case for the referral hospitals.) Based on results of interviews with health St&and

                                                             1 2


 clients in four randomly-selected project              provinces,2o      the second HMA audit in May 2002
 found that drug supply was generally reliable and technical training of staff had occurred,
but that supervision was variable, some facilities were still under-staffed,2*                         and that in
 some cases drugs arrived close to their expiration                  date22   (SBK 2002). The Final Project
 Evaluation survey of 61 HC in 21 provinces found that almost all HC undertake most
 MPA activities, and about two-thirds provide TB control and/or malaria treatment
 (Coffey 2002).23         All HC in the 2Lprovince sample reported receiving regular supplies of
 drugs but two-thirds also said that the HC runs out (the time                      frame was not provided,
however) (Coffey 2002, p              12-20).

45.         With the extension of the health system to under-served areas, the contact rate
of the population with public health services and key outcomes like the immunization
coverage rate should have risen dramatically. According to the MOH Health
Information System, based on service statistics, the percent of deliveries by trained
 staff rose from 29.1 percent to 40.9 percent between 1997 and 2001 and the number
of outpatient consultations at HC rose from 3.4 million to 4.6 million (PCU 2002,
Annex 6). However, the number of health system contacts per inhabitant per year rose
only modestly, from 0.32 to 0.37. A National Health Survey (1998),                                  which used a
stratified random sample of 21 of the 24 provinces, was conducted as a baseline to
measure both health outcomes and health care utilization by households. However,
the project's 2002 Final Evaluation Survey used a fundamentally different sampling
frame - one based on fully functioning health centers (Coffey 2002) - biasing results
in favor of better health outcomes. It also collected health care utilization on a
different group of household members and with a different reference period for
reporting illness. Thus, trends in health care use by households over the project period
(1997-2002) cannot be tracked. The 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
collected utilization data comparable to the 1998 NHS, but implementation of the
civil works did not accelerate until 2000-2002, after the DHS fieldwork.24

46          Nevertheless, there are some indicators of client satisfaction at the end of the
project. The second HMA audit conducted a survey of more than 400 HC clients in
four provinces and found that more than 90 percent received some drugs or medications
from their visit, the health workers were thought to be generally courteous, and the
                                                                                                                              .
20. Kandal,    Kampong Thorn, Pursat, Kratie.

21. One Provincial Health Director noted that while the norm for staffing an HC was 6-8, the average in his
province was between 3-4. The HC visited by OED in two provinces had             4-10 staff. Provincial health authorities
reported that staff were giving priority to outreach activities in the community (immunizations, deliveries, and
anti-malaria activities), which sometimes  left a shortage of staff for treatment in the facility.

22. Unfortunately, the audit report does not quantify these shortcomings, so it is     difficult  to know how pervasive
they were. In field visits to Kampot and Karnpong Speu provinces, OED found that in two of the three health
centers for which the pharmacy was open, there were stock outages of adult doses of anti-malarial drugs and the
TB drugs had expired one month previously.

23. TB and malaria treatment were defined as available if "services were provided routinely most days or the
same day of each week;" this may understate availability of treatment.       At the start of the project, DOTS was not
offered in HC.

24. The non-comparability of the 1998 and 2002 survey results cast doubts on other dramatic improvements in
outcomes asserted in the     PCU'S final report on the project (for example, dramatic reductions in infant and child
mortality). The comparability of results of the 1998 NHS, the 2000 DHS, and the 2002 Final Evaluation Survey
are discussed in greater detail in Annex C.

major impediment to use of health care remained the long distances andpoor road
infrastructure,   staflshortages,        and drug shortages. 25 User fees were not cited by the
clients as an impediment; those who did not receive drugs attributed it to drugs being
out of stock, and not high costs. The second HMA audit and OED field interviews
found that fee revenues were used in most cases to improve the quality or maintenance
of the facilities and for topping off salaries of the health workers. The final project
evaluation patient exit poll found similar findings on the courtesy of health staff and
that 96 percent of HC clients received drugs. In addition, 76 percent of HC clients and
91 percent of hospital clients got some exemption from paying the fee.


HIV/AIDS

47         The main achievements of the project with respect to HIV/AIDS were to
invest in the institutional development of the Government response through
NCHADS and decentralized Cambodian implementation of the national strategic plan
for the health sector. HIV/AIDS activities have been and continue to be funded in
parallel by bilateral donor agencies (such as DFID, EU, French Cooperation, USAID)
and international NGOs (such as FHI/Impact, MSF, Care, Save the Children, World
Vision). However, the DCHDP enabled the Government to direct and coordinate the
national HIV/AIDS strategy, particularly those activities within the purview of the
MOH. The key outcomes to which the DCHDP contributed include:

0     Creating the institutional foundation for a strong government response based in
      the MOH. The project was the catalyst for creating a completely new national
      institution, on a par with the other national communicable disease programs,
      capable of leading an effective fight against HIV/AIDS. As a covenant in the
      credit agreement, the NAO was elevated to the level of a department within the
      MOH when it merged in 1997 with the National Center for Dermatology and
      Venereology to become NCHADS. At the central level, the project created a
      management system based on annual and quarterly work planning and detailed
     budgets for all activities, with monthly and annual reporting. NCHADS took on a
      role of strategy development and management, with provincial implementation
      through operational plans and indicators in the HMA. During the project it
     prepared two strategic plans for HIV/AIDS prevention and care (1998-2000 and
      2001-2005 [MOH 20001) and strategic implementation guidelines for the outreach
     program, 100% condom use, ST1 treatment, HBC, IEC, testing and counseling,
     universal precautions, and surveillance (NCHADS 2001 a, 2001b,                           2001~). At the
     provincial level, the project financed decentralized training, implementation, and
     supervision, using new procedures that channeled funds directly from the
     PCU/MOH          to provinces, bypassing the MEF and the national programs.
     Respondents reported that the project instilled new confidence of Cambodian staff
     to manage the program, attracted many bright people, and fostered much learning.

l  Raisingpolitical commitment. The project financed a study tour in March 1999                                  -
     for senior officials from the PCU; NCHADS, MEF, NAA, and provincial health

25. While the audit commendably interviewed a    large sample of clients, the views of those who did not seek
health care would also be important in assessing the constraints to increased use of health facilities.

     improved the working relationships between agencies, cemented the commitment
     among participants to a decentralized national program, and instilled an
     appreciation for the importance of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data t&

     strengthen the health system to care for the rising number of AIDS patients.

    Implementing HIVprevention in commercial sex. The project financed the
     evaluation, re-design and provincial implementation of the outreach program,
    preparation, launching, and gaps in Cambodian implementation of the pilot 100%
    condom program in Sihanoukville,26              and renovation of three STD clinics where
     sex workers can obtain services. The redesigned outreach program was the
     launching pad for national expansion of the 100% condom use program, also
     financed by the project (see Box 1).

    Strengthening the capacity of indigenous            NGOs      in AIDS prevention      and care. The
    NGO small grant sub-contract to Khana built capacity among indigenous NGOs
    to design and implement technically sound interventions, financing 68 grants
    totaling $541,328 to 39 NGOs in 15 provinces from 1999-2002 (see Box 2).27

    workers was externally evaluated in 1998 and re-designed in 1999. Beginning in
     1999, the project funded the Government's annual HIV sentinel surveillance
    (among direct and indirect CSW, police, TB patients, and women attending
    antenatal clinics) and behavioral surveillance (CSW, police, military, mototaxi
    drivers) (NCHADS            undated c); it also funded the 2001 STD prevalence survey.

    Enhanced capacity for AIDS treatment and care; Funds were reallocated mid-
    term to train health staff in adult AIDS care guidelines (96 physicians - roughly 5
    percent of all government physicians), pediatric care guidelines (40 physicians),
    and laboratory techniques for voluntary testing (29 lab technicians). Nearly a third
    of the NGO small grants issued through Khana supported piloting and expansion
    of home-based care (HBC),               primarily in Phnom Penh and Battambang.

48       There were also some shortcomings. While there was substantial
decentralization of management to provinces, the AIDS program is not as well
integrated with basic health services in the provinces as the malaria and TB programs.
Widespread access of the general population to integrated STD treatment was not yet
a reality as of the end of the project. IEC activities were not as extensive as planned,
though condom publicity by PSI may have compensated to some extent. Except for

  1Box 1. Cambodia's 100% Condom Prqgram
   Building on Thailand's success in curbing the HIV epidemic through 100% condom use in brothel-based sex
   (Rojanapithayakom and Hanenberg 1996), in October 1998 Cambodia launched a home-grown 100% condom use pilot
   project in Sihanoukville, the country's only major port, with 60 brothels and 500 brothel-based and 200 indirect sex
   workers in massage parlors, restaurants, and karaoke bars. The pilot project mobilized political support                               from provincial
   authorities, the police, and brothel owners; created               CSW-fkiendly STD clinic that offers monthly medical checkups; and
   made socially marketed condoms available in brothels." A condom use working group (CUWG) and outreach team
   worked .with local authorities and brothel owners to implement the program; a Condom Use Monitoring and Evaluation
   Committee (CUMEC) was chaired by the vice-governor.

   From 1998-99, condom use in Sihanoukville doubled, fi-om 45 to 90 percent among CSW and by 2000 nearly doubled
   among male clients (Figures A and B). Syphilis rates among SW dropped                            Tom 9 percent to 1.8 percent and trichomonas
   from 5.6 percent to 2 percent (CrabM et al. 200 1). The 100% condom use policy was endorsed by the Prime Minister in
   1999 and all provincial governors were asked to support it. The program was extended to seven provinces in                                   2000,15     in
   2001 and achieved national coverage in              2002.b Commercial sex remains illegal in Cambodia, however.

   Cambodia's 100% condom use program has never been independently evaluated. While informants believed the
   pilot to be highly successful, all agreed that the program has been implemented too recently to have had an impact
   on behavior in the late 1990s. During the pilot phase, condom use rose dramatically in Sihanoukville but also in
   other provinces where the program had not yet been launched, though at a less rapid rate. The genera1 population
   avoids the CSW-STD clinics. The pilot project found that the syndromic approach to STD detection and
   management was not suitable for CSW. The CSW-dedicated facilities, the need for a higher level of diagnostic
   skills and equipment, and the financial incentives for implementation by health workers, the CUWG and CUMEC
   presumably raised the cost of the program.' The annual cost of the two committees' activities and the outreach
   program for .a single urban area is estimated at roughly $15,000 annually, plus $9,000 for a one-time launch, but
   excluding the cost of STD clinics (World Bank 2002). These costs                            - and less-costly alternatives to achieve the
   same outcomes - need to be evaluated against the benefits in terms of reducing transmission among those most at
   risk and to the rest of the population. The extent to which lack of access to                            free condoms among high risk groups
   affects outcomes also needs to be studied.

  funded Cambodian implementation, of the pilot when funding gaps occurred and most costs of expanded implementation to other provinces.
  b. The 100% Condom Use program was launched in           13    provinces in 2002 (Bantey Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang,
  Kampong Speu, Kampot, Prey Veng, Svay Reng, Koh Kong,            Pailin, Pursat, Siem Reap, and Takeo). However, the program had yet to be launched
  in Kep, Ouddar      Meanchey, and Mondulkiri because of the scarcity of sex workers (NCHADS 2002).
  c. The pilot clinic was equipped to diagnose trichomoniasis, syphilis,     candida  or bacterial infections, but not chlamydia or gonorrhea. Treatment for
  "suspected" STD was   pm&bed based on the number of white blood cells. All of the other provinces with the exception of           Sihanoukvilie   use
  syndromic management of STD, despite its limited ability to detect illness among sex workers (NCHADS 2002, Annex 3).

Box 2. Building the Capacity of Indigenous NGOs to Fight AIDS

International NGOs and local affiliates had long been active in providing health care in Cambodia, but
there were very few indigenous NGOs with capacity to do so. The Khmer HIV/AIDS NGO Alliance
(Khana)  was established in 1996 as a project of the UK-based International HIV/AIDS Alliance and
registered .as a Cambodian NGO in 1999.    Khana   receives both technical and financial support     from the
Alliance. Khana's   objective is to strengthen the organizational capacity of local NGOs to design and
execute HIV/AIDS activities in Cambodia and to secure funding for them.

The MOHLDCHDP.        contract was the first for Khana   that was not routed through the International
Alliance. The largest share of the 68 grants (33 percent) and spending (46 percent) were for home-
based care (HBC) or care and support for households with PWA (see Figure). Much of this was to
support NGOs in the post-pilot expansion of HBC in Phnom Penh and to the Khmer Rural
Development Agency in the piloting of HBC in rural Battambang province in 1999 (Wilkinson et al.
2000). Another third of projects and 30 percent of spending were for prevention and/or awareness
among youth or the general population. Only 7 grants (13 percent of spending) supported prevention
among high-risk groups (sex workers, the military, factory workers), and two (4 percent of spending)
were exclusively for support of orphans and their families. The provinces receiving the most resources
were Phnom Penh (48 percent of the total) and Battambang (12 percent), followed by Kratie                  (6
percent), Kandal, B. Meanchey, K. Chhnang, and Svay Rieng (5 percent each).         Khana's NGO partners
expanded from 15 in 1999 to more than 40 in 2002.

          Khana grants supported by DCHDP, 1999-2002, by type of intervention




                                                                                 1.20




Each vetted NGO had to conduct a community needs assessment prior to project design, followed by a
workshop to refine the design. The grants supported by the DCHDP lasted one year, with field
supervisory visits and disbursements once per quarter. Unfortunately, the DCHDP contract had no
requirement for evaluation of the NGO grants or of Khana,           reducing the ability to learn from
experience and improve program effectiveness. A USAID-funded           evaluation of the HBC pilot and
follow-on programs in June 2000 found important impacts on the health and well-being of PWA and
their families and reduced community stigma, compared to villages with no program (Wilkinson et al.
2000). The estimated cost of medical services per visit ($3.71) was less than outpatient hospital
services ($15 per patient episode), but the total cost per HBC visit including other support services
amounted to $9.28 in Phnom Penh and $14.60 in rural Battanibang.

                                                              1 7


 HBC, the NGOs funded by Khana were often not linked to government provincial or
 district activities. There was no evaluation of the NGO activities financed by the
project through Khana.

 49        HIV sentinel surveillance from 1997-2002                shows dramatic declines in HIV
prevalence among direct and indirect sex workers and blood donors, a decline then
 leveling off among police, an increase and leveling off among pregnant women, and
 continued sharp increases among TB patients (NCHADS data, see Annex D).
 Weighting these results, NCHADS estimates that HIV prevalence among adults 15
49 nationally has declined from 3.3 percent in 1997 to 2.6 percent in 2002 (NCHADS
undated). Since there is no cure for HIV, changes in prevalence are determined by the
balance of the number of new infections (HIV incidence, which raises prevalence),                              '
and the AIDS mortality rate (lowering it). All informants interviewed by the OED
mission acknowledged that higher mortality has contributed to the decline in HIV
prevalence. Most were convinced that behavior change has also contributed to
somewhat lower incidence. However, there are no studies of HIV incidence in
Cambodia to confirm the extent to which the rate of new infections has declined, nor
are there sufficiently reliable mortality data to deduce incidence from prevalence and
mortality.

4.10      Nevertheless, reductions of risk behavior among high-risk groups, increased
condom sales, and reductions in STD prevalence are strong evidence for the
plausibility of reduced HIV incidence. The most dramatic declines in HIV prevalence
are among brothel-based sex workers and police, both groups at high risk of
contracting and spreading HIV and the focus of NCHADS strategies to curb
transmission. These declines have happened in parallel with an increase in condom
use, particularly by sex workers themselves (Figure 3), and a decline in the percent of                        .
men who use sex workers (Figure 4). Annual sales of the socially marketed Number '
One condoms have jumped from 5 million in 1995 to 19 million in 2002 (Figure 5).
Corroborating the actual increase in condom use, STD surveys conducted in 1996 and
2001 show a decline in gonorrhea (from 23.2 to 14.2 percent), chlamydia (from 22.5
percent to 12.1 percent), and syphilis (from 13.8 percent to 2.8 percent) among sex
workers (Leng et al. 2002, Ryan and Gorbach 1997).28                       Moreover, the 2001 survey
found very low rates of ulcerative STD in all three groups surveyed (ANC women,
police, and sex workers). No cases of primary syphilis were found among any of the
groups, and no cases of gonorrhea were found among ANC women or police (Leng et .                                   -
al. 2002).

4.11      Knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention has also improved among
women of reproductive age. While there are issues of comparability of the sampling
frames, the 2000 Cambodia DHS and the Final Project Evaluation Survey in 2002
both collected data on knowledge of HIV/AIDS, and the latter may be less biased
with respect to HIV/AIDS knowledge than other indicators, since AIDS information



28. The sampling of the two surveys and provincial coverage were not identical, so comparisons must be made
with care. The 2001 survey used a population-based sample, which was not possible in 1996 due to security
concerns (Leng et al. 2002).

   programs were not strongly linked to extension of the health infrastructure.29                            The
.  share of women who spontaneously mentioned that using condoms could prevent
   HIV/AIDS rose from 66 percent to 86 percent, and the percent who mentioned
   avoiding sex with prostitutes as a way of preventing infection rose from 19 to 35
   percent (Annex C). The share who understood that a healthy person can have the
   AIDS virus jumped from 63 to 86 percent.

   4.12         These well-documented outcomes are a reason why the Cambodian response
   is increasingly cited as an example of effective public policy on HIV/AIDS. The
   DCHDP clearly had an impact on the ability of Cambodia to effectively implement its.
   HIV/AIDS strategy. Project resources accounted for roughly half of the budgetary
   resources for HIV/AIDS under control of the Cambodian Government over the period
   1997-2001 (P. Godwin, personal communication). To the extent the national program
   has been successful and developed the technical and implementation capacity for a
   sustained response, the project could be said to have made a major contribution.
   However, at the same time roughly two-thirds of all HIV/AIDS spending over the
   same period was from UN agencies, bilateral and multilateral donors, and
   international NGOs,          most of it implemented outside the MOH. WHO financed the
   initial outreach program launched in 1995 and PSI, with funding from DIFD and
  USAID,         launched the condom social marketing scheme in late 1994, with huge and
  continued publicity even before the start of sentinel or behavioral surveillance. Other
  NGOs          launched parallel early programs in the military. This may explain why
  condom use among some groups of men was already high at the start of the project
   (Figure 3).

  include any questions on HIV/AIDS knowledge or sexual behavior. Women of reproductive age (who were the
  respondents for all three surveys) are considered to be a low-risk group. There has never been a nationwide survey
  of HIV/AIDS knowledge and risk behavior that included both men and women.

  TUBERCULOSIS

  4.13       The major achievement of the project was to finance the training, supervision,
  and implementation by Cambodians of two key activities:

  `*   Extension of ambulatory DOTS to all 68 referral hospitals and 386 health centers,
       more than half of the roughly 650 HCs equipped to provide the MPA at that time
       and 119 percent of the target for the end of 2002.

  l    Monitoring and research, including completion of a study of multi-drug resistant
       (MDR) TB (2001) and a TB prevalence survey in a population of 30,000 (April-
       December 2002), and preparation for a January 2003 survey of HIV in all incident
       TB patients in the country.

- 4.14      Most of these achievements occurred during the last two years of the project.                                  '
  It also financed renovation of the CENAT headquarters building (2001),                                TB drugs
  (through UNICEF, which were delayed until September 1999), laboratory supplies,
  and technical assistance. DCHDP TB activities were extremely slow in taking off,
  due to capacity constraints, the lack of a strategy, and a one-year hiatus (2000) during
  which CENAT had no director. For an 1 Es-month period from June 1999 through most                                                  .
  of 2000, World Bank supervision reports rated this sub-component as unsatisfactory,
  with very low disbursements (only 12 percent of the budget was disbursed by the
  MTR in December 1999).

  4.15      However, the project's .TB activities acce1erate.d with the appointment of a
  new CENAT director in early 2001, the articulation of a National HeaZth Strategic
  Plan for Tuberculosis Control, 2001-2005 (CENAT 2OOla), training of health
  workers for decentralized implementation, and the decision to send the
  implementation budget directly to all 24 provinces. The project was premised on
 supporting hospital-based DOTS. However, a successful pilot of ambulatory DOTS30
  in 9 HCs in three provinces in 1999 proved the feasibility of decentralized, non-
  hospital based treatment: Ambulatory DOTS was extended to 60 HC in 2000,264 in
  2001 (including Phnom Per&, and 386 in 2002 (Eang 2003). The Strategic Plan set
  as a target the extension of ambulatory DOTS to all HC equipped to provide the MPA
  by 2005, to maintain a cure rate for pulmonary ss+ cases of more than 85 percent, and
  to achieve a case detection rate of at least 70 percent of pulmonary ss+ cases by the
  end of 2005. 31       '                                                                                                       I

  4.16      All of the TB monitoring activities foreseen in the project design were
  completed, although the timing and periodicity were revised. The TB prevalence

  3 1. WHO estimated the case detection rate in 2001 as 41 percent for new    ss+   cases, down from 44 percent in 2000
  and 49 percent in 1999 (WHO 2003). However, it isn't clear what assumptions were used for TB incidence, on
  which these rates are based. The Strategic Plan claims that the 2000 case detection rate was 5      1percent.

                                                                  2 1                                        _ ._-


 survey was conducted toward the end of the project with full participation of CENAT
 staff, with plans to repeat it every five years. The frequency of the MDR TB survey
 was revised to once every five years. Annual surveys of HIV infection among TB
 patients (called for in project design) were being conducted by NCHADS. The
 national survey of HIV in all 2,206 incident TB cases in January 2003 conducted by
 CENAT found prevalence of 10.3 percent nationally and 3 1.1 percent in Phnom Penh
 (Onozaki 20.03). This is higher than the last round of NCHADS sentinel surveillance
 data in 2002 (8.4 percent), which tracks trends but is not nationally representative.32

 4.17        The eventual success of decentralized TB activities relied on the infrastructure
 investments of the DCHDP (for 11 provinces) and were complemented by the JICA
National TB Control Project (199902004),                      which expended a total of g 15 1.6 million
 (roughly $1.32 million) in 2000-2002 (Onozaki 2002).33

4.18         The ultimate objective of the NTP is to reduce the annual number of new
 (incident) and chronic infections by raising the case detection rate and maintaining a
high cure rate. However, TB incidence is rarely measured and in Cambodia efforts to
reduce incidence are countered by the growing number of new TB cases due to the
AIDS epidemic: TB and chronic diarrhea are the most common opportunistic
infections associated with AIDS in Cambodia (Kimerling et al. 2002, Senya et al.
2003). Further, due to the decades of lack of effective. health care in Cambodia, there
is a huge reservoir of the population with untreated chronic TB. The lack of
information on TB incidence and prevalence makes it difficult to monitor the case
detection rate, although the future ability to monitor it has been enhanced by the TB
prevalence survey supported by the project. 34

4.19        There is nevertheless evidence of the NTP's                     short-run effectiveness in terms
of increased cases treated and maintenance of a high cure rate. The number of TB
cases treated increased sharply in 2002, when ambulatory DOTS was finally extended
to a large share of newly constructed or renovated health centers in the provinces
(Figure 6).35 It is impossible to know the extent to which this is due to an increase in
the case detection rate, to an increase in the incidence of TB or both, but the fact that
treatment outside of the major urban centers became much more widely available at
that time is strongly suggestive that an important share is due to an increase in the                                    .
case detection rate. The cure rate, which was only 69 percent in 1993, has been
maintained at the target of 85 percent or better since 1995, reaching as high as 91
percent in 2000. Consistent with a high cure rate, the 2001 survey of MDR TB found

33. Other contributors to TB control included WHO and the Government of Japan and CIDA (through WHO).
JICA expenditures exclude the cost of Japanese advisers and counterpart training in Japan.

34. Preliminary results suggest a prevalence of bacteriological TB in all ages of 9021100,000. The prevalence and             -
incidence of pulmonary ss+    TB were 270/100,000      and 256/100,000,    respectively. In contrast, WHO estimates for
2001 put prevalence of bacteriological and pulmonary   ss+  TB much higher - at 1,356/100,000        and 548/l 00,000,
respectively. The prevalence survey results suggest a case-detection rate of around 60 percent, higher than thought
but short of the goal of at least 70 percent (Onozaki 2003).

35. The number of reported TB cases rose by 57 percent, from 15,629 in 1997 to 24,610 in 2002. The increase in
reported cases in 1992-93 likely reflects an increase in percentage of TB cases that were treated as the   he&h
system was consolidated following the 199 1 Peace Accords.

 resistance to single drugs but no MDR cases (Onozaki 2003). Most observers
 contacted by OED attributed a large part of the high cure rate to the food supplied by
 the World Food Program to patients, improving the incentives for completing
 treatment. The estimated relapse rate has remained at 5 percent or less for the
 duration of the project.`(j

MALARIA

4.20       The key achievements of the project in terms of anti-malaria objectives were:


l    Expansion and reinforcement                   offirst-line         treatment of malaria in      public health
     facilities in the periphery, particularly HC. The project trained 934 public health
     staff and 247 military health staff in clinical skills, 472 public health and 375
     military lab technicians in microscopic diagnosis, and 772 HC staff in dipstick
     diagnosis and national treatment guidelines. In addition, it financed equipment
     and more than $0.5 million in anti-malaria drugs.

l    Institutional development and capacity building, in terms of vehicles and per
     diems for supervision and improved management and budgeting for decentralized
     implementation of the national malaria strategy.

l    Piloting and implementing the social marketing of insecticide-impregnated
     hammock nets for forest dwellers, part of a program to prevent malaria in high-
     risk areas under-served by the formal health system (see Box 3).


36. A relapse rate of 5 percent or less was an objective in the SAR. The overall relapse rate declined       from 4
percent to 3.2 percent and the   ss+  relapse rate from 5 percent to 4.6 percent over the period 1997-2002     (NTP data).

 Box 3. Lessons from the Social Marketing of Hammock Nets

 One of the innovative pilot interventions financed by the DCHDP was the social marketing of
 insecticide-treated mosquito nets suitable for use with hammocks. A transient population of roughly
 1.5 million people engages in seasonal work in Cambodia's forests and is highly vulnerable to malaria.
About two-thirds of them sleep in hammocks and only half were believed to be using hammock
mosquito nets for protection from malaria. With project resources, the CNM and WHO developed two
brand name products       - Peace Nets for hammocks and Peace PiIls to treat them with insecticide. The
goal was to develop the brand name and market and to turn this activity over to the private sector.

The national launching of the Peace       Net campaign was delayed by procurement problems and did not
take place until 2001, a year before the end of the project. By December 2002, only 12,000 of the
40,000 Peace Nets had been purchased (representing only 2.4 percent of the estimated 500,000
hammock sleepers without nets) and only 10 percent of the stock of 100,000 Peace Pills was sold. The
Peace Net - which had a break-even cost of 12,000 Riels (about $3), including the insecticide
treatment - encountered strong competition from untreated military-style hammock nets already in the
market, whose price dropped from 6,000 Riels at the start of the project to only 4,000 Riels ($1) at the
end. Despite the extensive publicity around the Peace Net and the benefit of insecticide treatment,
sales did not really take off until their price was lowered below that of the competition, a price that was
too heavily subsidized to be sustainable. Sales of Peace Pills, in contrast, did not respond to price
reductions, suggesting that the public did not understand their benefits.

While the Peace Net will be discontinued when current stocks run out, the publicity surrounding the
nets may have created a "halo" effect in stimulating demand for the inexpensive hammock nets already
on the market. The important lessons were that the existing hammock net market can address the need
of forest workers at lower cost and that the government's malaria program must focus on increasing
the public's understanding of the advantages of treating hammock nets (and        bednets)   with insecticide.
The media campaign for the Peace Pill will be intensified and the existing stock will be marketed (at a
price of 2,000 Riels) until the end of 2004, their expiration date. At that time, it is hoped that the
private sector will take over this activity.

4.21       By project closing, the DCHDP had disbursed $2.472 million on the malaria
sub-component, excluding the drugs and renovation of the national program offices
(covered under the health strengthening sub-component). Other donors were also
active in malaria during this period. DFID's             Malaria Control Project (1995-99,            El.387
million), implemented by WHO, also focused on public sector interventions,
including technical training in case management and microscopy, malaria drug
supplies, and distribution of over 127,000 bednets (Meek et al. 2000). The EC's
Malaria Control Program in Cambodia (1997.2002,e 5.59 million, of which c 3.84
million was spent in-country) was implemented over exactly the same period as the
DCHDP. Its main contribution was in terms of developing early diagnosis and
treatment for malaria (diagnostic dipsticks and Malarine, a combination therapy of
mefloquine and artinsenat) that were implemented in the decentralized public health
system, in the private sector through social marketing (at the end of 2002) and,
eventually, in communities (Bouth Denis et al. 2003). The EC also supported
distribution of insecticide-treated bednets and provided per diems to Cambodian staff
for implementation. As with the DCHDP, the EC project accelerated in its
implementation from 2000 onward, following the appointment of a new director of
the NMP, resolution of disbursement problems, and arrival of EC and Bank-

 sponsored technical advisers in 2000. As a result, two-thirds of the EC project funds
 (e2.56 million) were spent in the last two years, 2001-2002.

 4.22     The combined efforts of government and donors contributed to a 51 percent
 decline in the reported mortality rate from malaria between 1997-2002, from 7.48 to
 3.63 per 100,000, with most of the decline occurring since 1999 (Figure 7). This
reflects a 62 percent reduction in the reported incidence of malaria over the same period
 (from 7.9/1,000         to 3.0/1,000);          the case fatality rate (the percent of reported malaria
cases that are fatal) rose from 0.95 percent to 1.52 percent in 1999, then declined to 1.2
percent in 2002, so has effectively been unchanged or risen slightly (Figure 8).

4.23      While these results are suggestive of an important improvement in malaria
outcomes, they must be qualified. The data in Figures 7 and 8 pertain only to cases
confirmed in the public health system by laboratory examination. An estimated 80-90
percent of malaria patients seek treatment in the private sector. Thus, the reduction in
incidence of reported malaria cases could reflect a shift from public to private
treatment. The monitoring system is attempting to collect data on cases confirmed by
dipstick in health centers, but the numbers are still not consistently reported. There is
currently no regular monitoring system for malaria cases diagnosed in the private
sector (including self-diagnosis with dipstick technology). Nor is there information on
the extent to which the strategy of private marketing of pre-packaged dual therapy
and dipsticks has resulted in more effective treatment.

4.24    There were simply too many different activities being launched in the period
1997-2002 by the Government and donors - bednets,                                                    training, expansion of the
system, new treatments, not to mention a reduction of military action in the forested                                                                 .
areas due to higher political stability and new restrictions on logging, which would
lower malaria exposure - to be able to attribute the trends in the public sector
reporting system to a specific intervention or project (Figure 7). Unfortunately, there
are no large-scale population-based studies over time of the incidence or prevalence
of malaria, knowledge of malaria transmission, symptoms, or treatment, or ownership
and use of mosquito nets (impregnated or not). The surveys of bednet coverage of
high-risk areas in the project design were not completed. Neither the 1998 NHS nor
the Final Evaluation Survey had questions on malaria knowledge or the ownership
and use of bednets. The only nationwide household data known to OED were from .
the 2000 CDHS, which asked about household ownership of mosquito nets, whether
they had been impregnated, whether children underfive had slept under one, and
whether female respondents 15-49 had slept under a mosquito net the previous night.
These results are presented in Annex E.

 OUTCOME

 51        The project's overall outcome rating is satisfactory, based on the continued
high relevance of its objectives and substantial efficacy and efficiency at meeting
them.

 52        The project's objectives remain highly relevant in 2003. The objective of
improving access of the poor to basic health care through expanding the health
infrastructure and addressing key communicable diseases - specifically, malaria, TB,
and AIDS - is highlighted in all three Country Assistance Strategies (1995, 1997,
2000). Investment in improved health is a major poverty alleviation strategy in
Cambodia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and the project directly addressed
three of the five priority areas of the Government's Health Sector Strategic Plan,
2003-2007.

53         The project attained substantial eficacy in reducing death and illness from
preventable diseases and of rehabilitating the health system infrastructure to deliver
basic health services and disease control programs down to the community level. The
mortality rate from malaria declined, the health system expanded to treat a likely
increasing share of TB cases, and significant behavior change occurred in terms of
raising condom use in commercial sex and reduced probability of using sex workers
to strongly suggest lower incidence of HIV. These results likely would not have been
possible without the expansion of health infrastructure, capacity building, and
institutional development supported by the DCHDP, which was the first donor project
to substantially invest in the capacity of the Ministry of Health to implement public
health programs. Underlying this success were several M&E activities within each of
the national programs, and government commitment to evidence-based decisions that
encouraged the results to be used to improve outcomes.

54         While a lack of training in Bank procurement and financial management
procedures contributed to low efficiency at the start of the project, a number of
measures were taken (in addition to efficiency-enhancing elements of project design)
to result in substantial eficiency by the close of the project. The contracting of civil
works to SFKC and of the NGO small grants to Khana, establishment of provincial
accounts, and per diems in support of supervision at all levels enhanced efficiency in
implementation. The results of pilot activities supported in part or total by the project
(HMA, social marketing of hammock nets, 100% condom use) as well as monitoring
and evaluation (the AIDS outreach program) enhanced learning and were used as a
management tool to improve the efficiency of government programs. With respect to
                                                                                                                      l

civil works, the unit cost of HC -($20,900               in Phase I and $25,500 in Phase II, a 2 1
percent increase) was substantially higher than the appraisal estimate ($17,500).37                             In
supervision reports, this was attributed to increased costs of materials (the quality of

37. The costs of HC construction by the ADB project rose for similar reasons. For example, the average cost of a
square model HC rose from $22,033 to      $25,68 1. The cost of an elevated HC, implemented in the more remote
areas at the end of the project came to $3 1,855 (Sheladia 2001).

                                                               27


      some inputs was revised upward during the project, such as tiling for the floors) and
      the remote location of some of the Phase II facilities, where the SFKC relied more
      heavily on local shopping, reducing competition and raising the costs.38             The Phase II
      sites were also more challenging, requiring more backfill and grading.

      55      An important concern affecting both efficacy and efficiency is the extent to
     which the HC were adequately staffed and equipped to perform effectively. The late
.     supply of drugs was largely met by other donors, but the mission encountered
      evidence that timeliness of drugs in relation to their expiration date is still an issue,
     while supervision reports note that equipment for some HC would not arrive before
     the end of the project. The mission was not able to obtain systematic data on the
     extent to which the HC and RH are fully staffed or information on the proportion of
     staff that were trained. The overall number of government health staff has remained
     relatively constant at 17,000-l 8,000 over the life of the project (Ensor 2002);
     maintaining adequate staff at new facilities would require redeployment from those
     that were phased out. It is not known the extent to which this occurred.


     INSTITUTIONALDEVELOPMENTIMPACT                              .

     56       Institutional development was high, based on the contribution of the project to
     an enormous improvement in the ability of Cambodia to make more efficient,
     equitable and sustainable use of its resources through better institutional arrangements
     and better alignment of the mission and capacity of MOH, the national disease
     programs, and provincial health offices with their mandates.

     57       The MOH has evolved from a weak bystander to the owner and implementer
     of national health strategies, in coordination and collaboration with international
     donors. The project was the catalyst for fundamental changes in the relations between
     the MOH and the provinces, in which the national government was responsible for
     strategic direction and mobilization of resources and the provinces for planning,
     management, and implementation. Substantial progress was achieved in integrating
     `vertical' national disease programs into the decentralized health system, an
     achievement that has eluded many other countries. Each program developed short- to
     medium-term strategies and quarterly work programs and budgets to deliver them -a
     revolution in terms of the way that things get done. The HMA provided the
     principles if not incentives for this to occur and the project's investment in the
     technical and managerial capacity of the provinces made it possible to carry it out.
     The innovative financing arrangements piloted by the project to get money to the
     provinces were later adopted by decentralized World Bank projects in other sectors in
     Cambodia. The DCHDP created the institutional basis (NCHADS) and technical and
     managerial capacity for a nationally-owned AIDS response based in the MOH that is
     a source of technical expertise for expansion to other sectors. The contract with
     Khana built the capacity of national NGOs             to prepare and implement AIDS


     38. According to SFKC, greater use of local shopping in Phase II for some projects was due to: (a) the
     need to divide larger projects into smaller components when all components were not submitted
     simultaneously; (b) low total costs; and (c) indication of urgency by MOH for some facilities (see
     Annex G).

                                                                28                                              e


  interventions. These achievements would not have been possible without strong
  MOH leadership and commitment of the government to the project's objectives.

   58         The high rating on institutional development impact is based on the
  remarkable progress instigated by the project, yet the institutional agenda is evolving
  and progress has not been uniform. There are still large differences across provinces
  in implementation capacity and use of HMA. Much work remains to improve the
  accountability and incentives of MOH and the provinces to manage by results. Many
  improvements can be made in M&E at the central and provincial level, particularly
  with respect to population-based monitoring tools and ensuring the consistency of
  methodology over time. The capacity of the PCU to manage dual World Bank and
  ADB projects was enhanced during the project; it remains for this capacity to be
  developed within the MOH. The NGOs and activities sponsored by the Khana
  contract, while building local implementation capacity, were at arms length from
  NCHADS, had minimal links to provincial activities, and were never evaluated.


  SUSTAINABILITY

  59         Sustainability is likeIy, but with some important caveats. Sustainability of the
  outcomes and resilience of the project's benefits to risk are enhanced by the following
  factors. First, the Government has drafted a              Health Sector Strategic Plan for 2003-
  2007 that continues the expansion and improved quality of the health system with                                      .
  special provisions for the poor, and the national programs for TB, malaria, and AIDS
  all have recent strategic plans that they are following. Second, substantial Cambodian
  capacity has been built in terms of technical training, planning, budgeting,
  management, and monitoring. Third, the domestic resources allocated to health have
  been rising. Over the period 1998-2002,                 government health spending from the MOH
  has risen from $1 to $3 per capita and total public expenditure on health has more
  than doubled (Figure 9). Revenue from user fees (99 percent retained by the facilities)
  has risen from CR3.4 billion to CR53 billion between 1998 and 2001. Fourth,
  Cambodia has been or will be the recipient of significant continued donor support for
  these health programs through the follow-on Health, Sector Support Project (HSSP),
  funded by the Bank ($31.8 million) and the ADB ($32.6 million), a DFID grant for
  HIV/AIDS totaling $74.2 million over that period, as well as grants from the Global
  Fund of $10 million for malaria and $15.9 million for HIV/AIDS. The Bank-financed
  part of HSSP includes a $2.0 million IDA grht for NCHADS, specifically for ST1                                   '
  treatment drugs and to implement the 100% condom program in high-risk populations
  nationally.

  5.10      However, sustainability is weakened by several factors: First, the low salaries
  and morale of health staff are a continued concern and threatens the quality and
I availability of health care. The total number of health staff has been kept fairly
  constant at 17,000-18,000           (Ensor 2002),       while the amount spent on salaries in dollar
  terms has crept upward slowly in dollar terms (see Figure 9).39                      Second, the follow-on
  HSSP is more complicated and the PCU and PPU have been disbanded. The HSSP

  39. The decline in spending between 1996-98 in Figure 9 is due  to depreciation of the riel against the dollar.
  Expenditure increased in nominal riels.

 will be implemented by the MOH, which has less implementation capacity that will
 require substantial investment and learning at the outset. Third, there was a several-
 month gap in funding between the end of DCHDP and effectiveness of the HSSP,
 during which time there was no money for supervision or training and activities
 ground to a halt.40 Finally, the huge influx of funds for national disease programs
 from donors and the Global Fund may exceed the programs' capacity to use the
 resources well.

BANK PERFORMANCE

5.11            Overall, the Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. While there were
many aspects of the preparation and supervision of the DCHDP that were exemplary,
several significant shortcomings could have been anticipated and prevented.

5.12           The project design was appropriately selective, given the limited
implementation capacity of government. It addressed priority health issues with clear
criteria for choice of provinces and disease programs---cost-effectiveness, public
economics, reaching the poor, and the ongoing activities of other donors. The choice
of communicable diseases (especially malaria) favored the poor, as did the
construction and rehabilitation of rural health facilities. The Bank took a long-term
perspective, &vesting heavily in government capacity and health infrastructure while


40. This point was made repeatedly by informants. For example, funds for the outreach program for sex workers
were depleted by October 2002, while new funding       from the HSSP was not forthcoming until August 2003.

      supporting communicable disease control programs that can have an impact in the
      short run. It attempted to improve the efficiency of the system by rationalizing and
      capturing informal user fees to improve service quality and encourage local
      management, while exempting the poor. Preparation tapped strong technical expertise
      and prior sector analysis. The implementation plan was complex but detailed and
      developed with the full participation of MOH. Monitoring and evaluation were
      explicit - including a national baseline and final household survey - and were linked
      to management decisions to improve performance. However, the Bank failed to
      anticipate the need to train Government staff in financial management and
      procurement, which plagued the project for many years. The assumption that these
      functions could be delegated to external consultants proved wrong. The ambitious
     timetable for completion of civil works was unrealistic.

      5.13     Supervision emphasized proactive problem-solving, such as sub-contracting
     with the SFKC for civil works, sub-contracting the small grants component to Khana,
      and introducing new financial management structures to ensure decentralized
     implementation. National baseline and final household surveys were implemented in
     a timely way. There was good collaboration with partners. Despite the complexity of
     the project and implementation delays, the credit was virtually fully disbursed with
     only a modest g-month extension of the completion date. However, given that this
     was the first health operation in Cambodia,. there should have been more intense
     supervision at the outset, reinforced by a field-based Bank staff member. Further,
     inadequate supervision in design of the baseline and final surveys resulted in
     exclusion of key indicators in the baseline (on malaria and HIV/AIDS) and non-
     comparable questions, reference periods, and sampling design for the final survey.
     These omissions render both surveys of limited use in evaluating the impact of the
     project and the final survey will be of little, if any, use as a baseline for the HSSP.

     BORROWER P ERFORMANCE

     5.14     The borrower's performance was satisfactory. During preparation, the
.    Government generally took into account the economic, financial, technical, policy,
     and resource considerations-including limited implementation capacity-and
     ensured participation of other stakeholders. The MOH was strongly committed to the
     objectives of the DCHDP,     including decentralization of the health system and setting
     up a new and untried relationship with the provinces through the HMAs, and
     developed the detailed project implementation plan.

     5.15     With respect to implementation, the borrower executed the conditions and
     covenants in the credit agreement. Some of the implementation delay was due to            .
     factors under the borrower's control - the initial lack of coordination between the
     MOH and MEF, lack of leadership in CENAT until 2001, and delayed counterpart
     funding, for example. Most of these problems were eventually overcome, though final
     counterpart funding was still less than half that planned. The borrower exhibited
     flexibility in agreeing to contract key functions to other agencies and NGOs      when the
     initial design didn't work. After a late start and resolution of quality control issues,
     the SFKC performed well in implementing the civil works component on time.
     Training in procurement and financial management and the adoption of strategies and

 quarterly work programs dramatically improved implementation performance in the
 last two years of the project. The Government's commitment was demonstrated
 through increases in the health budget and attempts to raise remuneration for health
 staff It's strong commitment to evidence-based decision-making and testing pilot
 programs before they ae nationally replicated enhanced both implementation and
 sustainability. The borrower has embraced the M&E activities of the project, which
 have become an integral part of decision-making. OED was unable to establish the
 adequacy of staffing and maintenance of the new health facilities, a continuing
 concern in light of the deficit in counterpart finance and the gap between projects.

 60      Lessons

 61      This assessment highlights lessons from the project as a whole as well as
 specific lessons on HIV/AIDS that are relevant to OED's ongoing evaluation of the
 Bank's HIV/AIDS assistance.


 PROJECT-WIDE LESSONS

 62      Projects launched with a new borrower with low `capacity need to front-
 load the implementation plan with training in Bank procurement and financial
 management procedures - in the MOH, MOF and, for decentralized projects, at
 the periphery. Many of the problems encountered early in the project could have
 been prevented with adequate training before project launch; more frequent
 supervision and the presence of staff in health or procurement at the Phnom Penh
 field office would have improved performance. -

 63      When activities are prioritized and the comparative advantages of
 different partners are tapped, relatively complex projects can be successfully
 implemented by government in a low-capacity setting. Despite inadequate training
 in procurement and financial management and an over-estimation of the capacity of
-government early in the project's life with respect to several aspects of the project
 design (civil works, NGO grants), the Bank and borrower worked together to simplify
 and prioritize activities to complete the project with only a short extension. The key
 to this success involved: (a) prioritization of tasks; (b) a detailed, explicit project
 implementation plan (PIP); (c) focus on capacity building and institutional
 development; (d) strong M&E linked to decisions; (e) contracting other implementers
 when possible and necessary; (f) technical assistance provided by the project and
 from other donors; (g) coordination with other donors and health NGOs.

 64      HMA are a promising framework for decentralized management of the
 health system. Their successful functioning depends on investments in: (a)
 management, planning, budgeting and technical capacity in the provinces; (b) the
 means to get financial resources to the periphery; (c) strong M&E at the center and
 periphery to verify outcomes; and (d) the ability to reward good performance and

                                                                  32


 penalize non-performance. The project made important progress in a subset of
 provinces on the first three of these; the fourth remains a goal.41

 65          When M&E are linked to implementation decisions, they become inputs
 into the planning process and can contribute to improved performance. The
 project embraced baseline and final household surveys, intermediate evaluations of
 key program components and pilot projects that conditioned implementation (AIDS
 outreach, malaria hammock net programs, HMA audits), and monitoring of outcomes
 that were project targets (HIV prevalence, risk behavior, STD prevalence, TB
 prevalence). The HMA framework, which emphasizes funding based on meeting
 program objectives and targets, also strongly encouraged M&E.

 66          Monitoring instruments must ensure comparability of indicators,
 instruments, reference periods and sampling frames over time to track results.
 There's always pressure to "improve the next survey" by re-phrasing questions,
 changing respondents, altering reference periods for morbidity questions, or changing
 the instructions to interviewers. But succumbing to that pressure makes it impossible '
 to monitor trends. The project failed to ensure that key indicators were consistently
 measured using comparable sampling frames at baseline and project end. As a result,
 trends in health care use and health outcomes cannot be tracked in the project's
 timefkrne and the final survey will not be adequate to serve as a baseline for the
 follow-on HSSP. This problem was not limited to the DCHDP within.Cambodia;
 similar issues in maintaining comparability of poverty measures and household
expenditure trends over time have been encountered with the Cambodia
Socioeconomic Survey (CSES) implemented by the National Institute of Statistics in
 1997 and 1999.


LESSONS FOR HIV/AIDS ASSISTANCE

67          Investment in the institutional development of NCHADS and its
implementation capacity empowered the government to define and lead the
national AIDS agenda.                  NCHADS was created in conformance with a covenant in
the credit agreement, elevating the national profile of HIV/AIDS. The Bank was one
of many donors supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and care in Cambodia, .but the only
one to substantially finance government implementation capacity.

68          Promoting government commitment to fight HIV/AIDS and to embrace a
piblic health approach is never finished. Government commitment in Cambodia
was strong during the project, but it has not always been and cannot be taken for
granted. There has been much soul-searching among national and provincial leaders,
*as in other countries, on the proper approach - whether to close brothels and arrest
sex workers, which is politically popular but drives HIV transmission underground,
or to promote policies that will produce safer behavior in commercial sex. This is


41. It was intended that small cash accounts set up for each participating province to pay for day-to-day operating
costs for travel, subsistence, and offrce supplies would serve as an incentive if the payments could be linked to
performance (and not payments for civil works and equipment). However, it does not appear that the cash
accounts were used in this way in implementation.

                                                    33                             . -- -


     still an issue. Indeed, at the time of the OED mission brothels in Battambang
     province had been closed for several months even while NCHADS was trying to
     expand the 100% condom use program there. The project, helped to sustain
     government commitment through support for: data collection to document the
     severity of the problem (reducing denial); the 100% condom use pilot project and its
     expansion; capacity among local NGOs,      a constituency that will lobby for AIDS
     activities; and South-South interactions among policymakers and technical staff.

     69       Cambodia's HIV/AIDS strategy focuses scarce capacity on the areas
     where policy and programs can make the biggest difference-(Pisani et al. 2003).
     The MOH strategy has embraced prioritization and sequencing of activities to reflect
     capacity constraints and improve the cost-effectiveness of the response. It recognizes
     that the spread of HIV into the general population and the growing numbers of AIDS
     patients will require new public services and resources in prevention and care.
     However, both the strategy and program implementation have maintained a priority
     on reducing high-risk behavior linked to commercial sex as the engine of the
     epidemic, feeding these other two groups.

     6.10    A strong HIV/AIDS program in the MOH provides the foundation on
     which multisectoral efforts can be built. While action by other key sectors is
     important (many sectors, like the military and police, were already active) and the
     NAA has the respoinsibility for coordinating the multisectoral response, the MOH is
     in a unique position to provide technical expertise and key M&E functions crucial to
     the response of all sectors. Further, the MOH is central in coordinating the response
     of many sub-units responsible for key health interventions - for example, the
     National Blood Transfusion Center (for safe blood), the National Maternal and Child
.    Health Center (for prevention of mother-to-child transmission), hospital services for
     universal precautions, the Central Medical stores for STD and AIDS drug supplies,
     and so forth.

     6.11    Building capacitv of NGOs in project preparation, management, and
     technical skills is a pre-requisite to mobilizing their potential in the fight against
     AIDS, but doesn't ensure relevance, cost-effectiveness, or complementarity with
     government efforts. While many of the NGOs contracted by Khana did develop
     innovative approaches - notably experimentation with models of HBC - there was
     very little consultation with NCHADS, activities were usually not conducted in
     collaboration with provincial authorities, and with the exception of the HBC
     evaluation conducted at the initiative of another donor, none of the NGO activities
     financed by the project were evaluated (nor was there a mechanism or incentives for
     doing so).

     6.12    Tracking HIV prevalence and behavior is necessary but not sufficient for
     monitoring outcomes in a mature epidemic and must be linked with inputs and
     outputs in the context of an evaluation design to credibly attribute outcomes to
     public policy. NCHADS has developed a strong system for monitoring HIV
     prevalence and behavior among high-risk populations that are the target of policy,
     which many countries have failed to do. Yet there are holes in the monitoring system
     and evaluation capacity is nascent. With the exception of a single round of the BSS

                                                                 34


 (in 2000) in a sample of men in the general population, there has never been a
 national survey that would reveal the percentage of the male and female population
 engaging in risk behavior or a series of such surveys that would reveal whether such
behavior has declined. Further, trends in HIV prevalence are not a good guide to
 changes in incidence (the number of new infections) in a country like Cambodia
where AIDS mortality is high. Greater insight into incidence could be gained by
 launching efforts to: (a) measure levels and trends in adult mortality (either through
the vital registration system or periodic population-based surveys) and (b) directly or
indirectly measure incidence by encouraging academic research.


7 0         The Future

71         The follow-on Health Sector Support Project (WB-HSSP, US$3 1.8 million
equivalent) was approved December 19,2002.                        It is funded by an IDA credit of $17.9
million equivalent and two IDA grants of $2.0 million (HIV/AIDS)42                                and $7.8 million
(poorest country grant) plus a $1.84 million DFID grant, with the balance financed by
the Government. The project's objective is to contribute to the improvement of the
health status of the population by increasing the access and quality of health services,
assisting Cambodia to implement its Health Sector Sttiategic                         Plan (2003.2007),         and
strengthening the sector's capacity to manage resources efficiently. Specifically, it
aims to increase utilization of services by the poor, mitigate the effects of infectious
disease epidemics and of malnutrition, improve the health sector's capacity and
performance, and develop quality health services in rural areas. A parallel ADB
project (ADB-HSSP,              $35 million) supports health strengthening activities in other
provinces, including a continuation of contracting health care. The HSSP is part of a
larger action among donors that will eventually lead to a sector-wide approach in
health. Unfortunately, the HSSP did not become effective until August 14,2003,
leaving at least an eight-month funding gap between projects during which time many
of the basic functions supported by the DCHDP ground to a halt. World Bank task
management also changed between project approval and effectiveness.

72         The complexity and scope of the HSSP far exceed that of the DCHDP. The
6IOH and PHDs will manage the HSSP, including civil works; the PCU and PPUs                                       *
from the previous project have been disbanded and the civil works capacity built in the
SFKC will not be u&.43 While it is a laudable objective to transfer management to the
MOH and PHD, the abrupt elimination of the PCU and PPU will likely result in
substantial delays in getting the HSSP up and running.44                      The number of vertical health
programs supported has expanded fi-om three in the DCHDP to five in the HSSP
(nutrition and dengue fever were added). Of the 12 provinces to be supported, only 7


42. The AIDS component will finance STD drugs and nationwide expansion of the 100% Condom Program.

43. Informants generally agreed that the overall performance of SFKC in the civil works component of DCHDP
was satisfactory. No explanation was offered in the HSSP appraisal documents as to why the previous project's
model or other contracting arrangements for civil works were not pursued.

44. The most recent supervision report notes, for example, that none of the civil works are likely to be underway
until early 2005.

                                                    35                            --    -


   participated in the DCHDP (where PHD capacity will replace PPIJs) and the other 5 are
   completely new to World Bank procedures. The number of donors has increased from
   two (WB, ADB) to three (with the addition of DFID), with multiple instrument types
   across and within donor components (grants, loans).

   73 .    Unfortunately, the lessons in dealing with complexity in the face of low
   capacity are not well reflected in the HSSP design. The number of activities is
   greater and prioritization is less evident. While the design does attempt to front-load
   implementation with extensive training in procurement, financial management, and
   planning, the PIP is far from explicit and leaves the detailed specification of activities
   until after effectiveness. For example, the implementation plan for civil works,
.  including the number of facilities of different types to be built and where they will be
   located, is not specified. Likewise, the data collection and management plan was not
   spelled out. The only component to be delegated to others for implementation is the
   dengue fever component, to WHO. Intensive preparatory work and supervision will
   have to take place following effectiveness to compensate for this lack of preparation.

   74      The M&E activities in the Project Appraisal Document and the PIP are
   uhlikely to be adequate for monitoring or evaluating the impact of the project.
   There is an impressive list of indicators, but there is no evaluation plan.

   0 a     The HSSP is relying on the 2002 Final Project Evaluation Survey as the
   baseline. However, the biased sampling frame of that survey and the inadequate series
   of questions on use and access to health care make it unsuitable as a baseline for
   measuring increased access to health care or changes in health outcomes. There is
   supposed to be a final evaluation survey for the HSSP (co-funded by the World Bank
   and ADB), but the experience of the DCHDP risks repeating itself. Care must be
   taken to ensure that the HSSP final survey is comparable in sampling and'content to a
   suitable baseline (such as the 1998 NW, the 2000 CDHS or a new baseline) to
   maintain comparability.

   09      The HSSP indicators are not useful for monitoring outcomes of some of the
   most important activities. For example, the emphasis of the HIV/AIDS program is on
   changing behavior in high-risk groups. Yet the sole proposed outcome measure (the
   infection rate among pregnant women) addresses neither behavior nor high-risk
   groups. There is still no nationwide survey of risk behavior of men and women in the
   general population.

  0  C     The use of other relevant indicators often depends on additional data
   collection, but it isn't clear which surveys will be conducted, when, by whom, and
  how they will be financed. For example, malaria incidence is a key indicator, but to
  date this has only been measured by reported cases in health facilities. The emphasis
  of the malaria program has been on reaching out to communities, and social
  marketing of dipsticks and treatment; a periodic population-based survey would be
  necessary to measure impact and no baseline was collected by the DCHDP. Likewise,
  an accurate measure of the baseline case detection rate for TB was made possible by
  the TB prevalence survey financed by the DCHDP. The PIP does not explain whether

                                                 36                              ,-


a follow-up TB .prevalence    survey will be launched and who will fund it, on the basis
of which a trend in the case detection rate could be established.

Cd)     Finally, the failure to be more explicit in the M&E implementation plan prior
to project approval was a lost opportunity to formally link the results of M&E
activities to project decisions.

75      Based on the experience of the DCHDP, these inadequacies will likely lead to
considerable delay in implementation and efficacy. Early and intense supervision will
be necessary to prioritize activities, identify key partners, and develop a detailed
implementation plan, including a realistic and detailed plan to monitor and evaluate
the project.

  Annex C. Health and HIV/AIDS Indicators from National
  Surveys,         1998-2002

           During the life of the DCHDP, there were at least five national household
  surveys that collected data on health status and health care utilization: Cambodia
  Socioeconomic Survey (CSES) 1997; National Health Survey (NHS) 1998; CSES
  1999; Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDH.S 2000); and the DCHDP
  Final Evaluation Survey 2002. The NHS 1998 was the official "baseline" for the
  DCHDP and the ADB health project and the Final Evaluation Survey 2002 was the
  end survey for both. Thus, in theory, there are many sources of nationally
  representative data on health care utilization and outcomes for Cambodia and it
  should be possible to trace their evolution over the duration of the project.

           However, there were important differences between the three main health
  surveys (NHS 1998, CDHS 2000 and Final Evaluation Survey 2002) that suggest
  caution in interpreting the outcomes as trends (see Table C-l). While the NHS 1998
  and the Final Evaluation Survey 2002 collected data from the same 21 provinces,
  there was a fundamental difference in the sampling frame. The NHS 1998 sampling
  fkne was based on the 1997 listing of areas provided by the Populatiofi Census
  Office in preparation for the 1998 Census, while the Final Evaluation Survey sample
  was drawn fkom a list of villages covered under fully-functioning health centers with

 a minimum package of activities. It stands to reason that people in these villages
 would have systematically better access and health outcomes than those that were not
 yet covered. In contrast, the CDHS 2000 used the master sample of the National
 Institute of Statistics, based on the 1998 Population Census - a sampling frame that is
 much closer to that of the NHS 1998 - but covered all 24 provinces.

          The different sampling frame used by the 2002 Final Evaluation Survey seems
 to have resulted in a sample of women of reproductive age that are systematically older,
 more educated, and more likely to be married than the women in the NHS 1998 and
 CDHS 2000 (Table C-2). It's particularly remarkable that roughly 23 percent of the
 NHS and DHS sample of women were age 15-19, while only 15 percent of the Final
 Evaluation Survey were in this age group. About 3 1 percent of the NHS and CHDS
 samples were never married, compared to 21 percent of those in the Final Evaluation
 Survey. Finally, nearly 22 percent of the women in the Final Evaluation Survey
 attained secondary school or higher, compared with only 17 percent in the other two
 surveys. It is.highly unlikely that these basic characteristics of the Cambodian
 population could change so radically over the two-year period 2000- 2002.

          For these reasons, extreme caution must be taken in interpreting the results of
the three surveys as trends - particularly any comparison between the first two
 surveys and the final survey, which had a different and possibly biased sampling
 frame that would be expected to produce better health outcomes. While trends from
 1998-2000 can be tracked more confidently, project implementation didn't get rolling
until around the time of the mid-term review in late 1999. It would be difficult,
therefore, to attribute any changes between 1998-2000 to the project.

         With these caveats in mind, there appears to have been a slight improvement
in the measles immunization rate between 1998-2000 (from 49.5 to 55.4 percent) and
an even slighter increase in the percentage of women seeking antenatal care (Table C-
3). The Final Evaluation Survey 2002, in contrast, shows dramatically higher
percentages for women seeking antenatal care, deliveries in a medical facility, tetanus
immunization of mothers, and complete child immunization. It also shows much
lower infant and under-five mortality rates. While 2000-2002 was the peak period of
implementation for the DCHDP, it is difficult to know how much of this apparent
increase is due to better access to health care and how much is due to the sampling
fkme of the 2002 survey.

         The Final Evaluation Survey 2002 also shows considerably higher levels of
HIV/AIDS knowledge than the 2000 CDHS on a number of prevention methods -                            .
using condoms (86 percent in 2002,66 percent in 2000),                  avoiding sex with prostitutes
(35 percent in 2002,19 percent in 2000) - and the percent believing that a healthy
person can have AIDS was much higher in 2002 (86 percent versus 63 percent in 2000)
(Table C-4).45  These probably represent a real increase (although the exact magnitude
may be slightly less) and reflect most likely the effort on the 100% condom use
campaign as well as successful social marketing of Number One condoms by PSI.
However, it is interesting to note that respondents in the 2002 survey were much less

45. The I998 NHS failed to collect any data on HIV/AIDS knowledge or sexual behavior.

 likely to cite abstinence, limiting the number of partners, and being faithfilto one
 partner as a means for prevention, compared with the               2000 CDHS.

a. Differences in indicators between 1998 and 2002 would be statistically significant if they were
assumed to be from the same population. However, due to the difference in sampling methodologies
between the two surveys, this may not be a correct assumption. b. Percent of mothers with live births
in the past five years who have been immunized; if multiple births then the most recent birth. c.
Mortality rates are for the five years before the survey. The 2002 mortality rates are being re-
computed. d. The difference between the 1998 NHS and 2000 CDHS mortality rates are not
statistically significant. The CDHS infant and child mortality rates are systematically higher for all
previous periods (O-4 years, 5-9, 10-14, etc.) than the rates for the same periods calculated using the
1998 NHS. However, both surveys suggest an increase in infant and under five mortality indicators
between the early and mid-1990s (NIS et al. 2001, pp. 123-124).

a. Knowledge of ways to prevent HIV/AIDS were solicited through open-ended questions
(unprompted).

b. The question soliciting these answers was identical in the two surveys (an open-ended question in
which the interviewer circles all responses that were mentioned). However, this formulation is very
sensitive to the motivation of the interviewers to continue probing. This may have been a factor in the
seeming huge decline in the percent of respondents mentioning abstinence and fewer sexual partners.

         Dear Ms. Martha Ainsworth,

         First of all we would like to express our sincere thank to the World Bank`s supports
         to Cambodia, especially, for the health sector. We had carefully reviewed the
         OED' s report on the completion of the Cambodia Disease Control and Health
         Development Project Cr. NOO5KH) and agreed that the report provides most
         relevant and correct in1ormation of the Project. We also wish to inform you that
         based on the successful experience in utilizing the Health Management Agreement
         as a tool to manage the project funds and activities at provincial level, this
         experience is now extended to cover activities of all 24 provinces including.

 G-2: COMMENTSFROM NCHADS46

 A. General comments
 NCHADS agrees with the analysis and conclusions of the Report. In particular,
 NCHADS         confirms that:

      Institutional Development Impact has )een high; the successful coordination by
      NCHADS of the recent 4th Round Proposal to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB
      and malaria, for support for the Continuum of Care and introduction of ART,
      valued at $38 million, and including 8 NGOs, is a good example of the
      institutional capability developed in NCHADS.

      Sustainability for NCHADS has been assured: the technical and implementation
      strategies and procedures developed under the project have been further built
     upon to become NCHADS Standard Operating Procedures used in all NCHADS
      activities especially for funds received from ADB, the EU, CDC-GAP, DFID, the
      GFATM and the University of New South Wales-led Research Consortium.
     These now total some $7 million per year. In addition, the actual HIV/AIDS
     related activities initiated at provincial level under the project are being continued
     and extended with this funding for the next five years.

     Bank Performance was quite satisfactory throughout. Indeed, consistent Bank
     support for the development of the NCHADS programme was an important factor
     in its success.

     Lessons for HIV/AIDS Assistance have been clearly established and used to
     strengthen the NCHADS programme as it grows and expands.

B. Specific comments

Para 3.8: At the time of the project ACLEDA did not have branches in all provinces;
some branches have only been opened in 2002. Still not all provinces are covered.

Para 4.7: Note that the NCHADS strategic plans are not NATIONAL strategies:
National Strategies are coordinated by the NAA; NCIIADS                     strategies are health
sector strategies that contribute to overall National Strategies.

Para 4.8: Integrating the HIV/AIDS prograrnrne with basic services has been and
remains a priority. It should noted that at the time of the design of the MPA and CPA
HIV/AIDS activities were still nascent, and unclear, so were by and large not
included. With the formal approval of the Framework for the Continuum of Care for
PLHA in 2003 considerable progress is being made for better integration. However,
STD treatment for the general population has been integrated at health centre level
since the 1998, and is available in 589 HCs.


46 Editorial corrections identified by the borrower that have been corrected in the text have been
omitted to conserve space.

Para 4.8, Box 1:
l  Under the 100% Condom Use programme is that it is mandatory that condoms
    are available in brothels
l   The Programme was externally reviewed by a WHOKJNAIDS            team in 2003.
l   The most recent BSS (2003) indicates the success of the programme in reaching
    sex workers: 48% of brothel-based sex workers visited the public hospital or
   clinic for their last STD; 60% of brothel-based sex workers quote `trainings' (ie
   presumably given as part of the programme) for their main source of information
   about HIV; 43% and 31% of brothel-based sex workers give PA0 staff and ST1
   clinic staff respectively as the source for female groups to receive information
   about HIV/AIDS.

l  The sex worker clinic in Sihanoukville was entirely supported by the EU ST1
   project; all the other 26 clinics are managed by the government and were
   supported by the DCHDP project. From 2001 6 clinics were upgraded and
   supported fkom the ADB project; from 2003 a tirther 12 are being upgraded and
   supported from DFID funds.

Para 4.9: Dr Saphom Vonthanak has conducted a study of incidence among ante-
natal women, using de-tuned Elisa, for his Ph.D thesis at UCLA. This will be
formally disseminated soon.

Para 6.10: While the MoH does coordinate key health interventions, it should be
made clear that the NAA has the responsibility for coordinating the multi-sectoral
response in Cambodia. The MoH contributes, through the NAA Policy and
Technical Boards, to this overall, multi-sectoral, national response.

Para 6.12: In fact the BSS 2000 (BSS IV) was conducted as a household survey
among 3 166 adult males from the general population.

G-3: Comments from SFKC

Ref:   Disease Control and Health Development Project (Credit no.NOOS-KH)

Dear Ms. Martha Ainsworth,

I am pleased to acknowledge receipt your draft report dated March 09,2004 on
project performance assessment report of the Disease Control and Health
Development Project (DCHDP). Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my
profound thankfulness for the information given that the overall performance of
SFKC in the civil works component of DCHDP was satisfied. With referring to page
27, 1st Para, the report indicated that `L . .., where the SFKC relied more heavily on
                                          l

local shopping, reducing competition and raising the costs..    * ", I wish to clarify that
                                                               l
SFKC had strictly familiarized with the procurement procedures and the relevant
threshold for each procurement method mentioned in the credit agreement. I
recognized that in phase II a lot of projects had been procured under local shopping
method. In fact, we had no intention to break down the total sub project cost in the-
same province in small amount to conduct local shopping method. The reasons to
conduct the local shopping are as follows:

 1 . The design of some projects in the same province did not finalize and submit to
SFKC at the same time. In this connection, we were obliged to break down the
whole projects in different parts as the completion of all designed projects could not
provide on time at once.

2 .  The cost of some projects are small and

3 .  Urgent need of those facilities requested by MOH push us to implement the
project with local shopping method.

I am hoping that our above clarification would be met your understanding.

Thanking you and best regards

Chum Bun Rong
General Director
