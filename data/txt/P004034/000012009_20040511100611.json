project outcome, likely sustainability, and\n            high institutional development impacts, in addition to the\n            satisfactory performance ratings by both the Bank and\n            Borrower. Lessons of experience include the following. In\n            the absence of strong capacity, particularly in countries\n            new to Bank lending, projects should include training in\n            Bank procurement, and financial management in the\n            implementation plan, prioritizing a limited number of\n            components, emphasizing on monitoring and evaluation of\n            implementation arrangements, and performance indicators. In\n            addition, a number of lessons lend insight to OED's\n            evaluation of the Bank's HIV/AIDS assistance:\n            Investment in institutional development can have a dramatic\n            impact on the ability of the Government to define, and lead\n            the national AIDS agenda, while promoting government\n            commitment to fight HIV/AIDS and support public health,\n            requires continuing efforts. Cambodia's HIV/AIDS\n            strategy focuses scarce capacity on preventing transmission\n            among high-risk groups; instead, a big difference could be\n            an HIV/AIDS program, that provide the foundation for\n            multisectoral efforts to be built. In turn, building\n            capacity of nongovernmental organizations is critical for\n            resources mobilization, to help track HIV prevalence and\n            behavior, and, monitor epidemic outcomes linked with inputs\n            and outputs to establish plausible causality."}, "docdt": "2004-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
