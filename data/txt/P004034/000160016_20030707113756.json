The overall\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. These  were some of the lessons learned. 1)\n            Political commitment is critical: Cambodia's health\n            system was in a serious disarray caused by war, political\n            turmoil, poverty and a very low capacity to manage important\n            program. Despite all these handicaps, the country was\n            successful in achieving the ambitious development objectives\n            set in the project. 2) External technical assistance is\n            important but can not solve all problems: The high inputs of\n            external assistance, were not enough to tackle the\n            shortcomings in finance and procurement areas. In the end\n            trial and error and experience helped, including the\n            out-sourcing of civil works procurement to the Social Fund\n            of Cambodia (SFKC) and the decentralization of financial\n            management to fit the country's circumstances. 3) Well\n            intentioned plans are not enough; implementation capacity\n            and willingness to share authority are equally important:\n            Although the health management agreements (HMAs) were a\n            well-intentioned project component, and have a great\n            potential in future, they underperformed because the\n            capacity to understand and implement the HMA system simply\n            did not exist at the provincial (and lower) level and\n            inadequate involvement of lower levels of staff in the\n            planning process. In many cases, the decisions regarding\n            goals and outputs were set at the top levels, although the\n            involvement of all stakeholders was a key requirement. 4)\n            Under-paid staff and high turnover hurt: Cambodia's\n            systemic problem of under-paying staff and high turnover of\n            staff, a consequent of low pay, inevitably affected project\n            implementation. 5) the final survey was not complete and on\n            time and was not validated for comparison with the baseline\n            survey and to use in this report. Completion of that survey\n            and the addition of a final impact evaluation survey could\n            have yielded valuable lessons. 6) Successful donor\n            coordination greatly helps: In this project, project\n            coordination units became the foundation for effective donor\n            cooperation as it managed two health projects one each\n            financed by the Bank and ADB and costs for a number of\n            activities were shared between the Bank and ADB. This was\n            cost-effective and mutually beneficial."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
