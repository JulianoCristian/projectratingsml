THE KOSOVO\n            FARM RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was highly satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional Development\n            impact was substantial, the Bank performance was Highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned learnt during the project: as demonstrated\n            through the implementation of the Emergency Farm\n            Reconstruction Project (EFRP), Food and Agriculture\n            Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and in particular\n            FAO's Special Relief Operations Service - can be an\n            effective service provider in a post-conflict situation.\n            Previously agreed understandings on fiduciary arrangements\n            (harmonization) between the Bank and UN Agencies (that would\n            also encompass handling of post-conflict situations) would\n            tremendously facilitate the task of formulating and\n            implementing post-conflict projects. Strong implementation\n            and supervision presence throughout program execution is\n            necessary, in order to identify problems at an early stage\n            to allow for immediate and appropriate action. A well\n            functioning monitoring and up-to-date data management system\n            is crucial in this respect. The incorporation of lessons\n            learned from earlier emergency operations (in particular,\n            Bosnia) strongly improved the design of the project and it\n            was evident during project implementation. Thorough design,\n            especially of targeting and monitoring, is important for\n            good emergency operations. Timely follow-up activities\n            should be planned to turn successful emergency measures into\n            sustained development. The establishment of institutions,\n            like the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL), is\n            very challenging in a post-conflict environment. Capacity\n            building can work. It requires time and commitment to both\n            in-country training (including on administrative procedures)\n            and overseeing study tours and training courses. Targeted\n            beneficiary selection in a post-conflict environment can\n            work very successfully. Strong involvement of local\n            institutions and communication of the process are key. The\n            carefully chosen beneficiary selection process and its\n            successful implementation show that using a democratic\n            process to select beneficiaries and to use beneficiary\n            pressure to ensure compliance with project goals can be\n            effective. More flexibility on the procurement in the\n            machinery component might have resulted in more impact of\n            the component. The cost recovery program for new machinery\n            was well-designed and provides a good example for future\n            projects. Participation, involvement and cooperation with\n            counterparts were critical for capacity building."}, "docdt": "2003-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
