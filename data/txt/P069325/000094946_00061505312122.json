aims at helping jumpstart agricultural production\n            over the next two to three cropping seasons and to support\n            re-launching of the rural economy by investing in key farm\n            assets (cattle and farm mechanization) and key agricultural\n            services (veterinary services, and policy analysis and\n            formulation capacity). The project has five components: 1)\n            The first component will provide support to re-establishing\n            the national cattle herd through the procurement of 2,300\n            cattle. 2) Rehabilitation of veterinary services will be\n            implemented through the United Nations Food and Agriculture\n            Organization (FAO) Project Management Team. Private\n            veterinarians will be supported in equipment and drugs, and\n            the support to public veterinary services will include the\n            establishment of central and regional veterinary diagnostic\n            laboratories, as well as a facility to ensure artificial\n            insemination services. 3) Farm machinery repair and\n            replacement will help rebuild the power capacity for\n            agricultural production through a tractor repair program and\n            the distribution of new equipment. 4) Agriculture policy\n            capacity building will support the technical assistance of\n            the Department of Agriculture in agriculture trade polices,\n            and preparation for investments in irrigation rehabilitation\n            in the near term. 5) Project management will support a team\n            made up of local and international staff and will work\n            closely with non-governmental organizations."}, "docdt": "2000-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
