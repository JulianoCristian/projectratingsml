3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The overall project objective was to help "jumpstart" agricultural production over the two or three cropping
seasons following the conflict, and re-launch the rural economy by investing in key farm assets such as
livestock and agricultural machinery, and key services such as veterinary services and policy analysis and
formulation capacity. The project also aimed to support vulnerable households in targeted villages in
selected municipalities where damage was particularly severe. It should be noted that the project objectives
were conceived primarily in the context of an emergency situation, although the longer-term development
goals of improving services were also included.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The project's original objectives remained unchanged. The project's scope was expanded as more funding
became available over the course of the project.

3.3 Original Components:

The project had five original components: (i) Support to re-establish cattle herds; (ii) Rehabilitation of
veterinary services; (iii) Farm machinery repair and replacement; (iv) Capacity building support to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development; and (v) Project management.

Given the supplemental financing (in the amount of US$4.1 million) which became available in FY01, as
well as additional donor trust fund resources, the project scope was expanded to three additional
municipalities (Swedish Trust funds in the amount of 10 million Swedish Kronas, Italian Trust Funds in
the amount of US$1.37 million - the Government of the Netherlands contributed US$1.8 million in the
initial phase of the project). The project, therefore, covered six municipalities (compared to three as
originally envisaged) under the first two components and expanded capacity building activities.

Component I - Support to Re-establish the Cattle Herds. Under the initial phase, and to assist with the
restoration of food security of vulnerable farm families in the rebuilding of the cattle herds, the project
financed the purchase of 4,399 heifers and 92 bulls (this compares with a cattle loss of some 200,000
animals). Animals were distributed to families who had lost all their cattle during the conflict and had
experience in caring for livestock within six municipalities with the highest incidence of agriculture
damages (Skenderaj/Srbica, Gllogoc/Glogovac, Decan/Decane, Kline/Klina, Vushtrri/Vucitrn, and
Peje/Peja). Recipient farm families were provided with after-delivery services (veterinary services, feed
concentrate, artificial insemination) to ensure proper care of animals.

Component II - Rehabilitation of Veterinary Services. To rapidly restore critical animal health services in
Kosovo, the project provided basic kits of veterinary equipment to de facto private veterinarians throughout
Kosovo operating out of municipal veterinary stations. On the side of public veterinary services, the project
equipped a central diagnostic laboratory and rehabilitated some three regional public animal heath centers.
The project also provided equipment to support artificial insemination services.

Component III - Farm Machinery Repair and Replacement. Roughly 50 percent of tractors were lost or
damaged throughout the province. Under the initial phase, repairs of more lightly damaged tractors (a total
of 2,414) and combine harvesters were carried out in 13 municipalities. Some 202 new tractors were
provided in the six previously specified municipalities, as were critical farm implements (ploughs, harrows,



                                                       - 2 -

etc.) to ensure land cultivation in villages where critical tractor deficits persisted (taking into account
potential repairs provided).

Capacity Building Support. To support the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) in analyzing and formulating a broad range of agriculture policy issues and responses, the
project provided international and national expertise intended to work within the UNMIK structures in the
newly established Agricultural Department of the Joint Interim Administration. The Department of
Agriculture was transformed into the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development during
project implementation. Therefore, the capacity building also benefited the Ministry's staff. These
institution building activities established key capacities in collecting and maintaining agriculture statistics
and databases. The Ministry moved into newly renovated premises which made the planned refurbishment
obsolete. The funds for refurbishment were used for further capacity building.

Project Management. Implementing the above activities in the current environment in Kosovo to
acceptable technical and fiduciary standards posed considerable management challenges. To meet these
challenges, a Project Management Team (PMT) made up of a blend of local and international staff was
established and placed under the umbrella of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Emergency
Coordination Unit in Pristina. The PMT was supported by technical expertise, and implemented activities
in close collaboration with selected international and local NGOs.

3.4 Revised Components:
See above.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

In June 1999, UN Resolution No. 1244 took effect in Kosovo, bringing to an end the intense and violent
conflict that erupted in Spring 1999. This conflict led to a high share of refugees and internally displayed
persons, as well as massive physical destruction including the agricultural sector. A severe post-conflict
situation reigned in Summer 1999, marked by food insecurity, a lost cropping season, destroyed housing,
and lost jobs. UN Resolution No. 1244 also led to fundamental political and economic changes. Political
and administrative authority was vested with the United Nations through UNMIK. Besides UNMIK,
multiple other UN agencies were represented in Kosovo (UNHCR, FAO, WFP and others).

In early July 1999, the first Bank agriculture team visited Kosovo together with colleagues from the
FAO/CP to undertake rapid appraisal of the agriculture sector, launch a survey-based agriculture damage
assessment, and identify a post-conflict operation in support of the agricultural sector. The Bank
agriculture team, together with FAO/CP colleagues, returned to Kosovo during Summer and Fall 1999 and
Spring 2000 on a regular basis. The outcome was an agriculture damage assessment report as well as a
medium term strategy for the rural sector, thereby providing UNMIK and the donor community with a
basis with which to guide reconstruction support in the agricultural and rural sector. The farm damage
assessment carried out by FAO and the World Bank indicated that eight municipalities in the western part
of Kosovo were the worst affected, namely Skenderaj, Gllogoc, Decan, Vushtrri, Kline, Peje, Istog and
Gjakove. In some of these areas, agricultural production was reduced to almost zero. Other than housing
reconstruction, rural households identified their main priority needs as purchasing cattle and tractors.

Parallel to the analytical work undertaken, the Bank agriculture team prepared the Emergency Farm
Reconstruction Project (EFRP, which is the subject of this ICR). The project design, which was broadly
completed within some nine weeks (though additional detailed preparation was further required) aimed to
provide reconstruction assistance at the farm level in the short term, on the one hand, as well as



                                                      - 3 -

developmental support to a destroyed veterinary service and nascent Ministry of Agriculture in the medium
term, on the other hand. While project design, based on previous experience in the region (Croatia, Bosnia)
was completed relatively quickly, developing effective institutional arrangements to implement the EFRP
became a major challenge. As such, implementation was initiated fully only in September 2000, thereby
losing the opportunity to provide support during the Spring 2000 crop season as originally envisaged
(though many of the specific implementation arrangements were much better prepared by that time
compared to early 2000).

The conflict in Kosovo between March and June 1999 resulted in some 75 percent of the rural population
out of about 1.1 million people abandoning their homes, including 43 percent who took refuge abroad.
Farm assets were severely decimated by the systematic destruction of rural housing and farm buildings, the
loss or damage to 74 percent of the 1,800 combines and 55 percent of the 57,700 tractors present before
the war, and the loss of 54 percent of the cattle and 65 percent of sheep. However, by September 1999,
some 85 percent of the families had returned to their village despite the loss of their homes and assets,
though the 1999 winter wheat harvest was only 45 percent of normal levels and the spring cropping season
was largely foregone. Accordingly, large-scale relief aid and food imports were required to meet the
demands of the returning population.

The selection of the municipalities eligible for cattle distribution was conducted, in accordance with
UNMIK, on the basis of following selection criteria: (i) damages to private houses; (ii) the percentage of
cattle loss; and (iii) the percentage of tractor loss. The distribution of cattle was directed to those areas
where the deficit in terms of livestock was such that the population was considered food insecure. Eight
municipalities were identified as priorities in terms of vulnerability in rural areas, of which six were
covered under the project. Emphasis was placed on service delivery through the private sector. Contracts
were made with selected private veterinarians for follow up of the distributed cattle on matters relating to
animal health and re-breeding. Veterinary service assistance was implemented province-wide.

The project was well designed for the emergency situation at the time, in particular by: (a) contracting
existing NGOs active in the area; (b) developing feasible cost recovery mechanisms; (c) establishing clear
criteria for selection of beneficiaries; and (d) supporting private sector machinery repair shops. In addition,
clear operational procedures were laid out during the design phase for the component as a whole, including
beneficiary selection, cost recovery and monitoring procedures.

The project tractor repair sub-component was designed in the context of an overall international program to
repair farm machinery. A comprehensive damage assessment had already been carried out throughout
Kosovo, and several donor and NGO programs were also underway or had been completed. Accordingly,
the project selected municipalities such as Prizren, Rahovec and Gjakove where no other emergency tractor
repair programs were being implemented but where there was still demonstrable need. In addition, the
project elected to sub-contract the repair programs to NGOs that already had successful experience in
Kosovo and to use their proven methodologies and procedures. Although the repair of combine harvesters
was initially included in the sub-component, it was concluded by the NGOs and the IMS before
implementation started that, based on previous experience, this aspect should not be a priority. As a result,
the sub-component focused only on tractor repair.

The use of vouchers for tractor spare parts and repair services was included in the project design, and was
considered for the purchase of new equipment and farm machinery. However, it was concluded that new
equipment should be purchased through an international bidding process, because there was only very
limited experience with vouchers in a post-conflict situation, and there was no guarantee that the equipment
would be available at a competitive price in the local market within Kosovo. As was found during

implementation, some of the equipment packages were not fully utilized, and in retrospect, the impact may
have been greater if a system of vouchers had been utilized to allow the beneficiaries to select their own
equipment package.

Major consideration was given in selecting the machinery package in order to ensure that the beneficiaries
could carry out their land cultivation obligations for cost recovery purposes, and could not justify poor cost
recovery performance by claiming that they had no suitable implements.

As a lesson learned from other agriculture emergency operations, strong monitoring was built in the project
design. This allowed for immediate feedback and attention to problems and assured adherence to the cost
recovery mechanisms. It also played a key role in capacity building and communicating of project results.

Service delivery through the private sector was emphasized in the project design. Both the tractor repair
and after-sales services for the new tractors and equipment were to be undertaken by local repair shops and
spare part dealers, and the implied intent was to assist in the establishment of private agricultural support
services.

Priority areas foreseen (during the formulation phase) to be supported by technical assistance under the
CBC, based on a needs assessment, included, inter alia: (i) agricultural trade policies; (ii) measures
required to pave the way for investments in irrigation rehabilitation in the near term; (iii) measures required
to enable autonomous farm associations to thrive, and; (iv) measures required to permit the development of
micro-finance, and probably, commercial non-bank credit. Also, collection and compiling of a sound
agricultural database based on surveys and other information collection efforts undertaken by different
donors was considered.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The project fully achieved its development objectives and managed to enlarge its scope. It is therefore rated
highly satisfactory. The scope could be broadened as (i) additional funding became available and
(ii) decreasing prices for cattle allowed for more animals to be purchased. However, the project also
succeeded in addressing additional related issues as needed during the project implementation. This not only
allowed for expansion of the project area activities -- from three targeted municipalities to six -- but also
enabled the project to do additional work on capacity building and allowed expansion of the activities under
the veterinary component.

The project can be divided into three phases:
l Phase 1 -- starting August 2000          -- World Bank funding and Dutch Trust Funds; and
                                           -- Swedish Trust Funds (starting January 2001)
l Phase 2 -- starting July 2001            -- World Bank supplemental funding
l Phase 3 -- starting December 2001        -- Italian Trust Fund

The phased implementation resulted in the project, originally designed for a period of 18 months, being
extended to 3 years. The phasing of project activities proved valuable in some ways as it allowed constant
improvements of the component details. A well designed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was
essential to immediately feed back project data, leading to further improvements and attention to
implementation details. The following table compares the originally set targets with the achievements of
the project:

Shortly after the conflict, the immediate benefit of cattle distribution was the improved food security
(through milk) for impoverished farmers (households), while generating income from sales of milk and
meat would be a benefit which developed over time. In addition, by distributing these improved breeds, the
project stimulated the modernization of the livestock sector in Kosovo. Improved animal husbandry
techniques, feeding and veterinary care were introduced by the project which resulted in higher milk and
meat production. The larger impact of this project component lies, therefore, in revitalizing and upgrading
dairy cattle keeping, showing new opportunities, and stimulating farmers to expand livestock production.

Of the 4,399 pregnant heifers which were distributed by the project, to date 4,188 are alive and productive
(milk and off-spring). A total of 3,660 animals (83.2 percent) are still at the farm of the beneficiary and
480 (10.9 percent) cows are at other farms. Of a total 4,326 calves born, 3,793 are alive. A total of 3,198
(73.9 percent) are at the farm of birth, and 595 (11.4 percent) are at other farms. The last figure includes
calves given to other needy families. The importation of 4,399 heifers and 92 bulls, which started in
November 2000, grew till present to a herd of over 9,000 animals. The distributed project bulls contributed
considerably to upgrading the national herd. Annual services per bull reportedly range between 85 and 100
cows. Subtracting about 20 of percent services for project heifers, on average 6,000 local cows were served
annually. This number is expected to further increase when farmers keep bulls (pedigree), born from the
imported pregnant heifers, for breeding purposes.

The veterinary component provided province-wide clinical veterinary services, revitalized artificial
insemination (AI) services in Kosovo and introduced AI in rural areas, exposed the veterinary profession to
modern veterinary techniques and treatments, stimulated the development of private veterinary praxis and
input supply, provided support to CVDL which resulted in the development of a crucial public service to
the livestock sector, and provided support to AI/BC, which resulted in the development of a comprehensive
breeding policy. The main impact of this component lies in its improvement and activation of private and
public veterinary services for the development of the emerging livestock sector.

The requirement for a competent laboratory to support diagnoses of veterinary practitioners and assist with
the control of major diseases was confirmed at the onset of the project. Contrary to original planning, it was
concluded that one central veterinary laboratory in Pristina would be sufficient to meet the needs of the
province. The main role of the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL) is two-fold: (a) to
support the individual livestock owner through accurate diagnosis of livestock disease problems, and (b) to
support the livestock industry as a whole through diagnosis and constant surveillance of economically
important diseases, especially those in the Lists A and B of the OIE. The laboratory is expected to provide



                                                      - 6 -

essential service in the diagnosis and control of zoonotic infections that spread from livestock to humans.
The laboratory would also contribute significantly to the early detection of exotic diseases and the
maintenance of high standards of food hygiene, as well as the importation and exportation of quality
livestock.

Over 6,000 recipients benefited from a total of 202 tractors and implement sets provided to 176 villages,
which resulted in an overall reduction in the tractor deficits and assurance of cultivation for most needy
areas over two years and achieved an increase in land area cultivated and improved yield levels. The
machinery repair activities were able to reach a broad clientele in a large number of municipalities
attributing to the ability to improve agricultural production.

The capacity component facilitated MAFRD's formulation of an agricultural development strategy and
created strong ownership within the Ministry. It kick-started the policy discussions of the agricultural
sector and allowed the drafting and approval of legislative pieces.

The majority of households that benefited from the project stressed the importance of the project in meeting
their food security needs.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Component I: Re-establishing the Cattle Herd

This component is rated highly satisfactory. A total of 4,399 pregnant heifers and 92 bulls have been
distributed to selected beneficiaries. Distribution took place in six municipalities during three project
phases. A summary of the status of the distributed heifers is shown in Table 4.2.

contributes 0.6 percent. About 83 percent of the originally distributed cows remain at the beneficiary
farms. Around 10 percent have been given, exchanged or sold by the beneficiary to other households as
they faced difficulties to care for the animal or procurement of other life priorities such as construction
materials was given preference. In a few cases birth problems or disappointing milk production were
reasons to sell the cow. In most cases a local cow was procured instead.

A considerable number of cows from the first distribution have already given birth to their second calf and
are pregnant with a third (while their first calves, if female, are also pregnant again or have given birth to
their first calf). Also the second distribution heifers gave birth and most of them are in calf again or gave
birth while the third distribution animals delivered deliver their first calf. A summary of calves born and
rebreeding results is presented in Table 4.3.

Rebreeding results show that despite difficult conditions for rebreeding, relatively high pregnancy
percentages were realized. The confirmed pregnancy rate of the 4,140 cows still alive from the three
distributions was 73.8 percent in April 2003. As inseminations for third phase cows only started from
October 2002, the presently incoming pregnancy confirmations are expected to further improve results.
Forty five percent of cows were inseminated through AI in the first phase. Many farmers prefer natural
service by bulls especially farmers living in remote areas. In minority areas 72 percent of all confirmed

pregnancies resulted from AI ­ probably due to restricted movement in these municipalities. The average
calving interval is 14.7 months varying from 14.6 to 14.8 months in the minority areas. The calving
interval of Brown Swiss cows tended to be longer with 15.6 months than for Simmental with an average of
14.3 months. The daily average milk production of the cows is on average 12.5 litres.

Component II: Rehabilitation of Veterinary Services

This component is rated satisfactory.

Rehabilitating private veterinary practices. 106 private veterinarians across Kosovo (of which one fifth
are from minority areas) received equipment and/or drugs through the project and serviced farmers for free
as a cost recovery mechanism. AI training was provided to all veterinarians. A final AI training was
provided to minority area veterinarians in May 2003 who subsequently received the remaining project
semen (procured mostly in the first phase), and storage containers.

Training of private veterinarians and technicians. In the course of the project various training courses
have been offered by the project to private veterinarians and technicians. Training was provided by the
national livestock and veterinary specialists as well as through courses by international specialists. Subjects
covered included: (i) large ruminant reproduction; (ii) artificial insemination; (iii) large ruminant nutrition;
(iv) calf rearing; and (v) various subjects. In total nine training sessions were organized with two in
minority areas. Sixty five veterinarians and 63 veterinary technicians took part. The subjects taught appear
to be well chosen and in line with demands from the practitioners.

Artificial Insemination. With the support of EFRP, AI has been re-activated in Kosovo and introduced
with increasing success to smallholders in its rural areas. In the pre-conflict situation, AI was
predominantly used at large-scale state enterprises. To bring AI to smallholders was something new.
Hence, training of inseminators (veterinarians/technicians) and extension to farmers became a major
challenge for the project. AI equipment, semen and liquid nitrogen was made available at the start of the
project.

Semen and equipment. As an emergency relief the EFRP provided AI training and equipment to all
Kosovo veterinarians. The project imported in total 41,520 doses of bovine semen including Simmental
(20,863 doses [50 percent]), Brown Swiss (13,892 doses [33.5 percent]), Grauvieh (900 doses [2.5
percent]) Holstein Friesian (4,395 doses [10.5 percent]) and Jersey (1,470 doses [3.5 percent]).

AI / Breeding Center. In close collaboration with MAFRD, a comprehensive Kosovo Breeding Policy for
Cattle, Sheep, Goats, Pigs, Horses, Chicken, Buffalo and Dogs has been developed. In addition, an outline
of the functions and role of the Animal Production Department within MAFRD was discussed. Inclusion of
breeding data in the Animal Identification and Registration system, which is presently established by KVS,
has been secured.

Component III: Machinery Repair and Replacement

This component is rated highly satisfactory.

Machinery Repair Program. Three machinery repair programs were completed by the project. The
implementation of these programs was sub-contracted to two international NGOs, GOAL and World
Vision International. A summary of the programs is shown in Table 4.4. The direct tractor repair cost, not

including the NGO overhead costs, was around US$1.65 million, corresponding to an average of around
US$685 per tractor. This cost represents about 10 percent of the cost of an equivalent new locally
produced tractor. However, the repair costs varied substantially according to the level of damages of the
tractor to be repaired. The average repair costs were US$457 for category 1, US$962 for category 2, and
US$2,057 for category 3 cases. The direct tractor repair cost averaged about 79 percent of the total cost of
the tractor repair program. In total, around 2,414 tractors were repaired in 13 municipalities. The total
number of tractors repaired was about 50 percent higher than the number of 1,600 projected at appraisal.
In addition, it represents a substantial proportion of the tractors in the municipalities that were possible to
repair at a reasonable cost. For example, around 815 tractors were repaired in Gllogoc, Skenderaj and

Component IV: Capacity Building

The component is rated satisfactory. The component had a positive impact on the capacity of the MAFRD.
At the end of the project, clearly technical and administrative skills of the Ministry staff improved,
information management improved, as did the capacity to articulate issues and solutions. All CBC
activities were jointly realized by international and local experts and counterparts in the MAFRD.

Institutional development of the MAFRD was provided through the strengthening the day-to-day functions
of the MAFRD. On-the-job training and advice was provided by international and local experts, as well as
public administration, information management, communication consultancies, and training in English and
computer skills. For the improvement of the capacity of the MAFRD to formulate and implement specific
agricultural and rural development policies, eight major, specific studies and policies to support the future
development of agriculture were completed: (i) veterinary border control; (ii) phytosanitary border control;
(iii) water resources and irrigation; (iv) producers' associations; (v) agro-chemicals; (vi) fertilizers; (vii)
macro-economic study; and (viii) agricultural and rural services. All studies have been realized jointly
between the CBC experts and the respective counterparts, and were considered as very good on-the-job
training by the latter.

The CBC supported the initiative of the MAFRD to formulate an Agricultural Development Strategy
Document (Green Book) through facilitation and coordination of the work of the Ministry staff, information
gathering and analysis, and moderation of group meeting discussions and workshops. The document is
considered as the mission statement of MAFRD. The studies, consultancies, major findings,
recommendations, agricultural strategy and policy options proposed by different CBC experts also
constituted a good and reliable basis for this document. Several working groups were created in the
MAFRD, to cover different sub-sector and major cross-cutting issues. A short training session was
provided to the working groups by the CBC experts in how to set sub-sector short-, medium- and long-term
objectives.

To enhance the capacity of selected Ministry staff to analyze sub-sectors and formulate supporting policies,
two major sub-sector studies (dairy and horticulture) were undertaken in view of the importance of these
sub-sectors for the rural economy. Both studies provide a good overview regarding production, collection
and processing, and marketing issues. They raise key issues related to the institutional development of the
sub-sectors, and propose rather comprehensive technical and policy measures for the development of the
sub-sectors. Strong involvement of local experts and counterparts, especially in the first stages, and large
field investigations were assured.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

NPV = US$21.8 million; ERR = 32.2% (see Annex 3)

The economic analysis is based on the analysis that was conducted during the preparation stage, but relies
on the actual project data for the calculation. The data was derived from the project monitoring data base
as well as the final project evaluation survey. Beneficiary numbers and project activities differ from the
original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) figures as the project managed to target more municipalities
and beneficiaries than originally anticipated in the project design. The scope of the first two project
components was widened to six municipalities.

Project activities in the six municipalities (including province-wide rehabilitation of veterinary services, and
capacity building of the Agriculture Department) benefited an estimated 23,000 families (over 10,000 more
than originally anticipated). Around 13,000 households directly benefited as primary or secondary
beneficiaries from the cattle restocking and farm mechanization activities. Around 10,000 households
benefited from the improved veterinary services.

The economic analysis focuses on the benefits and costs associated with: (a) increased crop production
through the supply of new machinery and the repair of broken machinery, and (b) milk production and
production of offspring. However, there are more benefits of the project that have not been included in the
analysis as they are either very limited in scope or challenging to quantify. For example, these benefits
include activities under the veterinary component, the capacity building component and the conduction of
community services as part of the cost recovery scheme under the machinery component. In the following,
the assumptions for the cost-benefit analysis are presented. The calculations are based on realized

quantities and prices within the project implementation period. The ex-post analysis confirms and exceeds
the assumptions made at the beginning of the project.

Details of Economic Analysis

Machinery Component:

    l The replaced assets resulted in a one-time, incremental 10,100 hectare being cultivated annually
          (50 ha per tractor per year).
    l Under the machinery repair component, 2,414 tractors were repaired in three municipalities,
          resulting in around 12,000 hectare additional area cultivated annually (5 ha per tractor).
    l The calculation assumes that the additional area was planted with winter and summer grains. The
          average wheat yield was 2.6 tons per hectare, at a price of US$130 per ton. The price represents
          the average world market price for 2002.
    l The production costs (including farm inputs, fuel and routine machinery maintenance, and labor)
          for grain have been assumed at 90 percent of the production value.

Livestock Component:

    l The livestock component provided direct benefits to 4,409 farm households who lost all their
          cattle. The component had two benefits: (i) the increased availability of milk, and (ii) the cow and
          her offspring. The increased availability of milk directly improved the diet of more vulnerable
          households. The cow and calf enabled households, which would have otherwise been unable, to
          restart livestock production. Access milk, when marketed, created an additional income source for
          the family, often secured by the female household members.
    l The reproductive rate of a cow was on average 1.4. The mortality rate was very low at 5 percent.
          Around 95 percent of the cows reproduced.
    l Fifty percent of the off-spring are female. The female calves gave birth to their first calf and
          provided milk when they turned around 20 months old. Male calves are sold when they turn
          around 4 to 6 months old, at an average price of US$400. Female calves, in the large majority, are
          kept for rebreeding and building up of the cattle herd.
    l The cows are assumed to produce 2,600 liters of milk on average per year (12 liters per day for
          300 days). The economic value of milk is around US$0.25 per liter.
    l The off-spring consumes 800 liters per calf annually (8 liters over 100 days). Besides rooming on
          pasture (no economic costs have been imputed), the cows are also fed with hay and concentrate
          (US$285 annually).
    l The investment costs include: (i) the cost of the farm machinery repairs and replacements; (ii)
          providing livestock; and (iii) rehabilitating and providing veterinary services in three
          municipalities (US$10.9 million)

4.4 Financial rate of return:

Given the emergency nature of this operation and the unavailability of reliable data at the project design
stage, no quantitative financial analysis was conducted. Cost recovery levels for farm mechanization and
veterinary services were established and are discussed in Annex 3.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact is rated substantial, and has manifested in a number of ways and on
various levels:



                                                      - 13 -

l The beneficiary selection process introduced a transparent and democratic selection process on the
    village level which was, after initial resistance, widely accepted and proved to built agreement on the
    selection process.
l The training provided to farmers and veterinarians increased their capacity to deal with occurring
    problems and strengthened linkages between the various players.
l The provision of improved breeds resulted in the discussion about and, in one case, establishment of a
    private breeding society.
l The public sector role in veterinary diagnostics has been strengthened and a clear distinction between
    public and private responsibilities established which now can be built on
l The MAFRD's capacity has been strengthened and a sector strategy put in place which is fully owned
    by the Ministry and now can be built upon.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
In late 1999 and early 2000, Kosovo proved to be an institutionally challenging environment to implement
operations. At that time, UNMIK had neither the policy and investment formulation nor the project
implementation capacity in the agriculture and rural sector. In contrast, FAO had taken the lead in terms of
establishing an Emergency Coordination Unit in Pristina, which besides providing emergency agriculture
relief assistance on its own account, also aimed to coordinate the numerous efforts of a large number of
NGOs, many of which had established offices in Pristina immediately at the end of the conflict. FAO also
coordinated with the World Food Program (WFP) in charge of food aid to the country, and advised
UNMIK on agriculture and rural development questions. While consulted, Kosovars (Albanian, Serbian or
otherwise) had few, if any, opportunities to take formal decisions on project design. Ensuring timely donor
support for this operation also proved challenging with contributions coming in at different stages of
implementation, and overall falling short of the resources envisaged.

Given the absence of any agriculture implementation capacity within UNMIK, as well as strong presence
on the part of FAO in Kosovo at the time, the Bank approved ­ on a sole source basis -- FAO to implement
this operation on behalf of UNMIK which was the recipient of funds. While all parties (i.e. UNMIK, FAO
and the Bank, and donors who cofinanced the EFRP through the Bank) in principle agreed to this
arrangement (as well as to the broad project design) in early winter 2000, turning this arrangement into a
formal agreement proved to be a near irreconcilable undertaking. A battery of fiduciary issues ­ ranging
from procurement (whose rules apply?) over financial management (selection of project auditor, access to
financial records, flow of funds and others) ­ required some five months to discuss and agree in the course
of spring 2000. Earlier formal understandings reached between the UN and the Bank on UN agencies
providing TA services did not prove to hold or be relevant to the case at hand. The precedent setting nature
of the topics to be addressed required continued bilateral, as well as tripartite negotiations, including
passing through multiple clearance processes at the respective institutions.

As a result, the first set of agreements (Grant Agreement between the World Bank and UNMIK; and
Service Agreement between UNMIK and FAO) were signed in April 2000 providing resources for detailed
project preparation. Agreements (including the Bank and the Netherlands) in support of a first round of
funding became effective on August 15, 2000. Negotiations of these agreements led to delays in
implementation (deferring support to the spring 2000 cropping season), nevertheless, the time was used to
improve project preparation in terms of finalizing procurement packages (technical specifications), hiring
of NGOs to assist with implementation services, developing and carrying out a two-stage beneficiary

selection process, and establishing detailed project monitoring arrangements. Subsequently, agreements
were signed with Sweden (became effective on June 25, 2001) and Italy (became effective on January 9,
2002). Supplemental financing became effective on September 25, 2001.

Project team. The project was able to attract highly qualified and dedicated local and international staff to
implement the livestock and veterinary components. Excellent professional cooperation among members of
the livestock and veterinary team and project management contributed considerably to the success of the
project.

Monitoring. A comprehensive project monitoring system was set up. Project staff was fully involved in
closely monitoring the status of the various project components. At the village level this was realized in
close collaboration with municipal livestock technicians (MLTs) contracted through NGOs. Livestock and
veterinary component data were entered in a database. This well functioning monitoring system and
database contributed substantially to smooth project implementation and early detection of problems.

Cooperation with NGOs. Implementation of the project was carried out with assistance from NGOs.
Although some difference in quality of supervision and commitment of MLTs existed, cooperation with
NGOs was in general satisfactory.

Breeds supplied. In its three phases, the project supplied Simmental, Brown Swiss and Grauvieh cattle.
From the breeds supplied it appears that the Brown Swiss cows faced more challenges than the others in
the smallholder environment. Not all beneficiaries were able to provide the same level of care to the
animals. For this reason, Brown Swiss animals were no longer included in the second and third round of
distributions.

Component II: Rehabilitation of Veterinary Services

Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL). The institutional problems related to the CVDL, as
mentioned earlier, considerably slowed down the activities of the CVDL. However, the laboratory slowly
is picking up its activity. The CVDL is expected to fulfill its objectives over the coming years.

Veterinary training. Training of veterinary practitioners appears in general to have been appropriate.
However additional practical training would have been appreciated by the practitioners and was originally
foreseen in the TOR for the international specialist. However, some of the provided courses were rather
theoretical and the practical training manuals were not prepared as envisaged. Training was originally
meant for practitioners on subjects such as disease identification and reporting, as well as sample collection
and handling in relation to the CVDL.

Component III: Farm Machinery Repair and Replacement

Procurement and contract delays. Various delays in contracting NGOs and in procurement of equipment
meant that, for all three phases of the new machinery sub-component the equipment was distributed after
the optimum date for the start of the cultivation season. In the first and second phases, the late arrival of



                                                     - 15 -

the equipment meant that essentially the autumn cultivation season was lost. This could have potentially
been avoided.

Machinery breakages and after-sales service. As indicated, there were a number of problems that
occurred with the new machinery, particularly the breakage of a high proportion of the spring-tooth
harrows provided during the second and third phases. However, most were repaired with a simple welding
operation, and it was concluded that the breakages did not generally result in a reduction in the area
harrowed. Limitations in the after-sales service posed continual problems throughout the implementation
phase, and required substantial effort on the part of the PMT to solve. Nevertheless, from survey data,
only about 10 percent of PBs were dissatisfied with the availability of spare parts. To a large extent, the
tractors remained in working order during the project and all PBs serviced their tractors on schedule.

Performance of PMT. Overall, a significant positive factor affecting the implementation and outcome was
the strong performance of the PMT, in particular the national and international mechanization specialists
and the monitoring staff. Throughout the implementation period, the staff were able to identify problems
and find solutions, develop good relationships with beneficiaries, and pay full attention to detail.

Component IV: Capacity Building Component

The CBC team was placed within the MAFRD, supported and built its capacity in line with the Ministry's
strategy, and reported directly to the Ministry. In general, all CBC activities were jointly realized by
international experts, local experts and counterparts in MAFRD. This approach generally worked well.
However, in many cases, the involvement of local experts and counterparts mostly took place in the first
stages of the work (e.g. sampling, data and secondary information collection and discussions) and much
less in data processing, synthesis and report writing. A broader distribution of finding to a wider public
inside MAFRD and outside would have helped to build more alliances.

5.4 Costs and financing:
Financing. A Trust Fund Grant Agreement in the amount of US$10.0 million from the International
Development Association, acting as Administrator for the Trust Fund for Kosovo (IDA) and a Dutch Trust
Fund Grant Agreement in the amount of US$1.8 million equivalent provided by Government of The
Netherlands became effective on August 15, 2000. A Swedish Trust Fund Grant Agreement in the amount
of 10 million Swedish Kronas for the implementation of machinery repair activities in three municipalities
became effective on June 25, 2001 and closed on December 31, 2001. Supplemental IDA financing in the
amount of US$4.1 million became effective on September 25, 2001. An Italian Trust Fund Grant
Agreement in the amount of US$1.4 million for the implementation of project activities in the Peje
municipality became effective on January 9, 2002.

Closing of Funds

The Dutch Trust Fund Grant Agreement in the amount of US$1.8 million provided by the Government of
The Netherlands closed on June 30, 2002. Around US$130,000 was not disbursed and was cancelled. The
Swedish Trust Fund Grant Agreement in the amount of 10 million Swedish Kronas closed on December 31,
2001. The TF has been fully disbursed. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement in the amount of US$14.1
million from the International Development Association (IDA) and the Italian Trust Fund Grant Agreement
in the amount of US$1.37 million for the implementation of project activities in the Peje municipality
closed on June 30, 2003. Both TFs are fully disbursed.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

Although the project was conceived as an emergency project, there have also been positive effects on
long-term sustainability, which is rated likely.

Re-establishing the cattle herd. Cattle beneficiaries were selected based on criteria, which included
experience in cattle keeping and their housing and feeding possibility. Moreover, the cattle breeds supplied
under the project were known and appreciated by the farmers. Sustainability for this component seems
therefore guaranteed. Growth of the cattle herd from 4,399 imported heifers to over 9,000 animals to date,
confirms this assumption.

Food security and income generation. For all beneficiaries milk and milk-products form an important
part of their daily diet. Consequently, the major part of the milk produced is consumed at home. However,
additional income can be generated from sales of surplus milk and/or dairy products. These activities are
mainly handled by women and will still further develop when farmers decide to increase the number of
animals by keeping female offspring for milk production. In addition to sales of milk, occasionally income
can be realized from sales for slaughter (male calves).

Farmer training. A total of 4,560 farmers were trained under the project in animal husbandry subjects
such as feeding, calving, calf rearing, housing, breeding, record keeping and animal health issues. Through
the training, the attention of farmers was drawn to possibilities of developing their farms, especially by
using improved breeds that were distributed by the project.

Veterinary services and artificial insemination. The EFRP has been pivotal in revitalizing critical
veterinary services. In addition to the provision of veterinary equipment and drugs, private veterinarians all
over Kosovo received refresher training in veterinary medicine, praxis management and AI. Through the
training, they were exposed to modern techniques and new veterinary medicines. According to the
beneficiary assessment, the majority of farmers consider that their veterinarian increased his skills over the
span of the project. With the assistance of the project, the use of AI has been re-activated and expanded to
rural areas for small-holders and is now fully provided by the private sector. This applies to insemination at
farms as well as to provision of inputs such as equipment, semen and liquid nitrogen. The government's role
in AI and breeding at present is of a regulatory nature.

CVDL. The requirement for a competent veterinary diagnostic laboratory for Kosovo to support diagnoses
of veterinary practitioners and assist with the control of major diseases is unquestionable. Hence,
considerable investment and efforts were made under EFRP to rehabilitate the CVDL. Diagnostic activities



                                                     - 17 -

in the laboratory have so far been modest. However, Kosovo recently applied for OIE observer status and
prepares for regular reporting on its animal disease status. It is therefore expected that the plan to activate
the now fully operational laboratory, developed during the last supervisory mission in close collaboration
with KVS, will be implemented.

Repair and maintenance services. The re-establishment of local repair workshops was an important
contribution of the project to future sustainability. A total of 14 workshops participated in the tractor
repair program. Support was also provided to six mechanics (sub-agents) in the new machinery program,
which was coupled with a useful training program. To date, the workshops continue to operate.

Provision of tractor services. Based on follow-up visits to eleven PBs after they had completed their
obligation and received possession of their tractor, it was found that all tractors were still operational and
in the possession of the PB. In general, the PBs were continuing to provide some free cultivation and
transportation services to the most needy in the village and to their relatives. To varying degrees, the PBs
were also providing some services for a fee, although the demand was still limited.

Capacity Component

l Strengthening the long-term capacity of the Policy Unit staff and other Ministry senior staff to analyze
    sub-sector and specific issues, drafting specific legislation and regulation, and formulating and
    implementing specific agricultural and rural development policies.

l Improving general technical and managerial skills of a large number of Ministry staff, through
    on-the-job training and implementation of English and computer versions.

l Improving the Ministry structure and putting in place appropriate administrative, organizational and
    management functions. Ministry senior staff now has more capacity to make further improvement to
    the exiting structure and organization of the Ministry.

l Increasing the long-term capacity of local experts involved in the implementation of different activities
    of the component (sub-sector and specific studies and training courses) in their respective field. In the
    future, they will most likely continue to provide the most needed policy and technical expertise and
    development services to the Ministry, but also to other government and non-governmental organizations
    in the province.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank was able to dispatch a well staffed team quickly. Its cooperation with the FAO emergency
response team also helped to get project preparation conducted quickly.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank carried out frequent, well-staffed, supervision missions (nine in total), which worked closely with
the PMT and component specialists and provided useful inputs for project implementation. The supervision
missions supported the evolvement of the project and the quick responsiveness to changed conditions and
made adjustments to the project activities as needed. The frequent supervision in the field and intensive



                                                     - 18 -

supervision from HQ was essential to ensure prompt action from FAO, especially on procurement and
financial management matters. The additional TF agreements and subsequent changes to the Service
Agreement required substantial assistance from the Bank. The close and detailed involvement of the task
manager contributed to the successful outcome of the project. The project team was able to secure US$4.2
million in cofinancing.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank performance can be rated highly satisfactory. The project was prepared immediately in response
to the 1999 crisis. Preparation was based on a large assessment of agricultural damages and a number of
background studies prepared as early as July 1999. The Bank team worked very intensively and received a
lot of support through the country unit. The complete project concept was ready by January 2000. The
subsequent challenges faced in finalizing the institutional agreements between UNMIK, FAO and the Bank
could be limited through very good cooperation between the preparation team and the Bank's financial,
disbursement and legal specialists.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
See below.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The governance arrangements in Kosovo have evolved considerably since early project inception and
implementation of the agriculture policy capacity building component under the EFRP. To date, a large
share of responsibilities has been handed over to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG),
including: the Government, the Assembly and the President of Kosovo. The Ministry of Agriculture is a
power that has been transferred to the PISG, while the Kosovo Veterinary Service remains one of the
so-called reserved functions under UNMIK's authority.

Responsibility for agriculture was originally spread over several offices (pillars) within the early days of
the UNMIK administration. This has since evolved into a Department of Agriculture, and more recently
into a full-fledged Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, under the political and
technical responsibility of Kosovars with basic capacity for policy and project formulation. This capacity
building was significantly supported under the EFRP with Dutch and Bank funding.


7.6 Implementing Agency:
FAO performance was satisfactory. Overall, FAO staff on the ground were judicious in selecting the
project team leaders, hiring both international and Kosovar staff, as well as more generally in terms of
managing and implementing this operation from Pristina. The consistency of the support provided by FAO
Headquarters in terms of technical support, procurement, financial management and legal services was
much more variable, and at times resulted in delays of implementation activities. Strong supervision from
the side of the Bank was required to ensure timely responses of FAO Headquarters. While these challenges
can be partially attributed to trying to align procedures between institutions and within the institution, FAO
could have at times performed more proactively.

Project management team. The progress and results of project were generally excellent. This
performance was largely due to good work from a strong project management team and municipal livestock
technicians, M&E specialist, and database expert, as well as good support from the NGOs contracted for
the beneficiary selection and monitoring process. The implementation was not without its challenges,
though it is notable that challenges were identified early and action taken. There was full attention paid to



                                                     - 19 -

detail, and there has been close monitoring throughout the implementation phase. It was also useful that
the same staff were involved throughout the program, with some ten visits made on a regular basis by the
IMS and ILS.

NGOs. The NGOs ably supported the program, although there was some difference in quality of
supervision and commitment of M(M/L)Ts. The NGOs generally performed well throughout the program,
both in the tractor repair and new machinery programs, despite the consistent challenges that they reported
due to delays in their contracts and payments, and in the arrival of tractors and equipment. In more than
one case, the participating NGO started or continued work without a current contract in a show of good
faith. In part, the performance of one NGO was negatively affected by the reduced time of two months to
carry out the beneficiary selection, partly as a result of the contract arriving late.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of UNMIK and MAFRD can be judged satisfactory. Both had a strong interest in
the project and supported its implementation. UNMIK's Pillar II assured the essential signing of the legal
agreements and remained responsive to requirements of the FAO and the Bank.


8. Lessons Learned

l As demonstrated through the implementation of the EFRP, FAO ­ and in particular FAO's Special
    Relief Operations Service ­ can be an effective service provider in a post-conflict situation. This,
    however, requires a fair amount of supervision to ensure a consistent track record and sufficient
    attention to agreed details during implementation.

l Previously agreed understandings on fiduciary arrangements (harmonization) between the Bank and
    UN Agencies (that would also encompass handling of post-conflict situations) would tremendously
    facilitate the task of formulating and implementing post-conflict projects.

l Strong implementation and supervision presence throughout program execution is necessary, in order
    to identify problems at an early stage to allow for immediate and appropriate action. A well functioning
    monitoring and up-to-date data management system is crucial in this respect.

l The incorporation of lessons learned from earlier emergency operations (in particular, Bosnia) strongly
    improved the design of the project and it was evident during project implementation. Thorough design,
    especially of targeting and monitoring, is important for good emergency operations.

l Emergency operations should also attempt to address sustainability issues and to the extend possible go
    beyond pure emergency needs in the post-conflict period. Timely follow-up activities should be planned
    to turn successful emergency measures into sustained development.

l The establishment of institutions, like the CVDL, is very challenging in a post-conflict environment.


l Capacity building can work. It requires time and commitment to both in-country training (including on
    administrative procedures) and overseeing study tours and training courses.

l Targeted beneficiary selection in a post-conflict environment can work very successfully. Strong
    involvement of local institutions and communication of the process are key.




                                                     - 20 -

l The carefully chosen beneficiary selection process and its successful implementation show that using a
    democratic process to select beneficiaries and to use beneficiary pressure to ensure compliance with
    project goals can be effective;

l More flexibility on the procurement in the machinery component might have resulted in more impact of
    the component. The original project concept envisaged to issue vouchers to primary beneficiaries who
    would then select their tractors and implements from local dealers. If a system of vouchers had been
    used, it is likely that the implement package chosen would have been more in line with the beneficiary
    preference and needs, thus widening the project impact.

l The cost recovery program for new machinery was well-designed and provides a good example for
    future projects. The obligation of 15 hectare per season appeared to be set at the right level since it
    was attainable but not too easy. Nearly all primary beneficiaries completed their obligations on
    schedule, which can be attributed to the effective combination of the promise of future ownership of the
    tractor, coupled with a good primary beneficiary selection process, community and secondary
    beneficiary pressure, regular monitoring and supervision, and the threat to re-possess the tractor for
    noncompliance.

l Participation, involvement and cooperation with counterparts were critical for capacity building. All
    capacity building component activities were implemented in rather close cooperation between
    international experts, local experts and counterparts in the MAFRD. The improvement of the Ministry
    structure and functioning of the day-to-day work was a major part of the component's activities which
    was achieved through involvement and close cooperation with the high-level decision makers inside the
    Ministry and with the senior staff.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

I       Comments from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development (MAFRD) appreciates the strong support of
the World Bank to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development and to the Kosova
agricultural sector.

The Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project (EFRP) funded by the World Bank was a very important
project after the war for two main reasons: (i) the largeness of the project and (ii) the importance of
addressing the key problems. This project was implemented and managed by FAO and addressed the
following issues: poverty alleviation, increase agriculture production and develop agricultural capacity
building. This project was composed of four components:

        1.     Livestock Component
        2.     Farm Mechanization Component
        3.     Veterinary Component
        4.     Capacity Building Component

During the early stage of implementation, FAO carried out the project implementation isolated from the
MAFRD (at that time DAFRD), but cooperation improved during later stages of the project. We consider
that cooperation between FAO and UNMIK/MAFRD could have been better during implementation of the



                                                     - 21 -

first three components, as the Ministry employed a number of experienced senior staff who could contribute
in the project implementation. For the fourth component, the CBC, cooperation between the Ministry and
the EFRP project team improved during project implementation.

The CBC was implemented in close collaboration with MAFRD, during the Kosovarisation of the
MAFRD, providing support towards strengthening of the day to day functions of the MAFRD. This
support comprised on the job training and advice provided by international and local staff, study tours and
specific studies in many fields including language and computers skills. This improved the capacity of
MAFRD in formulation and implementation of specific agricultural and rural development policies
recommendations and strategies. The CBC has also significantly contributed in drafting the relevant
agriculture legislation.

The CBC initiated the formulation of an Agricultural Development Strategy Document (Green Book/first
draft) through facilitation and coordination of the work of the Ministry staff, information gathering and
analysis and moderation of group meetings discussions and workshops. Later, the MAFRD staff and the
international staff developed and finalized the document from 50 to 200 pages. This document is
considered the mission statement of MAFRD and presents the main option for the immediate and long term
development of the sector.

At the end of the project, we found improved technical and administrative skills of Ministry staff,
information management and improvement articulation of issue and solution. The MAFRD believes that it
is now ahead the curve, comparing to other ministries in Kosova in the terms of policies formulation and
administrative capacity.

II       Comments from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo - Civil
Administration (Pillar II)

The EFRP project has been very well designed and its implementation well supervised and monitored. It
can be taken as a model. The lessons learned indicated in Section 8 are of particular relevance and could
be useful in any future programs in similar post-conflict situations. The assistance from the World Bank
for supporting the work of the Ministry (including its capacity building) is deeply appreciated.

We would, however, like to state that the ratings given in Annex 6.2 on the borrower Performance, seem to
have underestimated the commitment of both UNMIK and the Ministry's Kosovar staff. It was this strong
commitment that allowed difficulties encountered with FAO in some stages of the project implementation
(such as coordination on fielding consultants and clearing their TORs, the planning of some activities and
in implementing the CBC in its early steps) to be overcome. This commitment also led to the issuing of the
Green Book, which was proposed and launched by the CBC and completed with the dedicated work of the
Ministry staff.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

In the absence of detailed agronomic data that reflect current farming practices, cropping patterns, farm
asset use, etc., only a simple quantitative economic analysis has been carried out aiming to reflect main
costs and benefits associated with this project. The assumptions used for the analysis are presented below
and are considered to be conservative. The analysis is presented for the implementation activities in the six
most damaged municipalities. Project activities in these six municipalities (including province-wide
rehabilitation of veterinary services, and capacity building of the Agriculture Department) benefited around
23,000 farm households. Around 5,000 households will directly benefit as primary or secondary
beneficiaries from the cattle restocking and farm mechanization activities. A further estimated 7,000
households will benefit from improved veterinary services provided. Each additional municipality included
under the EFRP would increase the number of beneficiaries by a further estimated 1,700 families.

The Net Present Value (NPV) is estimated at around US$21.8 million (over a 10-year period discounted at
an opportunity cost of capital assumed at 10 percent), while the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is estimated
at around 32.2 percent.

Summary of Benefits and Costs

The main benefits and costs associated with the project have been considered in the economic analysis.
These are the benefits and costs associated with: (a) increased crop production through the supply of new
and the repair of broken machinery, and (b) increased milk production and production of offspring.
However, there are more benefits of the project which have not been included in the analysis as they are
either very limited in scope or difficult to quantify. These benefits are the veterinary component (the
component is only considered to the extent which it provides services to the distributed cows), the capacity
building component and the provision of community services as part of the cost recovery scheme of the
machinery component.




                                                                        - 26 -

The benefits of the farm machinery supplied and repaired are measured through its impact on the cultivated
area. It has been further assumed that sufficient input supply would then enable the farmers to grow crops.
Therefore, benefits of the machinery component (repair and replacements) are reflected through the
increased production values generated by the use of the machinery. In the calculation the benefits of
machinery are limited to their benefits in crop cultivation only. There are additional benefits through their
use during harvesting time and for transport purposes.

The benefits of the livestock component are measured in terms of: (a) increased milk production; (b) cattle
restocking potential; and (c) the value of male off-spring. These benefits are reflected through: (a) the
value of the additional milk produced; (b) a simple herd model which quantifies the progress of female
calves in the breeding process and finally provides for the value in growth of off-spring and milk; and (c)
the value of young male calves. The distributed cows are used for re-breeding purposes and are able to
produce average milk yields under the given circumstances in Kosovo.

All cost were calculated based on prices for inputs and goods prevailing in Kosovo during the
implementation period. The price for crops are border prices, i.e. international prices adjusted for transport
and insurance. International prices are taken from world market price forecasts for the year 2002. Crop
yields and milk production data derive from project monitoring data. Refer to Annex 11 for a more detailed
description of benefits and impacts by component.

Key Data for Analysis

Machinery Component:

 l The replaced assets resulted in a one-time, incremental 10,100 hectare being cultivated annually (50
      ha per tractor per year).

 l The machinery repair component repaired 2,414 tractors in three municipalities resulting in around
      12,000 hectare additional area cultivated annually (5 ha per tractor).

 l The calculation assumes that the additional area was planted with winter and summer grains. The
      average wheat yield was 2.6 tons per hectare, at a price of US$130 per ton. The price represents the
      average world market price for 2002.

 l The production costs (including farm inputs, fuel and routine machinery maintenance, labor) for
      grain have been assumed at 90 percent of the production value.

      Livestock Component:

 l The livestock component provided direct benefits to 4,409 farm households who lost all their cattle.
      The component had two benefits: (i) the increased availability of milk, and (ii) the cow and its
      offspring. The increased availability of milk directly improved the diet of more vulnerable
      households. The cow and the calf enabled households who would have otherwise been unable to
      restart livestock production. Access milk, when marketed, created an additional income source for the
      family, often secured by the female household members.

 l The reproductive rate of a cow was on average 1.4. The mortality rate was very low at 5 percent;
      around 95 percent of the cows reproduced.


                                                     - 27 -

l Fifty percent of the off-spring are female. The female calves gave birth to their first calf and provided
  milk when they turned around 20 months old. Male calves are sold when they turn around 4 to 6
  months old at an average price of US$400. Female calves, in the large majority, are kept for
  rebreeding, and building-up of the cattle herd.

l The cows are assumed to produce 2,600 liters of milk on average per year (12 l per day for 300
  days). The economic value of milk is around US$0.25 per liter.

l The off-spring consumes 800 liters per calf annually (8 liters over 100 days). Besides rooming on
  pasture (no economic costs have been imputed), the cows are additionally fed with hey and
  concentrate (US$285 annually).

l The investment costs include: (i) the cost of the farm machinery repairs and replacements; (ii)
  providing livestock; and (iii) rehabilitating and providing veterinary services in three municipalities
  (US$10.9 million).

The project was prepared very rapidly (four months until appraisal) as an emergency type operation would
call for. However, the finalization of implementation agreements between the implementing partners
UNMIK, FAO and the Bank substantially slowed the process down. Main reasons were discrepancies of
procurement, financial management and audit requirements of the institutions. There alignment proved time
consuming.

FAO performance was satisfactory. Overall, FAO staff was judicious in selecting the project team on the
ground , hiring both international and Kosovar staff, as well as more generally in terms of managing and
implementing this operation from Pristina. The consistency of the support provided by FAO Headquarters
in terms of technical support, procurement, financial management and legal services was much more
variable, and at times proved to result in delays of implementation activities. Strong supervision from the
side of the Bank was required to ensure timely responses on the side of FAO Headquarters. While these
challenges can be partially attributed to trying to align procedures between institutions and within the
institution, FAO could have at times performed more proactively.

The overall performance of UNMIK and MAFRD can be judged satisfactory. Both had a strong interest in
the project and supported its implementation. UNMIK's pillar II assured the essential signing of the legal
agreements and remained responsive to requirements of the FAO and the Bank.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results

Objective

The main objective of the beneficiary assessment was to obtain the level of beneficiary satisfaction with the
project. More specifically, the assessment focused on beneficiary views regarding the following questions:

l Did the right people benefit from the project?
l Did the project address the needs of the people?
l What aspects of the project worked?
l What was the impact of the project?
l What impacts will continue after the project ends?


Methodology

Qualitative data was collected through individual and group interviews. Group interviews had between six
and ten respondents. Interviews with ten project stakeholders: six beneficiaries (cow, bull, primary and
secondary tractor and tractor repair beneficiaries, and veterinarians). This seems to be the weakest part of
the beneficiary assessment. This may have been due to the fact that one person was responsible for all
interviews and may not have understood the project well, non-beneficiaries (neighbors of cow and tractor
beneficiaries), and three other stakeholders (village, municipal and NGO officials). For each stakeholder a
separate interview guide was prepared. While all interview guides covered the research questions outlined
above, each also had probes relating to the specific stakeholder.

In each of the project's six primary municipalities, three villages were selected for interviews with cow,
bull, tractor (primary and secondary), and tractor repair beneficiaries as well as non-beneficiaries and
village officials. In the same municipalities, interviews were also conducted with veterinarians, and
municipal and NGO officials. In all, 192 individual and 36 group interviews were conducted:

Beneficiary selection

Overall, most respondents (including NGO, municipal and village officials) were satisfied with the
beneficiary selection criteria and process, and believed that the right people benefited from the project.
Remarkably, even non-beneficiaries did not raise major objections. They did, however, indicate that the
need for assistance exceeded the assistance available from the project. Those not satisfied with the
selection process pointed to minor deviations and misallocations by the village councils. They believed that
more and better information dissemination in beneficiary villages would have ameliorated this situation.

Cow recipients were aware of the various selection criteria (need, experience and capacity) and the ones
that their household fulfilled as well as the roles played by the village councils and the NGOs. They also
seemed to consider the criteria fair and the process smooth. In this regard, close monitoring by the
international NGOs was seem as very important. Nonetheless, a few respondents pointed out that some
poor households who were unable to take care of a cow became beneficiaries because they had lost
someone or had their house burnt during the war. Especially during the first phase, immediately after the
war, this seemed to have become a "hidden" criteria for selection and could not be avoided. For such
households, the distribution of smaller livestock or dairy products (by the cow beneficiaries) may have been
more appropriate.

Both primary and secondary tractor recipients were also aware of and satisfied with the selection
criteria and process. The village council selected 30 households based on need and land ownership; then,
those 30 secondary beneficiaries selected a primary beneficiary who had experience operating a tractor
through a secret ballot. Often, the person with the most votes was considered "hard-working, reliable and
honest". Interestingly, even other tractor candidates (potential primary beneficiaries) were satisfied with
the results. This is remarkable considering the value of a new tractor and the tensions that sometimes
surrounded the selection of primary beneficiaries. Perhaps the earnestness exhibited by the primary
beneficiaries with respect to fulfilling their obligations had eased some of those earlier resentments.

Priority Need

All cow recipients considered the cow to be a priority need for their household because it guaranteed a
minimum level of food security. A few households considered housing/construction materials more of a
priority, especially immediately after the war, but most were able to address this need on their own. None
of the bull recipients saw the bull as an urgent need for their household. However, they recognized the
importance of the bull with respect to improving the breed of their cows and those of their neighbors.

Similar to cow recipients, all primary tractor recipients considered the new tractor to be a priority need
for their household. Most secondary tractor recipients also indicated that accessing tractor services were
an urgent household need. However they stressed that they benefited only for two years (the duration of the
project in each municipality). Some would have preferred housing/construction materials, a cow or, of
course, a tractor of their own. Others mentioned that without seeds and fertilizer, having the land plowed
was useless.

Tractor repair recipients indicated that the assistance provided by the project was among their priority
needs. Some believed that they could not have repaired their tractors without the project; the others
reported that they would have been able to repair their tractors on their own but with much hardship.

Input Specifics

All cow recipients were pleased with the breed of the cow. They were happy with the quantity and quality
of the milk, the health of the cow, and the number and size of calves. A few beneficiaries noted that the
foreign breeds demanded more food, water and care than local cows. In certain areas, where water was
scarce, perhaps smaller livestock such as sheep would have been more appropriate. This was considered by
the project designers but rejected. Most recipients also praised the concentrate that they received, noting
the positive health effects on the cow and calf. However, a few had thrown away the concentrate because it
had rotted. The project management team explained that this was mainly due to inappropriate on-farm
storage.
About three-quarters of the cow beneficiaries indicated that they or another household member had attended
the training provided by the project. This finding is also supported by the project management team. Most
of them expressed satisfaction with the content (cow care, feeding, watering, hygiene, etc.) and the delivery
of the training. Those least satisfied with their cows, and the project more generally, seemed to be those
who had not attended the training.

Although there was some variation in the level of satisfaction with veterinary services among cow
recipients, most indicated that the project veterinarians provided caring and professional services promptly
and without a fee. In Vushtrri and Peje, however, several beneficiaries expressed serious dissatisfaction
with their veterinarians and indicated that they had to engage other veterinarians and pay for the services.
The project management team explained that this may have been due to some misunderstandings among
recipients with respect to the type of free services (four general and two artificial insemination visits) and
medications provided by the project. Project veterinarians indicated that this confusion could be avoided
through better information dissemination about veterinary services during the training.

According to cow beneficiaries (and some other respondents), the most problematic aspect of the cattle
component was artificial insemination. While some recipients had their cows artificially inseminated and
were pleased with the outcome, others expressed fervent dissatisfaction and urged the project to address the
problem immediately. Reasons for lack of success included: (i) inability of the cow to adapt to the new
environment; (ii) limited veterinary skill and experience; (iii) inadequately stored semen; and (iv) inability
of the farmer to detect heat. While the project management team acknowledged many of these problems, it
indicated that the overall rates of confirmed second pregnancies through artificial inseminations were quite
high. Few beneficiaries reported using bulls to service their cows. This finding is not supported by the
monitoring and evaluation system, where in some municipalities more than half of the second confirmed
pregnancies resulted from natural inseminations. Gaining access to the project bulls seems to have been
difficult due to transport constraints and some of them having been sold.

Few cow recipients were willing to give away their second calves to another needy household in the village
as envisioned under the project design. The project management team was aware of this. While they
encouraged beneficiaries to give away their second calves, they did not insist on it. Some claimed that they
were not aware of the requirement, while others insisted that none of the other beneficiaries had done so.
Those who were willing to part with their calves were adamant about giving them to someone of their own
choosing--usually a close relative. Non-beneficiaries suggested that the first rather than the second calves
be given away as the status of the first calves could be easily monitored by the project. This was considered
by the project designers but rejected. They along with village and NGO officials also recommended closer
monitoring and sanctioning of non-adherence.

Most bull recipients were pleased with the breed of bull and quality (not quantity) of concentrate they
received. They also seemed satisfied with the training (bull care, feeding, adaptation, insemination, etc.)


                                                     - 36 -

and veterinary services (except in Peje) provided by the project. Many beneficiaries reported providing bull
services to neighbors free of charge although the project had encouraged them to charge 5 Euros. This
resulted in a great deal of good will in the community. However, the project management team indicated
that this tradition of providing free bull service made bull keeping an expensive and unattractive option for
many farmers.

All primary tractor recipients seemed satisfied with the tractors they received. Many were especially
pleased with the hated cabins. A few, however, would have liked more implements or implements more
appropriate for the local terrain NGO officials also raised this issue. Most primary beneficiaries attended
and praised the training, which focused on the tractor services that they were obliged to provide for the
secondary beneficiaries.

The majority of the primary beneficiaries had already fulfilled most of their obligations toward the
secondary beneficiaries "to the satisfaction of all". The project monitored this cost-recovery scheme very
closely. Several indicated that in some cases the secondary beneficiaries were not able to pay for fuel as
required by the project. Given the level of poverty in many villages, they serviced the land anyway. Most
of the primary beneficiaries also participated in some type of voluntary community activity such as the
distribution of humanitarian assistance or road repair work.

Most secondary tractor recipients expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the tractor services
provided by the primary tractor recipients. Many also indicated that the services were provided in a
courteous and prompt manner. Most secondary beneficiaries paid about 5 Euros for fuel expenses related
to the preparation of about 0.5 hectares of land. Those unable to pay reported that the primary
beneficiaries prepared their land anyway. Many secondary beneficiaries also indicated that the primary
beneficiaries participated in voluntary community activities. Some criticized the village council for not
organizing more community work for the primary beneficiaries. Village officials acknowledged that they
had not been very active with respect to organizing community work for the primary beneficiaries.

Some disputes seem to have arisen when the secondary beneficiaries failed to understand that the primary
beneficiaries had 29 other secondary beneficiaries to service. Most of these disputes were solved at the
village level. In a few cases, the NGO or the project management team had to become involved. There did
seem to be cases, however, where the primary beneficiaries was clearly negligent and did not fulfill their
obligations.

Most tractor repair recipients were satisfied with the parts and services provided by the project.
However, several complained that additional repairs were necessary to make their tractors functional.
Others would have appreciated the provision of implements along with repairs. Most repair recipients
claimed that they were unaware that they had to provide tractor services to needy farmers. Some believed
that the assistance was too small for them to give anything back. The few that did provide free tractor
services to other farmers or undertook community work claimed to have done so for moral reasons not
because of an obligation to the project. The project did not monitor this cost-recovery scheme.

All veterinarians appreciated the equipment provided by the project. Most of them also found the quality
(not quantity) of drugs satisfactory. A few noted that they welcomed the opportunity to use equipment and
drugs that they had not used before. Most of the veterinarians also indicated that they found the training
useful, especially those focusing on artificial insemination. All of them claimed to have provided free
veterinary services to non-project farmers equal to 30 percent of the total value of the equipment and drugs
they received as required by the project. According to the project management team, only 8 of the 106
veterinarians did not fulfill their obligations. This cost-recovery scheme was monitored by the project.

Impact

The positive impacts reported by cow recipients included (i) improvement of the breed, and (ii) food
security for the beneficiary households, their neighbors with whom they shared the milk, and their relatives
to whom they gave the second calf. Although few beneficiaries were able to sell milk and/or milk products,
several noted that not having to buy milk meant they could spend their money on other urgent household
needs. A number of respondents also indicated that the presence of the cows in the village had a positive
psychological effect. It gave the farmers something to do with their time. This was very important,
especially immediately after the war. Few negative impacts were reported. There seemed to have been
some envy during the selection and distribution processes but this was short-lived as most villagers believed
that the right people benefited from the project.

According to the bull recipients, the project's contributions included (i) improvement of the breed, and (ii)
bull services for their cows, those of their neighbors, and those of nearby villages. A number of
non-beneficiaries mentioned that they had used the project bulls and were very pleased with the results.
Others non-beneficiaries as well as cow beneficiaries indicated that they would have liked a project bull in
their village. Most beneficiaries were not able to generate income (except when they sold the bull) because,
as noted above, they often did not charge for their services.

The positive impacts reported by primary tractor recipients included (i) a significant contribution to their
household assets, and (ii) food security for their households and the secondary tractor recipient households
(during the project). Several were also able to generate some income by providing tractor or transport
services to other farmers. Others helped non-beneficiaries by providing services for free or at a discounted
rate. This was confirmed by both non-beneficiaries and secondary tractor beneficiaries.

Secondary tractor recipients mentioned food security (during the project) as the main contribution of the
project. Some were also grateful to have some feed for their animals. Others noted larger yields than in
previous years. Although none of the secondary beneficiaries were able to sell their produce, several noted
that not having to buy produce meant they could spend their money on other urgent household needs. Most
secondary recipients also indicated that the availability of tractor services in the community "reanimated"
agriculture in the village as most of the land would have otherwise been left fallow. Surprisingly, the
project seems to have generated very little envy among secondary beneficiaries. Perhaps this was due to
their acceptance of the beneficiary selection process and belief that the value of the services that the
primary beneficiary provided was close enough to the value of the tractor. However, there were isolated
cases of conflict (in Carrabreg I Ulet, Decan, a tractor was set on fire).

According to the tractor repair recipients, the project's positive effects included (i) food security for their
households; (ii) some income from the sale of their produce; and (iii) some income from the provision of
tractor and transport services to other farmers. Unlike primary tractor beneficiaries, who had to devote a
considerable amount of time servicing secondary tractor beneficiaries, tractor repair beneficiaries seemed to
have been able to devote some time to income generation.

Veterinarians indicated that the project enabled them to conduct their work more efficiently and
effectively. A few also noted they were able to provide a broader range of services.




                                                     - 38 -

Sustainability

Village officials praised the sustainable food security impacts of the cow and new tractor sub-components
of the project. They also noted the long-term significance of the ennoblement of the cattle breed.

About two-thirds of the cow recipients reported that they still had their cows and that the cows were in
good health. This was confirmed by the project's monitoring and evaluation system. The others had either
given the cow to someone else because they were unable to take care of it, sold it because they needed
money urgently (for household expenses such as construction materials), or slaughtered it because of ill
health. Several respondents believed that selling the cow corrected some of the inclusion errors of the
beneficiary selection process: the seller got money, the buyer got a good breed at a reasonable price, and
the cow got better care. Slaughtering such a valuable breed, however, was considered a terrible shame.
About half of the beneficiaries indicated that they still had the first calves. The others had slaughtered the
calf (especially if it was male), sold it, or given it to relatives.

For most cow beneficiaries, the most sustainable effect of the project was food security for their households
and improvement of the breed. The project's impact on the reconstruction of the agricultural sector was
perceived as more limited. Nonetheless, some recipients indicated that they planned to increase their
livestock holdings. Others explained that they were unable to care for more than one cow and/or there was
no market for milk or milk products, mostly due to cheap imports. The absence of milk collection and
processing centers was another obstacle.

About half of the bull recipients had either slaughtered or sold their bull. According to the project
management team, this was not surprising given the poor management of the bulls. Often, they were
overfeed, under-exercised and keep in poorly ventilated, dark and unsuitable hygienic conditions. This
resulted in poor bull performance and, sometimes, aggressive bull behavior. Nonetheless, most
beneficiaries believed that the project still had long-term effects with respect to improving the breed of
their cows and those of their neighbors.

All primary tractor recipients indicated that their tractors were still in very good condition. However, a
few complained about the high cost of maintaining the tractor. They also mentioned that they planned to
keep their tractors, use them on their own land, and earn some income through the provision of tractor
services. Some primary beneficiaries were eager to expand their agricultural activities but limited access to
markets, poor infrastructure (irrigation, roads, etc.), and lack of capital presented significant challenges.

Interestingly, almost all primary tractor recipients indicated that they planned to continue providing
services for free or at a discounted rate to their neighbors. A number of secondary tractor recipients also
seemed to believe that this would be a long-term effect of the project. Others believed that the positive
impacts of the project would end when the primary beneficiaries had fulfilled their obligations to them.
Some of these secondary beneficiaries indicated that they would continue to find a way to work their land,
even if they had to pay commercial rates, while others did not believe that they would be able to continue
working their land after the project ended. A few secondary recipients noted that two years (the duration of
the project in each municipality) was not enough time for them or the economy to recover from the war.

About half of the tractor repair recipients reported that their tractors were still in good working
condition. Many of the others indicated that while their tractors were in need of repairs, they were still
functioning. Several also indicated that their tractors were barely or not working. Similar to some primary
tractor beneficiaries, a few complained about the high cost of maintaining the tractor. Most of the

beneficiaries believed that the effects of the project (food and income for their household) would continue
as long as their tractors continued to function. While many of them plan to stay engaged with agriculture,
they noted that lack of access to markets and credit presented significant challenges.

All of the veterinarians planned to continue to use the equipment and skills they had gained through the
project. Many of them also planned to develop their veterinary practices. They believed that the project
had increased demand for their services in a sustainable manner by injecting a large number of livestock
into their municipalities.

Conclusions

Based on the above findings, the following conclusions can be drawn:

l Most respondents were satisfied with the beneficiary selection criteria and process. Those that were
    not satisfied pointed to minor deviations.
l Some households that were too poor to take care of a cow were selected because they had lost someone
    or their house during the war. This seemed to have become a "hidden" criteria for selection.
l Cow and primary tractor beneficiaries believed that the project addressed a priority need for their
    household in a sustainable manner. Secondary tractor beneficiaries also believed that the project
    addressed a priority need but only for the duration of the project. Tractor repair beneficiaries believed
    that the project addressed a priority need but only as long as their tractors continued to function. Bull
    beneficiaries believed that the project did not address a priority need but they recognized that the
    benefits of improving the breed of their cows and those of their neighbors.
l Most cow beneficiaries were pleased with the breed, concentrate and training they received. Many
    were also satisfied with the veterinary services provided by the project. Artificial insemination seems
    to have been more problematic.
l Most cow beneficiaries seemed unwilling to give away their second calf to a needy household in the
    village. Non-beneficiaries suggested that the first calf be given away and non-adherence be sanctioned.
l Most bull beneficiaries were satisfied with the breed, concentrate (quality not quantity), training and
    veterinary services provided by the project.
l The local tradition of providing free bull service made bull keeping an expensive and unattractive
    option for many farmers.
l Most primary tractor beneficiaries were pleased with the tractors that they received and most secondary
    tractor beneficiaries were satisfied with the tractor service they received. In some cases, the secondary
    beneficiaries were not able to pay for fuel as required by the project. Primary beneficiaries seem to
    have worked their land anyway.
l Most tractor repair beneficiaries were satisfied with the parts and services they received. Those that
    were not satisfied indicated that their tractors needed additional repairs.
l The main impacts of the project were (i) food security (cow, primary tractor, secondary tractor and
    tractor repair beneficiaries); (ii) improvement of the cattle breed and productivity (cow and bull
    beneficiaries as well as the community); (iii) some income generation (tractor repair beneficiaries and
    veterinarians); and (iv) asset creation (primary tractor beneficiaries). Most of these impacts would
    continue after the project ended. The food security situation of the secondary tractor beneficiaries
    would worsen. The income earning opportunities of the primary tractor beneficiaries would improve.
l Several respondents believed that selling the cow corrected some of the inclusion errors of the
    beneficiary selection process: the seller got money, the buyer got a good breed at a reasonable price,
    and the cow got better care. Slaughtering such a valuable breed, however, was considered a terrible
    shame.
l Primary tractor beneficiaries provided tractor services for free or at a discounted rate to

  non-beneficiaries. Many indicated that they would extend these services to secondary beneficiaries
  when the project ended. Some secondary beneficiaries indicated that they also believed that this would
  happen.
l Veterinarians believed that the project had increased demand for their services in a sustainable manner
  by injecting a large number of livestock into their municipalities.
l Village officials appreciated the participatory process used to select beneficiaries.
l NGO officials appreciated the cost recovery mechanisms in the project and indicated that they would
  apply similar approaches to their own projects.
l Although there seems to be a great deal of awareness among project beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries
  of project objectives and implementation mechanisms, some respondents wanted more information
  dissemination: more information about the selection criteria and process, more information about the
  veterinary services available to cow beneficiaries, and more information about the obligations of the
  primary beneficiaries to the secondary beneficiaries.
l Where there were strong cost recovery mechanism and therefore close monitoring (primary tractor
  beneficiary obligations to secondary tractor beneficiaries and veterinarian obligations to farmers), there
  was a high degree of adherence. Where the cost recovery element was not as strong (cow beneficiary
  giving away second calf, tractor repair beneficiary obligations to farmers), adherence was low.
l Most project beneficiaries indicated that they relied on agriculture for their livelihood. Even those that
  had other employment reported that they relied primarily on the sector. This reliance on agriculture
  seems to have grown after the war. Most also believed that they would continue to rely on the sector
  for the foreseeable future.
l According to a number of respondents, sustaining and building on the impacts of the EFRP require the
  following: (i) medium/long-term strategic planning for agricultural development in Kosovo and in each
  municipality; (ii) access to credit; (iii) training and advisory services; (iv) collection/storage and
  processing capacities; (v) access to markets; and (vi) self-organization.

FAO Project Manager and Kutim Uka, FAO Deputy Project Manager of the EFRP Project Implementation
Unit also attended the meeting, as did the FAO Regional Coordinator based in Belgrade, Gordon Biggar;
and Severin Kodderitzsch and Frauke Jungbluth from the World Bank. The following summarizes the
meeting discussion.

According to MAFRD, the EFRP is the single most important donor funded agriculture sector operation
carried out in Kosovo in cooperation with UNMIK's Department of Agriculture, and later Kosovo's
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development (MAFRD). Around 13,000 beneficiaries, many
of them poor, have been supported through this operation. The EFRP was funded by IDA, acting as
Administrator for the Trust Fund for Kosovo, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy with a total amount of
around US$18.3 million, and implemented through the UN FAO in collaboration with numerous NGOs
during the period May 2000 through June 2003. The EFRP was well designed and overall well executed.

The Capacity Building Component (CBC), aiming to support the establishment of a functioning Ministry
of Agriculture in Kosovo, was implemented in close cooperation with MAFRD. The CBC comprised staff
training, both within Kosovo and abroad, a range of sector studies, technical assistance in developing
administrative and IT procedures for the Ministry, and a major agriculture policy workshop in September
2002. As a result, the newly established MAFRD has now issued the first edition of its Green Book on
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, reflecting on the status of agriculture and rural development
and MAFRD's strategy on agriculture and rural development policies in Kosovo.

This capacity building has also significantly contributed to the drafting of relevant agriculture legislation
(six laws have been approved since the inception of MAFRD in 2002). The CBC was implemented early
during the "Kosovarization" of MAFRD, a time when expatriate leadership was phased out in favor of
Kosovar involvement; the CBC has significantly contributed to the institutional set up of the new Kosovo
MAFRD. MAFRD believes that it is now ahead of the curve compared to other ministries in Kosovo, in
terms of policy formulation and administrative capacity. This head start is now being consolidated by
further technical assistance focused on agriculture statistics and capacity building funded by the European
Union (EU).

The Livestock Component was judged critical for the rehabilitation of livestock in Kosovo in two aspects:
(a) the overall number of livestock in Kosovo, and (b) the improvement of the genetic material. In addition,



                                                    - 42 -

the assistance to the livestock department on animal breeding and policy made it possible to have the
preliminary work finalized that will lead to the establishment of a law on livestock production. In terms of
the cost recovery mechanism of the component, the view was that the hand-over of calves to second
beneficiaries should have been emphasized more in the project design.

The Farm Mechanization Component is recognized for its support to cultivation. While most of the
benefits have been certainly shared between direct beneficiaries of the project, a larger number of people
will continue to benefit through the availability of mechanization services. The Ministry does not think that
the ownership of mechanization equipment will create tensions in the village. Rather, it will support
agricultural activities. The municipal representative noted that the beneficiary selection process was not
easy and more involvement would have been helpful.

The Veterinary Component comprised rehabilitation of veterinary services. Vaccination activities
initiated by FAO in the early post-conflict period were greatly enhanced through this component which also
made significant provisions for private veterinarians from minority groups. The distribution of equipment
to private veterinarians helped to quickly revitalize veterinary activity which contributed to reviving
services in rural areas. It was also pointed out that the training of veterinarians was very critical and
helpful.

While a functioning Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has been established, unfortunately little
diagnostic work has been performed to date due to unresolved institutional issues between the Kosovo
Veterinary Service (KVS, which is the owner of the laboratory equipment) and the Faculty of Agriculture
(which claims to own the site). Clarification on this conflict requires a decision on the part of UNMIK,
currently pending. Implementation of technical assistance provided by the European Union in support of
the public veterinary services in Kosovo has also been stalled until the status of the CVDL is clarified.
However, the Ministry expects the laboratory to take a lead role in disease control.

Stakeholder involvement increased substantially over the project period as local institutions gained
capacity. In the beginning of the project involvement of municipal authorities was low. The NGOs active
in the beneficiary selection process did not involve the municipalities, but dealt directly with the village
communities. However, later there was very good cooperation and the municipalities were fully involved
and informed. The cooperation and joining of forces in local communities are regarded as notable positive
impacts of the project. Cooperation between the Ministry and the project team also increased over the life
of the project. Early in the project planning, the Ministry consisted only of very few staff and did not have
sufficient capacity. However, this changed substantially over the course of the project and is attributed to
the capacity building component, which led to closer cooperation between the Ministry and the project
team.

Nevertheless, some of the technical assistance that supported the project should ideally have also
cooperated closer with the Ministry for additional capacity building and information purposes. A similar
opinion was voiced by the Kosovo veterinary service, given that the service was only established at a time
when the project was already ongoing. It is recognized that it is challenging to set up a project in an
environment that is just building up its institutions and governing framework. Given that, it was realized
that the project actually did very well in consulting stakeholder institutions as soon as they emerged.

Minority beneficiaries have also participated under the project. Project negotiations resulted in the
additional focus on some project activities in minority areas that required beneficiary selection. The then
Department of Agriculture was in charge of this beneficiary selection process. In retrospect, this was
overburdening the Department. However, this resulted in adaptation of the approach for the second and


                                                      - 43 -

third round of beneficiary selection, with the selection process of minorities being fully integrated in the
overall selection process. The NGOs in charge of the selection did not face many challenges in conducting
the selection.

Minority issues could have potentially been addressed in a better fashion, in particular during later phases
of the project, had the World Bank shown more flexibility in incorporating new project components.

NGOs' performance during beneficiary selection was critical to smooth implementation of the project.
With the exception of one NGO, the implementation performance of all NGOs involved in the project was
satisfactory to highly satisfactory (GOAL).

According to the MAFRD, overall, FAO's performance in executing the EFRP on behalf of UNMIK is
considered satisfactory. While during the early stages of implementation FAO may have carried out
implementation in some isolation from MAFRD, cooperation improved markedly during later stages.
Consultations between FAO and UNMIK/DOA/MAFRD could have been better during implementation of
the cattle and the farm mechanization components. For instance, systematic ex ante information on the
schedule of consultants to visit Kosovo would have facilitated further interaction with MAFRD, as would
have shorter reports translated into Albanian. This said, FAO managed to implement the EFRP, which
involved execution of both emergency-type activities as well as developmental/institution building efforts,
remarkably well at a time when this capacity was nonexistent in Kosovo.

Future Agriculture Development

MAFRD would much welcome further collaboration with the World Bank beyond implementation of the
EFRP. Agriculture is regarded as one of the important economic areas for Kosovo. Given that very little
governmental budget is allocated for the numerous responsibilities of the Ministry, projects are regarded as
key to move forward. Further activities could entail activities related to rural advisory services, processing
and marketing of agricultural products, and quality standards and public-private linkages.

Additional Annex 10. Review of Beneficiary Selection Process - Summary


Design of Beneficiary Selection

According to the PAD, the beneficiary selection criteria and process should aim to "minimize errors of
inclusion and exclusion" yet be flexible enough to allow for the effective implementation of an emergency
project. This approach ought to be implemented by a number of international NGOs and a local NGO
under the supervision of an international and national rural sociologist within the PMT.

The following steps were to be carried out to select project beneficiaries:

l Selection of municipalities;
l Collection of data on each village of the selected municipalities;
l Preparation of the preliminary list of villages;
l Consultation at the municipal level to finalize village selection;
l Information campaign in selected villages;
l Consultation at the village level to prepare the preliminary list of beneficiaries; and
l Finalization of the beneficiary selection.


The process was planned to take about three months and subsequent phases of the beneficiary selection
ought to be adjusted based on lessons learned in the previous phase.

Municipal selection. The project municipalities were the most heavily damaged municipalities in Kosovo
and selection will be based on a "rural damage indicator," which consists of data on damage to/loss of
housing, cattle and tractor, and include discussions with UNMIK. The number of farm assets distributed
to each municipality should be based on its population and decided by the PMT.

Village selection. This process began with the collection of data at the village level and include:
population, number of households, number of cows, number of households with no cow, number of
functioning tractors, number of damaged tractors, and arable land. In addition, information about minority
populations was gathered. Based on this information, the NGO responsible for the beneficiary selection in
the project municipality pre-selected a number of villages:
 Cattle. For cows, all villages where the average number of cows per household is equal to or lower than
one would be pre-selected. Then a number of cows will be pre-allocated to these villages to reach the one
cow per household ratio (at least 10 cows per village). If this does not allow for the distribution of the
predetermined number of cows for the municipality, the ratio could be adjusted. Finally, all villages where
the traditional livelihood does not relate to cattle will be excluded.
 Tractors. For tractors, all villages that have more than 20 ha of arable land per usable tractor would be
pre-selected. A usable tractor will include all functioning tractors and those that can be repaired at a
reasonable cost. The same iterative process described above for the cows would be used to pre-select the
tractor villages.
Once the list of pre-selected cow and tractor villages are ready, the international NGO in cooperation with
the Mother Theresa Society will organize a number of consultations at the municipal level to build
consensus and finalize the village selection. These consultations will include: (i) UNMIK representatives;
(ii) municipal leaders and technical specialists; (iii) international and local NGOs; (iv) women's
organizations; and (v) all village leaders. During these consultations, special attention should be paid to
minorities and enclaves, the concentration of aid in specific villages, and specific types of vulnerabilities



                                                       - 45 -

and conditions such as presence of land mines.

Household selection. In the selected villages, the Mother Theresa Society under the supervision of the
international rural sociologist of the PMT and the NGO responsible for the municipality will launch an
information campaign. This campaign will include the following steps:

l Preparation of leaflets and posters explaining the project, including its aim, beneficiary selection
    criteria and process, and cost recovery schemes;
l Distribution of leaflets and posters at all selected villages and municipal administrative offices;
l Organization of a one-day training seminar for the Mother Theresa Society facilitators (by the
    international rural sociologist) who would be responsible for information dissemination at the village
    level; and
l Organization of a meeting in each of the selected villages to explain the project.


Given that villages can be large and "a participatory method that makes the best use of intimate knowledge
on household characteristics within the community" is recommended, the household selection process
should begin with meetings at the lagje or neighborhood level. The criteria for selection should be
"discussed, amended and improved" during these meetings. The international NGO, however, ought to
begin with the following criteria: for cows, families who have lost all their cows, have vulnerable members
(children, elderly, pregnant women, widows and persons who are physically challenged), and have limited
means to buy milk due to their lack of income; and for tractors, families who do not have a functioning or
repairable tractor and have limited access to land preparation services by others due to their lack of income.
These tractor beneficiaries (secondary beneficiaries) will in turn select the future owner of the tractor
(primary beneficiary) who will over two years service their land. The criteria for the selection of the
primary tractor beneficiary include experience in operating a tractor and selection by the secondary tractor
beneficiaries. Once the final list of cow and tractor beneficiaries have been finalized at the village level,
the list will be made public and grievance hearings will be held.

Minorities. In principle, the project was designed to benefit all Kosovars, irrespective of their ethnicity.
Hence, minority household in project municipalities who meet the selection criteria should be able to benefit
from the project. In addition, it was agreed during negotiations that around 10 percent of the cows and
tractors would be set aside for minorities. Responsibility for the selection of these beneficiaries was to lie
with the Department of Agriculture, while FAO was responsible for distributing and monitoring the assets.

Implementation of Beneficiary Selection

The project municipalities were selected as outlined in the PAD. The villages and households were selected
by a number of international NGOs (see table below) according to a Letter of Agreement (LOA) signed
between them and the FAO. The NGOs were also responsible for the distribution of the assets,
post-distribution monitoring and technical support. The NGOs were mainly selected based on their
experience and capacity in the selected municipality and their willingness to work with the project.

The LOA maintained most of the selection criteria and processes outlined in the PAD, but made the
following refinements based on discussions between the NGOs, PMT, and World Bank:

Unlike the PAD, the LOA does not mention the local NGO as the agency in charge of implementing the
information campaign.

Household selection. For cows, three criteria were proposed: experience (had a cow before), need (no cow
now, small children, members with special needs), and capacity (shelter, grazing land, feed). For tractors,
two criteria were proposed for the secondary beneficiaries: no access to tractor and at least 1.0 ha of land.
They also had to be willing to abide by the project rules. In addition to these requirements, the primary
beneficiary also had to have experience in operating a tractor and had to be selected by the secondary
beneficiaries. Unlike the PAD, the LOA describes in detail both the primary and secondary beneficiary
selection processes, with the former involving a secret ballot.

Village meetings. For both assets, separate meetings would be held with: (i) the village council and lagje
representatives; (ii) women at the lagje level and women's groups; and (iii) opposition leaders. The third
meeting was optional. Each group would prepare its own beneficiary list and submit it to the NGO. The
NGO would be responsible for consolidating the list and posting the preliminary beneficiary list.

Cow beneficiary verification. All cow beneficiaries should be visited to ascertain if they have the capacity
(shelter, grazing land, feed) to maintain a cow.

Phase 1. During the implementation of the first phase, a few more adjustments were made. The cow
verification process that was designed to check capacity also became an eligibility (experience and need)
verification exercise. In addition, the requirement that a separate beneficiary list be prepared by women
was abolished because few women's groups were active at the village level, and vulnerability criteria were
introduced for the selection of tractor beneficiaries. These adjustments were maintained in the second and
third phases.

According to the supervision review of the beneficiary selection, the phase 1 NGOs conducted the village
and household selection in a satisfactory manner with no major deviations. However, a few issues were
identified. First, village pre-selection was constrained by inadequate and inaccurate data. Second, in
Gllogoc and Skenderaj, the number of available cows was not well understood at the village level, resulting
in a large number of potential beneficiaries needing verification. In Decan, on the other hand, MCI
developed a method of pre-allocation based on village deficiency levels. This method was also used in
phases 2 and 3. Third, beneficiary selection in the minority areas was not considered successful due to
inappropriate implementation arrangements that relied on the under-resourced Department of Agriculture
and a local NGO.

Based on this experience, the following recommendations were made for subsequent phases:

l More effort should be made to increase village level data accuracy.
l Cow villages should be selected based on the number of households who have lost all their cows and
    still do not have a cow. The number of cows allocated to each village should also be based on these
    criteria and made known to the villages before they begin the household selection process.
l Tractor villages should first be ranked according to their ratio of arable land to working tractor. Then
    starting from the top, villages should be selected until the pre-allocated number of tractors for each
    municipality is reached. One tractor per village should be the norm.
l Village councils and their lagje representatives should be responsible for the preparation of the



                                                      - 47 -

     preliminary household lists. To reduce their potential for bias, more effort should be made to
     disseminate information about the beneficiary selection criteria and process. Women should be
     encouraged to participate at the lagje level meetings.
l To the extent possible, minority beneficiary selection should be done in project municipalities and by
     NGOs rather than across the province by the Department of Agriculture.

Phase 2. Based on the lessons of the first phase, a number of adjustments were made to the second LOA:
(i) measures would be taken to improve the accuracy of the village level data; (ii) village councils would be
responsible for the preparation of the preliminary list of households; (iii) the requirement of a separate
beneficiary list by women would be abolished; and (iv) the NGO would be responsible for beneficiary
selection among minority populations in the same municipalities and in line with the same criteria and
processes. Also, the time allocated for the process was shortened from three to two months. According to
the supervision evaluation of the beneficiary selection, while in Vushtrri the process went reasonably well
with no major problems, in Kline the exercise was more problematic. As with the first phase, inadequacy
and inaccuracy of village level data made village selection challenging. Moreover, with time, the available
data became obsolete. To address this problem, more recent village level data was collected from village
councils in Vushtrri and directly from households through a survey in Kline.

In Kline, the municipal department of agriculture demanded that cow village selection be based on war
damage and the department decide (rather arbitrarily) the number of cows allocated to each village. These
numbers were later adjusted, resulting in a number of complaints from villagers and the municipality
withdrawing its cooperation from the project. Another challenge that was encountered related to
tension-ridden primary tractor beneficiary selection meetings in both phase 2 municipalities. This may
have been due to the meetings coinciding with provincial elections or the perception that this was the last
opportunity for significant external support.

Based on this experience, the following recommendations were made for the third phase: (i) collect village
level data from village councils and introduce measures to curb under reporting, and (ii) reduce tensions at
primary tractor beneficiary selection meetings by having an international staff member present.

Phase 3. According to the evaluation, the process was conducted smoothly. Some adjustments were made:
(i) included some large extended families that already had a cow; (ii) lowered the land ownership criteria
for tractor beneficiaries; and (iii) made efforts to improve participation at the lagje level meetings. In
addition, based on the experience of the previous phase, village level data was collected from village
councils and an international staff member was present during primary tractor beneficiary selection
meetings.

Compliance with Criteria

Cow village selection. As already indicated, due to the insistence of the municipality, cow village selection
in Kline was based on war damage. In all other municipalities, the ratio-based method described in the
PAD was followed with a few modifications. In the phase 1 municipalities, the ratio was raised to increase
village coverage, and in Peje, all households having more than five cows were excluded before the ratio was
applied. Overall, few changes were made during the municipal consultations. Changes mainly related to
off-farm income opportunities, other assistance programs, war damage, inaccurate data, and exclusion
from the tractor program.

Tractor village selection. The ratio (20 ha of arable land per tractor) suggested by the PAD did not allow
for the distribution of the tractors allocated to each municipality. In Gllogoc, the ratio was lowered to 10


                                                      - 48 -

ha per tractor and a second tractor was allocated to villages with very high ratios. A few villages were also
later added, mostly due to certain vulnerability considerations and exclusion from the cow program. In
Skenderaj, this lower ratio still did not allow for the distribution of the allocated tractors. Instead of
lowering the ratio again, AAH added villages based on whether or not they had tractor repair services. In
Decan, villages were first ranked according to their ratio of arable land to tractor and then, starting from
the top, selected until the allocated number of tractors was reached. Only one tractor was allocated per
village. In the second and third phases, ACTED and MCI followed a similar approach but had to excluded
a number of villages because they did not have enough (30) households needing tractor services. In Kline,
however, ACTED allocated a second tractor to villages with very high ratios. The above review suggests
that a ranking rather than a ratio method may have proved more useful.

Cow and tractor household selection. According to the monitoring and evaluation surveys conducted
during the project's first two phases, over 90 percent of the heifer beneficiaries met the three most essential
criteria (no cow now, had a cow before, and have a barn now) and about 95 percent of the tractor
beneficiaries met the most essential criterion (no tractor). However, adherence to the more flexible
landholding criterion for tractor beneficiaries was rather low (58 to 76 percent of the secondary
beneficiaries had at least 0.7 ha of land) for both phases, perhaps due to the application of the vulnerability
criteria. Finally, while vulnerability considerations seem to have been applied, female-headed households
were not positively biased. This may be due to the fact that they were either too poor to qualify for the cow
program or they were "hidden" within large, extended families.

Based on the above, the surveys conclude that in the first two phases, the selection process succeeded in
concentrating farm assets on "people needing them and able to benefit from them." However, about 15
percent of the cow beneficiaries in the first phase may have been too poor to benefit from the project. This
was confirmed by a number of cow transfer cases, mostly due to the inability of the household to secure
sufficient feed. Apparently, some village leaders felt obliged to give cows to households that had lost
family members during the war even if they did not meet the capacity criteria.

Beneficiary satisfaction. According to the same surveys, the majority of beneficiaries in all phases were
satisfied with the beneficiary selection criteria and process, including cooperation with the implementing
NGO and the village council. More interestingly, even those who did not benefit from the project
considered the process fair: (41 percent in phase 1, 54 to 71 percent in phase 2, and 65 to 80 percent in
phase 3). However, it should be noted that a qualitative assessment conducted by the local monitoring and
evaluation specialist after the first distribution found that while most village leaders considered the
beneficiary selection criteria sound, a few were concerned that the very poor and those who had lost family
members during the war were not specifically targeted.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Overall, the beneficiary selection process can be considered a success. The targeted beneficiaries were
reached, the key stakeholders were consulted, major conflicts were avoided, and the level of satisfaction
among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries was high. The basic elements of the design were sound and most
of the weaknesses identified during implementation were rectified. Below are a number of conclusions
about the process:

l The initial design overestimated the accuracy of the available village level data and lacked a strategy
    for addressing this issue.
l Preliminary village selection was based on the ratio method outlined above. Municipal consultations,
    on the other hand, required "a fine balance between objectivity and flexibility." This required


                                                       - 49 -

    understanding of and support for project objectives and implementation mechanisms by the municipal
    officials.
l The preparation of the preliminary household lists by the village councils and the finalization of these
    lists (through the verification process) by the NGOs was the most effective and efficient way to select
    the cow beneficiaries. Most of the village councils seem to have made their selections in a responsible
    manner and the verification eliminated many households that did not met the project criteria.
l In some cases, tension and conflict accompanied the selection of the primary tractor beneficiary.
    Successful implementation required delicate mediation by NGO staff, including the presence of their
    international staff. Often, the PMT and municipal officials also played a key role.
l Minority beneficiary selection improved significantly during the last two phases when the same NGOs
    were responsible for the process and the same criteria was applied.
l The process required considerable preparation and planning, including substantive discussions between
    the NGOs and the PMT. Successful implementation required at least three months and substantive
    (and regular) inputs from the international rural sociologist.

The above review demonstrates that high value resources can be distributed to targeted households even in
an emergency or post-conflict situation. While the country context and type of resource being distributed
will determine the applicability of this experience to other project situations, the following lessons might
apply.

l The design and implementation of the beneficiary selection process benefits from the consolidation of
    inputs by the sociologists and the relevant technical experts, as well as the active engagement of the
    responsible implementing agency.
l The selection criteria should be simple and easily verifiable.
l It is important to clearly identify key stakeholders and their roles (give advice or make decisions) based
    on their comparative advantages.
l Humanitarian NGOs are more likely than local administrative structures to make unbiased selections.
l To improve the accountability and transparency of the process, information about the project and the
    beneficiary selection process should be disseminated through stakeholder consultations, community
    meetings and printed materials.

Additional Annex 11. Summary of Benefits and Impacts by Component


Component I: Re-establishing the Cattle Herd

Benefits and impact. Shortly after the conflict, the immediate benefit of cattle distribution was in improved
food security (through milk) for impoverished farmers (households), while generating income from sales of
milk and meat would be a benefit which would develop at a later stage after normalization of the situation.
However, bringing considerable numbers of quality cattle into rural Kosovo went beyond individual
benefits. By distributing these improved breeds, the project stimulated modernization of the livestock sector
in Kosovo. Improved animal husbandry techniques, feeding and veterinary care were required and were
introduced by the project in order to keep the animals in a successful way. Rewards from such inputs will
be from higher milk and meat production. The larger impact of this project component lies, therefore, in
revitalizing and upgrading dairy cattle keeping, showing new opportunities, and stimulating farmers to
expand livestock production.

Beneficiary selection. The Beneficiary Assessment revealed that the selection criteria were adhered to and
that, with a few exceptions, the persons selected as beneficiaries were those most in need. Moreover, the
selection criteria for becoming recipients (adequate accommodation/stable for the beast, ability to provide
food, previous experience keeping cattle, willingness to service project cow beneficiaries, the number of
children in the family, and difficult living conditions) were widely communicated and understood. The final
project evaluation survey found that: (i) about 90 percent of the respondents were satisfied with the
beneficiary selection and (ii) 60 percent were very satisfied. Overall satisfaction with the project, including
all components, scores over 90 percent. Eighty-five percent of the respondents reported that they learned
something from the project (15% a lot, 55% some, and 15% little).

Satisfaction with breed. The final evaluation survey indicated that about 62 percent of respondents were
very satisfied with the breed received, while 90 percent of beneficiaries were very satisfied and satisfied.
Asked about the breed farmers would have chosen if they had the choice, 71 percent of the respondents
would have chosen Simmental, 10 percent Brown Swiss, 11 percent Grauvieh, while 3 percent would have
preferred Busha cattle, and 6 percent Holstein Friesians.

Herd development. Of the 4,399 pregnant heifers which were distributed by the project, to date 4,188 are
alive and productive (milk and off-spring). A total of 3,660 animals (83.2 percent) are still at the farm of
the beneficiary and 480 (10.9 percent) cows are at other farms. Of a total 4,326 calves born, 3,793 are
alive. A total of 3,198 (73.9 percent) are at the farm of birth, and 595 (11.4 percent) are at other farms.
The last figure includes calves given to other needy families, in some cases farmers preferred to give the
first calf. About 800 grown female calves from the first phase have already given birth to their first calf
and are producing milk. The importation of 4,399 heifers and 92 bulls, which started in November 2000,
grew till present to a herd of over 9,000 animals. The distributed project bulls contributed considerably to
upgrading the national herd. Annual services per bull reportedly range between 85 and 100 cows.
Subtracting about 20 of percent services for project heifers, on average 6,000 local cows were served
annually. This is number is expected to increase further when farmers keep pedigree bulls, born from the
imported pregnant heifers, for breeding purposes.

Benefits. Beneficiaries reported positive effects of the project in general. They noted as important aspects,
improved food security through milk for themselves as well as sharing with other poor families -- milk
consumption: 72 percent for household, 5 percent for neighbors/family, 14 percent for calf and 9 percent



                                                      - 51 -

sold. Income generation through sales of milk only applies to individual cases, as most beneficiary
households consume all milk or share it with relatives or other households. Selling of the calf or
occasionally the cow generated income in a number of cases. Only very few mentioned envy of neighbors
as a negative effect. The higher feed requirement, although compensated by high milk production, appears
to have been a problem in some occasions. Many beneficiaries felt that the project mainly contributed to
food security rather than had an effect on agricultural development in general. Bull recipients expressed
their appreciation for having received a bull. Most of them reported positive experiences with mating their
own or others' cows in their own or neighboring villages.

Farmer training. Farmer training, provided by the project prior to distribution of cattle, was appraised as
very important and necessary. However, understandably, farmers were less receptive to the training at
beginning of the project as their living conditions were still extremely difficult. Beneficiaries indicated that
more training of the farmers would have been very beneficial especially in the case of young farmers. In
occasional situations decomposed concentrate feed seems to have been distributed. This might be due to
unfamiliarity with the use of concentrate, which led to incorrect storage and use. The training of bull
recipients which covered feeding, care, and adaptation of the animal to the new environment was
appreciated.

Benefits from bull services. Bull services for project cows were mainly provided free of charge to
neighbors. The contract between project and recipient indicates a charge, however bull owners preferred
increased good-will rather than payment. Although the bull had very little effect on household income, the
positive effect of the project was seen in the bulls serving cows of neighbors and in neighboring villages,
and improving the local breeds. Income from the bull would come sooner or later as the bull would
eventually be slaughtered, or by charging for bull services now that living conditions in the village are
improving. Almost no negative effects were reported by bull recipients ­ occasional cases of poor
performance of the bull were reported leading to tension with neighbors, but in general the service of the
bulls was seen as positive for the community.

Component II: Rehabilitation of Veterinary Services

Benefits and impact. Direct benefit of rehabilitation veterinary services was a top priority for all private
veterinarians in Kosovo. They received veterinary drugs and equipment through the project and could
therefore re-engage in veterinary practice shortly after the conflict. However, the overall impact of this
component was much greater. Shortly after the conflict, it secured province-wide clinical veterinary
services; revitalized AI services in Kosovo and introduced AI in rural areas; exposed the veterinary
profession to modern veterinary techniques and treatments; stimulated the development of private
veterinary praxis and input supply; provided support to CVDL which resulted in the development of a
crucial public service to the livestock sector; and provided support to AI/BC, which resulted in AI/BC
redefining its role and development of a comprehensive breeding policy. The main impact of this component
lies, therefore, in its improvement and activation of private and public veterinary services for development
of an emerging livestock sector.

Private veterinary services. The project supplied basic veterinary equipment (drugs, inseminator kits and
semen) to 106 private veterinarians across Kosovo. About one-fifth of the veterinarians are from minority
areas. All veterinarians felt that the assistance was needed to start or restart veterinary practices. Training
courses in veterinary subjects, such as reproductive health, mastitis, surgery and feeding as well refresher
training in artificial insemination were provided. Although some contradictions are expressed in the
beneficiary assessment, the general impression remains that the project secured critical animal health
services shortly after the end of the conflict, and as such addressed a priority need of farmers. For all


                                                      - 52 -

veterinarians re-launching their praxis was essential in generating income as only one veterinarian reported
having secondary income from a store. Support in rebuilding the national herd as provided under EFRP is
seen by the veterinarians as very important. It is expected to increase the need for veterinary services and
provide an opportunity to expand their business. The equipment and drugs supplied under the project were
appropriate and much appreciated by the veterinarians. Some veterinarians reported that the materials
supplied meant an opportunity to broaden their professional skills. Some complaints were made about short
shelf life or even expired drugs. Practitioner training. In general, it appears that training in AI by the
international artificial insemination/breeding specialist and courses by the international veterinary clinical
consultant were appropriate. This is in line with information obtained while visiting various veterinary
clinics. During those visits additional practical clinical training was requested, especially in relation to
modern treatment techniques and new veterinary drugs now available in Kosovo.

Satisfaction with veterinary services. The final survey shows that total satisfaction with veterinary services
scored about 90 percent, this includes very satisfied (30 percent) and satisfied farmers. Less satisfaction
exists with AI services, about 50 percent expressed satisfaction including only a very small group of very
satisfied farmers (7 percent). Importance of a Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL). The
requirement for a competent laboratory to support diagnoses of veterinary practitioners and assist with the
control of major diseases was confirmed at the onset of the project. Contrary to original planning, it was
concluded that one central veterinary laboratory in Pristina would be sufficient to meet the needs of the
province. The main role of CVDL is seen as two-fold, namely to: (a) support the individual livestock owner
through accurate diagnosis of livestock disease problems, and (b) support the livestock industry as a whole
through diagnosis and constant surveillance of economically important diseases, especially those in the
Lists A and B of the OIE, with consequent advice on improved control. The laboratory is expected to
provide essential service in the diagnosis and control of zoonotic infections that spread from livestock to
man. The lab would also contribute significantly to the early detection of exotic diseases and the
maintenance of high standards of food hygiene, as well as the importation and exportation of quality
livestock. The EFRP supported the CVDL in becoming operational. The assistance included rehabilitation
of the laboratory building, provision of necessary laboratory equipment, and training of staff. Although a
fully equipped laboratory is now available, unclear ownership/user rights of the building, shared
responsibilities with the agriculture faculty, and weak managerial capacity within CVDL hinder the proper
functioning of the laboratory. Despite continued efforts of project management and repeated discussions on
this issue with authorities during supervision missions, little progress was made to resolve the issue.

AI/Breeding Center. Support to the AI/Breeding Center led to defining the role of the Center in a post
conflict Kosovo within the broader framework of the Ministry of Agriculture and KVS. This is a role
which is now exclusively regulatory while the private sector meets the demand for semen, AI equipment
and liquid nitrogen. Its functions include: (i) regulatory ­ AI semen importation certification, bull semen
testing, breed standards; (ii) providing a national breeding policy; (iii) linking with EU livestock
identification program; (iv) establishing breed societies or national breeders association with herd books for
each species and breed; (v) providing practical AI courses for veterinarians and technicians certified by
KVS/MAFRD; and (vi) providing farmer extension training at the municipal level. With support from the
project and in close collaboration with MAFRD, a comprehensive Kosovo breeding policy for cattle, sheep,
goats, pigs, horses, chicken, buffalo and dogs was developed. In addition, an outline of the
functions and role of the Animal Production Department within MAFRD was discussed. Inclusion of
breeding data in the Animal Identification and Registration system, which is presently established by KVS,
was secured.

Component III: Machinery Repair and Replacement

Tractor Repair. Both NGOs participating in the tractor repair program were already operating
agricultural machinery repair programs in Kosovo, and had developed suitable methodology and
procedures for selecting beneficiaries and implementing the repair program. The NGOs had some
differences in procedures, but in general, three steps were taken. Initially, a survey was conducted in each
village with the assistance of the municipality and village councils, which included demographic and
agricultural statistics, and number of working and repairable tractors and other farm machinery. The target
villages were then selected based primarily on a high ratio of arable land per working tractor (i.e. a high
tractor deficit) and a detailed assessment of repair needs. Finally, within villages, the aim was to prioritize
farmers that: (a) were involved in agricultural production with available land; (b) owned a damaged tractor;
(c) were among the most vulnerable; (d) had a tractor with a relatively low repair cost; and (e) were willing
to assist others without tractors to cultivate their land.

Following selection and examination of tractors, lists were prepared by the NGOs of the spare parts to be
replaced and the repair services required for each tractor. Vouchers were then issued to the beneficiaries,
which were used to obtain the supplies and, if necessary, repair services from designated local suppliers.
The suppliers were selected on a competitive basis by the NGO, with a total of 14 local suppliers used
during the three programs. The repairs were classified in three broad categories: category 1 primarily
included tractors with slight damage (e.g. battery, alternator, starter, tires, etc.); category 2 included
tractors with substantial damage (e.g. fuel/water pumps, brake systems, etc.) but not requiring the engine to
be dismantled; and category 3 included tractors with heavy damage and requiring overhaul of engine and
other internal parts. For most category 1 cases, the beneficiaries installed the spare parts themselves; for
category 2, the repairs were generally carried out on-farm with the assistance of the local mechanics; for
category 3, the heavy repairs were normally carried out in the repair shop by the local mechanics. In
addition to the vouchers, the beneficiaries were provided with a contract or letter of agreement that included
an obligation to carry out 0.5 ha of land cultivation for each DM 250 of parts supplied. This
requirement corresponded to an in-kind cost recovery of about 25 percent. However, considering the large
number of tractors and the high cost to monitor this obligation was based on trust and the willingness of the
beneficiary rather than on a contractual basis, and was not enforced or monitored. Various verification
surveys were carried out after each program to determine whether all spare parts had been distributed and
fitted, and whether the tractors were in working order. These surveys were carried out independently by the
project and participating NGOs. In summary, about 24 percent of the beneficiaries were checked, and
indicated that: (a) all had received all of the spare parts included on their vouchers; (b) around 96 to 98
percent had fitted all the spare parts, with the most common explanation for non-compliance being that
some owners had not fitted the new tires provided as they were waiting for the old ones to completely
expire; and (c) only a few tractors were not in good working order, including one that needed an engine
overhaul.

Machinery Replacement

Village and beneficiary selection. The selection of villages and beneficiaries was sub-contracted to
international NGOs, namely Mercy Corps (MCI), Action Against Hunger (AAH) and ACTED. Target
villages were initially intended to be selected based on a threshold exceeding 20 ha of arable land per
working tractor. However, modifications were made during implementation such that the actual thresholds
were generally lower, ranging from 15 ha in Decan to 7.5 ha in Peje, partly depending on the number of
tractors available for distribution. Following village selection, a group of about 30 beneficiaries in each
village was identified by the Village Council in consultation and discussion with the contracted NGO. A
primary beneficiary (PB) was then elected by a vote of the members of the beneficiary group following


                                                       - 54 -

presentations and discussions on the program by the NGO and members of the PMT. The PBs were
expected to have had previous tractor-driving experience, and have the interest and available time (i.e. not
employed off the farm) to carry out their obligations. A Village Cultivation Committee made up of three
SBs was also elected at the meeting. To a large extent, the selection was based on the specified criteria and
the most needy villagers were identified. From survey data, almost 90 percent of the beneficiaries were
satisfied with the process, and even 71 percent of the non-beneficiaries were satisfied. Occasionally, there
were some aggrieved parties following the voting process, but overall the democratic process led to the
selection of worthy and responsible PBs who were fully aware of their obligations. A few villages were
unable to select a PB and were not included in the program if the situation could not be resolved. These
problems were most frequent
in the second phase municipalities, Kline and Vushtrri, with seven and eight villages excluded respectively.
In comparison, only two villages were excluded in Peje. Part of the reason for exclusion can be attributed to
the reduced time for mobilization and facilitation (only two months rather than three months) resulting from
the delays in contracting the NGO. Nevertheless, the excluded villages were only a small proportion of the
total 176 villages selected. The process also helped to make the SBs fully aware of the obligations of the
PBs, which resulted in additional social pressure on the PBs to meet their obligations. The cultivation order
was determined by a drawing, and there was little evidence to suggest that this order was not generally
respected.

Minority areas. In the first phase, 10 tractors were also distributed to farmers in minority areas, including 9
in Serbian villages and one in an Albanian enclave. This program was implemented by the Department of
Agriculture, assisted during the selection process by a Serbian NGO, in some areas and in cooperation with
the UNMIK local community officer in other areas. In the second and third phases, the minority
beneficiaries were fully incorporated into the selection procedures and programs of the participating NGOs,
Mercy Corps and ACTED.

Cost recovery. As specified in the project design, each primary beneficiary had a contractual obligation to
carry out land preparation on at least 0.5 ha for 30 secondary beneficiaries (SBs) over four seasons, i.e. 15
ha each season or 60 ha in total. There was solid understanding of the obligations by the PB and SBs,
partly because the PB was elected by the SBs in a transparent and fair voting procedure following a
complete explanation of the program. The SBs were expected to contribute to the cost of fuel (about DM
20 per ha), although the PB often excused the most needy from this obligation. The PBs were also required
to contribute six days of transport work for the community each year, and carry out activities on their own
land and for other non-beneficiary farmers.

Monitoring. The monitoring process was well organized in each program. Log books were used to record
all work done by the PB was maintained for each tractor, and vouchers were provided by the SBs to the PB
following completion of the required work. Duplicate copies of the vouchers and log books were provided
for monitoring purposes. The municipal mechanization technician (MMT) for each municipality visited
each PB regularly to inspect the log books and vouchers to monitor the work done, whether tractor services
were completed on schedule, and follow up on any complaints. Overall, the system enabled the project to
keep a firm grip on the program as a whole, to identify and solve problems as they arose, and contributed to
the good performance of the cost recovery scheme. Letters were sent to those PBs falling behind by more
than 10 percent of their required obligation, which informed the PB that the tractor could be re-possessed if
the obligation was not met.

Verification. After completion of the obligation, but before the formal transfer of ownership, the project
verified compliance by checking with the Village Cultivation Committee (which is also a secondary
beneficiary), and investigated any complaints from SBs. The verification process was completed for all


                                                     - 55 -

first phase PBs in Gllogoc, Decan and Skenderaj. An investigation was necessary in only one case in
Gllogoc (out of 120 tractors) and the dispute was resolved.

Hand-over. For those PBs who completed their obligation, the license plates and registration certificates
were formally handed over at a ceremony in the municipality. This presentation provided positive
reinforcement of the program. Money was collected from the PBs for the cost of registration and license
plates at a cost ranging from US$134 to 250, depending on the licensing regulations in force at the time.
This process was very time-consuming for the mechanization staff, both to collect funds and carry out the
transfer of ownership. Nevertheless, 93 tractors out of 120 were formally handed over by April 2003.
Overall, the selection and implementation procedures were generally well planned and organized in each
program, and can be rated satisfactory. Although there were some challenges during implementation, the
procedures were flexible and thorough and allowed early identification of problems, a good selection
process, and sufficient pressure on PBs to comply with their obligations.

Benefits and Impact

Tractor repair program. Overall, a total of 2,414 damaged tractors were repaired and restored to working
order, substantially more than the 1,600 projected at appraisal. In most cases, the beneficiaries indicated
that they would have eventually been able to repair the least-damaged tractors themselves, although it
would have taken some time, but that it would have been very difficult for them to repair the most damaged
tractors. Nearly all beneficiaries agreed that the repair program had enabled them start up the cultivation of
their land sooner than they would have otherwise been able to. From the survey data, an average of about
85 percent of the beneficiaries indicated that they were satisfied with the repair program and 74 percent
indicated that they had earned or saved additional money following the repair. No respondents indicated
that they had lost from the program. Beneficiaries also indicated that they had averaged 44 percent more
plowing and transport work following the tractor repair, with an average of over 0.8 ha per of their own
land cultivated per season.

The direct beneficiaries were also asked to share some of the benefits with non-beneficiary farmers by
plowing about 0.5 ha of land for each DM 250 of repairs. This obligation was not monitored to determine
compliance, and it appears that many beneficiaries were not aware of the contractual agreement to provide
such services. Nevertheless, many beneficiaries indicated that they helped out relatives, friends and the
needy in their village to varying degrees in transportation and/or cultivation work, and sometimes earned
income from services. In one village, for example, the beneficiaries estimated that only about 40 percent of
the families had working tractors, but that essentially all families were able to cultivate their land each
season as required. From limited survey data, it appears that the beneficiaries plowed an average of over
0.5 ha of other people's land each season. An important additional benefit of the tractor repair programs
was derived from assisting in the re-establishment of 14 local repair shops. The average cost to repair the
damaged tractor was around US$685, which represents about 10 percent of the cost of an equally new,
locally produced tractor. Accordingly, the program was considered a good value for the money as well as a
considerable benefit to the local agricultural community. Overall, the various donor and NGO programs
assisted in the repair of around 14,500 tractors following the conflict, of which the project financed about
17 percent.

Machinery replacement program. A total of 202 tractor and implement sets were provided in 176 villages,
which resulted in an overall reduction in the tractor deficit in those villages. The direct benefit was to
primary beneficiaries who received the tractor and equipment. From survey data, all (100 percent) of the
beneficiaries were happy with the tractor, and only 2 percent would have selected an IMT model instead. In
addition, some 96 percent were satisfied with the equipment provided, which was intended for emergency


                                                     - 56 -

cultivation following the conflict, despite the limited use in some cases and the challenges discussed above.
However, when asked, some PBs indicated that other equipment such as a grain drill, maize drill, power
cultivator, and hay-making machines might have been more useful under their particular circumstances.
The average cost of the tractor and implement set was around US$16,000. However, although not directly
comparable, locally manufactured equipment would have been substantially cheaper, and a larger number
of beneficiaries could have been included.

In addition to the 202 PBs, around 6,000 secondary beneficiaries also benefited from the program through
two seasons of land preparation work. The survey data indicated that only about 10 percent of SBs were
not satisfied with the services provided by the PB. However, only one formal complaint was made by SBs
during the verification process. Also, the Village Cultivation Committee was generally very positive about
the performance of the PB and expressed satisfaction with the program. Two SBs of each tractor were
normally interviewed during the monitoring process by the MMT, with a high degree of satisfaction
generally expressed. The monitoring data indicated that all first phase PBs had completed 60 ha of plowing
for SBs or around 2 ha per SB. However, the draft final evaluation survey indicated that the average was
only about 1.4 ha for each SB in the survey. A number of possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy
was revealed during field visits which include: (a) some SBs allocated part or all of their entitlement to
other farmers if they did not wish to have their land cultivated, or if the area to be plowed was less than 0.5
ha; (b) many SBs requested two passes with the plow in one season, which would often be registered as two
ploughings (1 ha) in the monitoring data and reported as only 0.5 ha of land cultivation by the SB; and (c)
one case was found where the SB handed in the voucher without having his field plowed, based on an
agreement to carry out the work in future seasons.

Component IV: Capacity Building

On-going support was provided to strengthen the day-to-day functions of the MAFRD. This support
comprised on-the-job training and advice provided by international and local experts, public administration
as well as information management and communication consultancies, and trainings in the English
language and computer skills. As to the second development objective, improvement of the capacity of the
MAFRD to formulate and implement specific agricultural and rural development policies, eight major,
specific studies and policies to support the future development of agriculture were completed in the fields
of: (i) veterinary border control; (ii) phytosanitary border control; (iii) water resources and irrigation; (iv)
producers' associations; (v) agro-chemicals; (vi) fertilizers; (vii) macro-economic study; and (viii)
agricultural and rural services. All the studies were realized jointly by the CBC experts and the respective
counterparts in MAFRD, and were considered by the latter as very good on-the-job training. The CBC
supported the initiative of MAFRD to formulate an Agricultural Development Strategy Document (Green
Book) through facilitation and coordination of the work of the Ministry staff, information gathering and
analysis, and moderation of group meeting discussions and workshops. The numerous studies,
consultancies, major findings, recommendations, agricultural strategy and policy options proposed by
different CBC experts also constituted a good and reliable basis for this important document. Several
working groups were created in the MAFRD, covering sub-sectors and major cross-cutting issues.

Two major sub-sector studies (dairy and horticulture sub-sectors) were undertaken in view of the
importance of these sub-sectors for the rural economy. Both studies presented a good overview of the
existing situation in their respective sub-sectors regarding production, collection and processing, and
marketing issues. They raised key issues related to the institutional development of the sub-sectors, and
proposed rather comprehensive technical and policy measures for the development of the sub-sector. The
studies were characterized by strong involvement of local experts and counterparts especially in the first
stages, and large field investigations.

Benefit and Impact.

Strengthening of the day-to-day functioning of the MAFRD. This support comprised on-the-job training
and advice provided by international and local experts on public administration as well as information
management and communication consultancies, and training sessions in English and computer skills. The
Ministry structure was fully revised and largely improved in the following areas: administration,
organizational and management functions and skills (including recruitment procedures, a comprehensive
filing structure, accounting system and financial procedures as well as planning and reporting and
coordination procedures between the departments) and articulation of issues and solutions. This led to
improved organization, internal procedures and information management, and exchange between different
departments. It has also led to the improvement of the overall structuring and functioning of the Ministry
and strengthening the capacity of its staff in actual decision making, exchanging views, debating policy and
strategy issues, etc. Although further improvement of the MAFRD structure and functioning of specific
departments is still needed, the Ministry staff are now fully aware and capable of making use of the
existing structure and functions and have the necessary capacities to build on for future improvements.

Improved capacity of the MAFRD staff to analyze, formulate and implement specific policies. The ten
studies undertaken (including two sub-sector and eight specific ones) provided comprehensive diagnosis of
the current situation for their respective sector and proposed relevant measures, draft regulations, and
policies to be implemented mostly in the short and medium term. MAFRD staff have since been
considerably involved and contributed in the realization of these studies. MAFRD staff consider the studies
as 'very good on-the-job training and a good chance to learn and apply new approaches'. Also, improving
their methodological knowledge, their capacity to analyze sub-sector and specific issues and formulate
policies and action plans. On the other hand, the level of their understanding and ownership of the
recommendations and policy options presented in the studies is considered very high. Most of the
recommendations and policy options were adopted and further developed by MAFRD staff during the
finalization of the Agricultural Policy Document (Green Book). The support of the CBC during the whole
process of the formulation of the Green Book (through facilitation and coordination of the work of the
Ministry staff, information gathering and analysis, and moderation of group meeting discussions and
workshops) was highly appreciated by most of the MAFRD representatives and staff. The numerous
studies, consultancies, major findings, recommendations, agricultural strategy and policy options proposed
by different CBC experts also constituted a good and reliable basis for this document. During the process,
the CBC team worked closely Ministry staff. This involvement was considered good on-the-job training by
MAFRD staff, and contributed to the establishment and consolidation of the Policy Unit and improved
relations with other technical departments. It also led to considerable improvement of the capacity of Policy
Unit staff, especially regarding policy analysis and formulation and in their day-to-day work. This
improved capacity of the Ministry staff skills became apparent when the Ministry staff, led by the Policy
Unit staff, took the lead in processing the final revision of the Green Book. Several parts of this document
were largely improved and the results of public consultations, including the Kosovo Agricultural Policy
Workshop, were incorporated. Today, the Ministry staff take full ownership of the Green Book and think of
it as the official statement of the Ministry for the future short- and medium-term development of the sector.

Improved capacity to draft new legislations and regulations. Legal expertise was provided to MAFRD staff
and especially to the Legal Department staff in improving technical knowledge and procedures for drafting
legislation and regulation on several issues. Two major legal studies were realized, setting up future
regulatory framework; one was related to agro-chemicals and pesticides and the other to fertilizers.
Prepared in cooperation with the International Fertilizers Development Center, which constituted a
methodological bases for drafting of the new legislation and regulations in other sectors. The technical


                                                      - 58 -

capacities of the Legal Department staff have since significantly improved, easing the process of revising
existing drafts and formulating new laws.

Improved cooperation and coordination with other stakeholders. Another important benefit from the CBC
activities was derived from the organization and facilitation of meetings and discussions between MAFRD
and other stakeholders, including municipalities, private sector, etc. This led to increased exchange of
information, better coordination of activities and more generally to creation of a working environment that
is more acceptable to both parties. MAFRD is now making more efforts to find ways to improve the
cooperation and coordination of different development activities with several municipalities and other
stakeholders throughout the province.
