The lessons\n            drawn from this project include: When the disease burden is\n            high, the centralized vertical organizational structure is\n            useful. When the disease burden is reduced, an integrated\n            approach is more efficient. The role of the states in\n            project implementation needs to be strengthened. It is\n            important to strengthen the capacity of the general health\n            system to address long-term issue of diagnosis and\n            treatment. Effective program management requires high\n            quality, up-to-date epidemiological and management\n            information. It is important to increasingly embed leprosy\n            control activities in the General Health System. Effective\n            targeted program require high levels of coverage and\n            saturation, and the identification, reach and coverage of\n            hard-to-reach groups, particularly urban poor, women and\n            scheduled tribes/castes, remain challenging. There is a need\n            for a clear and well-coordinated strategy, which\n            incorporates various Information, Education, and\n            Communication interventions to meet well-defined goals. It\n            is important to be aware of epidemiological changes and to\n            change project design and implementation accordingly.\n            Monitoring activities should be an integral part of the\n            routine functions of the program and cannot be ad hoc\n            activities linked solely to a Bank's supervision mission."}, "docdt": "2001-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
