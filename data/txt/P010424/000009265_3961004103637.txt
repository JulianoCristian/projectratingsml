NEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DP.VELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR A NATIONAL LEPROSY ELIMINATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to India
is submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 60.0 million (US$85.0 million
equivalent), would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The credit
would help finance a National Leprosy Elimination Project. The proceeds of the
credit would be passed by the Government of India (GOI) to the States and Union
Territories in accordance with standard arrangements for development assistavce to
States and Union Territories.
2.        Country/Sector Backgroumd.  India is one of the few countries where
leprosy is a major public health problem, accounting for one third of the global
leprosy load. Currently, there are approximately 2.2 million people with leprosy in
India and 300,000 new leprosy cases arise annually. Leprosy control progressed
slowly before the 1980s, largely because program inputs were limited and the
medicines available were not very effective. A breakthrougih resulted in the early
1980s from the development of multidrug therapy (MDT), which, was successfully
introduced in 135 high endemicity districts.
3.        The National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP) is centrally sponsored by
the Union Government and is carried out by the States and District Leprosy
Societies. Central expenditures average Rs. 220 million (US$6.7 million) per year.
Despite progress over the last ten years, the program faces important constraints.
First, funding has been sufficient to cover with MDT only about half the districts
requiring it. Second, there has been little funding for disability care. This is
very important since deformity causes much of the social stigma associated with
leprosy. Third, improvements could be made in the use of existing sectoral
resources. Fourth, greater attention is needed to social perceptions of leprosy and
gender concerns. India aims at arresting the disease among known cases by the turn
of the century. India could achieve this goal if it speeds up progress in
addressing the above constraints.
4.        Lessons of Kinerience.  There is no past Bank Group experience in
financing leprosy control in India. However, the Bank has sponsored the Special
Program for Tropical Disease Research and Training, which developed the multidrug
regimen with UNDP and WHO, and the proposed project would build upon considerable
local and international experience with leprosy, among which the richest experience
is found in India. The main conclusions to date include: (a) appropriate technology
is critical to success, (b) a vertical monopurpose infrastructure is necessary for
effective service delivery in high prevalence areas, where the disease burden cannot
be handled by the general health staff, while integration with the regular health
system is more cost-effective in moderate prevalence regions; (c) disability care
must be provided as deformity constitutes the patient's single most important
concern; (d) patient segregation is detrimental, unnecessary, and hinders the
effectiveness of leprosy control activities by breeding defaulters and deterring
Fatients from seeking treatment; (e) health education which relies on formal methods
in high illiteracy communities has limited effectiveness; (f) responsibility to deal
with the disease must be promoted at the community level; and (g) surveillance of
contacts is necessary because of the clustering tendency of leprosy.

5.        xnerigence of Bank-assisted Projecta.  IDA has assisted in financing seven
population projects, one maternal and child health project, one AIDS control
project, and four nutrition projects in Tndia. Most projects have generally been or
are being implemented satisfactorily. However, many of them suffered initial delays
and two recent nutrition projects have started more slowly and with less attention
to quality than planned. Two completed population projects met most of their
localized project objectives, although they had little systemic impact on the
overall program for population and maternal and child health. A third completed
population project was quite successful in one state but less in another. The
completed Tamil Nadu Nutrition Project had a positive impact on the nutrition status
of malnourished children. The ongoing Fourth and Fifth Population Projects are
already showing positive results on morbidity and fertility. The National AIDS
Control Project is being implemented in accordance with plans. Experience in social
sector projects, however, suggests that greater attention needs to be paid to
financing and management, beneficiary participation ir. planning project activities,
supervision of staff, training -,f personnel, the supply of necessary materials, and
sustainability, especially in the present environmen. of adjustment. Major impacts
have occurred only when projects have focused on refining program approaches,
strategies and technologies.
6.        Coumtry Assistanc.e Strategv and Rationale for IDA's Involvement.
General. IDA aims to assist India in speeting economic development and
poverty alleviation by supporting structural adjustment and liberalization in key
areas such as trade and finance. IDA also aims to encourage more rapid poverty
alleviation by helping India direct greater attention to human capital issues and
improve the coverage, quality, efficiency and effectiveness of India's human
resource development programs.
7.        Secporal.  IDA's strategy for public health in India is to assist and
further advance the Government's policy in controlling major endemic diseases before
the turn of the century, while simultaneously improving quality, effectiveness and
efficiency of health sys'ems in a sustainable manner. In support of this strategy,
the National AIDS Control Project was brought to the Board in 1992. IDA is also
working with the Government in preparation of the control of pulmonary tuberculosis,
malaria, cataract blindness, and a model for strengthening state health systems.
These health development interventions would be in addition to our ongoing and
future portfolio in population, nutrition, safe motherhood and child survival. In
this context, IDA places considerable emphasis on the importance of improving the
health status of India's poorer citizens so they and their children may be more
productive and enjoy a better quality of life.
8.        The Project and Added Value of IDA's Involvement.  The elimination of
leprosy is one of several priority interventions identified by the Government in the
health sector. IDA's assistance in leprosy control was also recommended in a 1992
IDA health financing study. In addition, the proposed project would link closely
with the recent Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Credit, which incorporated a
focus on endemic disease control including the Leprosy Program. Studies done on
leprosy have shown that treating leprosy and related disabilities has a high social
rate of return and should be a high priority for investment in public health. The
importance of helping India deal with leprosy is heightened by the fact that the
disease causes deformities and by the extreme social stigma attached to affected
people. IDA's assistance would allow GOI to accelerate the elimination of leprosy,
and when low levels of prevalence and transmission are reached, the disease
spontaneously dissipates in a gradual manner. Without IDA assistance in this
effort, progress in leprosy elimination would be slower and a significant pool of
1.2 million people with leprosy would remain at the turn of the century.



-3-
9.        Collaboration with IDA would bring added value and efficiency to the
program through promotion of an appropriate mix of service del'very mechanisms,
policies and strategies, provision of a wider and more effective package of
services, and expansion of the use of appropriate technology.
10.       Project Objectives.  The ultimate objective of the project is to eliminate
leprosy as a public health problem in India .y the year 2000 by reducing the
prevalence from 2.4 per 1,000 to 0.1 per 1,000 nationwide. The secord objective of
the project is to reduce the impact of leprosy disability.
11.       Prolect Descilption.  The project would finance the incremental cost of a
six-year cime slice of an enhanced National Leprosy Eradication Program. The IDA
proceeds would be used to finance contractual services for health personnel, anti-
leprosy medicines, medical and office equipment, medical material and supplies,
medical/surgical services, training and workshops, publicity services, vehicles, and
incremental vehicle ooeration costs and honoraria. The project would support the
NLEP, with a focus on program enhancements in five activities: (a) eggaMign of
multidrug therapy throug' a vertical structure targeting 66 high-endemicity
districts, providing outreach services to the community and service circuits
designed with the participation of the beneficiary population, and strengthening
current control operations in 135 other districts with high prevalence; (b)
integration of mul-tidug therasy into the general health care system in 77
intermediate-endemicity districts and pockets of infection; (c) disability care and
RrevntnYion through health education, preventive precautions, physiotherapy,
supportive medicines, ulcer care and reconstructive surgery; (d) 2romoting public
awareness and community p&rticination through village awareness camps, non-formal
methods of education, mass media and interpersonal education by health personnel
with emphasis on the importance of early treatmeJit and gender concerns; and (e)
enhancing skills and institutional develogment through the provision of short-term
training to 160,000 officers and multi-purpose staff and strengthening program
coordination capabilities.
12.       The project would be coordinated by the Central Leprosy Coordi- nation
Unit of the Union Ministry of Health, and would be implemented by the States and
their District Leprosy Societies. GOI would monitor its progress and observe
implementation of central policies and technical guidelines. It would carlv out
procurement of MDT, medical equipment, and mass media services. GOI would pass to
the States the goods procured and would finance the entire project costs borne by
them. Also, the NLEL works with a variety of NGOs and external donors such xs WHO,
DANIDA and SIDA and will continue to do so. Project plans were coordinated with
these agencies, which assisted in preparation and appraisal.
13.       Prject  gst8. G01 expenditure on leprosy control, which is a centrally
sponsored scheme, has been about Rs. 1,601 million over the last six years. The
total cost of the enhanced program for the next six years would be Rs. 5,396 million
(US$138.3 million equivalent). IDA would finance 61.5% of the total cost of the
program over the next six years, which is equivalent to 89.70 of the increment or
US$85.0 million equivalent, net of taxes, of the enhanced program over the program
of the past six years. GOI would finance 38.5% of the total project cost or US$53.3
million equivalent including all taxes estimated at US$3.4 million equivalent. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. In order
to facilitate a timely project start, retroactive financing up to US$3.0 million
would be provided for eligible expenditures incurred after March 31, 1993. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations

in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraital Report, No. 11735-
IN, dated June 4, 1993, is being distributed separately.
14.      ftataluLailitZ.  At project completion, there would be a net reduction in
annual expenditures on leprosy due to the completion of the intensive phase of
control activities, the sharp decline of the leprosy caseload and its dissipation as
a public health problem.
15.       GOI has expressed its intent to improve expenditures on health and has
done so in its latest budget for FY94. The States contribute to the NLEP mainly by
maintaining the current infrastructure. By virtue of the design of the project, and
the fact that it is centrally sponsored, the project would not have an impact on the
recurrent costs of State expenditures. Many project assisted services would also be
contractual, to limit long-term liabilities on the Government. Moreover, the
project would start the transition from a vertical monopurpose service to an
integrated delivery through the general health system in areas where the disease
burden has declined to moderate levels, which will reduce costs by utilizing
existing resources to a greater extent.
16.       Aarecd Actiong.  During negotiations, the Government of India provided
assurances that it would: (a) carry out, and ensure that Project States would carry
out, the project in accordance with the Guidelines of the Directorate General of
Health Services for Multidrug Treatment, NLEP, 1989; (b) ensure that Project States
would discontinue the use of Dapsone mono- therapy within 12 months of the
availability of multidrug therapy in the concerned project districts; (c) obtain or
ensure that Project States would obtain, from each District Leprosy Society which
carries out the project, an undertaking, with form and content acceptable to IDA,
regarding the carrying out of the project by such Society; (d) ensure that the
Project States would carry out the delivery of services in tribal areas in
accordance with the plan agreed with IDA, which inter alia provides for the
participation of tribal populations in planning and designing project activities in
their communities; (e) discuss with IDA by December 31, 1997, options for the future
utilization of the staff assigned to the NLEP, duly taking into account the findings
of the mid-term review; (f) carry out with IDA yearly reviews; and (g) a mid-term
review. A condition of disbursement for expenditures incurred by 13 States, in
which major project components would be implemented, would be that such States would
furnish to IDA a Letter of Undertaking, which would outline how each State would
carry its part of the project in accordance with the guidelines and policies of the
National Leprosy Eradication Program.
17.       Prosect Benefits.  The project would enable India to eliminate leprosy as
a national public health problem by the turn of the century. The project would
eliminate the disease in 2.2 million people currently with leprosy and in 1.8
million new cases, treating a total of 4 million people. The project would decrease
the occurrence of disability, alleviating human suffering, economic loss and the
social burden and stigma of the disease. Leprosy control generates high positive
externalities. The project would have a high social return in terms of healthy life
years saved.
18.       Program Objective Categories: Poverty AsRects.  The impact of leprosy is
highest in the poorer segments of the population since they have the least access to
health care. The project would reach underprivileged communities, and of the 4
million people to be affected by the project, it is estimated that 2.4 million
people or about 60% would be living below the 001 poverty line. Women
Develgpment Aspects. The project would benefit about 1.6 million women and reduce



the current gaps in the coverage and treatment of women with leprosy. It would
emphasize non-formal health education at the grass roots level, and would highlight
the identification of female patients. The benefits of health communications would
contribute to reducing social discrimination affecting woLen. fr4idL&nm9
EggulatiQ2a. The frequency rates of leprosy ere three times less among tribal
communities compared to non-tribal and less secluded ones. However, to help prepare
for the project, beneficiary assessments were done of tribal people in Madhya
Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh who have been beneficiaries of the leprosy program.
These assessments and leprosy reviews in India have generally shown that acceptance,
compliance and satisfaction with MDT among indigenous populations are high. Data on
tribal populations has been collected on a block by block basis. In the high
endemicity districts where outreach services would be expanded, the tribal
population is nine million people (6.5%) out of a total of 139.4 million people.
These tribal groups would benefit from the project and would participate in planning
the delivery of outreach services and multidrug circuits in their com=un..ties. In
intermediate endenicity districts, where leprosy control is integrated in the
general health system, the tribal population is 13.7 million (9.1%) out of a total
of 150 million people.
19.       lisks. There are some risks to the project.  First, there is a risk that
the Union Government may not be able to facilitate local implementation of all
control activities. This will be addressed by up-front State commitment to project
implementation through Letters of Undertaking, by providing the States with Leprosy
Consultants, and by encouraging continuous State involvement in planning and
evaluating project activities through regular workshops and increased local
training. The project would foster local involvement by further developing the
implementation role of the District Leprosy Societies, which have been effective in
advancing leprosy control efforts in India. Second, there is a risk that primary
health care staff may not oe sufficiently motivated to fulfill leprosy
responsibilities in the integrated model of service delivery. This would be
addressed by selecting moderate prevalence areas for this mvdel of service delivery,
and through the provision of inservice training and incentives for performance.
Third, there are the usual risks of poor use of project investments by a Borrower
whose implementation record is mixed. These will be addressed by the careful
preparation of implementation arrangements and the use of WHO resident technical
assistance for project monitoring.
20.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
