The project finances the incremental\n            cost of a six-year time slice of an enhanced National\n            Leprosy Eradication Program. This brings an added value and\n            efficiency to this program through the promotion of an\n            appropriate mix of service delivery mechanisms, policies and\n            strategies, provision of a wider and more effective package\n            of leprosy services, and expansion of the use of appropriate\n            technology. This project focusses on program enhancements in\n            five activities: (a) expansion of multidrug therapy through\n            a vertical structure targeting about 66 high-endemicity\n            districts and providing outreach services to the community\n            and service circuits; (b) integration of multidrug therapy\n            into the general health care system in about 77\n            intermediate-endemicity districts and pockets of infection;\n            (c) disability care and prevention through health education,\n            preventive precautions, physiotherapy, supportive medicines,\n            ulcer care and reconstructive surgery; (d) promoting public\n            awareness and community participation; and (e) enhancing\n            skills and institutional development through the provision\n            of short-term training to about 160,000 persons and\n            strengthening program coordination capabilities."}, "docdt": "1993-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
