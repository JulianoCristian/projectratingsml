development of human resources in the\n            Comoros by: (a) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness\n            of basic health services, through the establishment of\n            efficient regional health administrations and other\n            supportive services, which will be capable of providing\n            comprehensive good quality and cost effective health care;\n            these will include family planning services and Acquired\n            Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention, and will\n            involve community participation, self-management and cost\n            recovery; and (b) promoting complementary community\n            development initiatives to develop social infrastructure and\n            grassroots participation in small-scale productive\n            activities, through a Community Development Support Fund\n            (CDSF). The project has two components: population and\n            health; and community development. The population and health\n            component will build upon existing successful pilot programs\n            for self-management and cost-recovery to establish services\n            capable of ensuring cost-effective and sustainable provision\n            of comprehensive and good quality health care, including\n            family planning and AIDS control services. To that end, the\n            component will: (a) strengthen the capacities of the three\n            health regions to plan, implement, administer, and supervise\n            health care services, in part through improving and\n            expanding the training of district health personnel; (ii)\n            equip and rehabilitate two regional hospitals and a number\n            of health centers; and (iii) promote family planning and\n            AIDS control services. In the second component,\n            complementary community development activities as well as\n            activities to encourage sustainable economic development\n            will be supported through a CDSF. While demand driven, the\n            CDSF will focus primarily on: training of communities and\n            groups in micro-project development, management, and\n            implementation; rehabilitation of social infastructure\n            (especially primary schools, water supply, and health\n            posts); activities to promote the well-being and development\n            of women; and income generating activities."}, "docdt": "1993-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
