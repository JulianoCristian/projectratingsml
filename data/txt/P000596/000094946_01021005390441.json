Conversely, the Borrower's\n            performance was unsatisfactory, based on the\n            Government's inability to strengthen macroeconomic\n            policies. Lessons drawn from the project are as follows.\n            First, social sector projects in Comoros should reinforce -\n            and include in project design - the need for dynamic local\n            communities to participate in the mobilization of human\n            resources; thus, the country should envisage reforms to\n            reduce civil service, and instead increase the ratio of\n            government revenues to GDP, beyond fifteen percent. Second,\n            the approach taken in testing sub-project preparation,\n            financing, and supervision, before committing a large amount\n            of resources proved highly successful, i.e., the Social Fund\n            was prepared before Board approval of the project, was\n            highly successful, and its implementation progressed\n            smoothly. However, operating costs for a newly established\n            Social Fund, within the context of the Comoros, is\n            supposedly high, a fact which although legitimate, increased\n            unexpected administrative costs. And third, beneficiary cost\n            sharing, enabled the health system to continue operations,\n            despite the lack of government funding."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
