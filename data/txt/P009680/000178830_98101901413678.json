   Pise and water treatment plant of about 5.3 cubic meters per\n            second capacity at Panjrapur; and (ii) construction of a\n            water treatment plant of about 22 cubic meters per second\n            capacity at Bhandup, a pumping station, a master balancing\n            reservoir, and service reservoirs and provision of\n            transmission mains and distribution system, electrical and\n            mechanical equipment, leak detection equipment,\n            instrumentation and control systems, vehicles and water\n            meters and spare parts for plant and machinery and water\n            meters. (B) Sewerage, Sewage Treatment and Disposal Works:\n            Improvement in the extension of the sewerage system by\n            laying about 130 km of sewers and sewage pumping mains;\n            construction of seven pumping stations; rebuilding of nine\n            existing pumping stations; the provision of mechanical and\n            electrical equipment and improvements to existing sewage\n            treatment works; the provision of sewer maintenance\n            equipment, vehicles and spares; and investigations for\n            sewage treatment and disposal. (C) Consulting Services and\n            Training: Strengthening of BCM's water supply and\n            sewerage organizations and improvement of related technical\n            and financial operations."}, "docdt": "1973-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
