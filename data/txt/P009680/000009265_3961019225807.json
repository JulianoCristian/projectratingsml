{"cdata!": "The purpose of this study is to\n            determine the impact of the Bank's interventions in the\n            provision of urban water supply and wastewater services in\n            Bombay. The study covers the First, Second, and Third Bombay\n            Water Supply and Sewerage Projects. These projects supported\n            the sector development program of the Municipal Corporation\n            of Greater Bombay (MCGB) which began in 1973. Elements of\n            other Bank-financed infrastructure projects in the Bombay\n            area are considered in this evaluation to the extent that\n            they had an impact on the program. The objectives of\n            MCGB's program were to improve living conditions of\n            Bombay's population by alleviating water shortages,\n            doubling the hours of supply and mitigating dangerous and\n            offensive sanitary conditions. The program was divided into\n            phases, with BWSSP-I (1973) financing the first phase which\n            was primarily for water supply system improvements.\n            Subsequent phases covered sewerage as well as water supply."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
