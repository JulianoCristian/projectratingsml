3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
Background.

3.1.1 The Pilot Agricultural Services Project (PASP) was identified in 1996 following the slow down of
economic activities in trade and agriculture, which contributed to a real GDP decline averaging 2.3 percent
a year in 1994-95. At that time, agriculture accounted for 40 percent of GDP, provided the livelihood of
about 75 percent of the population, and about 50 percent of total export earnings with activities
concentrated on the production of food crops as well as the three main export commodities (vanilla, cloves,
and perfume essence). A key constraint to agricultural development related to the inadequacy of the
agricultural services delivery system, particularly the extension and research systems, and a weak
agribusiness sector. On the policy front, distortions included unfavorable fiscal/tariff regimes (i.e. high
imports duties on inputs, taxes on inter-island trade), and a currency regime that favored imports, resulting
in a negative incentive structure for the agricultural sector. Other agricultural development constraints
included the prevalence of complex land tenure arrangements, insufficient rural financing services,
inadequate infrastructure in the more remote areas, and weak institutional arrangements arising from
political instability.

3.1.2 In view of these conditions, the Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros requested
IDA's assistance to help restore agricultural growth. The government recognized that a long-term
commitment was needed to achieve this goal and that innovative approaches must be sought to address the
most binding constraints it faced with regard to increasing agricultural productivity. PASP was proposed to
support the first steps in this long-term process and to address the core constraints to agricultural
development while serving as a vehicle for developing and testing innovative but viable solutions that could
be adopted on a broader scale. PASP was based on the results of a broad-based systemic consultation
carried out with farmers, agricultural professionals and Government officials in the first half of 1995, and
aimed at supporting Government's efforts towards refining, fine-tuning and implementing certain aspects of
its agricultural development strategy.

3.1.3 The project was approved in February 1997 but was only declared effective one year later because of
delays related to key effectiveness conditions. However, following political instability and financial
constraints, especially the non-payment of debt service arrears and the non-availability of the Government
counterpart funds, the Bank and IFAD (which co-financed $ 1 million for the project) suspended their
disbursements to the Comoros from August 1998 to January 2000. When disbursements resumed, the
Comoros and the World Bank co-organized a participatory review of the Bank portfolio in March 2000,
which led to the Government request for a restructuring of the project in May 2000. The restructuring was
approved in July 2000 and the original closing date of December 31, 2000 was amended and extended to
June 30, 2002. A second extension was then granted until June 30, 2003 to complete the implementation.

Original Objectives.

3.1.4 The specific objectives of the project were twofold:

(a)      To produce through actual testing on the ground, replicable service systems for agriculture that, if
successful, could be established nation-wide, with full collaboration from the Government's partners in the
donor community. The service systems to be tested included: (i) a participation-based and results-oriented
extension service, operable by either the private or the public sector; and (ii) the use of private sector



                                                      - 2 -

association and the media to collect and relay market and farm-related information, the cost of which could
eventually be covered through advertising.

(b)      To support the strengthening of the country's capacity to implement its agricultural strategy
through (i) the re-orienting and re-focusing of INRAPE's role as a collector and provider of technical
information to extension agents and end-users, and a coordinator and provider of training services in the
sector; (ii) the improvement of MPEPFE's capacity for sector planning, monitoring and coordination, as
well as (iii) the formulation of sub-sectoral policies and strategies to improve rural finance and land tenure
inadequacies.

3.1.5 The proposed objectives were in line with the Comoros CAS, reviewed by the Board on December
14, 1993, and the Comoros Agricultural Strategy adopted in 1994. The central objective of Bank assistance
was to help the Comoros (i) reduce poverty by accelerating sustained economic growth; (ii) develop human
capital and reduce population growth; and (iii) protect the fragile ecosystem. The objectives of the
agricultural strategy were: (i) to enhance rural incomes as a means of alleviating rural poverty; (ii) to
expand and diversify agricultural exports as well as broaden outlets for domestically-produced, non-traded
food products; and (iii) to promote a self-sustainable, private sector-led agricultural development. These
objectives were explicitly reflected in the design framework of the project as it was aimed at fostering the
development of institutions and capacity in both the private and public sectors as well as assisting in
formulating appropriate policy and institutional frameworks for agricultural development. By supporting
sustainable productivity growth and agricultural intensification, PASP was also intended to make a
significant contribution to poverty alleviation.


3.2 Revised Objective:
When the Project resumed in 2000, a third objective was added and stated as follows : to reinforce the
capacity of local communities and Producers Groups. The March 2000 Bank portfolio review emphasized
the importance of realigning the Bank program with actual needs and their impact on the short-term
recovery of the country's economic and social situation. The revised objectives were aimed at positioning
PASP towards quicker results and more direct impact on farm production and productivity, and farmers'
incomes. Introduction of demand-driven productive investments in the revised project design was expected
to generate results in the short-term and to allow transfer of knowledge to farmers through a
"learning-by-doing" spirit.


3.3 Original Components:
PASP, to be implemented over a three-year period, had two original components: (i) Agricultural Services;
and (ii) Planning and Monitoring Support.

The Agricultural Services Component ($1,335,500) was divided into three sub-components: (i) the
Agricultural Extension sub-component ($ 552,100) to test private sector delivery of extension services; (ii)
the Research sub-component         ($ 316,100) to convert the country's research establishment into a
depository/clearing house of agricultural technical information adapted to Comoran conditions, and (iii) the
Communications and Markets Information sub-component ($ 467,300) to improve access to information
through training, through media, and support to farmer organizations. The principal constraints to be
addressed were the difficulties farmers experienced in accessing relevant and timely information about
crop-related technology, soil conservation and markets, and in using it to their advantage. This component
was mainly focused on improving the supply side of agricultural services and the technical capacity of
farmers to receive the services, with mid-term to long-term outcomes.



                                                       - 3 -

The Planning and Monitoring Support Component ($ 316,200) was to strengthen the MPEPFE's
capacity to: (i) implement the agricultural strategy and prepare the public expenditure programs in the
agricultural sector as well as sector development plans for each of the islands of the archipelago; (ii)
coordinate, monitor and evaluate implementation of sector projects and activities; and (iii) carry-out
sector-wide studies. The constraints to be addressed included the weaknesses of the MPEPFE in the areas
of planning, monitoring, sectoral policy formulation and general internal management.

3.4 Revised Components:
3.4.1 PASP was restructured to include three components: (i) the Agricultural Services component ($
569,738); (ii) the Planning and Monitoring Support component ($ 258,928); and (iii) a new Farm Producer
­ Initiated Activities component was added ($ 845,250) devoted to the financing of productive subprojects
initiated by farm producers, consisting of the construction and equipment of small infrastructure for
production, transformation, storage and marketing of farm products.

3.4.2 As part of the restructuring, the project: (i) discarded the communications and markets information
component; and (ii) reduced activities and credit allocated to agricultural extension, research, and planning
and monitoring support components. Expected outputs were adjusted towards more short-term results on
farm production and income with the subprojects in line with the revised focus of the country assistance
program.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is rated unsatisfactory. While the project was strongly aligned with the CAS and
government priorities, it was not ready for implementation and was based on a weak analysis of
external risks. The one year delay in declaring effectiveness signaled the weak readiness for
implementation - the effectiveness date was extended twice as the Government failed to fulfill key
conditions, namely (i) the ratification of the credit agreement; (ii) the provision of counterpart
contribution to project costs; (iii) the preparation of a Project Implementation Plan satisfactory to
IDA; and (iv) the preparation of all bid documents for the first year of implementation.
Moreover, the project was based on a weak assessment of external risks and the overall enabling
environment for project activities. The project designed failed to adequately address: (i) the risk
related to the capacity of the Government to address the issue of non-payment of debt service
arrears causing the suspension of disbursements from August 1998 to January 2000; (ii) the
non-supportive macro-economic and political environment; and (iii) the persistent problem of
inadequate counterpart funding for Bank projects.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1 Achievement of revised objectives / outcome is rated satisfactory, as measured by the key
performance indicators related to agricultural extension, research, planning and monitoring support, and
farmer income set out in Annex 1. Considering the degree of economic, political and civil instability during
the life of the project, the actual achievements of the Project were remarkable. Outcome targets were
substantially met for producing replicable service systems for agriculture. Extension and research systems
involving public and private sectors were tested and can now be rationalized and replicated.

4.1.2 Outcome targets were also substantially met for reinforcing the capacity of Producers Organizations.
Farmers' ownership and commitment were enhanced through the creation of Producers Organizations and
identification and implementation of subprojects. A small but important share (12 percent) of project's


                                                     - 4 -

beneficiaries were women. PASP has paid special attention to ensure the effective representation of women
and women groups to enable them to voice their views and demands on the productive investments to be
funded under the project. Also, PASP had been instrumental in linking producers to local and regional
markets by helping them organize themselves to manage commercialization activities and by funding
marketing facilities such as grain storage. Initial results from demand-driven productive investments
financed under the PASP show significantly increased revenue generating capacity of small farmers. The
subprojects also have contributed to the introduction of innovations and diversification of agricultural
production systems through a learning by doing spirit. The most significant shortcoming was the weakness
of the public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the benefits gained from the different components of
the Project, and to strengthen their capacity to implement the country's Agricultural Strategy, plan and
monitor and evaluate agricultural-related projects.


4.2 Outputs by components:
Agricultural Services Component ($1,335,500 SAR, $ 569,738 actual). This component was divided into
two sub-components (Research and Extension) and both are rated satisfactory.

4.2.1 Agricultural extension component. The objective of testing the delivery of extension advice to
farmers through private contractors (NGOs, individuals, etc.) has been fully met. A network of sixty
private extension agents has been created, equipped and trained. Fifty village vaccinators were also
equipped and trained. These extension agents and vaccinators are now fully operational and able to provide
services that meet farmers' needs. Also, two development NGOs (GAD for agriculture and ACTIV for
livestock) have been successful in disseminating new technologies directly required for the implementation
of the subprojects through producers associations.

4.2.2 Research component. The objectives of improving the collection and availability of information on
technological innovations, and the prioritization, programming and setting-up of research activities have
been fully met. The INRAPE's documentation center was rehabilitated and agricultural information related
to crops and other commodities for which the Comoros has a comparative advantage is now available for
extension agents, farmers and other users. Also, an extension manual in a usable form was produced and
distributed to extension agents and selected farmers. This manual was also very received by intended
beneficiaries and was helpful in improving their agricultural practices. INRAPE has also successfully
established three regional research committees in each islands to promote participatory research resulting in
the adoption by 60 percent of producers of the improved technologies.

Planning and Monitoring Support Component. ($ 316,200 SAR, $ 258,928 actual)

4.2.3 This component is rated unsatisfactory as it failed to achieve most of its objective and outcomes, and
did not generate substantial development results. Although the activities identified in the SAR were reduced
during the project restructuring to coordination, monitoring and evaluation of sector projects, the MPE's
Planning Department failed to develop sound monitoring and evaluation systems and to undertake timely
and appropriate monitoring of the public sector investment program. Also, the monitoring reports were of
poor quality and not delivered on time.

Farm Producer ­ Initiated Activities Component ($ 0,00 SAR, $ 845,250 actual)

4.2.4 This component is rated satisfactory . With 40 percent of actual total costs, this component
constituted the core of PASP. The objective of improving the capacity of producers organizations



                                                       - 5 -

has been achieved : 61 producers organizations were legally created, trained and functioning.,
and 50 investment subprojects were established. Producers have been successfully able to identify
and implement income-generating productive investments. PPSA has demonstrated that financing
productive investments has increased producers' incomes by at least 25%. Also working with
producers organizations was cost-effective and enabled PASP to reach a large number of
beneficiaries. This approach was well received by local communities, as illustrated by the fact that
90 unsolicited requests were received during the last year of implementation but not financed due
to limited resources.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
A Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated in the 1996 SAR. When the objectives and components were
reformulated at the March 2000 review, no calculation was performed for the revised components since the
demand-driven approach did not pre-identify specific investments. As part of the ICR analysis, financial (
not economic) analysis was undertaken for four typical subprojects financed under the project: a small
agro- processing plant, and production of onions, potatoes and poultry. The agro- processing plant
displayed a NPV of Kmf 12,765,049 ($ 29,686) and an IRR of 59%. The onion production exhibited a
NPV of Kmf 69,910,779 ($ 162,583) and an IRR of 258%. The poultry production presented a NPV of
Kmf 4,427,578 ($ 10,297) and an IRR of 23%. The potatoes production showed a NPV of Kmf 3,600,764
($ 8,374) and an IRR of 20%. These indicative results suggest that the subprojects will generate significant
financial benefits for the beneficiaries and contribute to the project objective of increased agricultural
productivity and the government objective of poverty reduction.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
see 4.3

4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1 The institutional development impact of the project is rated as positive but marginal. PASP
contributed to the formation of social capital in Comoros through consultation and participation of
beneficiary farmers and villagers in project preparation and throughout implementation. PASP provided
assistance to producers organizations to strengthen their capacity to identify and implement sub-projects.
The project was effective in helping farmers acquire the motivation, confidence and skills necessary to
identify their problems and needs, to set priorities and to assume complete responsibility for decision
making and implementation. However, the project's overall institutional development impact is viewed as
marginal, since it focused on a very small pilot group and did not make any provision for scaling up the
government's or country' s ability to make effective use of its human and financial resources for agricultural
development.

4.5.2 The project has demonstrated the possible emergence of private sector in agricultural
development. In this domain, the project contributed to the capacity building of NGOs and a
network of private extension agents by contracting out support services required for preparing
and carrying-out those sub-projects, and their implementation at the island level. These NGOs and
extension agents have now broken the vicious circle of "no funding without experience, and no
experience without funding". Also, PASP promoted some decentralized decision-making through
the establishment of regional steering committees with full involvement of key stakeholders in the
review and approval of subprojects. As regards research, the project has strengthened INRAPE's
capacity to provide training to its staff to develop a research system more responsive to
beneficiary concerns and needs.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Poor farmers targeted by the project had difficulties in mobilizing their counterpart funding which
delayed implementation of approved subprojects. Delays in implementation were also caused by
the time required to import some equipment and materials to equip INRAPE or to implement the
subprojects.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Frequent changes of the head of the Planning Division had seriously weakened the implementation
of the Planning and Monitoring Support Component. Also, the non-payment of debt service
arrears and counterpart funds impacted negatively on the project causing the suspension of
disbursements from August 1998 to January 2000

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Despite its limited number of staff, the implementing agency exceeded expectations in project
management, partnership with NGOs, and development of producers organizations. The
coordination of the monitoring and evaluation activity was however weak. There was inadequate
communication between concerned parties in charge of data collection and the Planning Division.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The restructuring significantly changed the cost structure of the project: the agricultural extension,
research, and planning and monitoring support components were reduced respectively by 62%, 72%, and
82% of their original costs. The reallocation went in favor of a new component "Farm Producer-Initiated
Activities" devoted to the financing of demand-driven productive subprojects, which accounted for 40 % of
total costs. Consultants' services, studies and audits were drastically reduced from US$ 1,028,800 to US$
408,900, followed by operating costs from US$ 706,400 to US$ 406,600, and vehicles from US$ 118,400
to US$ 73,100.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

6.1.1 The project sustainability is rated as likely. Despite the persistent problem of political instability and
weak economic management in the Comoros, the core project activities are expected to maintain their
achievements in the future. This reflects the following factors: despite a weak public sector, critical public
services have been effectively delivered through private initiatives of local communities, such as the pilot
producer organizations developed under the project; the government remains committed to continuing and
deepening the role of producer organizations in agricultural development; producer organizations have very
strong financial incentives to expand their role in production and marketing; and the technical, financial and
environmental viability of the subprojects financed under the project, which provide strong incentives for
beneficiaries to sustain project activities.

6.1 2 Productive investments and activities that generated income streams overtime, and which producers
organizations themselves would be capable of managing and maintaining would ensure financial
sustainability. Cost-recovery was encouraged, as producers benefiting from funding for productive
subprojects were invited to invest part of the incremental income in savings schemes, that would facilitate
further investment and access to credit. The preliminary results of the savings schemes are very
encouraging but their sustainability is uncertain. As regards research, while the institutional capacity of


                                                      - 7 -

INRAPE has been strengthened, it will not be able to operate without continued financial support from the
government and donors for the next 3 to 5 years. Government has indicated its support for continued public
sector investment in INRAPE

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

Most of the activities developed under the project - the development of producer organizations and the
financing of subprojects - are now self-financing and self-managing, so no special transition arrangements
will be needed. However, PASP was envisaged as a pilot project, and the continued political and social
instability has affected the scope of scaling up. Nonetheless, the new Transitional Support Strategy for
Comoros proposes one single comprehensive and community-driven lending project that would consolidate
investment activity in several sectors. The proposed project will seek to improve the living conditions of the
poorer communities through financing of small-scale social and economic infrastructures, social protection
programs for vulnerable groups, and demand-driven productive investments for the rural and agricultural
sector which builds on the experience of PASP and is designed to scale up PASP to a larger set of
beneficiaries. This project is under preparation and scheduled for Board presentation in FY04.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance in lending is rated unsatisfactory, reflecting the insufficient attention to readiness for
implementation and the weak quality at entry. Nonetheless, the Bank sis provide strong support to the
Borrower during project identification and preparation, ensure that the project design was consistent with
the government's development strategy/priorities and with the Bank's CAS, and completed a rigorous
appraisal of the project, including due attention to lessons learned from previous operations in the sector.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance in supervision is rated as satisfactory, reflecting the effective restructuring of the project
in response to the changing country conditions; realistic reporting of project implementation progress;
proactive management of implementation problems; sufficient attention to development impact during
project implementation; good quality advice given to the implementing agency; and a very effective working
relationship among the Bank, government, and stakeholders. Seventeen supervision missions and five site
visits were conducted from 1997 to 2003 (Annex 4a). In particular, disbursement delays were improved, as
well as issuance of non-objections.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Rated Satisfactory

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Rated Unsatisfactory. Although the Government was committed to development of a new Agricultural
Strategy and displayed strong ownership during the preparation of PASP, it failed to adequately prepare
some technical aspects of the project, which led to the one year delay in effectiveness.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Rated Unsatisfactory. In 1998, after six months of implementation the entire Bank's portfolio was
suspended due to the non-payment of debt service arrears by the Government. During that period the
Government failed to provide counterpart funding, adequate oversight and acceptable responsiveness to
the project. Following the suspension, the Government took substantial corrective measures but fall short



                                                      - 8 -

to address some of them. For examples, the Head of the Planning Division was changed frequently and the
documentation center rehabilitated by the project was repeatedly closed due to lack of personnel.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Rated Satisfactory.

7.6.1 Despite the political instability, the performance of the implementing agency was strong. The
implementing agency was successfully able to assume overall coordination of the project, including
preparation and management of the annual work programs and budget, preparation and production of the
annual progress reports and financial statements, procurement and disbursements activities, and
supervision of activities implemented by the NGOs and INRAPE.

7.6.2 PASP financial management system is rated satisfactory. All deficiencies identified at the beginning
in internal controls were addressed correctly in a timely manner. The PASP's accounting staff was
qualified and had relevant and practical accounting experience. All audit reports were completed and
submitted on time. The procurement activity is rated satisfactory. To assist beneficiaries in acquiring
equipment and goods related to subprojects, a procurement officer was recruited and trained. Procurement
reviews were conducted periodically and effectively. Reports showed only minor deviations from agreed
procurement plans and were consistent with Bank guidelines and procedures. Average times for
procurement process steps were as follows: evaluation = 5.4 days; PDA reviews = 7.6 days; contract
signing =3.2 days.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Rated Unsatisfactory, reflecting the problems that led to the delay in effectiveness, the suspension of
disbursements, and the continuing weak macroeconomic and institutional framework during the
implementation of the restructured project.


8. Lessons Learned

8.1 Despite the political instability and a weak macroeconomic management, the project has demonstrated
that coordination and implementation of productive investments through micro-projects at the decentralized
level can be done with little difficulty provided the local actors are empowered to act and have resources to
utilize. The project was designed with a light implementation unit structure and that coordination at the
decentralized level was carried out by a steering committee composed of representatives from the
decentralized administration, private sector, NGOs and producer groups. The regional steering committees
were very instrumental and effective in marketing project's activities, selecting micro-projects and
monitoring them.

8.2 A plurality of service providers (NGOs, private extension agents and vaccinators) with relevant
capacities can be employed to deliver research and extension services that are more responsive to farmers
needs. The main benefit is that the extension and research activities are more operationally efficient and
that those providers can be held accountable for their performance and results. Also farmers are willing to
gradually share costs providing that the services provided lead to increase in productivity and income.

8.3 The participatory approach adopted in implementing and monitoring micro-projects has also promoted
ownership. The project has been very effective in helping farmers acquire the motivation, confidence and
skills necessary to identify their problems and needs, to set priorities and to assume complete responsibility
for decision making and implementation. Producer groups have contributed on average 10% in addition to



                                                      - 9 -

the required 20% beneficiary contribution.

8.4 The project has demonstrated that promoting producer organizations around productive investments,
namely small agricultural processing industries, is a key factor in job creation. It stimulates progress in
agriculture intensification and diversification, and integrate the rural economy. It also accelerate overall
economic growth and raise income, absorb rural unemployment and reinforce food security. However,
vertical integration of agriculture into processing and local industry would only succeed if adequate
infrastructure (road, energy, water, communication) is available.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

$ 1 = Kmf 430
For the purpose of this analysis and due to lack of reliable basic data, the following figures come from the
beneficiaries survey with some assumptions. Net Present Value (NPV) at 10% discount rate, and Internal
Rate of Return (IRR), on a 10-years basis were computed.


1. The Project funded a processing unit for agricultural products. The machine can process other products
than rice. Because of the recent establishment of the enterprise, only data on rice milling was available and
collected. Therefore, potential Production is estimated from rice only (underestimated capacity given other
products possibilities):

Total Investment = Amount given by the Project + Producers' Contribution = 5,095,791 Kmf
Production per year is based on 50 Kg per 35 minutes during 5 hours per day, 5 days a week on a 6 months basis
due to seasonality = 51,429 kg Gross Receipts at 100 Kmf / kg = 5,142,857 Kmf
Charges include 5 liters gas per 150 kg + Maintenance costs of 25% of Gross Receipts = 2,142,857 Kmf
Net Value of Production = Gross Receipts ­ Charges = 3,000,000 Kmf. Net value of Production is assumed to
increase a conservative 1% per year.

2. The Project financed a warehouse and inputs for potatoes and onion productions. The following results
concern an estimated potential onion production (underestimated capacity given potatoes and other
products possibilities).

Total Investment = Amount given by the Project + Producers' Contribution = 5,000,000 Kmf
Production of 11,413 kg on 20.75 ares, based on 550 kg per are, estimated collected Gross Receipts =
17,118,750 Kmf
Charges are estimated at 25% of Gross Receipts = 4,279,688 Kmf, since first inputs such as seeds were
given by the Project.
Net Value of Production = Gross Revenue ­ Charges = 12,839,063 Kmf. Net value of Production is
assumed to increase a conservative 1% per year.
