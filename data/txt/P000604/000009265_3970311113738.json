strengthening of the capacity to implement\n            its agricultural strategy.  The project, to be implemented\n            over a three year period, will contain two components.  The\n            agricultural services component will include: a) testing\n            private sector delivery of extension services; b) converting\n            the country's research establishment into a depository/\n            clearing house of agricultural technical information adapted\n            to Comorian conditions'; and c) improving information\n            access through training, media, and support to farmer\n            organizations.  The planning and monitoring support\n            component will support the planning division, providing for\n            computers, office equipment, staff training, and sector\n            specific studies including: a rural finance study, a land\n            tenure feasibility study, and an agricultural baseline study."}, "docdt": "1996-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
