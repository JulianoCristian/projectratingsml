NEW,TF031081-COMOROS - AGRICULTURE", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Pilot Agricultural\n            services Project for Comoros were as follows: the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was satisfactory, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            despite the political instability and a weak macroeconomic\n            management, the project has demonstrated that coordination\n            and implementation of productive investments through\n            micro-projects at the decentralized level can be done with\n            little difficulty provided the local actors are empowered to\n            act and have resources to utilize. The project was designed\n            with a light implementation unit structure and that\n            coordination at the decentralized level was carried out by a\n            steering committee composed of representatives from the\n            decentralized administration, private sector, NGOs and\n            producer groups. A plurality of service providers (NGOs,\n            private extension agents and vaccinators) with relevant\n            capacities can be employed to deliver research and extension\n            services that are more responsive to farmers needs. The main\n            benefit is that the extension and research activities are\n            more operationally efficient and that those providers can be\n            held accountable for their performance and results. Also\n            farmers are willing to gradually share costs providing that\n            the services provided lead to increase in productivity and\n            income. The participatory approach adopted in implementing\n            and monitoring micro-projects has also promoted ownership.\n            The project has been very effective in helping farmers\n            acquire the motivation, confidence and skills necessary to\n            identify their problems and needs, to set priorities and to\n            assume complete responsibility for decision making and\n            implementation. Producer groups have contributed on average\n            10% in addition to the required 20% beneficiary\n            contribution. The project has demonstrated that promoting\n            producer organizations around productive investments, namely\n            small agricultural processing industries, is a key factor in\n            job creation. It stimulates progress in agriculture\n            intensification and diversification, and integrate the rural\n            economy. It also accelerate overall economic growth and\n            raise income, absorb rural unemployment and reinforce food\n            security. However, vertical integration of agriculture into\n            processing and local industry would only succeed if adequate\n            infrastructure (road, energy, water, communication) is available."}, "docdt": "2003-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
