Some lessons learned included:  a\n            commitment to project implementation should be assured prior\n            to project execution, both on the part of the Government and\n            the Borrower; this commitment should translate into putting\n            in place a project execution unit endowed with sufficient\n            power to obtain executive decisions necessary for successful\n            implementation. At the project preparation stage a realistic\n            appraisal of the institutional framework of the Borrower and\n            the sector should be undertaken; in particular,\n            institution-building components should be included in a\n            project only if there is a sector-wide institutional\n            framework in place thereby ensuring that they have a\n            reasonable chance of being implemented. A realistic\n            evaluation of procurement procedures at the preparation\n            stage should be followed at the negotiations stage with an\n            explicit agreement to by-pass local procedures (e.g. import\n            licenses and municipal contracting codes) that may delay the\n            implementation and a commitment to follow Bank contracting guidelines."}, "docdt": "1995-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
