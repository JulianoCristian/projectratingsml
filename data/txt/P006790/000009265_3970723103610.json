Electrica de Bogota (EEEB)\n            operations and to extend electric service to a larger\n            segment of Bogota's population.  The project consists\n            mainly of the 1985-90 time-slice of EEEB's distribution\n            and subtransmission program, including the expansion and\n            improvement of Bogota's network, studies to improve\n            EEEB's distribution and operational planning, a\n            training program for EEEB's staff and a program for\n            reducing the system's losses.  Around 240,000 new\n            customers will be connected to the power services, 1,100 MVA\n            in subtransmission substation will be built, and about 10 km\n            of 230 kV and 75 km of 115 kV lines will be constructed,\n            together with 350 MVA in distribution substations and 1,000\n            MVA of distribution transformer capacity and more then 1,400\n            km of new primary and secondary distribution circuits."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
