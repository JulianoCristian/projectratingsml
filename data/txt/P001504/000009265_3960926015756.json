The\n            Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (ISAC) marked the start\n            of a new direction in Madagascar's economic policy. The\n            economy badly needed the Credit during its external and\n            internal financial stabilization, primarily to provide the\n            necessary foreign exchange for imported inputs to be used in\n            production and spare parts. Although it was very difficult\n            to simultaneously carry out a policy to restart growth in\n            production and reestablish internal and external balance,\n            the Government was clearly committed to undertaking a series\n            of reforms to increase the performance of the industrial\n            sector. ISAC was the first step on that road. Difficulties\n            were encountered but the phased approach to implementing the\n            Credit was well suited to a difficult economic environment\n            in which the reforms could be only a starting point for a\n            market-oriented economy."}, "docdt": "1993-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
