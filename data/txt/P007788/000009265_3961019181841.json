in\n            Nicaragua, to improve the planning, funding and\n            implementation of road maintenance, and to improve the\n            quality and the capacity of selected trunk roads on a\n            sustainable basis so as to enhance Nicaragua's export\n            competitiveness. The project will include the following\n            components: 1) civil works, including the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of the Chinandega-Izapa section of the trunk\n            road connecting Nicaragua with Honduras and Costa Rica; 2) a\n            pilot project to maintain 500 kilometers of roads using\n            microenterprises; and 3) technical assistance, training and studies."}, "docdt": "1996-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
