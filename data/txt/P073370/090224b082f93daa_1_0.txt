Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has monitored the productivity of water both for agriculture and fisheries. Increased crop production per unit of water delivered (measured
 in kg per unit of water delivered) for a sample of schemes was monitored as part of detailed impact assessment studies covering about 482,000 ha
 cultivable command area (CCA). The assessment of 22 impact studies shows that the crop production per unit of water more than doubled from 0.30
 kg/m3 to an average value of 0.86 kg/m3 for wheat (main crop). Wheat crop yield increased substantially from an average of 3.11 t/ha to 4.39 t/ha in
 the sample of schemes. The average fish productivity in reservoirs (measured in kg/ha of water spread area) increased from a baseline value of 10-20
 kg/ha to 114 kg/ha in 2014/15, almost double the expected end-of-project target of 60 kg/ha. The average fish productivity in village ponds (kg/ha of
 water spread area) increased from 500 – 1,000 kg/ha to 2,479 kg/ha, about the expected end-of-project target of 2,500 kg/ha. Farmers and fishers are
 now better off than before the project.

         Comments
         The total project area covered is about 650,000 ha. Works at 55 schemes are still ongoing, two weeks before the closing of the project,
         and about Rs 220 Crores is yet to be disbursed. It is not yet fully clear, though, how much of the work related to this amount has already
         been carried out as during the construction season the main focus is on construction works and not on administrative work and invoicing.
         At this point in time, WRD and PICU expect that there may be some left-over works in schemes where the balance of work is more than 15
         percent. To be on the conservative side, it has been considered that 66,000 ha has not been fully improved and this is reflected in the
         indicator. All out efforts are to be made to complete the balance of works as much as possible by the project closure on June 30, 2015.
         WRD is confident that almost all contracts can be completed by project closure, but WRD has agreed to complete any major outstanding
         works after loan closure using state funds. The ICRR mission will update the status with contract completion,

         This indicator is for wheat, the main Rabi crop. The figure is obtained from the impact assessments of 22 schemes (major, medium, and
         minor). The same assessment assessed that the crop production per unit of water for green gram has increased from 0.29 to 0.58 kg/m3
         and for mustard from 0.24 to 0.55 kg/m3. Irrigated paddy started only two years ago (see graph in the AM) due to the increased availability
         and the more efficient use of water.

         The actual production per ha went down from the December 2014 value, as the June value includes all 170 reservoirs, including the large
         ones where the production per ha is typically lower than in small reservoirs.

               The draft Sindh and Chambal RBPs provide comprehensive coverage of water resources issues, including increasing water demands from
               urbanization and industry, pollution and environmental concerns, etc. The RBPs were only recently prepared (the required measurement)
               and it is too early for evidence of use. However, in the discussions with the PS and his team, there is a desire to use the Chambal RBP as
               the foundation for possible follow-up support.

               system managers (data provided by WRD), with evidence based on the large increase in irrigated areas.

               WRD assesses than in all project schemes at least 60 percent of the water users are satisfied with WRD and WUAs. This was confirmed
               by the impact assessment studies of a limited number of schemes. It is planned to conduct surveys to obtain more information on this for
               the ICRR preparation.

               At the time of restructuring in June 2012, it was envisaged that the project would work in 290 schemes. That number was reduced to 228,
               173 of which are now complete.

               The end target is based on about 90 percent of the 290 schemes envisaged at restructuring. This number was reduced to 228 schemes.

               The project worked in 170 project reservoirs. It is only in these schemes that the project worked on ponds as well. The total number of
               ponds was 82 within these 170 schemes.
