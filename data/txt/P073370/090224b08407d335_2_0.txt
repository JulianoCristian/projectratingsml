1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector issues

1.      Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the second largest State by area in India and fifth
largest by population. At the time of appraisal in 2004, Madhya Pradesh had a
population of 60 million with an estimated 44 percent living below the poverty line1.
The economy was dominated by agriculture, which accounted for 35 percent of the
State’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 80 percent of total employment. About one
third of the population belonged to socially and economically disadvantaged groups
consisting of scheduled tribes (20 percent) and scheduled castes (15 percent), with the
proportion of the poor being substantially higher among the tribal population.

2.      Despite relatively significant rainfall ranging from 800-1,600 mm per annum,
this amount mainly falls irregularly during the monsoon season with the dry period
extending from January to June, during which time agriculture is dependent on surface
water resources (often stored in reservoirs) and groundwater. With increasing technical,
social, environmental, and financial constraints, further development of the surface
water systems was seen as problematic and increased groundwater exploitation had
caused widespread decline in the groundwater table in many parts of the state. In
addition, the performance of existing surface water irrigation systems was found to be
poor, with less than 50 percent on average of the created potential being utilized. The
gap between the irrigation potential created (IPC) and irrigation potential utilized (IPU)
ranged from 70 percent in minor schemes2, 50 percent in medium schemes, and 40
percent in major schemes.

3.     Issues identified at the time of appraisal which contributed to project
formulation related to: (i) institutional and policy issues; and (ii) the need to improve
the condition and performance of critical water sector infrastructure.

4.      The institutional and policy issues related to a need to strengthen the policy
framework implementation, improve the coordination of institutions to facilitate and
strengthen integrated water resources management (IWRM), separate water resources
management from irrigation management, and improve institutional capacity for
modern water resources and irrigation management, including greater participation of
Water User Associations (WUA).

5.     In 1997, Andhra Pradesh started with WUA development, which was quickly
taken up by other states, including Madhya Pradesh around 2000. GoMP realized that
water users could be important partners to improve water management and close the
gap between IPC and IPU. The Bank’s experience in other countries made it clear that
WUA capacity would have to be built through extensive training and capacity building.
It would also require commitment by Water Resources Department (WRD) to work in

     Minor schemes are those with culturable command area (CCA) up to 2,000 ha, medium schemes
     range from 2,000 to 10,000 ha CCA, and major schemes have CCA greater than 10,000 ha.

close partnership with WUAs and water users. Successful participatory irrigation
management (PIM) would require WRD staff to work in close collaboration with WUA
Presidents, Committee members, and water users, which would be a change from the
typical top-down irrigation management approaches practiced by WRD.

6.      Issues on the condition and performance of the infrastructure assets in the water
sector related to the need to modernize irrigation and drainage (I&D) assets in order to
improve service delivery and close the gap between IPC and IPU3, and increase the
productivity of water through the adoption of modern tools and techniques in irrigated
agriculture and fisheries development.

Rationale for Bank involvement

7.       The project was consistent with the World Bank Group Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS; 22541-IN, dated June 27, 2001), the World Bank Water Resources
Management Strategy that had just been prepared, and the existing principles of
engagement in the I&D sector in India. Madhya Pradesh was seen as an important State
from a poverty alleviation viewpoint and for the key role that water resources
development and management played in the economy. The State was committed to
reform in these areas to support the rural economy. In addition, to the proposed MP
Water Sector Restructuring Project (MPWSRP), the Bank had started providing similar
support in several other States in India, including Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and
Maharashtra. The Bank also had a comparative advantage with its global experience
in irrigation developments in supporting the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP)
with reform programs in the water resources and irrigation sectors. The Bank was
involved in other related projects in MP, including the Hydrology and Dam Safety
Projects, and had thus some experience working in MP, although the proposed project
was the first Bank project in the irrigation sector.

Higher level objectives

8.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) states that the project will contribute
towards the objectives of sustainable economic growth4 as well as poverty alleviation
through maximizing the productivity of water, with the focus being both on improved
water resources management as well as irrigation service delivery.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The project development objective reflected in the PAD is to improve
productivity of water5 for sustainable growth and poverty reduction in selected focus
river basins (Chambal, Sindh, Betwa, Ken, and Tons) of Madhya Pradesh. The wording
of the PDO in the PAD differs slightly from that in the Loan Agreement where it states
that the objective of the Project is “to improve productivity of water, thus contributing
to sustainable growth and poverty reduction, in selected river basins.” Considering the

     The gap between IPC and IPU was identified at appraisal as being 49 percent overall in MP.

     The underlining is as given in the PAD.
                                                   2
description of the higher level objectives, the description of the objective in the loan
agreement, and the underlining of productivity of water, it can be concluded that
sustainable growth and poverty reduction were not the direct intended project objectives.

10.    The original key performance indicators selected for measuring and monitoring
progress toward achieving the project’s development objective were6:
      i) Improved incomes of targeted river basin stakeholders;
      ii) Improved inter-sectoral, environmentally-sustainable water resources
           management;
      iii) Modernized and well-performing assets;
      iv) Increased crop production per unit of water delivered; and
      v) Increased fisheries production in targeted water bodies.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

11.     The PDO was not revised but the Results Framework was rationalized and
simplified, as described in the Restructuring Paper dated June 1, 2012. The amended
Results Framework and associated indicators reflected a more focused approach.

12.     As a result of restructuring the key performance and intermediate outcome
indicators were simplified and refined taking into account the revised scope of the
components. The PAD PDO indicators (i), (iv), and (v) were retained with small
changes in some of the definitions or splitting up of the original indicator, while PAD
PDO indicators (ii) and (iii) were dropped as they were considered less suitable as
project outcome indicators and their results could be captured through the other
indicators. In addition, the number of intermediate indicators was reduced to capture
only the most important ones.

13.          After restructuring the key PDO indicators were:
      i)     Average farm income of project beneficiaries;
      ii)    Targeted families with increased incomes;
      iii)   Increased crop production per unit of water delivered;
      iv)    Average fish production productivity in (a) reservoirs and (b) village ponds;
      v)     Area provided with I&D services sub-divided into (a) new and (b) improved;7
      vi)    Operational water users associations created and/or strengthened; and
      vii)   Water users provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage services for
             (a) total number and (b) female water users.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    The PAD states that upon completion, the project would positively impact
192,863 farm households, of which an estimated 73,637 farm families living below the
poverty line would obtain sufficient benefits to enable them to move above the poverty
line. In addition, after the project, some 122,100 rural farm jobs would have been

    As stated in the Results Framework.
7
    Indicators (v), (vi), and (vii) are core indicators for the I&D sector and were added to the Results
    Framework on December 9, 2012 in line with the Bank’s requirement that core indicators be added
    to all ongoing irrigation-related projects.
                                                   3
created as a result of project-initiated intensification and diversification of farming. As
most of this incremental demand was expected to come from hired labor, the project
would enhance employment and income opportunities for landless people in and around
the project schemes. Following the restructuring in June 2012, the number of potential
beneficiaries provided with improved irrigation services was identified as 750,000
(about 170,000 households), of which 300,000 were estimated to be women. It was
noted in the restructuring paper that there may be some additional changes in numbers
during the project implementation as it was government’s intention to use the Bank
funding more for medium- and large-scale schemes rather than minor schemes. GoMP
had received grant funds from the Government of India (GoI) for rehabilitation of minor
schemes, so excluding minor schemes would not mean that farmers in these schemes
would not benefit from improvements to their systems.

1.5 Original Components

15.    The project had four components as outlined below (see also Annex 2).
16.     Component A: Water Resources Management – Institutions and
Instruments (US$7.27 Million original allocation). This component was designed to
support the establishment and operationalization of the proposed planning, allocation,
and regulatory institutions and instruments at the State and basin-levels. This would be
achieved through the proposed State Water Resources Agency (SWaRA), the
associated State Water Resources Data and Analysis Center (SWaRDAC), State Water
Tariff Regulatory Commission (SWaTReC), and the creation of River Basin
Development and Management Boards (RBDMB) for the Sindh and Tons Basins. The
project would provide technical advisory material and other material support needed
for the establishment, maintenance and capacity building of these new institutions.
Through improved water resources planning and management these activities and
outputs would contribute to improved inter-sectoral water resources management.

17.     Component B: Service Delivery – Irrigation and Drainage Institutions
(US$38.35 Million). This component was designed to support measures related to
delivering reliable irrigation services at reasonable cost. This included irrigation line
agency (Water Resources Department) strengthening through technical and
management assistance, including the development of a comprehensive information
management system, training, and equipment. Options for promoting decentralized
management of irrigation and drainage schemes through strengthening of WUAs and
some public-private partnerships (PPP) would also be supported under this component.
In addition, a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) would be piloted to assist the State
in achieving its vision of modern, lean, and financially sustainable institutions. By
improving the delivery of more reliable, timely, and adequate irrigation water supplies
to water users in all parts of the irrigation command these activities would contribute
to better performing I&D assets, increased crop production per unit of water delivered,
and ultimately improved incomes of targeted stakeholders.

18.     Component C: Improving Productivity of Selected Existing Irrigation and
Drainage Assets in Five Basins (US$388.09 Million). This component was designed
to provide the necessary investments in five river basins (Chambal, Sindh, Betwa, Ken,



                                            4
and Tons)8 to rehabilitate and modernize 654 existing irrigation schemes with a total
cultivable command area (CCA) of 495,000 ha, with the provision of appropriate
extension for agriculture, horticulture, livestock management, and fisheries. It was
broken down into several sub-components: (i) asset modernization, covering physical
works; and (ii) agricultural intensification and diversification, with allocations to
various departments such as the Department of Agriculture (DoA),9 Jawaharlal Nehru
Krishi Vidyalaya (JKNVV),10 and the Department of Fisheries. This component sought
to increase the total area irrigated in the project schemes through rehabilitation and
modernization of the physical infrastructure and then adding value to the upgraded
irrigation water supply through improvements in agricultural practices, thereby
contributing to increased crop production per unit of water delivered and ultimately
improved incomes of targeted stakeholders.

19.      Component D. Project Management Support (US$5.52 Million). Project
activities were coordinated by a multi-disciplinary Project Implementation
Coordination Unit (PICU). Technical advisory and other material support would be
provided by the project to assist PICU with its role in facilitating and guiding the
implementation and monitoring of all project activities, ensuring synergy and
coordination amongst activities and agencies implementing these activities, preparing
consolidated reports, and facilitating training. PICU would guide baseline surveys and
environmental, social and other assessments, starting from scheme preparation and
updating such information throughout scheme modernization.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    The project was restructured through a Level 2 restructuring, approved on June
7, 2012 (see Data Sheet).

21.    At the time of restructuring, a constraint analysis was carried out to explain the
slow performance of the project and propose actions to address existing constraints.
The analysis concluded that the project development objective and associated
components were still valid but their scope needed to be amended to make them more
relevant to the current requirements in Madhya Pradesh and to simplify them where
possible. Table 1 summarizes the changes in the scope of each component and the
reasons for the restructuring.

       Table 1: Revisions to Project Components under the Restructured Project
    Component A:Water Resources Management – Institutions and Instruments
    Restructured scope:
    To speed up implementation of IWRM practices, the State Water Resources Data and Analysis Center and
    State Water Resources Agency were incorporated into the Water Resources Management (WRM) Wing
    created after restructuring within the Water Resources Department. The WRM Wing would eventually
    coordinate the allocation and management of all water resources in the state, coordinate the development
    and implementation of river basin plans, become the depository of all water-related data in the state, and
    regulate water use and tariff setting. The project would support the establishment of the WRM Wing



8
     After restructuring one large scheme was added in the Wainganga Basin.
9
     Subsequently re-named the Department for Farmer Welfare and Agricultural Development (DFWAD).
10
     These are the two agricultural universities located in Gwalior and Jabalpur tasked with research, development,
     and capacity building of water users and line department staff.
                                                         5
through services, training, goods, etc. A key task of the WRM Wing during the project would be to prepare
river basin plans (RBP) for the Sindh and Chambal (substitution for the Ton Basin, which is less important
and complicated than Chambal) River Basins, for which selected WRD staff would be trained under the
project. The establishment of the State Water Tariff Regulatory Commission had stalled as this required an
Act to be approved by MP’s parliament, due to the fact that there would be major changes in the review and
monitoring of water costs and revenues, and in the setting of water fees. As GoMP was reluctant to move
ahead with such major changes, the project dropped the requirement to establish SWaTREC and
incorporated important tasks in the WRM Wing.
Reasons for change:
Progress by SWaRA on the preparation of RBPs had stalled as the newly-formed agency lacked the capacity
and found it difficult to require organizations to provide SWaRA with the necessary data and support. A
better mandated WRM Wing would have far greater authority to deal with water resource management
issues. The Sindh Basin Development Management Board had been formed for several years, but was not
active as there was no river basin plan to work with. There was little political will to proceed with the
establishment of SWaTREC, as GoMP was of the opinion that setting users fees is a service provider’s
responsibility, with only review and approval of fees to be done eventually by an independent regulatory
agency. As all water service providers are government owned there was little requirement to approve water
fees by an independent agency.
Component B: Service Delivery – Irrigation and Drainage Institutions
Restructured scope:
The restructured project sought to strengthen the focus on irrigation water management, in particular on
service delivery and performance-based management of I&D systems. This was to be achieved through:
separation of irrigation management from irrigation development and construction activities; adoption of
modern irrigation management technologies, including remote sensing, creation of GIS databases, etc.;
strengthening of human resources management and training capability in WRD; move towards volumetric
water allocation (through pilot schemes); conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; and target
setting, monitoring and benchmarking the performance of individual schemes.

In line with a renewed focus on better management of existing irrigation systems, WRD would promote and
support the formation of effective and sustainable WUAs, with more rights and responsibilities devolved to
WUAs. Recent developments at the time of restructuring had started to address this issue, as the government
had started the restructuring and strengthening of the Command Area Development Directorate (CADD)
and the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI). The project would support further strengthening
of CADD and WALMI and the formation of Regional Training Centers with a twin-track approach to
training of WUAs and awareness raising amongst water users.
Reasons for changes:
Consultancy services had been engaged to assess, recommend, and implement institutional strengthening
of WRD, yet there was little buy-in from the Department to the proposed measures which needed to be
scaled back if tangible benefits were to be achieved. Consultancy services had also been engaged to train
WUAs and raise awareness of water users, but no on-going institutional capacity was created within the
State for these activities.
Component C: Improving Productivity of Selected Existing Irrigation and Drainage Assets
in Five Basins
Sub-component: Asset Modernization
Restructured scope:
Soon after the start of the project the number of irrigation schemes was reduced from 650 to about 500
schemes when lift irrigation schemes were excluded. Over time, more schemes were excluded, e.g. more
than 200 schemes in the Bundelkhand Area that were supported by grant funding under GoMP’s Repair,
Renovation and Restoration (RRR) program. At the time of restructuring, the number of schemes was
revised to about 290 schemes with a total CCA of 490,000 ha, with some possible additional changes in
numbers to follow after the restructuring due to government’s intention to use the Bank funding for medium-
and large-scale schemes rather than minor schemes for which more RRR money would likely become
available. Under the restructuring, procedures for preparing of Scheme Modernization Plans (SMP), which
had become overly detailed and cumbersome, were streamlined with concise SMPs based on participative
approaches, water availability studies, and techno-economic feasibility studies being prepared by the WRD
rather than by consultants. In addition, approval procedures by the Bank were greatly simplified.
Reasons for change:
Though the number of schemes was reduced, the total command area of the project was maintained by the
inclusion of major and medium schemes. Delays in the preparation and approval of SMPs had been a major

                                                 6
 constraint to commencing the physical works. It was therefore important to simplify these procedures and
 overcome the delays in the SMP approval process. Procurement procedures were also substantially revised,
 with all future procurement to be done centrally by PICU.
 Sub-component: Agricultural Intensification and Diversification
 Restructured scope:
 At the time of restructuring there were a number of GoI and GoMP programs for agricultural extension and
 support to farmers which covered key parts of the original scope of the project. As a consequence, the
 restructuring sought to focus on strengthening irrigation water management and leverage the activities of
 GoI and GoMP programs. These interventions concentrated on the main crops (paddy, wheat, gram, maize,
 mustard, and soybeans) with a focus on improving productivity of water through interventions, including
 the system of rice intensification (SRI), border check irrigation (for wheat), and ridge and furrow irrigation
 (for soybean, maize and gram). Extensive field demonstrations and training of both water users and
 agricultural/horticultural extension staff was to be carried out. The livestock component was discontinued
 as part of the restructuring as there were better funded projects for livestock activities.
 Reasons for change:
 In order not to duplicate GoI and GoMP general agricultural extension programs, the project sought to focus
 on measures to improve the productivity of water and leverage ongoing government programs by
 introducing these updated technologies through the line agency staff. Research by the agricultural
 universities on improved water management technologies were to be extended with more field
 demonstrations and training of both water users and line agency staff.


1.7 Other significant changes

22.     Besides the changes described in Section 1.6 above no additional significant
changes were introduced. The project was restructured five times and extended by 4 ¼
years in total, for the reasons indicated in the Data Sheet.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Assessment of contextual and background analysis
23.      The project built strongly on the poverty and sustainable growth strategies set
out in the 2001 CAS. It was also aligned with the Bank’s Water Resources Management
Sector Review11 and the principles of engagement in the irrigation and drainage sector
in India. It addressed, and was important to, GoMP’s economic, social development
and poverty alleviation goals, to enable MP to catch up with the development indicators
of other Indian states.

24.     The quality and extent of the Bank’s background analysis for project preparation
was solid and addressed the needs of both GoI and GoMP to improve water resources
and irrigation management, thereby contributing to the higher level objective of
sustainable economic development and poverty alleviation.

2.1.2 Assessment of project preparation and design

25.    Project preparation was thorough with a comprehensive Project Implementation
Plan (PIP) prepared prior to appraisal. The PIP covered all aspects of the project,
including the background, project details (river basin profiles, project description, costs,


11
     World Bank. 1998. India – Water Resources Management Sector Review: Report on the Irrigation
     Sector, Report 18416-IN, World Bank/Government of India, September 1998.
                                                    7
and economic analysis), environmental and social assessment, and six sample designs
for schemes of different scales (major, medium, and minor). The PIP and PAD made
a strong and valid case for linking increased agriculture production to improvement in
the management and productive use of available water resources.

26.     The PAD discussed six possible alternatives for the project and provided
adequate analysis for the selection of the approach adopted. The approach of following
the “water pathway” and seeking to improve water management in order to increase
agricultural production and productivity of water was sound, particularly in light of the
growing scarcity and competition for water in Madhya Pradesh.

27.     The PAD details the arrangements for project implementation. At the time of
appraisal there may have been insufficient understanding of the difficulty of
establishing a major new organization such as SWaRA which would have required
GoMP Cabinet approval and an on-going budget allocation for a new organization.
SWaRA was formed, but only had three staff as it was difficult to recruit additional
staff within a constrained civil service, and it was not able to fulfill its required functions.
The proposal at restructuring to establish a WRM Wing within WRD, utilizing younger
and computer literate staff from within the department, proved to be a more effective
approach.

28.      There was also significant interest in India in volumetric allocation of irrigation
and associated water charging. However this process not only requires infrastructure,
it also requires significant changes in attitudes and operational procedures within the
WRD, which may not have been fully appreciated by the appraisal team. In the event
the WRD did implement volumetric measurement based procedures, but at a higher
level than anticipated at appraisal.

29.     Overall, project preparation and design was thorough, but probably too
ambitious and complex on some of the institutional aspects for a first Bank-funded
project in the irrigation sector in MP, especially due to the lack of experience of GoMP
and the WRD in executing such multi-disciplinary projects. There was inadequate
experience and capacity in the project management team during the initial
implementation phase, not only for multi-sectoral coordination and planning, but also
for understanding the nature of what was required and being able to direct and manage
the various activities, particularly those carried out by a wide range of consultancies.

2.1.3 Safeguards

30.     The project was categorized as environmental Category A, safeguard screening
Category S1, and triggered seven Bank safeguard policies: (i) Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01); (ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12 and OD 4.30);
(iii) Cultural Property (OPN 11.03, revised as OP 4.11); (iv) Nutrient and Pest
Management (OP 4.09), (iv) Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20); (vi) Safety of Dams
(OP/BP 4.37); and (vii) Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP/GP 7.50).
31.    A comprehensive Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) was carried out
during project preparation. Thereafter a Social and Environmental Management
Framework (SEMF) was prepared for planning, implementing, and monitoring
interventions in project schemes. The ESA and SEMF recommendations were
                                              8
integrated into the project design, institutional arrangements, and costings, and were
used specifically to frame the social and environmental components in Scheme
Modernization Plans and construction contracts. The project ESA was disclosed in the
Bank’s Infoshop on May 28, 2004 and around the same time on the website of WRD.

2.1.4 Assessment of Government Commitment
32.     GoMP attached high priority to this project, which it saw as addressing its
primary concerns relating to irrigation and water management performance which in
turn would contribute to economic production and poverty alleviation. It constituted a
multi-disciplinary PICU in August 2002 with a Project Director (PD) who served a term
of 2 ½ years until the project became effective. A detailed PIP was prepared, together
with a draft Procurement Plan, procurement packages and specifications, and model bid
documents.
33.    GoMP had enacted the Participatory Irrigation Management Act in 1999,
enabling WUAs to be established in 2000 in all the major, medium and minor schemes
in MP. It also formulated and adopted a State Water Policy in 2003.

2.1.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation
34.       The PAD identified critical risks as being related to:
         Deep and sustained buy-in of GoMP, and particularly in WRD, to the program
          concepts, especially dealing with institutional reforms, modernization, and
          devolution;
         Sustaining financial support for reforms and counterpart funding; and
         Sustained reforms in other allied areas (overall governance, roads, power).
35.     To mitigate these risks the project proposed substantial technical assistance
support for implementation of project activities, combined with awareness raising and
capacity building at all levels of government and civil society, particularly in relation
to consultation with WUAs and water users in the preparation of SMPs. Risks which
emerged during project implementation related to the complexity of the institutional
reforms, difficulties in letting and managing consulting services contracts, and capacity
constraints within implementing agencies. These risks were addressed during a
restructuring.

2.1.6 Quality at Entry
36.     There was a strong rationale for Bank involvement and a key imperative to
improve water resources management in the State, as well as the efficiency and
productivity of irrigation water use. The commitment of GoMP to these processes was
established and the rationale for Bank involvement adequately justified. Key lessons
learned from implementation of similar projects were incorporated in the design,
though at the time of appraisal there were very few, if any, lessons learned from
organizational reforms in other States in India. Critical risks were identified.
37.     Project design and components matched the intended outcomes of the project,
though the inclusion of poverty reduction in the PDO was not necessary as this was
adequately covered in the specification of the higher level objectives to which the
project was expected to contribute. The Results Framework was logically designed and
comprehensively covered all aspects of the project, but was ambitious with a fairly large
number of indicators to monitor. This was resolved in the Restructuring Paper prepared
                                              9
in June 2012, when the number of indicators was reduced and the clarity of some of the
original indicators improved.
38.     Overall, the project design was well structured, with components and activities
following the water pathway from the water source to farmers’ fields and focused on
improving water use efficiency and productivity. It was, however, quite ambitious in
relation to the institutional changes proposed in the time available. Though the critical
risk related to deep and sustained buy-in by GoMP and WRD was identified,
insufficient attention was paid to how this would be addressed within the project,
especially with regard to establishing completely new institutions such as SWaRA and
SWaTReC.

2.2 Implementation
39.    Progress until the Mid-Term Review (MTR, carried out in 3 missions between
April to September, 2008) had been very slow, with only US$56 million (14.3%)
disbursed by October 2008. Issues raised during the MTR included:
          Problems with physical works. These included slow progress with the
           preparation of SMPs and delayed letting of construction contracts.
          Problems with management and supervision of the consultancy contracts.
           PICU’s and WRD’s supervision and management of some of the consultancy
           contracts was considered to be inadequate.
          Slow progress with the agricultural, horticultural, livestock, and fisheries sub-
           components. There were difficulties in coordination with the line departments,
           in part due to the lack of nodal officers in these departments for project activities.
           Some line departments (especially fisheries) had staff shortages and high staff
           turnover.
40.     Two years later in December 2010, after nearly six years of implementation the
achievement of the PDO was rated as moderately unsatisfactory (MU) and
implementation progress as unsatisfactory (U). The subsequent Restructuring Paper in
June 2012 simplified project design, improved implementation arrangements, and
extended the closing date by three years. It increased the focus on: (i) overall water
management and irrigation sector reform; (ii) reform of WRD to become a modern and
efficient organization that not only focuses on scheme planning and development, but
also on scheme water management and WUA development; (iii) comprehensive
rehabilitation and modernization of especially medium- and large-scale irrigation
schemes; and (iv) support by selective line agencies to maximize the benefits of
improved irrigation systems.
41.    The restructuring and extension of the project by three years in June 2012
enabled it to achieve its core objectives by project closure in June 2015. A number of
key factors contributed to the satisfactory project implementation:
      i)  Revision of procedures for preparation and approval of Scheme Modernization
          Plans. The procedures to prepare SMPs were greatly simplified following
          restructuring, with concise SMPs being prepared by WRD staff with the
          participation of WUAs and water users, and approval procedures were
          rationalized.
      ii) Management Information System. In 2011-12, WRD introduced modern
          irrigation management practices using the web-based Enterprise Management
                                                10
             Information System (EMIS) developed for the project by specialist consultants.
             This system allowed the department to collect, process, and report daily on
             reservoir water levels, canal discharges, and cropped areas for all irrigation
             schemes in MP. Targets were set for irrigated areas in the rabi season12 and
             especially the major and medium schemes are monitored with weekly tele-
             conferences between senior staff in Bhopal and field staff in basin and
             divisional offices. The performance of each scheme and that of individual
             WRD staff are then assessed at the end of the season, with good performance
             recognized and rewarded and measures taken to identify reasons and improve
             performance of less well performing schemes in subsequent seasons. Around
             170 schemes are monitored weekly at the moment by senior management using
             EMIS. Monitoring of most minor schemes is left to the Divisional Executive
             Engineers (EE), with reporting to senior management at the end of the
             irrigation season.
      iii)   Centralizing of contract procurement in PICU. Prior to 2012, procurement of
             works contracts had been organized by EEs and the Chief Engineer’s (CE)
             office in each Basin. To overcome delays and lack of uniformity in the process,
             a Central Procurement System (CPrS) was established in PICU based on the
             project’s EMIS. This change considerably shortened the time from notification
             of tenders to letting of contracts. Allied to this process, PICU established a
             system of e-billing and payment to contractors through the EMIS. This not only
             simplified contract administration and payment processes, but also facilitated
             far better monitoring of the progress of works.             Transparency and
             accountability were also improved as a result.
      iv)    Appointment of senior government personnel as Project Director. The
             government appointed and kept in place senior government personnel as
             Project Director, with two PDs in turn serving from December 2006 to
             December 2013. This provided PICU with continuity and authority in project
             implementation. The appointment in 2010 of a new Principal Secretary (PS)
             for WRD who applied a results and performance based management approach
             to project and Department activities further strengthened the arrangements.
      v)     Computerization of WRD management and administrative systems. Providing
             computers, peripherals, and internet-based connectivity between WRD offices
             and PICU made a significant contribution to project administration and
             monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Speed and accuracy of communications
             and exchange of data was greatly improved.
      vi)    In-house expertise for WUA support. WUAs play an important part in WRD’s
             modernized irrigation management procedures. In order to achieve the
             required seasonal targets set for each system, WRD divisional staff has to liaise
             and work closely with WUAs who in turn communicate and work with the
             water users13. To support this process the project institutionalized training to
             WUAs by supporting the Water and Land Management Institute to establish
             week-long field-based training of WUA committees and water users.
      vii)   Agricultural support. The project supported MP’s two agricultural universities
             to develop procedures for improved field water management practices. The


12
     The rabi (winter) season is the main irrigation season in Madhya Pradesh, running from November
     to March.
13
     Senior management in WRD see this as a partnership between the department and water users.
                                                  11
           universities carried out adaptive field trials and demonstrations with farmers
           and then provided training for over 25,000 farmers and 2,600 line agency staff.
           This sub-component also leveraged GoMP agricultural programs by
           introducing these new approaches in these programs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
42.     M&E Design. Overall, the Results Framework in the PAD was logical and
comprehensive with indicators to track the full range of expected outcomes and results.
Baselines and targets were provided for most indicators, but some information was
missing, for example related to the expected increase in stakeholder incomes. Also,
some of the indicators could have been focused more on the changes in performance
expected (e.g. related to improved water resources management and irrigation
modernization). An omission in the PAD was the provision of details on the outcome
indicator to measure the change in productivity of water in terms of agricultural
production. These were shortcomings and the June 2012 Restructuring corrected these
deficiencies. The data collection and reporting details were adequately described in the
PAD.
43.     M&E Implementation. A contract for the monitoring and learning (M&L)
consultancy did not materialize due to difficulties with agreeing and letting the contract,
so responsibility for M&E fell back on PICU. Staff were recruited for the M&E unit
and line agencies got involved to collect monitoring data from different offices. The
EMIS system allowed the department to collect, process, and report regularly on key
indicators of scheme performance.
44.     Baselines for schemes to be modernized were provided in the SMP for each
scheme. PICU commissioned eight impact studies covering an adequate sample of
major, medium, and minor irrigation schemes. The impact studies covered 19 schemes
with a total CCA of 490,000 ha, or 75 percent of the total project command area (see
table 2 under paragraph 75).14
45.     M&E Utilization. EMIS provided timely, reliable, and accurate data on core
project activities related to works, which enabled tracking of progress towards
completion of construction and achievement of the target modernized irrigated area.
The EMIS also provides daily updated information on water stored in reservoirs,
irrigated areas, and main canal discharges, together with performance statistics for
individual schemes. The EMIS has been adopted by WRD and is now rolled out for
used for all contract management and for management of all irrigation systems in the
State.


14
     The studies included: (1) Impact Assessment Study of Harsi Irrigation Scheme, 2011, by the Centre
     for Knowledge Management & Good Governance, Noronha Academy of Administration &
     Management; (2) Impact Assessment Study of Chambal Irrigation Project Under W.R. Division,
     Gohad, District Bhind, 2013 by WAPCOS Ltd; (3) Impact Assessment Study of Doraha Irrigation
     Scheme, 2013, School of Good Governance and Policy Analysis of the National Academy of
     Agricultural Research Management (NAARM); (4) Impact Assessment Study of Aoda Irrigation
     Scheme and (5) Impact Assessment Study of Harsi Irrigation Scheme, 2013-2014, by NAARM; and
     (6) Impact Assessment Study of Chambal Irrigation Project, March 2014, by NAARM.




                                                  12
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguard Compliance
46.     Environmental Assessment. As the scope of works was on rehabilitation and
modernization of existing irrigation schemes, no significant negative environmental
impacts were identified, including on forestry and bio-diversity. There was generally
satisfactory compliance with environmental safeguards, although reporting was not
always timely and detailed. PICU appointed an Environmental Specialist to ensure that
the SEMF was implemented in contract works. This involved ensuring that SMPs had
the necessary environmental safeguards and construction contracts had the requisite
Environmental Management Plans.
47.     A contract related to the lining of the Swarn Rekha River that runs through
Gwalior City was subject to a Phase 1 Inspection Panel investigation in 2011 after a
complaint that the project had led to increased pollution of the river with sewage water.
After investigations, the Inspection Panel opted not to carry out a full investigation.
GoMP prepared an action plan to reduce sewage inflow in the river, which is under
implementation.
48.    Pest Management. Demonstrations and training on integrated pest management
(IPM) and Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) were carried out in project
schemes to motivate farmers to use reduced quantities of agricultural chemicals and
move towards organic and biodynamic farming approaches involving the use of green
manure, crop residues, vermi-compost, bio-fertilizers, and bio-pesticides. The
Department of Agriculture is expected to continue this kind of support to farmers.
49.     Cultural Property. No issues were raised during the project affecting physical
cultural resources. The Chandela Tanks mentioned in the PAD are in the Bundelkhand
Region which was dropped from the project at an early stage due to alternative funding
from the RRR scheme.
50.     Involuntary resettlement. No involuntary resettlement was carried out under the
project.
51.     Indigenous Peoples. The requirement for a Tribal Plan was not triggered for
any of the project schemes as no scheme had a significant tribal population. The SMP
provided the necessary social profile to enable identification of significant tribal
populations, should it have occurred.
52.     Safety of Dams. The project was in compliance with the Dam Safety policy,
and work programs for each dam were implemented satisfactorily. A number of SMPs
were subjected to dam safety review as per State Dam Safety guidelines. Periodic
inspection of these dams is carried out by a Dam Safety Review Panel to investigate
hydrological, structural, and geological status/stability of the dam, and critical
identified issues were incorporated, as needed, in SMPs and relevant mitigation
measures were proposed to address any dam safety issue. The results of pre- and post-
monsoon inspection and assessment conducted by WRD staff were incorporated into
SMPs as needed. The Bank-funded Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project is
currently under implementation, with MP as one of the benefiting states.
53.     Projects on International Waterways. As a rehabilitation and modernization
project, the project has not increased water abstractions above the pre-project levels.
An exemption to notification was approved before project appraisal.

                                           13
2.4.2 Fiduciary Compliance

54.     Procurement was generally carried out in accordance with agreed procedures.
PICU mostly complied with the Bank’s procurement policies and regulations and was
provided guidance and implementation support by the Bank’s procurement specialist.
There was a mis-procurement under the project, resulting in a cancelation of US$6.62
million of loan funds in March 2009. The work was later retendered and financed from
State funds.
55.     Procurement procedures were changed in early 2012 and a Central Procurement
System was introduced based on the EMIS, whereby all procurement was carried out
by a specialist team based in PICU in Bhopal. This procedure greatly improved the
procurement processes, with the period for tendering reduced from over four months to
an average of two months, in some cases as low as five weeks. Procurement post
reviews did not reveal any major procurement deficiencies (the mis-procurement was a
prior review case).
56.     Financial Management arrangements, including accounting, reporting,
budgeting and funds flow, internal controls, and staffing were generally adequate. A
Financial Management Manual, acceptable to the Bank, was prepared by PICU, which
formed the basis for the financial management processes and procedures. A system of
quarterly internal audit by the internal audit team of the State Finance Department was
set up as part of the project and provided good oversight of the project’s financial
management, though timely resolution of audit observations was an issue at times.
57.    Annual project accounts were audited each financial year by the State
Accountant General on behalf of the Comptroller and Accountant General of India. The
annual audited project financial statements were submitted regularly to the Bank each
year. Apart from some issues with advance payments to WUAs which were later
declared as eligible on submission of utilization certificates, the annual audit reports
issued by the Accountant General did not have any major qualifications.
58.     PICU engaged consultants to develop a financial reporting system for the
project to facilitate online financial reporting between the 42 divisions and PICU.
However, due to the delay in development of the software, much of its relevance was
lost with alternative systems developed by the state for government departments and
the software was not rolled out to all divisions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
59.      The project set out to modernize irrigation and drainage infrastructure and to
initiate change and establish sustainable institutions for water resources and irrigation
management in Madhya Pradesh. Post-project transition and management
arrangements built into the project at the design and restructuring stages have
materialized and are functioning, as summarized below:
      i)   Water Resources Management Wing is functioning. A permanent WRM
           Wing has been established within WRD with responsibility for the planning
           and management of water resources in Madhya Pradesh. The WRM Wing is
           staffed by WRD personnel, who were trained in the Netherlands under the
           project. The WRM Wing is now well positioned to advise the State
           Empowered Committee (formerly the State Water Utilization Committee)


                                           14
     under the Chief Secretary on all matters related to water allocation and
     management in the State.
ii) River basin plans have been prepared, adopted and are in use. WRD staff
    have prepared two modern, comprehensive river basin plans for the Sindh and
    Chambal River Basins. These river basin plans represent a step change in the
    way such plans are prepared, and subsequently used. They set the benchmark
    for the preparation of river basin plans for the other eight river basins in MP
    over the coming years.
iii) EMIS is functioning and is being developed further. EMIS has had a major
     impact on the way business is, and will be, carried out by WRD. It has enabled
     the collection of reservoir and canal discharge data in real time, facilitating a
     step change in the way the irrigation systems are managed. It has modernized
     construction works contracts, with e-tendering and e-billing greatly
     simplifying and greatly increasing the transparency of these processes. It has
     significantly increased the transparency and accountability of WRD, with data
     on major, medium and minor schemes in the State available to interested
     parties, together with monitoring reports on reservoir levels and volumes,
     flooding, etc.
iv) Modernized irrigation management procedures have been established and
    are functioning. With regularly updated data, senior management in WRD is
    now able to set targets and monitor achievement of rabi irrigated areas in each
    scheme through weekly teleconferences with all Divisional offices. Divisional
    Executive Engineers, Assistant Engineers, and Sub-ordinate Engineers now
    work very closely with the strengthened Water Users Associations to achieve
    these targets. As a result, the rabi irrigated area has increased three-fold since
    2010-11, closing the gap between the irrigation potential created and the
    irrigation potential utilized, which was a key objective of the project. Timely
    maintenance has been recognized as a key contributory factor to improving
    system performance and the overall maintenance budget has been increased.
v)   WALMI is functioning well. In the second half of the project WALMI was
     contracted to develop week-long field-based training rather than classroom-
     based training of WUA management and water users. This process was
     successful and with a restructured WALMI again being under WRD control
     and with additional funds, this approach will be continued.
vi) Water Users Associations have been strengthened. WUAs have been
    strengthened through the project in a number of ways, including through
    training and capacity building. Election rules have been changed, so one-third
    of the committee is re-elected each two years, and the President is now elected
    by the Committee, making him/her more accountable. WUAs are now fully
    accepted by WRD as important partners in the management of I&D systems.
vii) Agricultural research and extension has been strengthened. The two
     agricultural universities have done a good job of carrying out adaptive field
     trials on improved water management technologies and promoting these
     practices to both water users and line department personnel. They have
     project-funded micro-irrigation demonstration plots on their campuses and are
     involved in on-going programs for training line department staff, using
     findings developed under the project.
                                       15
      viii) Fisheries growth and development underway. The Fisheries Department
            has been considerably strengthened through the project and new approaches to
            fisheries production have been developed. The good results achieved on
            project reservoirs and village ponds can now be expanded to other communities.
60.    The performance of the main project outcome, increased irrigated area, will
continue to be closely monitored by WRD using EMIS.

61.     Discussions have been held between WRD’s Principal Secretary and the Bank’s
task team on a follow-on project and an initial concept outline was shared with the task
team in November 2015. It considers resilient and sustainable development of the state
water resources to address current and future water needs of all uses and users. This
draft concept fits well with GoMP’s and the Bank’s current focus on integrated water
resources management, using river basin planning as its foundation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: Substantial

62.      With an economy dominated by agriculture for which irrigation is a critical
input, the project objective was highly relevant and in line with GoMP’s objectives and
priorities. These objectives were also consistent with GoI, GoMP’s, and the CAS
(2001) higher-level goal of poverty reduction and growth within a strong enabling
environment, and continued to be so with the six priority water sector reforms identified
in the Country Assistance Strategy of FY 2009-2012. 15 The objectives are also
consistent with the FY2013-2017 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) overarching
goals of helping India to accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction, and increase
shared prosperity. In this respect, the project contributed to CPS Engagement Area 2 –
transformation through increased agricultural productivity.

63.     Improving agricultural production and productivity of water continue to be a
high priority for GoMP and for India as a whole. With increasing competition for water
for domestic, industrial, and power uses, the focus continues to be on ensuring that the
productivity of water use in agriculture is efficient and optimum.




15
     These include: (i) enabling water policies and institutional and legal frameworks to improve
     stewardship of the resource; (ii) inter-sectoral approaches at the basin level that integrate surface
     water with ground water; (iii) restructuring of public sector institutions (including through capacity
     building and the strategic realignment of incentive structures and skill mixes) and the establishment
     of new institutions (including regulatory authorities, WUAs, river basin agencies and public-private
     partnerships); (iv) decentralized and participatory service delivery mechanisms with a particular focus
     on improving customer/user service, enhancing accountability and transparency and extending
     service to the poor; (v) modern management practices and technology applications, including
     improved operation and maintenance (O&M) through asset management planning and the
     development of a comprehensive knowledge base and decision support tools; and (vi) financial
     sustainability of resource management and service delivery through rational charges and tariffs and
     improved financial management including removing distorting subsidies and moving towards user
     charges that reflect at least O&M costs (CAS, 2009-12, p.15).
                                                     16
64.      Despite the slightly different formulation of the PDO in the PAD and the Loan
Agreement, both have improving productivity of water as the core objective. This is
supported by the statements made in the Strategic Context and Rationale Section of the
PAD. The PDO is realistic given that the project scope was to close the gap between
irrigation potential created and irrigation potential utilized, which varied between 40-
70 percent on major, medium, and minor irrigation schemes in Madhya Pradesh. The
project correctly focused on modernization of physical assets and better water
management to contribute to the higher-level objectives of sustainable growth and
poverty alleviation, particularly for farmers and communities located in the tail-end and
peripheries of the irrigation systems.

Relevance of Design: Substantial

65.      Relevance of the design was substantial. The main components of the project
were related to institutional and policy issues and to improvement of I&D system
infrastructure. Project design rightly focused on the need to rehabilitate and modernize
irrigation infrastructure, which at appraisal was functioning poorly or not at all,
resulting in low overall productivity. It was also correct to focus on improving water
resources and irrigation management by both WRD and WUAs to increase the
command area under actual cultivation, and in addition design interventions that would
increase the productivity of these lands. All project components contribute to achieving
the PDO, correctly targeting the need to improve: (i) the condition and performance of
infrastructure; (ii) management of infrastructure to make full use of improved
infrastructure and available water resources; (iii) overall water resources management
to quantify, plan, and allocate available water resources; and (iv) agricultural and
fisheries practices to make optimum use of the more adequate, reliable, and timely
irrigation water supplies. As was shown through adaptive trials carried out by the
agricultural universities, significant value addition is to be had per unit of irrigation
water supplied through improved farming practices, substantially raising the
productivity of water for major crops.

66.     The Project design focused on activities to support implementation of the
recently adopted State Water Policy and the national and state objectives of increased
participation by water users in water resources and irrigation management. The
objective to move towards integrated water resources management and to separate the
functions of water resource management from irrigation service delivery should be seen
as a longer-term objective that takes time to achieve. It was too ambitious to expect
that such complex and time-consuming developments could be fully achieved under a
first Bank-funded project in the irrigation sector in MP.

67.    The results framework correctly focused on measuring the modernization of
physical assets and better water management. The results framework could have been
stronger in some cases to measure outcomes rather than outputs (e.g. by quantifying the
improved production achieved in the PDO indicator rather than just the irrigation
command area modernized) and to provide quantified targets (as was done for fisheries
but not family incomes). The revised indicators contributed adequately to the
measurement of the outcomes of the overall project, as well as the various components.



                                           17
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
          Overall Rating: Substantial
68.     The project has achieved the main objective of improving productivity of water
as set out in the PDO,16 measured in agricultural and fisheries production. As a result
of project interventions, the area under actual irrigation increased from about 242,000
ha at appraisal to almost 597,000 ha (92 percent of the command area covered under
the project), with about the same water resources. This was achieved by much more
efficient irrigation infrastructure as a result of canal lining, canal cleaning, and
reconstruction and repair of hydraulic structures. These physical interventions, coupled
with improved water management by WRD and WUAs and improved agricultural and
fisheries practices, all aided by capacity building support and other interventions under
the project, improved water productivity considerably. Crop production per unit of
water delivered more or less doubled for the three main crops (wheat, mustard, and
gram or chickpea), a much higher increase than the targeted 20 percent. This large
increase in productivity has contributed to the higher-level objectives stated in the PDO.
The state economy is still highly dependent on agriculture, and the large increase in
irrigated agriculture as a result of the project is positively supporting economic growth.
The project’s impacts on poverty was also positive as it enabled irrigated farming in a
much larger area than before the project during the dry season, providing farmers with
opportunities to augment their income and reduce vulnerability to climate shocks.
Project benefits were inclusive, as a large number of project beneficiaries were farmers
with less than two ha of land. Fisheries enabled typically poorer and socially
disadvantaged households to augment their income on a significant scale.

69.       Achievements under the post-restructuring PDO indicators are highlighted
below:
(i) Improved farm income of project beneficiaries
70.     The economic analysis (Annex 3) shows that incomes of all categories of
landholders have increased as a result of project activities. Impact studies also showed
that the project was proportionately more beneficial to tail-end water users. Using data
from the Chambal Irrigation Scheme, the impact survey and economic analysis show
that net income from the major wheat crop increased by 18 percent in the head reaches,
28 percent in the middle reaches, and 35 percent in the tail reaches (for those who
already had some access to water). For many farmers in the tail reaches, who did not
have access to irrigation water and could not grow an irrigated crop, the impact has
been much more marked.

71.      As a result of the project, the gap between irrigation potential created and
irrigation potential utilized has reduced from an average of 73 percent in 2010-11 to 8



16
     In the PAD PDO the productivity of water is defined as the sum of the multi-sectoral benefits per unit
     of water use in a river basin framework. This was considered to include a range of benefits, from
     irrigated agriculture and fisheries through to environment and other community uses of water, with
     the inherent objective that water should be put to an optimal combination of beneficial uses across
     sectors. The results indicators in the PAD do not provide a composite indicator for measuring the
     productivity of water; rather it is broken down into component parts for the main water uses for
     agriculture and fisheries.
                                                    18
percent in 2014-15. 17 This change has benefitted tail-end farmers in irrigation
commands, particularly in Bhind District at the tail-end of the Chambal Irrigation
System where many areas had not received water from the canal network for over 30
years.

72.      These benefits are directly related to the outputs from Components B: Service
Delivery and Component C: Improving Productivity. Procurement and installation of
computers and associated communication networks has significantly improved
communication between WRD offices. This has been supported by the web-based
EMIS, without which the enhanced performance-based irrigation water management
procedures would not have been possible. WRD and WUAs have benefitted from
institutional improvements in water resources management as a result of which the
irrigation service delivery capacity has improved. WUAs have been able to improve
the link between WRD and water users. Finally there were the substantial
improvements to irrigation infrastructure.

(ii) Targeted families with increased incomes

73.     The PAD estimated that some 193,000 farm households would be beneficially
impacted by the project. Impact studies indicate that about 400,000 farm households
have increased incomes. The estimated incremental net farm incomes in 2004 prices at
Rs. 26,122 is 8 percent higher than the PAD projected value of Rs. 24,291. However,
the estimated numbers of rural households whose incomes would exceed the per capita
income cut-off level for poverty line, is somewhat (14 percent) lower than the PAD
projection (63,397 households versus 73,637 households) solely because of smaller
than projected numbers of farmers with marginal and small landholdings in the
rehabilitated schemes and the overall decline of rural poor at the State level. Linkages
to project outputs from Components B and C are similar to those discussed above.

(iii) Increased crop production per unit of water delivered

74.      The productivity of water has increased substantially as a result of project
activities (Table 2), brought about by a mixture of works modernized under Component
C, improved management procedures developed under Component B, and improved
on-farm agricultural practices by farmers linked to the agricultural intensification
outputs of Component C. Adaptive research by universities has shown the benefit
(“value added”) of improved field level practices by farmers to the productivity of water,
with increases (over farmers’ current practices) ranging from 60 to 87 percent (see
Annex 2, Table A2.7).

75.     The PDO indicator target of 0.48 kg/m3 (for wheat) has been exceeded, with
values from the 22 impact studies recording a weighted average of 0.78 kg/m3, just less
than twice the baseline average value of 0.40 kg/m3.

     Conversely the culturable command area utilization rose from 27 percent (176,000 ha) in 2010-11 to
     92 percent (597,000 ha) in 2014-15.

76.     Increase in irrigated area from works under Component C has been supported
by agricultural intensification and diversification under the Component. As a result,
yields have improved, contributing to increases in output and value of agricultural
production per unit area cropped (Table 3 shows results for five schemes, including a
large part of Chambal).

(iv) Increased fisheries production in targeted water bodies
77.     Outputs from the fisheries sub-component of Component C have led to
significantly increased productivity of water in 170 reservoirs and 82 village ponds.
Average fish production increased from a baseline of 10-20 kg/ha of water spread area
(WSA) to around 114 kg/ha WSA (190 percent of end target) and in village ponds from
between 500-1000 kg/ha WSA to 2,479 kg/ha WSA (99 percent of minimum end target).
Overall, fisheries activities have contributed a benefit of Rs. 340 million in 2014/15
alone, against a total investment under the Project of Rs.188 million, with poor and
landless fishers being the main beneficiaries. The Project investments have resulted
not only in improving productivity in project reservoirs and village ponds, but also
contributed to the construction of the Fisheries Training Institute at Nowgong,
enhancement of the capacity of six existing seed production units and the construction
of a new unit, and training of Fisheries Department staff and farmers/fishers, thereby
contributing to the sustainability of this project activity.

      These figures are the average for the total CCA and take account of large areas in the tail end of the
      Chambal System (especially in Bhind District) which had not received water for many years.
                                                     20
(v) Area provided with I&D services
78.     The core output of Component C: Improving Productivity, was the
modernization of 651,000 ha CCA in 228 schemes, exceeding the original target value
of 495,000 ha CCA. In addition, as noted above, the gap between IPC and IPU has
been greatly reduced as a result of works and improved management procedures.
Volumetric measurement is at the heart of the WRD’s modernized water management
procedures whereby the volume of water in the reservoir is measured at the start of the
rabi season in mid-September and target irrigated areas set, based on one (1) million
cubic meters (MCM) being sufficient to irrigated 200 ha. Water is then distributed by
continuous flow in main canals and rotated flow in distributaries and minors, with water
allocation based on supplying Full Supply Level (FSL) in the distributaries and
proportional distribution down the minors. As a result of the project activities,
including this approach, the irrigated area utilization (actual irrigated area/design
command area) was successfully increased from 27 percent in 2010/11 to 92 percent in
2014/15, or from around 176,000 ha to 596,750 ha. The area irrigated on project
schemes in 2014-15 represents 25 percent of the total area irrigated in Madhya Pradesh
from government schemes, an increase from 19 percent in 2010/11.
79.     Annex 2 provides a more detailed analysis of the increase in the irrigated area
over the last five years and the volume of irrigation water supplied. For the Chambal
Irrigation Scheme the analysis shows that the annual volume of irrigation water
supplied has stabilized at around 1,100 MCM between 2011-12 and 2014-15 with the
area irrigated per MCM of irrigation water supplied being around 270 ha. This figure
has grown from a relatively poor level of 78 ha/MCM in 2006-7, essentially a three-
fold increase in productivity.
(vi) Operational water users associations created and/or strengthened
80.      Outputs from Component B have developed and strengthened the capacity of
367 WUAs in 228 Project schemes, thereby enabling them to better manage the
allocation and distribution of water to water users, as well as the maintenance of the
irrigation systems.
81.     Initial training of 477 WUAs19 by a consultancy firm was followed up with
targeted field-based training by WALMI on water management, operation, and
maintenance for 126 WUAs. This latter training was successful in building the capacity
of the WUAs as well as that of WALMI, particularly in developing field-based training.
This type of training is to be continued by WALMI for other WUAs, with funding from
GoMP. WUAs are now working closely with WRD in increasing the irrigated area in
their commands and managing the available water as efficiently as possible.
(vii) Water users provided with new/improved I&D services
82.     Of the 635,414 water users benefitting from the project 243,796 are women20.
The gap between irrigation potential created (the CCA) and the irrigation potential
utilized (actual CCA area irrigated) has been reduced as a result of the Project. This
has particularly benefited tail-end water users. A large part of this achievement is


19
     This training covered schemes that were initially included in the project, before the reduction of
     schemes was initiated. The total number was later reduced due to grant support from GoI for minor
     schemes under the RRR program.

     Data obtained from the WUA registers for all 228 schemes.
                                                  21
attributed to selective canal lining and construction of hydraulic structures carried out
under Component C, which has enabled water to be conveyed much more efficiently to
the lower reaches of irrigation schemes. WUA capacity building activities under
Component B have also provided water users with improved management services.

3.3 Efficiency

       Rating: Substantial

83.     The overall estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is 28.9 percent which is
moderately higher than the PAD projected ERR of 21.6 percent. The financial rate of
return (FRR) is 28.3 percent, which is also higher than the PAD estimated FRR of 24.6
percent. The estimated economic net present value (ENPV) is Rs.16.7 billion at an
opportunity cost of 12 percent and 2004 prices (the same discount rate and prices as in
the PAD). This is higher than the corrected PAD ENPV at Rs. 11.1 billion (a correction
was made to erroneous links to economic prices in the PAD estimate). The estimated
financial net present value is Rs. 17.6 billion, which is slightly higher than the PAD
projected FNPV of Rs. 17.2 billion.
84.     Despite significant delays in project implementation and limited crop
diversification towards vegetables, spices, fruits, and fodder crops, the assessment
shows net present values similar or higher than the PAD estimates. This is due to the
Project: (i) providing irrigation water to a larger area than was projected (50 percent
higher than projected); and (ii) achieving 35 to 56 percent higher crop yield increases.
85.    As indicated in a previous section, the estimated incremental net farm incomes
in 2004 prices at Rs. 26,122 is eight percent higher than the PAD projected value of Rs.
24,291. The estimated numbers of rural households whose incomes would exceed the
per capita income cut-off level for poverty line, is lower than the PAD projection as
explained in paragraph 73. Similarly, the estimated numbers of newly created jobs is
14 percent less than projected due to the unrealized projections for diversification
towards more labor intensive crops.
86.     The ICRR economic analysis additionally tested the impact of the project
implementation delays on the economic and financial results. If the project had faced
no implementation delays, it would have generated higher financial and economic
returns at FRR of 34.7 percent and FNPV of Rs. 34.5 billion, and ERR of 36.1 percent
and ENPV of Rs. 35.1 billion. This analysis assumes no crop diversification in the
‘with project’ scenario.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.      Relevance of objectives, relevance of design, achievement of the PDO, and
efficiency are all rated substantial. The assessed moderate shortcomings of the project
relate to its slow start, the long implementation period, a degree of over-ambition in its
approach to institutional change and development, and an over-reliance on
consultancies. Important shortcomings were addressed during the restructuring in 2012.
On balance, project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.


                                           22
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
88.     Poverty Impacts. An assessment carried out by a poverty and gender specialist
during the preparation of the ICRR found that project impacts on poverty were positive.
The project enabled irrigated farming in a large tract of land during the dry season,
providing farmers with opportunities to augment their income and reduce vulnerability
to climate shocks. Project benefits were found to be inclusive, as a large number of
project beneficiaries were farmers with less than two hectares of land. This poorer
segment of the beneficiary group successfully adopted irrigated wheat cultivation
during the rabi season and produced surplus to sell. The project’s support to reservoir
fisheries exclusively benefitted traditional fishing communities who were poorer and
socially disadvantaged, and augmented their income significantly.
89.     Gender Aspects. Among the smaller landholding households, both men and
women worked considerably less (if not entirely gave up) as casual agricultural labor
during rabi to work on their own fields. Though both male and female adult members
of household are members of the WUA, and some 30 WUAs have women Presidents,
more targeted capacity building support for women is necessary to translate the
opportunity arising from equal representation in enhanced roles and performance. As
part of the field-based WUA training program, WALMI will focus more on this in
future.
90.     Social Development. WUA office bearers and farmers interviewed were
satisfied that the project has resulted in tail-end farmers getting water and improving
productivity. They were appreciative of the participatory efforts and are looking
forward to further engagement in participatory irrigation management. WUA capacity
has been built through training and capacity building and there is strong commitment
by WRD to working in partnership with WUAs and water users to increase agricultural
production in Madhya Pradesh. According to the WRD Principal Secretary the
significant improvement in irrigated area achieved between 2010-11 and 2014-5 would
not have been possible without WRD staff working in close collaboration with WUA
Presidents, Committee members, and water users.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
91.    The project has supported significant institutional change. A step change has
been achieved in attitudes within WRD to water resources planning and management
and WRD is no longer seen as being only (or predominantly) for irrigation and
construction. Project-supported education and training of ten WRD staff in UNESCO-
IHE, Delft in the Netherlands and the preparation of two comprehensive river basin
plans have greatly increased awareness, understanding, and knowledge of how water
resources should be managed, and river basin plans prepared and used.
92.     Significant change has also occurred in the way WRD manages irrigation
schemes, with greater responsibility now placed on Divisional Executive Engineers to
ensure that: (i) systems are in a fit state to supply water; and (ii) water is used efficiently
and productively. The focus on outcomes (area productively irrigated) rather than
outputs (water delivered) has fundamentally changed the way WRD works. This
performance-based approach, which is now applied to all irrigation schemes in MP, has
been made possible as a result of the project introducing computers (and associated

                                              23
staff training) in all WRD offices and modernization of the procedures for data
collection, processing, and analysis using EMIS.
93.     Institutional changes have occurred in WALMI for field-based training of
WUAs, whereby a multi-disciplinary WALMI team, with support from WRD staff
works with one WUA for an entire week on training, system walk-through, looking for
scheme-specific opportunities to manage the WUA-managed system better, etc. These
measures are set to continue with GoMP having sanctioned expansion of the faculty
and activities at WALMI. With the strong support of the Project, WUAs have been
strengthened, and are expected to continue to develop in the coming years.
94.     Agricultural education, training, and extension have been changed by the
Project, with a greater focus and understanding now in the agricultural universities of
the important role that improved water management plays in agricultural production in
the State. Fisheries have made significant strides with the support of the Project, and
the previously rather weak Fisheries Department has been given a strong boost by the
results achieved.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
95.      No unintended outcomes and impacts were observed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
96.     A survey was carried out to assess the satisfaction amongst water users with the
level of water delivery service following project interventions (Annex 5). Results show
that over 91 percent of those surveyed were either satisfied (64 percent) or highly
satisfied (27 percent) with the level of service provided.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
      Rating: Moderate
97.     The development outcome is potentially affected by factors external to the
project (such as droughts, changes in pricing policies for agricultural products, etc.) or
by internal factors within key institutions (WRD, Department of Agriculture,
Department of Horticulture (DoH), Fisheries Department, WUAs).
98.   The following factors are identified as potential risks to the development
outcome:
      (i) Water shortages or drought. Water shortages caused by low rainfall during
          the monsoon period may adversely affect the area that can be irrigated during
          the following rabi season, and thus agricultural production and farmer
          livelihoods. However, the improved water management measures should
          mitigate this risk, while the lining of canals will make delivery of surface water
          supplies more efficient. During 2014-15 when rainfall was below average the
          area irrigated remained the same as in 2013-14, which was an above average
          rainfall year. The risk to the development outcome is rated as Moderate.
      (ii) Loss of GoMP commitment to maintaining and enhancing agricultural
           production. Changes in the way WRD now manages irrigation are both
           technical and institutional, with competent staff being appointed to key
           positions in the organization. In the past there had been some political
           interference in these appointments, which represents a risk to the professional
                                            24
          manner in which irrigation water management is now carried out. Mitigating
          factors are the increased expectations of a large number of farmers who have
          benefitted from the improved condition and performance of the canal network
          and improved management. It has been suggested that: (i) service contracts
          are prepared between WRD and WUAs for each scheme, clearly stating the
          targets for each scheme; and (ii) annual results for each scheme are publicized
          and monitored against previous years’ performance. The risk to development
          outcome is rated as Moderate.
     (iii) Loss of focus on performance management for irrigation. The current
           performance-focused management approach within WRD has been in place
           now for five years, and is becoming the established way of doing business.
           However there is a risk that management may slip back to the previous less
           intensive management approaches. As with (ii), mitigation measures include
           greater transparency and accountability, particularly to water users. The risk
           to the development outcome is rated as Moderate.
     (iv) Failure to update and maintain computerized systems. The provision of
          computers and internet links to all WRD offices in MP and the development of
          the EMIS have significantly changed the way that WRD communicates, and
          how it collects, processes, records, and reports data. There is a risk that these
          computer systems are not updated by WRD. However, this risk is assessed as
          Negligible as they have proved their worth and their use is now mainstreamed.
     (v) Failure of Water Users Associations. There is a potential risk that WUAs
         are not sustained, either by their members or by WRD. WRD intends to
         continue to invest time, effort, and resources in supporting WUAs, as is evident
         by the formation of the PIM faculty within WALMI. Positive evidence in favor
         of sustainability of the WUAs are the regular elections, the phased replacement
         of committee members, the selection of the president by the WUA committee,
         and the increasing involvement of women. Water users have also seen the
         benefit of functional WUAs with regard to water management. It is therefore
         unlikely that water users and members of WUAs will allow WUAs to fail and
         the risk to the development outcome is rated as Moderate.
     (vi) Failure to adequately maintain the I&D systems. Through its performance-
          based approach to irrigation water management, senior WRD management has
          come to better appreciate the difficulties WRD officers in the field experience
          when the condition of their schemes limits performance levels. In non-project
          schemes additional maintenance funds have been provided to address
          identified bottlenecks. To address the issue in the longer term GoMP is set to
          raise the annual maintenance grant to WUAs from Rs. 100/ha to Rs. 300/ha in
          the 2016/17 budget. In addition, the annual maintenance funding and
          expenditure has been rising year-on-year from Rs. 39.44 crore (Rs.179/ha) in
          2010/11 to Rs. 200 crore (Rs.909/ha) in 2015/16.21 Annual expenditure of Rs.
          900-1000/ha is considered to be adequate for maintenance of these systems.
          The risk to the development outcome is rated as Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.    The project was aligned with the objectives of GoI and GoMP, and with the
Bank’s CAS. In particular the project addressed key issues identified in the joint World
Bank/GoI Water Resources Management Sector Review carried out in 1998. Poverty,
gender, and social development aspects were adequately identified and discussed, as
were environmental and safeguard policy compliance concerns through the
commissioning of an ESA and associated SEMF. Implementation arrangements were
adequately addressed through the preparation of a detailed PIP. Financial management
and procurement were well covered in separate annexes within the PAD.

100.    Project design was ambitious and complex, especially in the context of the
expected institutional reforms and the demands placed by procurement of multiple
consultancy services contracts on a project management team inexperienced in this
form of Bank-funded project. In addition, the M&E design as presented in the Results
Framework had some shortcomings in quantifying targets. These shortcomings became
apparent during project implementation and were adequately addressed by project
restructuring in 2012. Valuable lessons have been learned for the design of future
projects.

(b) Quality of Supervision

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
101.    Regular implementation review and support missions were fielded throughout
the project duration and detailed aide memoires were prepared after every review
mission. There was adequate supervision budget to enable technical specialists to
participate in missions, in addition to Bank specialists for safeguards and fiduciary
reviews. The team leader was always an experienced water engineer, which facilitated
dialogue with government.

102.    It is evident from the aide memoires of the early project years that there were
significant delays in starting the physical works (and the associated slow disbursement
of loan proceeds) as well as issues with the management of the project. The Bank’s
reporting of project progress in the early years did not always adequately and candidly
reflect project status and issues. By the time of the MTR in 2008 only 14 percent of
the loan had disbursed, yet achievement of the DO and IP were still rated moderately
satisfactory. Additionally, a shortcoming of the supervision was the failure to
restructure the project at the time of the MTR. Given these shortcomings, the quality
of Bank supervision over the first half of the project is considered moderately
unsatisfactory (MU).

103.   From mid-2010 onwards the quality of supervision improved significantly. In
addition to safeguards, fiduciary, and M&E support, the Bank fielded multi-disciplinary
teams with expertise in water resources management, WUA development, engineering,

                                          26
agriculture, fisheries, agricultural economy, and water law, to provide the required
implementation support. For example, Bank specialists influenced WUA legislation
and the change in the election of committee members, supported PICU with the
development of impact assessments, and were influential in the setting up of the WRM
Wing and the training of specialists in river basin planning in the Netherlands. Regular
interaction between senior management in WRD and Bank staff was appreciated by
WRD as it led to much sharing of knowledge and experience.

104.    Reporting on project performance appeared to have become more objective as
well. It was also recognized that the initial framing of the project had been too
ambitious and complex in certain areas and consequently the project was restructured
in June 2012. This allowed the project to focus on a more limited number of activities
and fully achieve its objectives. Overall, the quality of Bank supervision over the
second half of the project is considered satisfactory.

105.    The combination of a moderately unsatisfactory first half of the project with a
satisfactory performance in the second half merits an overall assessment of Moderately
Satisfactory for Bank performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
106.    Based on the ratings of Moderately Satisfactory for both Ensuring Quality at
Entry and for Quality of Supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
107.    GoMP provided sustained support during the preparation and implementation
of the project. A Project Steering Committee was established with the Chief Secretary,
GoMP, as the Chairperson with a smaller sub-committee overseeing all financial,
procurement, and administrative matters related to the project. In addition, GoMP
established the Project Implementation Coordination Unit in August 2002 and
maintained the same Project Director for 2 ½ years until just after the project started
implementation. This continuity in PD was sustained for the majority of the project,
with the appointment of two senior government officials full time as PD serving 3.2
and 3.8 years, respectively, from December 2006 to December 2013.
108.   Though PICU was established to assist with project preparation, there were
some shortcomings in the level of staffing as not all involved line agencies appointed
nodal officers for the Project. As a result coordination between PICU and line agencies
was at times weak. Though covenants relating to the establishment of SWaRA and
SWaRDAC were complied with, staffing of SWaRA in particular was weak and it was
never able to successfully implement its mandate as GoMP, with support of the Bank
was looking at other ways to regulate water resources.
109.    Government supported the Project through revision of regulations governing
election of WUA Committee members and WUA Presidents. These changes facilitated


                                           27
improved management of WUAs. Additionally, changes to the structure and funding
of WALMI benefited project implementation and sustainability of WUAs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
110.    Cells were established in PICU for core activities, including procurement,
accounting, agriculture, fisheries, environment, social development (WUAs),
engineering, and M&E. PICU was initially inexperienced with implementation of
Bank-funded projects and there was lack of staff experienced in some key aspects of
the project, such as water resources planning and management, remote sensing,
organizational change management, and business process re-engineering. There were
also a large number of consultancy contracts to deal with, some in areas outside the
experience of project management and staff. The level of detail expected by the Bank
in the SMPs caused delays. Over time these issues were resolved.
111.    PICU was proficient in financial management and procurement. Financial
reporting was regular, with timely submission of accounts to the Accountant General,
and in submission of annual audited financial statements to the Bank. Procurement of
works contracts was initially dealt with by the Chief Engineers in each of the project
basins, but due to delays in this process PICU introduced a Central Procurement System
in 2012. Thereafter procurement was far more efficient and timely, greatly reducing
the time between publication of requests for tender and contract award. Allied to this
process PICU established a system of e-billing and payment to contractors, which not
only simplified billing and payment but also facilitated far better monitoring of the
progress of works.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
112.  The overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the above ratings of
Government and implementing agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned
       (i) Limit the range and complexity of the project, especially on institutional
           aspects. The project was too ambitious in some aspects, especially related to
           some of the institutional activities, for a six year implementation period.
           These included the proposal to establish SWaRA and the extent of changes to
           modernize WRD. These activities were re-assessed during restructuring and
           the more modest approaches yielded good results. It had to be realized that
           institutional development is a long-term process. As an example, that was the
           reason that the Project ensured that WALMI was developed up to a level
           where it can continue to provide support and training to WUAs, rather than
           expecting that with one consultancy WUA training can be completed.
       (ii) Ensure early implementing agency engagement with new concepts.
            Several core concepts in MPWSRP were new to WRD, such as separation of
            water resources and irrigation management functions, volumetric
            measurement and charging, decision support systems, and holistic river basin
            management. PICU had difficulty in the early years in taking these concepts


                                           28
    on board, as much of it was outside PICU staff’s experience, including the
    preparation of terms of references for a large number of consultancies.
(iii) Take account of the complexities of institutional change. Institutional
      change within government agencies is always difficult as the structure,
      staffing, and financing for these agencies is not controlled by the agency, but
      by government. The project was formulated based on a number of identified
      institutional issues for which solutions were proposed based on an insufficient
      understanding of the difficulties inherent in closing the identified gaps in
      performance. The experience with this project is that it is easier and more
      productive to make smaller changes which are within the remit of the agency
      (such as establishing the WRM Wing within WRD) rather than larger changes
      which require review and agreement from government, as well as
      parliamentary approval.
(iv) Build good relationships between the Bank, the implementing agency,
     and government. Especially during the second half of the Project the Bank
     provided strong professional support and guidance, and the government
     showed strong commitment to ensuring successful implementation with
     strong and consistent leadership from senior personnel.
(v) Better understand the role of consultancies. There were notable difficulties
    with some of the consultancies. Of the 11 proposed consultancies, one was
    not let and four had to be terminated. Terms of references for some
    consultancies were too ambitious, e.g. the consultancy for WUA capacity
    building. The EMIS consultancy worked well because of the firm’s prior
    experience of similar work in India, the phased approach adopted, and the
    long duration of the assignment. Given the relative inexperience of the PICU
    team in supervising such a wide range of activities, it may have been
    preferable to select one consultancy to work as part of PICU alongside the
    government personnel. Such an approach has for example been adopted for
    the World Bank funded Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project
    in West Bengal and appears to be working well.
(vi) Build in-house capacity and develop ownership of institutional reforms.
     The preparation of the river basin plans by WRD staff rather than consultants
     has resulted in a step-change in the way in which WRD are now engaged in
     water resources management. There is a clear sense of pride and ownership
     of the river basin plans and a commitment to a more holistic approach to
     planning and management of the State’s water resources.
(vii) Take account of short construction periods for rehabilitation or
      modernization of I&D systems. MPWSRP construction timeframe was
      typically limited to about three months per year (April-June) due to the need
      to keep irrigation systems functioning to irrigate rabi crops and the constraints
      on construction during the monsoons. Thus the total MPWSRP construction
      period was only about 30 months (i.e. less than 25 percent of the total project
      time). More account needs to be taken of the feasibility of carrying out
      extensive rehabilitation or modernization works in these limited time frames.
      The Water Global Practice intends to launch a study to determine
      opportunities for more effective implementation of irrigation rehabilitation
      programs.

                                       29
       (viii) Benefits of performance-based management. A performance-based
             management approach has been adopted for operation and maintenance of the
             I&D systems, which has potential benefit for other States in India. The key
             elements of this approach have been: (i) introduction of computers and web-
             based data collection and processing systems in all WRD offices; (ii) strong
             leadership from senior WRD management; (iii) benchmarking performance
             and identification of performance targets (e.g. one MCM being sufficient to
             irrigate a minimum of 200 ha in rabi); (iv) enhanced pre-season maintenance
             inspections and associated funding to address constraints to system
             performance; (v) regular monitoring and feedback to field staff (in this case
             through the EMIS and weekly teleconferences); and (vi) a reward system for
             good performance and identification of causes of poor or less than anticipated
             performance.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
113.    Annex 7 provides comments by the Additional Chief Secretary of GoMP on the
draft ICRR. In general government is satisfied with the results of the project. In the
comments the importance of irrigation rehabilitation and modernization is stressed and
the fact that the Project has been able to exceed the original targets. Linking this to the
improved performance based management has allowed the State of Madhya Pradesh to
become one of the main agricultural producers in the country.
114.    Considering that the project has been completed successfully and that the
indicators were not only met but were surpassed, GoMP feels that the ICRR has under-
estimated the ratings. It is government’s view that based on the draft ICRR findings,
the rating should be improved to "Satisfactory".
115.   The Additional Chief Secretary appreciates the support provided by the Bank’s
supervision team. The letter provides ideas about continued engagement with the
World Bank through a follow on project. The Water Global Practice plans to follow up
with management of WRD in Madhya Pradesh.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component A. Water Resources Management - Institutions and Instruments
1.      This component was designed to support the establishment and
operationalization of water planning, allocation, and regulatory institutions and
instruments at the State and basin-levels. Three new agencies were proposed under the
original scope, a State Water Resources Agency (SWaRA), a State Water Resources
Data and Analysis Center (SWaRDAC), and a State Water Tariff Regulatory
Commission (SWaTReC). River basin plans were to be prepared for two river basins
and two River Basin Development and Management Boards (RBDMB) established in
the Sindh and Tons River Basins. Table A2.1 summarizes the results of the key project
outputs under this component.

                        target
 A.1   Creation and     Established   Achieved, in revised format.                                    Forming a separate agency to plan and manage water
       establish-       and           SWaRA was established, but was not adequately staffed.          resources was too ambitious. SWaRA did not have
       ment of          functioning   Following restructuring a Water Resources Management            sufficient track record and authority to be able to collect
       SWaRA            SWaRA         (WRM) Wing was created within the WRD and SWaRA                 essential data from other agencies on water resources
                                      was incorporated into this Wing. The WRM Wing was               utilization. Once incorporated into the WRD as a
                                      staffed with 10 WRM staff who underwent 1-year WRM              specialist unit, the WRM Wing was properly staffed and
                                      training at the specialist UN water training center at          able to function effectively.
                                      UNESCO-IHE in Delft, the Netherlands. WRM Wing staff
                                      are now engaged in water resources planning and
                                      management. Besides the training, the WRM wing was
                                      provided with equipment and materials under the project.
 A.2   Creation of      Established   Achieved.                                                       Establishment of SWaRDAC has been a success, mainly
       SWaRDAC          and           The SWaRDAC was formed on the existing WRD Data                 as it built on the existing WRD Data Centre and thus did
                        functioning   Centre. Following restructuring it was incorporated into the    not require any special institutional or budgetary changes
                        SWaRDAC       WRM Wing. The unit has functioned well during the               or instruments to form and staff it. It plays a central role
                                      project, collecting, processing, and reporting on surface and   in the WRD’s management of surface and groundwater
                                      groundwater resources for the whole State. It has been          resources and irrigation systems.
                                      further strengthened under the recently closed World Bank
                                      funded and Hydrology II Project, and will be engaged in the
                                      forthcoming Hydrology III Project. The Project supported
                                      SWaRDAC with equipment and materials.
 A.3   Preparation      Established   Partly Achieved after delays.                                   The intention of the SWaTReC was to establish a body
       of legislation   and           The draft SWaTReC legislation was prepared in the early         to set and oversee water charges in the different water
       and              functioning   stages of the project, but was not enacted until 2013 when      sub-sectors (irrigation, water supply, industry, energy
       establish-       SWaTReC       the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) enacted the             generation, etc.). There continues to be discussion in MP

Component B. Service Delivery – Irrigation and Drainage Institutions
2.      This component was designed to support delivery of reliable irrigation services at
rationalized cost by financially viable entities. Under the sub-component of irrigation line
agency reform, the main original activities that were to be carried out included: (i) study
tours and training courses; (ii) provision of modern equipment, such as survey, design,
communication, and computer equipment; and (iii) computer-based Management
Information System (MIS) and telemetry. In addition, the original project would support
a pilot Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). Under the sub-component of management
of irrigation and drainage (I&D) schemes, piloting of various management options was to
take place, including: (i) leasing part or a whole scheme to a private sector operator; (ii)
transfer management of part of systems to WUAs; (iii) transfer of management to a
financially-decentralized irrigation/drainage/fisheries entity; and (iv) specialized crop zone
management by the private sector.

3.      Following restructuring the proposed activities included: (i) separating irrigation
system management from irrigation planning, design, and construction by forming a
separate Irrigation Service Management (ISM) Wing within WRD, staffed with a specialist
cadre of irrigation system managers; (ii) adoption of modern technologies for irrigation
management, including the use of remote sensing, computer-based irrigation scheduling,
use of GIS databases, etc.; (iii) strengthening human resource management and training
capability in WRD; (iv) piloting of volumetric allocation of irrigation water supplies to
allocate water from the main system to WUAs; (v) development of conjunctive use of
surface and groundwater; (vi) focus on service delivery and performance management,
including benchmarking; (vii) pilot schemes to develop improved water management
practices, including command area development and re-engagement with WUAs; and (viii)
piloting options for public-private partnerships activities in scheme management.

4.     At restructuring the VRS was dropped and focus was more on performance
management of I&D systems, including benchmarking and the use of remote sensing to
assess performance. It also sought to further strengthen Water User Associations with a
renewed mandate to support WRD to minimize the gap between the irrigation potential
created and the actual area under irrigation by actively supporting on-farm developments
and providing support to WUAs.

9.     Irrigation Scheme Improvements. The breakdown of the planned and actual types
of scheme and area rehabilitated is provided in Table A2.4. The number of minor schemes
was significantly reduced due to the availability of grant funds from GoI for rehabilitation
of minor schemes under the RRR program. As a result, the total number of schemes has
been reduced from 654 to 228, but the actual area covered by the physical works has
increased to about 651,000 ha. The most significant change has been in the area
modernized in the Chambal Irrigation Scheme.

10.    A consequence of the change in the number of minor irrigation schemes is that the
number of beneficiaries has reduced from the estimates given in the PAD. This is due to
the generally smaller landholding sizes in minor schemes (Table A2.5).

11.   A summary of the main works is given in Table A2.6. It shows that the Project
worked on more than 5,900 km of canal, inclusive of more than 2,900 km of canal lining.
                                         44
The schemes have now also about 6,600 workable structures. These works have allowed
an improved management of the irrigation water which has led to a much better water
distribution throughout the schemes.

12.     Figure A2.1 shows the disbursement, physical works progress, and actual irrigated
area from 2005-6 to 2015-16. As the physical work progressed, the EMIS became
operational, and modernized irrigation management procedures introduced by the WRD in
2011-12 took effect, the actual irrigated area increased significantly. Where there was
surplus water available, WRD also started working with WUAs on irrigation during the
kharif season to overcome dry spells. Before EMIS, more efficient irrigation infrastructure,
and a better understanding of water management practices, WRD did not want to use water
during the kharif season for fear that there would be not enough water for the rabi season.

Figure A2.2. Due to a combination of improved physical condition of the irrigation and
drainage systems and change to modern irrigation management practices introduced by the
WRD in 2011-12 the average irrigated area utilization has risen from 27 percent in 2010-
11 to 92 percent in in 2014-15.

14.     Figure A2.3 shows the variation in the supply of irrigation water to the Chambal
Irrigation Scheme after the main canal re-enters Madhya Pradesh from Rajasthan. During
the period 2004-5 to 2010-11 the irrigated area is relatively low, around 100,000 ha, whilst
the volume of water supplied is relatively high initially (1073 MCM) and then dropping to
a low of 352 MCM. After 2010-11 the volume of irrigation water increases initially quite
substantially (due to completed project modernization works on the Main Canal and
gradual completion of secondary canals) to 1098 MCM in 2011-12 and then remains
relatively steady through to 2014-15. In the meantime the irrigated area increased to about
270,000 ha in 2011-12 up to 330,700 ha in 2014-15. The area irrigated per MCM steadily
increased over the period from a low of 78 ha/MCM in 2006-7 to a peak of 360 ha/MCM
in 2013-14. This improvement coincides with the physical modernization work being
carried out on sections of the system between 2007 and 2015.

15.     Impact of rainfall. A plot giving rainfall over the period (Figure A2.4) shows that
though rainfall increased in 2011-12 to 2013-14 there was a significant decline in 2014-15
and 2015-1622. These data indicate that the increase in irrigated area over this period is
due to factors other than good monsoon rainfall.

16.     Maintenance funding. As can be seen from Figure A2.5 the maintenance
expenditure in Madhya Pradesh for irrigation schemes has increased consistently over the
period 2010-11 to 2015-16, from Rs179/ha to Rs 909/ha respectively. This represents a
significant change in the levels of maintenance funding, and shows an increased

field trials to improve water use efficiency and productivity for soybean, wheat, and paddy
are presented in Table A2.7. As can be seen there are significant opportunities for

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     PAD estimated Project Benefits and Rate of Return
1.       The PAD (economic) cost benefit analysis projected that the project investments in
improved irrigation service delivery combined with improved farm management practices
would result in improved agricultural intensification and diversification. It quantified the
following benefits: (i) incremental production from 242,300 ha of agricultural lands where
irrigation service delivery was expected to be resumed; (ii) increased crop yields up to 50
percent over a period of 5 to 10 years, both in existing and newly irrigated lands; (iii)
production of vegetables, spices, fruits, and fodder crops on up to 21 percent of agricultural
lands as a result of the improved irrigation service delivery; (iv) increased cropping
intensity by 15 percent; and (v) incremental fish production from 7,145 ha of water spread
area (WSA). The analysis also examined poverty and fiscal impacts of the project by
estimating: (i) new jobs created by intensified irrigated agriculture sector; (ii) numbers of
poor households whose incomes were expected to be raised above the poverty line income
threshold; (iii) incremental revenues generated from marketing of incremental agricultural
production; (iv) incremental water charges collected from the agricultural lands returning
to irrigated agriculture; and (v) incremental water charges resulting from crop
diversification towards vegetables, fruits and spices.
2.      The project benefits were quantified based on crop production models representing
marginal farms (less than one ha), small farms (1-2 ha) and other farms (more than two ha)
and agronomic practices in five river basins. The project returns were estimated for a 25
year period at 2004 prices and assuming opportunity cost of capital at 12 percent. The
financial prices for traded inputs (fertilizer, chemicals) and commodities were converted
into economic prices at import/export parity prices. Non-tradable goods, commodities, and
animal labor were converted using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.90. Agriculture
labor wages were also converted at the SCF of 0.90.
3.      The analysis used the full project cost, inclusive of base (2004) physical and price
contingencies. It also took account of incremental recurrent costs at 0.8 percent of the total
project cost starting from project year six, but without adjustment for future inflation. Input
and output prices were also not adjusted for future inflation.
4.      The economic analysis suggested that the project investments would generate
substantial financial and economic returns. At the farm level, the project expected to yield
incremental financial incomes at Rs. 17,355 per farm household, thereby allowing 73,637
farm households to earn incomes above the poverty line ceiling. The project as a whole
projected to produce a financial rate of return (FRR) at 24.6 percent and financial net
present value (FNPV) at Rs 17.2 billion. The economic rate of return (ERR) and economic
net present value (ENPV) of the project were estimated at 21.6 percent and Rs 11.12 billion,
respectively. Furthermore, the project was expected to generate incremental revenues from
taxes and water charges at Rs. 45 million per annum at the full development of the project
starting from project year 15 onwards.

2.        Methodology of ICRR Economic Analysis
5.      The PAD economic analyses in spreadsheet format were made available to the
ICRR team and were used as the basis for the ICRR analysis. The ICRR economic analysis
re-assessed the economic and financial returns to the project following the methodology of
the PAD economic analysis and by introducing slight modifications to PAD assumptions.
These changes are discussed below:
      i) The findings of the impact assessment studies suggest slight crop yield increases
         for the period between the project appraisal and the start of the project
         interventions. The State statistical data suggest a similar trend. Therefore the
         ICRR economic analysis revised the without project (WOP) crop yields by
         increasing them by 15 percent and keeping the revised yields constant for the entire
         project period.
      ii) As discussed in the relevant sections of the ICRR report actually rehabilitated and
          modernized schemes differ from the schemes proposed at the appraisal. If the
          appraisal proposed schemes were largely minor and did not serve kharif season,
          actually irrigated schemes were of larger sizes and several schemes served some
          parts of command areas also during kharif season both in the WOP and with project
          (WP) scenarios. This change was reflected in the ICRR analysis.
      iii) The PAD analysis estimated the WOP farm incomes reflecting incomes to different
           farm sizes and shares of such farms in command areas (weighted average). The
           WP farm incomes, however, were estimated as an average for all farms (i.e., not a
           weighted average). The ICRR economic analysis followed the ICRR WOP
           approach and measured farm incomes for WP scenario.
      iv) The PAD analysis assumed that improved farm knowledge and incremental
          production of major traditional crops in existing and new irrigated lands would
          motivate farmers to increase areas under vegetables, fruits, spices, and fodder
          crops. In total 21 percent of gross agricultural areas (i.e., 19 percent of kharif and
          10 percent of rabi lands) were projected for crop diversification. Although the
          official statistical data suggest that the production of vegetables and spices in the
          State started to increase since 2004-05, the impact assessment studies23 did not find
          the projected cropping pattern changes were taking place in the project schemes.
          Only the impact study for the Harsi scheme where canal irrigation also supplies
          the kharif crops captured crop diversification in the kharif season. The crop
          diversification in this scheme however was predominantly towards production of
          more paddy. Therefore, the projected diversification benefits were excluded from
          the ICRR analysis.
6.     To allow more accurate estimation of the project impacts on irrigated agriculture
productivity and production and to net out the inflation impact the ICRR analysis used
2004 prices. This method was used assuming that the improved water delivery services
and improved farm management practices did not contribute to significant quality


23
     The design of impact studies, which were conducted soon after a rabi season, were predominantly rabi
     focused as in Madhya Pradesh stored water is predominantly used for rabi cropping.

improvements of agricultural produce which would result in higher output prices. In terms
of the project cost, the ICRR analysis used the actual cost of the project, inclusive of
physical contingencies, but net of price contingencies.
7.     The ICRR analysis used findings of the impact assessment studies for schemes that
represent nearly 75 percent of the project areas.24 It should be noted that to capture results
more accurately the impact assessment studies for the major schemes (Chambal and Harsi)
were carried out twice during the project. Additionally, the latest official agricultural and
poverty data of the State were used in the analysis.

3.        Project Benefits in ICRR analysis
      Impact on Irrigated Areas
8.       At the project appraisal stage the project was expected to rehabilitate and modernize
654 schemes with a gross command area (GCA) of 618,761 ha and a culturable command
area (CCA) 25 of 495,000 ha. Based on the appraisal list of schemes, the PAD analysis
projected that improved water service delivery in the proposed schemes will close the
irrigation gap of 49 percent, thereby resuming water delivery to around 242,276 ha. The
originally proposed schemes were revised during the project implementation following the
government’s decision to rehabilitate minor schemes under the RRR program26. Excluded
minor schemes were replaced mostly with major and medium schemes reducing the overall
number of project schemes from 654 to 228, but increasing the CCA from 495,000 ha to
almost 651,000 ha. The project restored water delivery to 318,960 ha within the CCA.
      Agricultural Production Intensification
9.      The PAD analysis projected different scopes and accumulation phases for yield
increases for crops produced in existing (51 percent) and newly irrigated (49 percent) lands.
In WOP situation, 51 percent of command areas were served by canal water and farmers
either used only canal water or supplemented canal water with pumped groundwater
supplies or relied largely on pumped groundwater supplies in dry years depending on the
location of lands within the scheme. The remaining 49 percent of the command areas
produced only rainfed crops. In the WP, the whole command area was projected to be fully
served by canal water. Farmers in the existing irrigation areas were projected to
accumulate the target yields over a 10 year period (i.e. 10 percent of the target yields in
each year) starting from the second agricultural season after completion of rehabilitation.
Farmers located in areas where canal irrigation water was to be restored were projected to
accumulate the target yields in a shorter 5 year period (i.e. 20 percent of target yields in
each year) starting from the second agricultural season after the rehabilitation completion.
Irrigation operational costs were expected to reduce as a result of moving away from

     See paragraph 44 of the main text for details of the impact studies.
25
     Gross Command Area (GCA) is the plan area lying within the scheme boundaries and includes the
     irrigated land (the Culturable Command Area, CCA), roads, canals, drains, villages, etc. A conversion
     factor of 0.80 is used to convert GCA to CCA.
26
     The RRR program of the Government of India aims at poverty reduction through rehabilitation of minor
     schemes (simple design and rehabilitation works) by employing water users in the rehabilitation of their
     own schemes.

costlier and unreliable (due to electricity shortages) groundwater irrigation. Availability
of reliable supply of canal water and in sufficient volumes was expected to encourage
farmers to invest in better inputs (i.e., seeds and fertilizer) resulting in yield increases at
3.5 t/ha for wheat, 1.6 t/ha for gram, 1.25 t/ha for mustard, and 4.0 t/ha for paddy. Table
A3.1 presents the sample WOP and WP assumptions of PAD analysis for rabi wheat. In
addition to the crop yield increases, the PAD analysis projected increases in cropping
intensity from 133 percent to 153 percent.

10.     The findings of the impact assessment studies suggest that the PAD projections for
the target yields, phases for the yield increases, and cropping intensity increases were on
the conservative side. Wheat yield, for instance, was reported to increase up to 4.8 t/ha in
some schemes, while the PAD projection for the target yield for wheat was only 3.25 t/ha.
Similarly, the PAD projection for gram and mustard yield increases were 1.5 t/ha and 1.5
t/ha, respectively. The actually reported yields were 2.5 t/ha for gram and 2.1 t/ha for
mustard. In terms of yield increase phases, the head and middle section farmers reported
up to 30 percent yield increases already in the second year after completion of rehabilitation
works, which the PAD analysis assumed to occur in the fourth cropping season. Finally,
the studies report cropping intensity in the ranges of 165-180 percent, which is significantly
higher than the PAD projection at 153 percent for the WP scenario. The ICRR analysis
updated the WP target yields using the actually reported yields levels for major crops and
revised the WP cropping intensity using the lower rate. However, it kept the PAD
assumptions for yield increase accumulation phases. The WP yields and cropping intensity
were assumed constant for remaining project years.
    Agricultural Production Diversification
11.    As discussed above, the impact assessment studies did not find the projected
cropping diversification taking place in the surveyed schemes. Only in the Harsi scheme,
where canal water serves parts of the command areas in the kharif season, areas under
paddy were reported to increase significantly. The official statistics, however, suggest


                                                 52
increasing trends for vegetable and spices production in the States since 2004-0527. The
impact assessment studies, which were mainly designed to capture impacts of system
rehabilitation and modernization and as such were conducted during the rabi season, likely
failed to capture crop diversification in the kharif season. As for the rabi season, the
findings suggest that areas under wheat production increased dramatically while areas
under other traditional rabi crops such as mustard and gram increased moderately. Farmers
reasoned this trend with the higher returns to wheat than to other traditional crops. The
studied do not provide explanation for the lack of diversification towards projected non-
traditional crops. One likely reason for this could be that farmers may need stronger
confidence that the improved water delivery in rabi season is not of a short term nature,
while lack of marketing opportunities may play a role as well. Given the lack of supporting
evidences, the ICRR analysis assumed no changes to kharif cropping patterns for the entire
project period. It updated the WP rabi cropping patterns following the findings of the
impact assessment studies and kept these constant for the remaining project years.

4.        Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis
12.     Results of the ICRR analysis are shown in Table A3.2. The project generates an
ERR of 28.9 percent and an ENPV of Rs. 16.7 billion. The PAD economic analysis had
erroneous links to economic prices which resulted in the use of economic prices of different
crops for wheat, maize and paddy, which when corrected resulted in a slightly higher
ENPV for the PAD analysis. Financial results estimated FRR at 24.6 percent and FNPV
at 17.6 percent. The ICRR FNPV, which is similar to the PAD analysis, is explained by
the delays in benefits accumulation and lack of crop diversification. The ICRR analysis
used the PAD adopted opportunity cost at 12 percent to ensure comparability of the PAD
and ICRR results.

13.     The ICRR economic analysis additionally tested the impact of the project
implementation delays on the economic and financial results. If the project had faced no
implementation delays, it would have generated higher financial and economic returns at
FRR of 34.7 percent and FNPV of Rs. 34.5 billion, and ERR of 36.1 percent and ENPV of
Rs. 35.1 billion. This analysis assumes no crop diversification in the ‘with project’ scenario.

5.        Financial income, poverty alleviation and employment impacts
      Income and poverty impacts
14.     The PAD analysis suggested that agricultural intensification and diversification on
existing and newly irrigated areas would result in significant increases in farm incomes and
job creation. Net financial farm incomes were expected to increase from Rs. 6,864 to Rs.
24,219. Incomes of around 73,637 farmers were projected to increase above the per capita
income cut off level poverty line of Rs. 3,732 (March 2002). Incremental agricultural
production was expected to create 122,100 jobs per year, assuming 300 work days per
annum per job.
15.     The ICRR analysis re-estimated the poverty impact of the project using the same
ICRR approach. It updated the household and landholding sizes reflecting latest data for
schemes which were actually rehabilitated and modernized. It should be noted that
according to official statistics household landholding sizes in the States have increased over
time while numbers of poor declined. 28 Moreover, the actually rehabilitated schemes
included more medium and large schemes where landholding sizes are larger than in minor
schemes. Together these factors resulted in the numbers of marginal and small farmers
being less in the rehabilitated schemes than estimated at appraisal. When the 2004 prices
and the same per capita income cut-off level for poverty line were used, the results of ICRR
analysis suggest that the project helped around 63,397 households to go above the poverty
line. The ICRR analysis also suggests that incremental irrigated areas created around
105,000 new jobs. This number is slightly lower than the PAD projected numbers of new
jobs, which is explained by the fact that the PAD projected crop diversification towards
more labor intensive crops, which did not materialize (see Table A3.3 for a summary of
impact data).

      Incremental Revenues
16.     The PAD economic analysis projected that the incremental agricultural production
would generate additional revenues to the State from: (i) incremental mandi29 and sales
taxes at Rs. 29.7 million; (ii) incremental water charges at Rs. 9.7 million from areas where
water delivery is resumed; and (iii) incremental water charges at Rs. 5.3 million resulting
from increased water charge recovery due to the improved institutional functioning in the
project area.
17.     The ICRR re-visited the fiscal analysis, and the estimated results are that: (i)
incremental mandi and sales taxes at around Rs. 38.8 million would be generated starting
from year 12 onwards; (ii) based on the recent upward trend in water revenue collection
(Figure A3.1), incremental water charges at Rs. 129.9 million would be collected from the
existing and newly irrigated areas when the current water collection rate is assumed to
remain constant. The ICRR did not estimate the incremental charges resulting from the
improved institutional functioning as there was insufficient supporting evidence indicating

      Other Project Impacts
18.     The findings of the impact assessment studies suggest that with availability of
reliable canal water supply and in sufficient volumes in existing and new irrigated areas
the consumption of fertilizer and seeds increases significantly. In Chambal scheme, for
instance, fertilizer consumption increased from 44.35 kg per ha to 77 kg per ha. This is a
considerable increase, but still lower than the national average of 144 kg per ha. Similarly,
consumption of seeds for major rabi crops increased by 2.4 times (see Table A3.4 for
details).

agriculture growth has on poverty reduction30, the sector has a substantial multiplier effect

backward and forward linkages to service, trade, and manufacturing sectors were estimated
in different countries in ranges of 1.31 to 4.67 with 1.87 being estimated for Tamil Nadu34.
Studies also suggest that ‘…investments and policy reforms in agriculture might actually
yield faster overall economic growth, even though agriculture itself might grow at a slower
pace than non-agriculture.’ Due to lack of required data, however, the ICRR analysis did
not examine the impact of project investments on other sectors as well as its contribution
to the overall economic growth of the State.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
1.       Opinions of project beneficiaries were taken during impact surveys and in a survey
carried out in 21 schemes in November 2015 of water users’ satisfaction with the level of
irrigation water delivery service. Where satisfaction was assessed in the impact studies it
tended to relate to the level of satisfaction with the physical works. In Chambal, for
example, 10 percent of those surveyed were highly satisfied with the physical works, 60
percent were satisfied, 15 percent moderately satisfied, and 5 percent dissatisfied. In this
case the dissatisfaction related to the lack of field channels.
2.      The results of the survey on the satisfaction with the level of water delivery service
conducted in November 2015 are presented in Table A5.1. The data show that over 91
percent of those surveyed were highly satisfied or satisfied with the level of irrigation water
delivery service. The command area surveyed comprised 15 percent of the total project
command area, and though the number of minor schemes surveyed was the largest, the
total area of these schemes was relatively small compared to the medium and major
schemes.

Government of Madhya Pradesh's comments on the draft ICRR (received by email on
December 24, 2015).


Government of Madhya Pradesh has emphasized not just the expansion of irrigated area
by new water resources development but has committed itself to bridge the gap between
the irrigation potential created and that which is actually utilized. Over the last 6 years in
particular, the Water Resources Department (WRD) has internalized the need to improve
its system and water use efficiencies and has performed in a professional manner in the
area of irrigation service delivery. The actual service delivery in the State of Madhya
Pradesh has increased from around 0.9 million hectares in 2009 and before to more than
2.4 million hectares with nearly the same amount of storage. This increase in irrigated area
is corroborated by the fact that Madhya Pradesh has emerged as a leader in food grain
production among other States of India. It is also now the leading State for soyabean, gram,
pulses and oilseeds and is ranked 2nd in the country for wheat, sorghum and lentils.
Assured water for irrigation has been the most important factor for this turnaround in crop
productivity and productivity of water.
Madhya Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project (MPWSRP) has played a very
important role in rehabilitation of old irrigation systems in 6 of the 10 river basins of the
State. Whereas the project set out to improve irrigation in nearly 0.5 million hectares of
command area which were performing at 40-50% efficiency, the project actually improved
irrigation in more than 0.65 million hectares of command area which have performed at
more than 90% efficiency. Whereas these schemes were irrigating nearly 0.25 million,
these schemes have consistently irrigated nearly 0.6 million hectares for the last 3 years.
The effect of rehabilitation work has particularly improved the performance of Chambal
Canal system where despite receiving smaller amount of releases from the upper riparian
State, Madhya Pradesh has achieved very high water use efficiency so as to be able to
irrigate more than 0.359 million hectares of its command. The Chambal Canal system used
to irrigate only 100 hectares per million cubic meter (MCM) and since the last 3 years it
has irrigated more than 270 hectares with unit MCM of water. Thus, almost doubling in
Water Use Efficiency (WUE) for the system.
Apart from the physical works other project components like the development of an
Enterprise Information Management System (EIMS) hand in hand with trainings in
computer use of WRD staff and procurement of IT hardware have substantially contributed
in bringing about institutional change in the Department. The aforementioned have
provided the WRD management with the necessary tools for effective water governance
and for performance based management.
The satisfactory implementation and completion of the project was possible due to synergy
between the WRD team and the Bank's task team in the second half of the project from
2010 to 2015. Both teams led by Mr. Manish Singh and Mr. Joop Stoutjesdijk respectively
put their heads together in analyzing the implementation stumbling blocks and
appropriately restructuring the project so that its objectives are effectively achieved.


                                             64
Though the draft Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) brings out that
all the indicators were not only met but were surpassed, the overall rating of "Moderately
Satisfactory" does not do justice to the WRD team's effort of turning around a 'problem
project' (as once classified by the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India)
to a success story. It is our view that based on the draft ICRR findings, the rating should
be improved to "Satisfactory".
We look forward to continue the engagement with the World Bank in future through a
follow on project. One of the possibilities is to provide access to potable water with
sanitation and surface water access to agricultural users (around 100,000 hectares) at
various areas in the Narmada basin with micro-irrigation practices. Chinki, Alirajpur Lift
and Jobat Extension and micro-irrigation projects could form a suite of schemes for this
possible intervention. Another possible project could be the extension, rehabilitation and
modernization of Tawa project.
It has been a pleasure to share the Bank's supervision team's experience and knowledge
especially in the latter half of the project and look forward to work together for future
projects.
With best wishes,
