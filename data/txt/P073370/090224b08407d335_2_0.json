Project (MPWSRP) for India were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            project was too ambitious in some aspects, especially\n            related to some of the institutional activities, for a six\n            year implementation period. These included the proposal to\n            establish state water resources agency (SWaRA) and the\n            extent of changes to modernize water resources department\n            (WRD). Several core concepts in MPWSRP were new to WRD, such\n            as separation of water resources and irrigation management\n            functions, volumetric measurement and charging, decision\n            support systems, and holistic river basin management.\n            Institutional change within government agencies is always\n            difficult as the structure, staffing, and financing for\n            these agencies is not controlled by the agency, but by\n            government. Especially during the second half of the project\n            the Bank provided strong professional support and guidance,\n            and the government showed strong commitment to ensuring\n            successful implementation with strong and consistent\n            leadership from senior personnel. The preparation of the\n            river basin plans by WRD staff rather than consultants has\n            resulted in a step-change in the way in which WRD are now\n            engaged in water resources management. The water global\n            practice intends to launch a study to determine\n            opportunities for more effective implementation of\n            irrigation rehabilitation programs. A performance-based\n            management approach has been adopted for operation and\n            maintenance of the irrigation and drainage (I and D)\n            systems, which has potential benefit for other states in India."}, "docdt": "2015-12-27T00:32:05Z"}
