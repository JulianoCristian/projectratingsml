                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Gradual progress is being made with the development of arrangements for improving water resources management in Madhya Pradesh. The detailed proposals to set up a Water
                         Resources Management (WRM) wing within the Water Resources Department (WRD) have been discussed with and agreed by senior government officials and are to be submitted

                         to the Cabinet for consideration. The emphasis on preparing river basin plans will be increased and a carefully selected group of officers will be trained in a practical way in water
                         resources planning, in particular the development and subsequent monitoring of river basin plans. As part of the training, the trainees will prepare detailed river basin plans for the
                         Sindh and Tons Basins. The development of arrangements for adequate training, support, and monitoring of water users associations (WUA) are also ongoing, which involves the
                         Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI), the newly merged Command Area Development/Participatory Irrigation Management (CAD/PIM) cell within WRD, and basin offices

                         of WRD. Out of approximately 260 project schemes, 78 schemes are completed with a total culturable command area (CCA) of almost 120,000 ha (up from 52 schemes at the end of
                         2012). Works are in progress in 71 schemes, while for 52 schemes, including all the major schemes, the tender procedures are ongoing and tendering is starting for the remaining
                         schemes, most of which are minor ones. These numbers show that with two construction seasons remaining before project closure on June 30, 2015 there is still a very challenging
                         task ahead for WRD to complete the works at all schemes as planned. Demonstrations carried out by the Department of Agriculture during the year 2012/13 have shown
                         encouraging results. For example, demonstrations of the system of rice intensification (SRI) have shown yield increases of 150 to 300 percent. Notable other demonstrations are on
                         deep ploughing, field preparation, sowing of field crops by seed-cum-fertilizer drills, sowing by ridge and furrow method, and sowing of Rabi crops after soybean/paddy harvest by
                         Zero Till Drill. These demonstrations intend to show the saving of irrigation water besides increase in the crop yield. It is now important to move from demonstrations to adoption of
                         good practices by as many farmers as possible.
