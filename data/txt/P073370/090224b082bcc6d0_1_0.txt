Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 As expected, project implementation slowed down during the 2014 monsoon season. The last construction season before project closure on June 30,
 2015 is about to start. More than 100 schemes have remaining works to be implemented and contractors and the Water Resources Department are
 getting ready to complete as many of these schemes as possible. The project continues to support Madhya Pradesh's road map for the water sector
 that focuses on better integrated water resources management and technical and institutional support to irrigation scheme water management.
