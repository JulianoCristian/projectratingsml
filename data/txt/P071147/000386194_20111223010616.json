"loan_no": "7107", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Tuberculosis (TB)\n            Control Project for China outcomes were satisfactory; risk\n            to development was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: Strong political commitment\n            is most important factor of a project success. In China TB\n            control project, political commitment of the government was\n            the most important success factor. Until the political\n            commitment reached the threshold level that was necessary to\n            move the project forward there was very little progress\n            made. Full integration of the Project into the National TB\n            Control Program was a key success factor. This is an\n            important lesson to learn from. The project was not a\n            standalone operation with its separate indicators and\n            targets. Importance of local financial contribution for\n            sustainability. The Project successfully learned from the\n            lessons presented by the previous operations key ingredient\n            for sustainability is local financial commitment and\n            participation. Soft investments can achieve more than an\n            investment in hardware. The greatest impact of the China TB\n            Control Project was through the new policies, capacity\n            building and institutional development that were supported\n            by the project. Modern donor architecture requires\n            innovative solutions flexibility and creativity. The world\n            is different from what it was a decade ago. The\n            international donor architecture for health has changed. The\n            World Bank is no longer the biggest and most influential\n            funding agency, nor does it possess the unique technical\n            knowledge. Learning from previous lessons is important. The\n            success of the China TB Control Project is largely\n            attributable to the ability of the Bank and the client to\n            learn from the successes and challenges of the previous\n            operations. Simple design and parsimonious development\n            objectives and result indicators are better that the\n            opposite. Strong coordination and harmonization among donors\n            can augment the effects and such harmonization efforts shall\n            be coordinated by the government."}, "docdt": "2010-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
