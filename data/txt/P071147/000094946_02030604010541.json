The project has three broad components, one at the\n            national level and two at the provincial level. The first\n            component has three subcomponents, which strengthen\n            institutions at the national level, including establishing a\n            central project coordination group; strengthening a central\n            management unit to carry out a national tuberculosis control\n            program; and strengthening a central reference laboratory\n            with required staff and resources.

The\n            second component, also comprises three subcomponents and\n            implements an evidence-based program management and improves\n            management and usage of drugs and equipment; improves case\n            detection and improves the cure rate; as well as\n            implementing program-oriented research activities,\n            developing and implementing an action plan for information\n            dissemination and education, developing and implementing\n            plans to deliver treatments to hard-to-reach populations,\n            and piloting treatment programs.
