Major components\n            include: (i) construction of 26 km of pipeline, pump\n            stations, treatment works and miscellaneous facilities; (ii)\n            pumping and treatment plant, vehicles, tools, stores, and\n            miscellaneous equipment; and (iii) consulting engineering\n            services to supervise the Francistown improvements and\n            investigate the feasibility of raising the Gaborone Dam. The\n            Project would meet Francistown's water requirements\n            until 1988/89, and would raise water quality to\n            international standards. The Project faces no technical\n            risks, but WUC would have to raise tariffs substantially\n            from existing levels to recover project costs."}, "docdt": "1979-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
