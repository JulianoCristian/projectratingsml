"The proposed project would provide\n            technical assistance to the Government for (i) the carrying\n            out of studies to assess and meet urban, industrial and\n            agricultural water requirements in Greater Algiers and in\n            the surrounding regions within one hundred miles from\n            Algiers; (ii) the design of a new source of water for the\n            Greater Algiers metropolitan area; and, (iii) the\n            preparation of a master plan for the distribution of potable\n            water for the Greater Algiers metropolitan area. The project\n            would require about 680 man-months of consulting services at\n            an average man-month cost of $7,500, including international\n            travel and project would also assist in further\n            strengthening the technical capabilities of the Ministry of\n            Hydraulics. The project presents no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
