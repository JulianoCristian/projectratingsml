Project for\n            Serbia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. A key lesson from other transition experiences\n            and from the first four years of transition in Serbia was\n            the need for sequencing: (i) the initial steps should be the\n            immediate goals of price liberalization and fiscal\n            stability; (ii) followed by structural reforms in industrial\n            enterprises and banks and, (iii) only then, in the third\n            stage, pursue reforms in utilities, non banking institutions\n            and capital markets. Moreover, due to the political economy\n            of post conflict Serbia, it was important to start\n            enterprise privatization with sellable companies or early\n            wins and only later move onto restructuring of the\n            politically sensitive large loss makers. The focus of the\n            three stage sequencing needed to include lessons on the\n            timing and design of social policies aimed at directly\n            addressing poverty reduction and mitigating some of the\n            adverse social impacts potentially caused by the three\n            transition stages. Continued pursuit of these aims will need\n            to be closely aligned and sequenced with Government of\n            Serbia (GoS) efforts to provide adequate social protection\n            for those displaced by the envisaged restructurings and or\n            privatizations. Another factor was the coupling of social\n            protection with major restructuring efforts. The priority\n            given to mitigating the social costs of enterprise\n            restructuring, and the publicity and benefits surrounding\n            these efforts, are considered to be one of the reasons why\n            social turmoil did not erupt. Concrete efforts to provide\n            unemployment and severance payments and pre-layoff services\n            appear to have had a positive impact."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
