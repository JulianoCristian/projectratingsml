three years of the Government's five-year investment\n            program (FY 86-90) which is a part of a longer term strategy\n            to achieve Universal Primary Education (UPE) by the year\n            2000.  The main objectives of the project would be to:  (a)\n            increase enrollments; (b) improve the quality of\n            instruction; and (c) reduce costs.  The project would\n            accomplish increased enrollment by improving and expanding\n            primary school facilities and introducing more liberal\n            promotion.  Instruction would be improved by reforming the\n            primary teacher training program, improving curriculum and\n            increasing the supply of instructional materials and\n            textbooks. Finally, costs would be reduced by expanding the\n            low-cost experimental instructional program (Project\n            IMPACT), increasing teacher utilization patterns, utilizing\n            lower cost school construction designs and techniques, and\n            introducing selective cost recovery mechanisms in the\n            textbook program.  The project would also improve the\n            management and administration of the primary school system\n            by the strengthening of key institutions, staff training and\n            the development of management information and project\n            support communications systems."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
