SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1574-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Primary
Education Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 1574-BD in the amount of SDR
80.1 million (US$78.0 million equivalent) was approved on March 28, 185. The
Credit was closed on December 31, 1990, six months behind schedule. The
Credit was fully disbursed on March 19, 1991. Due to exchange rate
fluctuations, the total amount disbursed was US$94.7 million equivalent, which
was more than the original credit amount.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Asia Country Department I, Asia Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's final supervision
mission of the project during February 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Development Credit Agreement (DCA),
supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower and
discussions with management and staff of the participating institutions.

SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1574-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
(i)       Proiect Obiectives:  The three main objectives of the project were:
(a) to increase enrollments through (1) improving and expanding primary
school facilities; and (ii) the introduction of more liberal
promotion policies;
(b) to improve the quality of instruction through (i) the reform of the
primary teacher training program; (ii) curriculum improvements
including the student assessment system; and (iii) increased supply
of instructional materials and textbooks; and
(c) to reduce costs through (i) expanding the low-cost experimental
instructional program - Project IMPACT; (ii) change teacher
utilization patterns to include multi-grade/multi-subject teaching;
(iii) utilizing lower cost sichool construction designs and
techniques; and (iv) introducing selective cost recovery mechanisms
in the school textbook program. The project was also designed to
improve the management and the administration of the primary school
system through the strengthening of institutions, training of staff,
and development of management information and project support
communications system.
(ii)      Implementation Experience:  The project was efficiently implemented.
Physical targets were achieved (Part III, Statistical Information), and
disbursements exceeded estimates (Table 3).
(iii)     Results:  The project was instrumental in assisting the Government
of Bangladesh (GOB) reverse a 20-year pattern of stagnant enrollment
percentages in primary education, increasing the gross enrollment ratio of
primary school students to the primary school age population of Bangladesh
from approximately 55% in 1985 to 63Z in 1990. A new curricuium, textbooks
and other instructional materials were introduced in the first two grades.
Teacher training and support was organized around a cluster system and
institutionalized throughout the country. Modest savings in the cost of
producing a graduate from primary school were realized thanks to improved
retention rates and reduced number of drop-outs. A follow-on project (the
General Education Project, Credit 2118-BD) is continuing and expanding the
efforts to improve the quality of the system.
(iv)      Sustainabilitv:  The project was designed to be part of a series of



- iv -
successive interventions supporting the primary subsector. The project
established significant gains in access and in institutionalizing methods to
improve quality. Budgetary support for the sector is increasing. These gains
are being sustained and expanded in the follow-on proiact.
(v)       Lessor-s Learned:  The main lesson learned from this project is that
projects that seek to change behavior require significant investment of staff
time in preparation and in supervision. This project was unable to implement
significant changes in the deployment of teachers (Project IMPACT), introduce
cost savings in textbooks, and provide an integrated delivery system for
educational serviceo (paras. 10 and 12(c)). The failure to implement these
changes did not reduce the overall effectiveness of the project but the
desired changes were important, and the loss significant. The difficulties
might have been overcome if more time had been devoted to preparing interest
groups for the changes during preparation; and progress tracked more carefully
during supervision (para. 15). The most important strategy learned from this
project is that well-tested interventions that are proven within the country
have a high degree oi likelihood of being adopted.

B. Project Background
1.        The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has struggled since Independence
(1971) to meet the basic educational needs of the nation against handicaps of
great poverty and high population growth. It was not until 1980 that
significant investments were able to be made ir the primary education sub-
sector, shifting from 13Z of the total education development budget in the
First Plan Period (1973-80) to 46Z in the Second Plan Period (1980-85). IDA
supported this priority with its fourth education project (Primary), Credit
1054-BD. This project, although covering the five-year plan period, was
limited in scope and experimental in nature, designed to identify
interventions to improve che quality and access to primary education. By the
mid-1980s the Government was convinced that its goal of Universal Primary
Education (UPE) could not be met until access was improved, and the internal
efficiency of the primary school Aelivery system increased. It was decided to
embark upon a system-wide improvement of the program and to encourage
increased external financing. The Third Five-Year Plan (1985-90) reflected
this conviction, and for the second plan period in a row there was a continued
high share of GOB investment of education development funds in the subsector
(48Z). In llght of this commitment, and because of encouraging results from
the first primary education project (reduced drop-out and increased retention
in project districts), IDA decided to provide further subsectoral assistance
through the Second Primary Education Project.
2.        Despite the encouraging results of the geographically limited
experiments of the first primary education project in the early 1980s, GOB had
made little or no country-wide progress in increasing the proportion of its
primary school age children enrolled in the system. The quality of the system
remained low, with only 301 of the schools in acceptable physical condition.
Teacher morale was low, and their training and administrative support



-2-
inadequate. The curriculum was outdated, textbooks and teachers manu&ls were
of poor quality and generally unavailable or limited in supply. The
management of the system was hampered by inappropriate organizational
structures, and staffed by undertrained professionals.
C. Project Objectives and Descriptions
3.        Project assistance was focussed on interventions which had in the
prior project showed promise of increasing attendance and improving quality.
It was understood that this project would not provide a final solution to the
systemic inadequacies of the subsector, but would be one in a series of long-
term project support. 1/ Consequently, project objectives were relatively
modest, and the project period seen as one during which the basic building
blocks of a more efficient and effective system would be institutionalized.
.4.       Pruject Oblectives.  The three objectives of the project were:
(a)  to increase enrollments t1-rough (i) irproving and expanding primary
school facilities; and (ii) the introduction 'f more liberal
promotion policies;
(b) to improve the quality of instruction through (i) the reform of the
primary teacher training program; (ii) curriculum improvements
including the student dssessment system; and o_ i) increased supply
of instructional materials and textbooks; and
(c)  to reduce costs tirough (i) expanding the low-cost experimental
instructional program - Project Instructional Management by
Parents, Community and Teachers (IMPACT); (ii) improved teacher
utilization patterns (multi-grade/multi-subject teaching); (iii)
utilizing lower cost school construction designs and techniques;
and (iv) introducing selective cost recovery mechanisus in the
school textbook program. The project was also designed to improve
the management and the administration of the primary school system
through the strengthening of institutions, training of staff, and
development of management information and project support
communications system.
5.        Project Components:  The project provided for:
(a) physical development, included repair and additions to existing
schools, as well as new school construction;
(b) teacher training, with gradual integration of pre-service and in-
service teacher training to be instituted with training provided to
teachers, and teacher trainers;
(c)  curriculum development through the enhancement of the capacity of
1/ Para. 4, "Agreed Minutes of Negotiations".

the curriculum wing of the National Curriculum and Textbook Bord
(NCTB) to provide an updated school curriculum, with reduced
content overload and more relevance to students lives. Student
assessment procedures were designed to be improved;
(d) instructional materials, the quality and supply of teachers'
editions of textbooks, teaching aids and basic educational
materials, and textbooks were to be improved; and
(e) management/administratlin improvement, through strengthen of the
Directorate of Primarv Educat'on (DPE), improving the flow of
management information and developing a project support
communication system.
D. Project Design and Organization
6.         The project design was based upon a clear conceptual framework.  It
was agreed by GOB, the Donors and IDA that Bangladesh could n,t achieve its
economic and social goals unless the educational foundations of the country
were well designed and in place. Therefore the priority of the GOB and donor
investment in primary education was continued and quality enhancement as well
as increased access became essential parts of the development strategy for the
sector. The concept was innovative in the sense that it was on the cutting
edge of World Bank practice at the time. Some act'vities designed to
implement the project were innovative: (a) the cluster system of teacher
training and support; (b) Project IMPACT (an experimental multi-grade
cou!nunity-supported, low cost primary school program); and (c) Integra~.ed
School Development (a phased program of upazila development with all project
inputs concentrated in one upazila at a time).
7.        The scope and timing of the project were both appropriate.  The
preceding project had been experimental and limited in scope. This project
expanded the geographic scope to the entire country. Some problems were found
in managing a project that encompassed almost 60 operational and traini.ng
centers, 461 local authorities, and 64 districts. Despite these problems, it
was an appropriate decision to expand the scope to the entire country and thus
allow expansion of practices that were proven in the first project. The
timing was right, in that the project supported a time slice of GOB's sub-
sectoral program for its Five-Year Plan Period. The size oc the financing
also was appropriate to the absorptive capacity of the country. Despite
serior1 economic and physical difficulties in the country between 1985 and
1990  n  1987 and again in 1988 floods ravaged the country), the Finance
Ministry met its ccunterpart financing obligations in every fiscal year (even
though other sectors were cut back) with the single exception of the fourth
quarter of the last fiscal year. As a result IDA extended the project to
allow financial and physical targets to be met. The planned disbursement for
the project was US$78.0 million and the actual disbursement was US$94.7
million (due to exchange differences), and physical targets were met.
8.         The roles and the responsibilities of the institutions selected for
the implementation of the project were clearly delineated in pro;ect



-4-
documents, and well undarstood by all parties.  No unexpected difficul4ies
were encountered iwhen an institution was identified which had the autbority
and the financing to carry out its role. 2/ Where there were difficulties,
they almost invariably were in the inter-inscitutional activities. The
planned coordination mechanisms were modified several times during the life of
the project. By the conclusion of the project these mechanisms were
functioning fairly well, bu' by no means optimally.
9.        In retrospect, the project design was appropriate to the
conditions.  Proje_, organization was, for the most part, appropriate.
However, it is evident that a more effective coordinating mechanism
for project management would have improved the achievement of the mure complex
quality enhancement activities, suwh as the Teacher Training Program.
E.  Project Implementation
10.       The most critical variance between planned and actual project
implementation was the overly optimistic expectation of repid
institutionalization of cost reduction activitiest Project IMP'CT, the
Integrated School Development Program (ISDP), more efficient tea'.:her
utilization patterns, lower cost school construction designs, and selective
cost recovery in the textbook program. Each activity involved changes in the
rew3rd structures for teachers, local officials or small printing
establishments. These changes are being institutionalized at the present time
(with the exception of ISDP and Project IMPACT), but far more slowly and with
greater difficulty than project deGigners anticipated. The risk of slow
institutional and behavioral change was correctly identified in the SAR;
however, the SAR did not identify the areas where the most critical variance
between the expected and actual outcomes did in fact occur.
F. Project Results
11.       The most significant result of the project is that it provided the
necessary assistance to enab..e the Government to halt the stagnation and
decline of the primary subsector. For the first timc in over 30 years an
improvement in school retention and reduction of drop-out became apparent.
The importance of this result should not be underestimated. Because there
were signs that the system was improving, in large part because of the
interventions supported by the project, the Government, working closely with
IDA, was able to assemble cofinanced support for a follow-on project in excess
of US$100 million. Where the institutional strengthening provided by the
pro >ct was successful, there is a new and encouraging professionalism and
con,..rn to achieve even greater objectives. More broadly, GOB has
strengthened its commitment to basic education and for FY93 will invest the

Educational Administration, Extension and Research (NIEAER), was unable to
fulfill its assigned role, and training was shifted to another center
early in the project implementation cycle.



-5-
highest percentage of its resources in its history to the education sector.
12.       The three project objectives were achieved:
(a)  Enrollments were increased:  The SAR (Annex 7) predicted an
'ncrease in enrollment from 8.8 million in 1985 to 10.3 million in
1990. Actual enrollment in 1990 slightly exceeded 10.4 million.
The Gross Enrollment Ratio improved during this perio:' from
approximately 55Z of the primary school age cohort to 63Z. This
objective was to be achieved through two meanAs,
(i) by improving and expanding primary school facilities ( 5,285 of
5,349 schools were improved; 3,298 of 3,300 rural schools were
repaired, and the supply of new and replacement furniture met
982 of its target); and
(ii) through Lhe introduction of a more liberal promotion policy
(this policy was enacted for the first two grades. It has been
effective, but could have been better institutionalized if
teachers had better preparation through training for its
implementation).
(b) Instru-tional quality was improved:
(i) by the reform of the teacher training system: the cluster
system supported by Assistant Upazila Education Officers
(AUEOs) was institutionalized throughout the whole country;
however, the full reforms in pre-service and in-service
training will not be realized until the follow-on project
invests significantly higher resources in the training of
teachers;
(ii)  through curriculum improvements including the student
assessment system: although it took longer than expected to
train the staff and to begin the curriculum design process, a
complete curriculum refo.m, including continuous pupil
assessment was introduced to Classes I and II and is being
completed for the remaining classes under the follow-on
project;
(iii) instructional materials and textbooks were increased: free
textbooks were erficiently distributed to all primary school
pupils. A full ppckage of new instructional materials:
textbooks, teacher'_ guides have been developed for Classes I
and II. Syllabi, guidelines and illustrative sample lessons
have been developed for Classes III-V; and
(c) Costs were reduced, however not in the manner highlighted in the
SAR. The increased efficiency of the primary school system with
its lower drop-out and higher retention rates appears to have
reduced the cost of graduating a student from the primary school



-6-
system. An exact calculation of the magnitude of the reduction
cannot be made due to the poor statistical base at the beginning of
the project. The cause of this greater internal efficiency seems
to be related to improving quality in the school instruction and
facilities; however, no valid correlations have been made. The
project wa. dssigned to additionally reduce costs through:
(i)  expanding the low-cost experimental instructional program -
Project IMPACT: IMPACT did not reduce costs because parents
and teachers objected to the higher teacher-pupil ratios
planned for the program. When it became apparent this problem
could not oe solved the experiment was discontinued;
(ii) increasing teacher utilization patterns through multi-
gradelmulti-subject teaching: the success of this activity
dependedj upon the adoption of a successful IMPACT program;
(iii) utilizing lower cost school construction designs and
techniques: no serious low cost school design modifications
were explored; and
(iv) introducing selective cost recovery mechanisms in the school
textbook program: the study designed to support these changes
was commissioned late in the project period, and was of such
poor quality it could not be used. The project was also
designed to improve the management and the administration of
the primary school system through the strengthening of
institutions, training of staff, and development of management
information and Project support communications system:
Management structures were rationalized, but management
problems still plague DPE. Real improvements were found 'n
NCTB. The Management Information System was well designea and
almost fully institutionalized by the end of the project. It
is serving as the model for an MIS system for the entire sector
financed under the follow-on project. Project support
communications were found to be effective, although much needs
to be done at the field level to involve communities in the
schools.
G. Project Sustainability
13.       The project was designed to be the first of a series of country-
wide projects supporting GOB's primary subsectoral program. The project began
the institutionalization of the reforms necessary in primary education in
teacher training, textbooks, curriculum and school facilities. Sufficient
progress was made to encourage seven donors to join IDA and the Government in
a follow-on project three times the size of this project. There is little
doubt that the project advances w.11 be enhanced and sustained.  Teacher
training is being continued and financing for the component increased (by
426Z) under the follow-on project. Likewise curriculum reform will assure
that all five grades receive a new and much higher quality curriculum



-7-
supported by revised instructional materials. Some of the cost-saving
measures that were raised but not adopted in the project are being addressed
in the follow-on project: New school buildings will be of a design costing
40? less than those constructed under the project, textbook costs will be
reduced, and better management practices instituted. Adequate budgetary
support for the subsector seems assured. Primary education remains a high
priority of the Government, compulsory primary education is being introduced
throughout the country, and adequate counterpart financing for the follow-on
project is being provided.
H. IDA's Performance
14.       IDA's performance was satisfactory.  The project preparation was
timely and thorough. The areas in which the project did not perform as
appraised were in the untested innovations such as Project IMPACT, the attempt
to organize project development serially by upazilas (the Integrated Schools
Development Program) and in areas affecting benefits (perceived or real)
affecting local teachers, local officials and small businesses.
15.       IDA supervision of the project could have been imprcved.  Although
there were nine supervision missions during the 5.4 years of the project,
there were a number of problems with the quality of the superviLion, in large
part due to unanticipated effects of IDA's own reorganizatior.. There were
three different task managers during the life of the project and not enough
technical specialists were provided for the thorough supervis4on needed by
this complex project.
I. Borrower's Performance
16.       The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.  The
project was prepared by GOB with assistance from UNESCO and UNDP. During the
appraisal, GOB made its staff available to work alongside the Bank mission
members.
17.       Although the project effectiveness was delayed due to
misunderstandings during appraisal regarding the status of the Facilities
Department (FD), the issue was resolved to the satisfaction of both IDA and
GOB upon the establishment of the FD as a permanent unit in the Ministry of
Education. Implementation was affected by frequent change in the directorship
of the FD, which saw three Directors over the five-year project period.
Coordination was not always optimal between the DPE, which, with the UEO, was
responsible for selecting the schools for the annual construction program, and
the FD which was responsible for contract award and supervision of works. As
a result, several schools were built in areas where adequate facilities
already existed or where minimal rehabilitation would have been adequate.
18.       Implementation was also affected by the delay in filling many
vacant positions under the project. Most of the 300 AUEOs were appointed but
only after some delay. Many vacant positions for teachers, and UEOs slowed
project implementation.



-8-
19.       Despite difficulties in recruitment of staff and in coordinating
the many agencies involved in implementation, the variotrs consultants, the
hundreds of contractors and the 460 Upazila Parishads, the project retained
its coherence and succeeded in meeting its quantitative and part of the
qualitative targets.
J. Project RelationshiP
20.       Except for the initial misunderstanding between IDA and GOB
regarding the status of the FD, which delayed project effectiveness, overall
IDA/GOB relationship throughout the project remained satisfactory. As a
result of this amicable working relationship and between the various
participating donor agencies, many problems encountered during implementation
were resolved without much delay.
K. Consulting Services
21.       Four local and three expatriate consultants provided assistance in
project implementation. The overall opinion placed the performance of the
various consultants as satisfactory. The curriculum consultant made a
valuable contribution toward curriculum development including some transfer of
knowledge and skills to Government counterparts. The training consultant
played a major role in improving the planning and management of various
training programs and preparation of training materials. The management
consultant provided assistance in the development of a computerized MIS in
DPE. Some studies carried out by local consultants, however, were not very
satisfactory and had to be revised several times before finalization. The
performance of the building contractors and furniture suppliers, although
later improved, was not fully satisfactory during the first three years of the
project.
L. Project Documentation and Data
22.       The Development Credit Agreement which guided implementation of the
project was quite adequate and appropriate for achieving project objectives in
the key organizational and financial areas. The appraisal report, which was
prepared by IDA after extensive discussions with GOB and other implementing
agencies provided a useful framework for IDA and GOB to monitor project
implementation progress. Despite this, however, the project suffered some
major design flaws especially with respect to the involvement of community and
local bodies.
23.       The PCR was prepared from assorted data collected from Project
Proformas of the Government, the SAR and DCA, IDA's supervision reports, and
through interviews with Government staff connected with the implementation of
the project.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER PERSPECTIVE
A. Evaluation of IDA's Performance and Lessons Learned
24.       The IDA's performance during the evolution and implementation of
the project was cooperative and satisfactory. Its attitude was flexible
without affecting the objectives of the project.
25.       The IDA sent appraisal missions to study the status of the UPE
program, to identify problems, and also to assist finding out corrective
measures for the same.
26.       IDA also sent supervision missions several times to review the
project activities. Each mission attempted to appreciate the problems and
issues of the project and suggested solutions. They also regularly reviewed
the progress of works, tried to appreciate the problems, responded to
communications, az:d provided approvals as and when necessary.
27.       The IDA's interest in financing the project was also found
satisfactory. In the field of reimbursement, the bank played an encouraging
role in ensuring a quick settlement of claims; moreover, it agreed to raise
the ceiling of the SAFE Account to facilitate implementation.
28.       With respect to lessons learned that may be of help for future
project operations, it may be pointed out that the percentage of IDA
contribution towards expenditure for the civil works component should have
been enhanced from the present 85? to 90X. This may help overcome the problem
of GOB financing constraints.
B. Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
29.       The project was launched mainly to achieve the goal of
universalization of primary education. The main objectives of the project
were to: (i) increase primary school enrolment; (ii) reduce dropout ratios;
and (iii) improve the internal efficiency of the primary school system.
30.       From the results so far achieved, it can be concluded that the
project successfully achieved its objectives and targets to a large measure.
Action was initiated for improving the quality of education which is a much
longer term objective.
31.       In the civil works component optimum standard could not be
achieved; the supply and quality of furniture delivered to the schools was
according to the desired level.
32.       The draft P.P. was prepared and processed for approval by the PEC
and ECNEC. The Borrower met all the conditions of credit effectiveness. The
credit became effective on 31 December 1985, though retrospective effect was
granted from original date of commencement of the project.



- 10 -
33.       The Borrower deployed project staff and required manpower for the
successful implementation of the program. However, the project
administration, management, supervision and monitoring activities were
satisfactory. The above functions were performed by three divisions of the
DPE viz: (i) Planning and Development; (ii) Administration and (iii) the
Training headed by Director General of Primary Education who was the Project
Director.
C. Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Relationship Between IDA and
the Borrower
34.       The satisfactory achievement of the objectives and targets of the
project is a clear testimony to the effectiveness of the sound relationship
between IDA and the Borrower. In spite of effective and cooperative
reciprocal relationship between IDA and the Borrower, some inconveniences were
incurred due to the system of recovery of the advance at the end of the
project. The system should be more gradual, even extending after the
completion date of the project period.
D. Evaluation of the Performance of Co-Financiers
35.       UNDP, UNICEF and SIDA were the main co-financiers of the project.
UNICEF participated in the training and curriculum development programs.
Moreover, they also financed the textbook papers.  SIDA participated in the
project as a parallel financier with IDA. The UNDP fund was mainly available
for the technical assistance program. Their performance was also
satisfactory. The Borrower had a supportive and cooperative relationship with
the co-financiers.

PART III, STATISTICAL INFORMATION
Physical Achievements
School
Construction:  The construction of 5,285 schools comprised of 16,909
classrooms, out of the revised PP provision of 5,349 schools
and 17,145 classrooms was completed by December 31, 1990, the
Project closing date. Out of the total number of schools
constructed during the project period 4,758 were rural, 349
town, and 178 city schools.
Repair:         3,298 out of 3,300 rural schools were repaired from 1985 to
1988.
Furniture:      73,217 pairs of high-lower benches and 6,218 pairs of chair-
tables were supplied in 1985-86 and 1986-87. Supp' y of
furniture resumed in 1989-90 and by the project completion
date (i.e. December 30,1990) 73,217 wooden high-low benches,
174,872 steel ones and 20,841 pairs of chair-tables. The
Project thus achieved 982 of the revised PP t&eget for this
component.

Note:  1.  In 1988-89 GOB distributed more books than it produced.  This was
possible due to a surplus stock of books from the previous years.
2.  In 1990-91 due to GOB policy to decrease the number of freely
distributed pre-primary books from 25 to 15 per class, the
production and distribution of pre-primary books decreased.
