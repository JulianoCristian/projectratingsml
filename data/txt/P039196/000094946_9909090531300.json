State Reform Loan\n            Project's outcome was rated as satisfactory. Some of\n            the key lessons include: 1) Sub-national governments are key\n            elements within the framework of a country's overall\n            reform program. 2) Potential windows of opportunity for\n            reform should be capitalized. 3) For the reforms to be\n            sustainable, a consistent system of incentives has to be in\n            place at the national level. 4) An adequate regulatory\n            framework at the federal level is a pre-requisite for the\n            successful implementation of state-level privatization and\n            concession programs. 5) Focus on those sub-national\n            governments that are most willing and able to implement\n            major reforms. 6) Operations should concentrate on a few,\n            significant reforms that are hard to reverse. 7)\n            Quick-disbursing loans supporting a well-defined set of\n            reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural\n            adjustment at the sub-national level. 8) Reform loans should\n            support the state's own reform program, thus maximizing\n            the state's ownership of the project. 9) Despite the\n            irreversibility of privatization reforms, the project raises\n            the question on whether greater consensus can be achieved\n            with respect to these reforms. 10) The Bank should require\n            the actual sale of public enterprises as a condition for\n            disbursement. 11) Governments should be encouraged to ensure\n            that the composition of the regulatory agencies is\n            politically balanced."}, "docdt": "1999-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
