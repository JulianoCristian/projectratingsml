Sul (RGS) State Reform Loan Project was developed\n            in a prior sector study that presented options to address\n            the state's debt crises. The objective of the State\n            Reform Project is to improve efficiency in the\n            government's service delivery through privatization and\n            to improve the state's fiscal condition. The project is\n            tailored to support successful implementation of RGS's\n            more limited privatization and fiscal reforms. Its\n            components comprise technical assistance, restructuring of\n            public enterprises that adopt voluntary departure programs,\n            and subprojects and programs to mitigate the reform\n            program's costs, including priority investments and\n            social assistance projects. Selected reforms include actions\n            to privatize the Rio Grande do Sul telecommunications\n            company and the state power company, and to award\n            concessions of water and sewage services, port services, and\n            road maintenance. The environmental targets set for the new\n            utilities will be a critical factor determining both the\n            economic feasibility and the environmental consequences of\n            restructuring; thus, a consistent set of targets and\n            obligations for the restructured utilities will have to be\n            developed early in the process. Other components include\n            reform-related studies, audits, and training; reform-related\n            equipment and rehabilitation works; high priority\n            investments in land management and rural poverty\n            alleviation; highway, school, and hospital rehabilitation;\n            severance pay to employees of reforming state enterprises;\n            and transfers and non-transfers to municipalities and\n            private institutions (to cushion the reform's impact)\n            for incremental, recurrent expenditures in early childhood,\n            public health, sanitation, and basic education."}, "docdt": "1997-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
