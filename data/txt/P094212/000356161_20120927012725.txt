                      P094212 AND P093545
                      LOAN 74560/TF090454

                                  Restructuring Paper



1.     The closing date for Serbia, Transitional Agriculture Reform Project, Loan 74560
(P094212) and TF090454 (P093545) will be extended by 8 months from September 30,
2012 until May 31, 2013.

2.      Although the Project has achieved key milestones towards achieving the project
development and global environmental objectives—and these objectives continue to be
achievable—implementation of current outstanding commitments cannot be completed
without a closing date extension. Current disbursements amount to 75 percent of the loan
and 71 percent grant funds, with an additional 13 percent of the loan and 24 percent of
the grant committed. In July 2012, the Government changed, causing implementation
delays due to the absence of a signatory to authorize payments. A signatory is expected
to be authorized shortly. The Project is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory for both
progress towards achieving project development and global environmental objectives and
implementation progress.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow road and bridge rehabilitation works
in four pilot villages in the Old Mountain (Stara Planina) area to be completed under
Component 3. Contracts for these works were signed in July 2012, but have not
commenced given the absence of a signatory to authorize advanced payment under the
contract. In addition, the proposed extension would also allow the newly-reorganized
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management to procure short-term
consulting services to support the National Paying Agency undergo the EU accreditation
process and access EU pre-accession agriculture funds.

4.     An action plan has been discussed and agreed with the Bank to bring current
commitments to successful closure. Financial management performance is satisfactory,
with no overdue audits.

5.    This will be the third extension of the project, for a cumulative extension of 17
months from the original closing date of December 30, 2011.
