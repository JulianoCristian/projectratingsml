                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on improved implementation performance observed during the mission of November 2011, the project underwent a restructuring that extended the closing by 5.5 months and
                         canceled project funding for activities that could not reasonably be completed within the new project closing date. A number of commitments pending at the time of the last mission
                         were met and several new ones have been undertaken with the most important one being the signing of sub-grant agreements for the Global Environmental Fund (GEF) Rural
                         Development Grants in Stara Planina Region. Critical activities completed include contracting the delivery of IT equipment and vehicles for the Paying Agency, Extension Service and
                         Agriculture Inspection; and re-staffing of the Managing Authority for Rural Development as well as delivery of training to PA staff and the substantial completion with occupancy
                         certification of the visitors center in Stara Plannina. However, a number of contracts for smaller, but crucial, infrastructure works, training activities and grants remain incomplete, and
                         the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade, Forestry and Water Management (MATFWM) has requested that the project be extended another 3 months past its current closing date.
