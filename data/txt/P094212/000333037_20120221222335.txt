                                             Restructuring Paper

A.      Summary

1.      This restructuring paper seeks approval for the partial cancellation of EURO 2,337,678.

B.      Project Status

2.     The Serbia Transitional Agriculture Reform Project is currently scheduled to close on June 15, 2012
and 49% of the Loan has been disbursed.

3.       The project is currently rated moderately unsatisfactory for Progress towards achievement of the
Project Development Objective (PDO) and moderately satisfactory for Overall Implementation Progress.
However, in view of recent demonstrated implementation progress, an upgrade of these indicators is
expected to be conducted following the next Implementation Support Mission (tentatively April 2012). This
is a noteworthy development since, in the first three years following approval, the project had suffered severe
delays, including a 16-month effectiveness delay, and disbursed only 6 percent of the Loan. Following a
mixed implementation history between mid-2010 and mid-2011, project performance has meanwhile vastly
improved, with all actions met in an action plan agreed with the Bank, and having laid the foundation for the
December 2011 extension of the Project Closing Date to June 15, 2012.

4.       No changes to the project development objective, environmental assessment (EA) category, or the
results monitoring framework are proposed. Financial Management Reports issued to date have been
satisfactory to the Bank and there are no outstanding audits.\

C.      Proposed Changes

        (i)       A Loan amount of EURO 1,837,678 will be cancelled from Category (1) and EURO
                  500,000 will be cancelled from Category (2) as of February 6, 2012. In addition, the
                  commitment charges on EURO 2,337,678 cease to accrue from February 6, 2012.
                  This amount is equivalent to the estimated amount of funds that will remain unused by the
                  Closing Date.

        (ii)      The revised Table is set forth below.
