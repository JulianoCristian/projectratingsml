1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country context -Serbia’s political and economic isolation immediately following the
Balkan wars of the 1990s and the complete dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1999 had left it
unprepared to respond to the rapid changes in the region. Rregional trade opportunities
were expanding rapidly, driven by economic recovery in the post accession countries, a
proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements, negotiation of the European Union (EU)
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) and plans for accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO). In order to capitalize on these trade opportunities, in late
2000 the Government of Serbia (GoS) launched an ambitious reform program to improve
the business environment and create a vibrant private sector.

The changes were driven by a progressive new team in government that saw its
opportunity in quickly progressing along the EU accession path to benefit from the
block’s trade and economic opportunities. However, opening up the economy meant
that market forces were applying growing pressure on the agri-food sector to improve
productivity and quality and a new emphasis on environmental sustainability.

The reform program over time lost much of its popular support raising significant
opposition and political resistance. The government in charge had been in power for
some 6 years at project appraisal and was facing a growing mobilization of the
fragmented opposition. Over the years these competing perspectives would translate
themselves into a continuous battle between reformers and conservatives across parties
with frequent and disruptive government changes and reshuffles that would affect this
project throughout its implementation.

Agriculture and rural development - Serbia has large areas of agricultural land with high
quality soils, a strategic trading location, and an educated workforce. Primary agricultural
production and agro-processing was estimated to be 15 percent of GDP and 20 percent of
exports in 2005. At project preparation, some 0.8 million ha, or 15 percent of the arable
land was operated by about 1050 large corporate farms and agrokombinats 1. Privately
owned commercial farms averaged around 10 ha and accounted for 46 percent of arable
land. The remaining 39 percent comprised an estimated 600,000 small private farms,
most under five ha and often consisting of several fragmented parcels of land producing
primarily for their own use consumption, and depend heavily on non-farm income.

There were and remain important regional variations in production systems and products.
The low-lying and fertile Vojvodina region is dominated by large farms and partially


1
 Agrokombinats - were large socially owned vertically integrated agricultural enterprises that dominated
agricultural production in Yugoslavia.




                                                    1
privatized Agrokombinats producing field and industrial crops and pigs, cattle and
poultry. Central Serbia is characterized by hilly topography, small farms and diverse
farm production systems, with fairly intense production of high-value fruits and
vegetables and milk. Southern Serbia, the poorest and least developed region, is
characterized by mountainous geography, large expanses of pasture and forest, small and
fragmented arable areas, very limited commercial production, and high rates of out-
migration.

An agriculture strategy had been developed in line with EU pre-accession requirements
(August 2005) that set out a road-map for growth and competitiveness based on: (i)
completing the move to a competitive market economy, including abolishing remaining
production subsidies and adopting WTO principles but retaining quite a high level of
border protection for as long as possible pending WTO agreement; (ii) increasing
Serbia’s share of EU markets by harmonizing with EU sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS)
and quality and agro-environmental requirements; (iii) improving competitiveness
through adoption of modern, cost effective production technologies; and (iv) promoting
rural development, especially in poor regions of the country. Simultaneously, the EU
Integration Strategy for Serbian Agriculture laid out an ambitious three-phase plan for
moving towards EU standards and integration with the EU Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP). This was the centerpiece of Serbia’s agricultural strategy, both to gain access to
CAP funds and to facilitate Serbian producers’ entry into the world’s largest agricultural
market.

Agricultural Extension Services - The extension system was composed of publicly
funded but socially owned Agricultural Stations that included large production
(demonstrations and research facilities) that were expected to be privatized. As part of the
policy that formed the Agricultural Strategy, the extension services were expected to
develop into a pluralistic system with a small public service providing advisory services
of a public good nature to smaller farmers and an administrative body that would manage
the delivery of a program through a mix of public and private providers who each would
focus on their comparative strengths.

Agricultural Subsidy Policy - GoS policy aimed to facilitate agri-food sector growth and
competitiveness by moving away from price and input subsidies to structural support 2,
using EU harmonized financial delivery systems in anticipation of receiving EU pre-
accession (and eventually CAP) funds. The GoS 2006 Rural Development Grants
program measures were aligned with CAP which in addition to farm modernization,
included support for agro/eco-tourism, development and marketing of specialized local
agricultural products and crafts, conservation and promotion of cultural, sociological and
economic customs and values, special provisions for marginalized areas and farmer
retirement incentives.

    Market support was scheduled to fall from 40 percent of the budget in 2004 to 20 percent in 2008.

Agro-Biodiversity and nature protection - Access to EU markets requires convergence
with EU policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the acquis communautaire,
most notably, chapters 11 and 12 3.However, additionally, EU agricultural policy also
emphasizes environmental sustainability in agriculture which is underpinned by the
Water Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Habitats Directive and an emphasis on
agricultural support measures that provide incentives to farmers for environmental
sustainability and conservation and protection of species while ensuring adequate
livelihood in rural areas.

Dialogue with the Bank - The Bank’s dialogue on agriculture, rural development and
environment with Government was held in parallel with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) and the Ministry of Sciences and
Environmental Protection (MSEP). MSEP was in charge of implementing the GEF
financed Danube River Enterprise Pollution Reduction Project supporting legal alignment
towards the EUs Water and Nitrate Directives and demonstration investments in agri
business to reduce point source pollution from livestock production. MSEP sought
support for a project that would tackle agro-biodiversity conservation for the Southeast of
the country which suffered from massive population flight and growing forest
encroachment in pastures around the SPNP as a result of depopulation. With MAFWE
the dialogue had been ongoing for improvements in the rural business environment
including a review of the rural credit program and an analytical piece to inform the
strategic policy in the sector. Given that MSEP was the main body financing research in
the various agricultural institutes, and that MAFWM was responsible for agricultural
policy, rural development and extension services,already early on in the preparation of
the two projects close coordination between the two Ministries was considered necessary
to arrive at an optimal project design.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO and GEO) and Key Indicators
The project development objective is to enhance the competitiveness of Serbian
agriculture and to conserve the globally important eco system in the Stara Planina
mountainous area.

Key outcome indicators included: (i) improved ability of the Ministry of Agriculture
Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM ) to target the use of rural development
funds, disburse them transparently and evaluate their impact on the agri-food sector; (ii)
an increased number of agricultural producers and processors using competitive, market
oriented agriculture technologies and practices; and (iii) expanded areas under ecological
management and/or restoration within the Stara Planina Nature Park (SPNP) and
surrounding area.

  The Acquis Communautaire is the basic set of rules countries in the EU are expected to abide by. Chapter
11 defines the rules surrounding rural development and agricultural policy and support systems including
institutions that ensure the transparent traceable tracking of subsidies, while chapter 12 defines the
arrangements and institutions necessary to ensure food safety and trade with the EU common market..

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The project included institutional as well as individuals as beneficiaries. The main
institutions benefitting from the project were the Managing Authority (MA), the
Directorate for Agrarian Payments (DAP), the extension and advisory services, a number
of research institutes that obtained applied research grants, the communities, individual
households and municipalities of the Stara Planina region.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Strengthening the Agriculture and Rural Development Support System -
This component was to support the shift of agricultural payments towards structural
support and developing an EU compliant paying system. It was to involve building
capacity for processing and administering the national rural investment grant program.
The project was to fund development and implementation of data processing software
across the Payment system. Technical assistance was to be used to design the national
integrated administration and control system (IACS), a pilot land parcel information
system (LPIS) and a risk management program. In PY3, the project would support the
updating of the national rural development plan and support measures. This component
was to complement the work of European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) Support to
Rural Development Programing and Payment System (SRDPPS) project, which was
supporting the development of an EU-compatible fiduciary system within the MAFWM
and the preparation of a national rural development plan and supporting measures.

Component 2: Building Knowledge and Capacity of Agricultural Producers and
Processor - This component was to develop and disseminate the knowledge and
technology needed for agricultural producers and processors to raise agricultural
production and competitiveness and to access and make effective use of the structural
support provided by the MAFWM. Adopting best practice EU measures, this component
was to build upon and enhance existing GoS systems, in which research and extension
activities were carried out through transparent, competitively awarded contracts including
private sector delivery. While extension delivery were to be tailored to specific country
environments, systems such as those in the UK and Holland, where government funds up
to 70% of the privately delivered advisory services, were the working models for Serbia.
  a) Improve Agricultural Extension Delivery
    • Strengthening of MAFWM capacity: the project supported the establishment
         and capacity building of a Department for Rural Development and Extension
         Services (DRDES) within the MAFWM to oversee the Serbian applied research
         and extension system, with responsibility for adopting an Agricultural Extension
         Strategy and approving contracts and making payments to Extension Service
         Providers. This included office and computing equipment and vehicles for the
         DRDES, technical assistance and capacity building in extension management and
         effective communication for DRDES staff and trainers and support for annual
         workshops and training programs.




                                            4
   •  Incremental funding for extension services contracts: over the project life,
      existing funding for contracts to service providers for training of extension
      contractors, extension services to farmers and for facilitating farmer’s rural
      development grant applications was to be doubled. Demand driven extension
      contracts financed by the project were to be awarded on a competitive basis to
      certified service providers, including restructured agricultural stations, academic
      institutions (e.g., agricultural schools), NGOs, private companies and private
      individuals.
 b) Improve Applied Research Delivery – A national Advisory and Applied Research
    Fund would be established as defined in the 1991 Law on Agriculture Departments.
    The Project financed applied research programs through competitively awarded
    contracts based on EU best practice.
   • Capacity building for applied agricultural research: the Project supported
      technical assistance and training in applied research management and
      implementation and regional study tours for the members of a project supported
      Applied Research and Extension Council.
   • Incremental funding for applied research contracts: for demand driven
      applied agricultural research, awarded on a competitive basis to accredited
      research institutes and, at a lower level of funding, to innovative farmer, agro-
      industry and civil society groups for technology testing and demonstration;

  c) Development of stakeholder representation - The MAFWM extension and
    applied research program would oversee a multi-sectoral Agricultural Extension and
    Applied Research Council including representatives of the MAFWM, Ministry of
    Science and Environmental Protection (MSEP), civil society and target beneficiaries
    (agricultural producers and processors). The project also supported the establishment
    of a system for democratic, gender-balanced stakeholder representation in local
    extension and applied research management. This included a consultation and
    communication package on the development of stakeholder representative bodies
    and TA and capacity building in support of effective representation. The project will
    also fund TA and capacity building in applied research management at both
    scientific and Council levels and funding for national Council operations.

Component 3: Management of the Stara Planina Nature Park - Support aspects of
improved management and biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource use
within the non-core conservation areas (Zones 2 and 3) of the SPNP. The Project would
support TA, training and equipment for the forestry management authority (Srbijasume)
and support the preparation of management and operational plans for the SPNP including
public awareness raising and strengthening of cooperation with local authorities and
communities and trans-boundary cooperation. Support would be provided for ecological
restoration of priority sites (particularly degraded high elevation meadows), development
and certification of “SPNP branded” products based on sustainable use of natural
resources, incentives to farmers for maintaining rare indigenous livestock breeds, small
scale infrastructure to support rural/eco-tourism, and establishing an ecological
monitoring system. Project support was provided to the establishment of a practical and
meaningful ecological monitoring system for effective PA management. GEF co-


                                            5
financing was used to strengthen MAFWM capacity in areas such as agro-environmental
production and agro-tourism. While targeted toward the SPNP, these competencies will
be applicable anywhere in the country.

In the Stara Planina resources were be applied as competitive grants to support the global
objectives of promoting managed extensive grazing, ecological restoration, sustainable
rural tourism and related enterprises, and preservation of natural and agro-biodiversity,
including using the LEADER approach where appropriate. Twenty five percent of the
amounts were to be paid by local communities and 75 percent financed by the GEF grant
(€ 1.3 million). This was to be supplemented by the limited funds available from GoS for
these purposes (in 2005, approximately €103,000 equivalent went to farmers in the four
Stara Planina municipalities). The GEF investment grants would fund up to 100% of
investment costs, to encourage recipients to undertake activities with a high public goods
element (such as ecological restoration) or higher than usual financial risk. The grants,
managed through a Stara Planina Advisory Committee, supported integrated strategies
for sustainable local development, prepared through decentralized, integrated and
bottom-up approaches. In the agriculturally marginal SPNP area, GEF funds helped to
pilot approaches to introduce sustainable farming and forestry practices and to diversify
household and local economies.

Component 4: Project Management and Coordination - The project was to be managed
as an integral program of MAFWM, without the establishment of an independent project
implementation unit and covered incremental costs of consultant services, training,
equipment and operations to facilitate project implementation including procurement and
financial management, monitoring and evaluation and reporting. A Project
Implementation Team within MAFWM, working under the direction of a MAFWM
Project Manager, was providing technical, procurement and financial management
support to participating MAFWM Sectors. A small technical advisory team was located
in the Stara Planina area to support MAFWM and Srbijasume in implementation of the
GEF-financed activities under Component 3. Day-today implementation of the project
subcomponents was the responsibility of the associated MAFWM Divisions, Directorates
and Sectors, and Srbijasume in the case of for the SPNP program. The project M&E
system was designed to provide timely and concrete information to project managers,
based on the Results Framework.

1.6 Revised Components
The project components substantially remained as designed at appraisal albeit substantial
reallocations of resources and cancellations were undertaken.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project underwent five level II restructuring processes during its implementation,
three of which primarily to extend the closing date, however none affected the PDO/GEO
nor were the primary results indicators modified. The initial restructuring was in March
2010 to enable the project to be responsive Government policy change in regard to
support to the public agricultural extension services. The new Government policy was
geared toward actively supporting the public extension service approach although at the



                                            6
same time supporting a mix of public and private sector entities. The original design of
the project was unable to accommodate this policy change because state ownership made
the agricultural stations ineligible to receive project financing. The proposed changes
involved (i) the changes in wording in relevant places in the Loan Agreement and GEF
Grant Agreement – mainly in the project description to accommodate for the above
described policy change; (ii) clarifications on the financing mechanism of the agricultural
extension service and for applied agricultural research activities; (iii) improved
institutional arrangements for the implementation of the competitive grant scheme; (iv)
enabling financing for the incremental operational expenses for project management from
the loan proceeds; (v) a reallocation of loan proceeds among disbursement categories to
ensure consistency with the above amendments;(vi) and the correction in the definition of
disbursement category 1 in the GEF Grant Agreement to include training under eligible
expenditures and redefining implementation arrangements.

A second restructuring involved a project closing date extension from December 31, to
June 15, 2012 after encouraging signs for willingness to implement ongoing activities
were made. Bank Management supported this extension in spite of the relatively poor
project performance with the agreement that cancellation of activities that had little
prospect for realization would be undertaken in parallel once the amounts for such
cancellation were better known. Consequent in February of 2012, a third restructuring
was undertaken for the cancellation of some EURO 2.34. There were no changes to the
project development objective, environmental assessment (EA) category, or the results
monitoring framework were proposed.

The fourth restructuring involved a project closing date extension of some 3 further
months to September 30, 2012 mainly due to the elections that were deemed disruptive
and little implementation progress had been made during that period.

A full year should have been sought as the disruption was worse than expected and no
contract or payments were processed requiring a fifth and final restructuring in
September 2012 when the project was finally extended to its closing date of May 30,
2013.Some EURO 2.14 of IBRD resources remained unspent after all transactions have
been processed meaning the project only absorbed some EURO 8.0 million during its
implementation. It needs to be noted that the extensions were granted in view of the
goodwill the new government expressed and the fact that local communities in remote
areas of Stara Planina would have been the ones most penalized from project closure
without completing the rural infrastructure that had been promised by the project. GEF
financing was nearly fully absorbed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

There was a lack of clarity as to the shape Bank support in agriculture, rural development
and environment would take in Serbia. The initial preparation mission was already
fielded in February 2005 aiming at a GEF financed In Situ Agro-Biodiversity


                                            7
Conservation with MSEP and in parallel with MAFWM to discuss an intervention to
support improvement in the rural business environment. Two projects were prepared in
parallel: (i) one focusing on improving the Stara Planina region under a GEF grant that
would both preserve the landscape while simultaneously providing for grants to stimulate
the local economy and the competitiveness of less favored areas; and (ii) a rural credit
study reviewing Serbia rural credit support program, and an agriculture sector review
with the aim to have a project that would address the rural business environment. The
sector review had ambitious objectives for reforms which were fully supported by the
reformist government but may have lacked broader based popular support especially in
rural areas, and may not have been insufficiently promoted at the lower functional level
of the MAFWM and its related agencies.

On the Bank side there was also some pressure to deliver larger projects to reduce
administrative costs and GEF especially expressed a wish to have its projects paired up
with a Bank projects to optimize impacts. The initial concept review meeting held in
September 2005 underlined the complexity of the design and the wisdom to have both the
GEF and IBRD project under a single operation. However, the single operation was
endorsed at the second PCN review meeting in March of 2006 as an expressed wish of
GEF and supported by the project preparation team.

The project thus agglomerated the preparatory work under GEF and the conclusions of
the two studies. At the time of project preparation, Serbia was negotiating the
Stabilization and Association Agreement which would allow access to EU IPARD 4
funding, where competitiveness was to be stimulated by implementing EU compliant
payment system, and establishing a policy making body that would allow the country to
absorb the funding made available to Serbia from IPARD. Given the experience with
absorption issues, this included strengthening extension and advisory services to help
disseminate knowledge to the farming community with applications that have a strong
business plan. The support to extension services was also going to help government
implement its reform agenda in moving extensions towards a more pluralistic system that
would also generate some of its own revenues from sale of services.

Support to access EU IPARD was considered uncontroversial regardless of the turn
elections would take and the policy stance of the new government would be. The team
was composed of a fairly broad team of experts who also had worked on the agriculture
sector review and as such no questions could be raised as to the technical competence of
the team. Given that the project was negotiated with a care taker government, at the last
minute project financing had to be revised reducing counterpart contributions so as to not
fall upon resistance during implementation. The pressure to move ahead with
negotiations was also in large part driven due to the fact that resources that had been
allocated to the project would be lost if not locked in the current Bank fiscal year.

Retrospectively, it could be argued that the Bank could have taken a step back and get a
bit more clarity as to what the government really wanted. While preparation took nearly
two and half years it seems in the end there was still a need to get a better sense of the
vision of the new government.

2.2 Implementation
The project was faced with serious implementation challenges as soon as it was approved
by the Bank. This is well illustrated by the fact that it took some 18 months from that
point to effectiveness. The political turmoil was such that a total of five Bank projects
were similarly held up. By the time effectiveness was declared the political landscape had
significantly changed in the country and a previously reformist MAFWM had been
replaced be a more conservative one. An important change was the reversal on the
research and extension policy back towards a fully budget funded model. The result was
that the project required an almost immediate restructuring and amending of the legal
agreements and the development of a grant manual that reflected the conditions of the
grants and grant administration by the PIU. A project restructuring should have been
discussed with the new government and completed shortly after effectiveness. The
supervision assessed this option with ECA quality, but was advised that a restructuring so
early in project implementation would be difficult to justify.

While little changed conceptually, a series of four new Ministers along with associated
senior staff changes severely undermined continuity in overall decisions. The successive
administrations failed to coordinated project resources to improve and operationalize the
activities developed by the EU funded EAR and politicized the establishment of technical
bodies with the move of the Directorate for Agrarian Payments and the loss of support for
the Managing Authority including the temporary firing of crucial staff that guided these
nascent institutions. Each new MAFWM management raised issues of corruption and all
contracts under implementation were reviewed. Since these allegations were primarily
based on hearsay they could never be substantiated and project audits and procurement
reviews did not bring to light any unusual issues. The net result of these inquiries was
significant delays in procurement and contract signing, ultimately causing very late
delivery of most of the project activities. The continuous changes in counterparts
combined with the utter lack of devolution for signing and decision authority to the
Project Implementation Team (PIT) made this project an administrative nightmare, and
the primary cause for the implementation delays, the inability to absorb the loan funds,
and the need for the three consecutive project closing date extensions.

More specifically at the component level this meant that for Component 1 dropping of
software development as the government of Serbia purchased a payment software
package out of its own funds with the aim of customizing it in house to suit the DAP’s
needs. At the same time, it decided that the DAP would be established in Sabac some
100km away from Belgrade and the embryonic Managing Authority to Vojvodina. This
decision also led to some difficulties in finding adequately qualified staff locally and
eventually staff had to be bussed in from Belgrade daily. It also effectively disconnected
the policy making body for RD and agriculture from the MAFWM and focused subsidy
policy in favor of the region. Savings from not funding software development were



                                             9
reallocated towards some key TA support to the DAP for training and assistance in
developing process and procedures as well funding of core specialized staff that
eventually would be absorbed into the civil service, and support for procurement of
computer hardware and technology for improved on-the-spot controls and verification.

For Component 2 changes related to the new structure of the extension services and
regional extension stations. While at project design the intent was to substantially move
away from a public extension service towards a hybrid system where public funding
would essentially fund programs to be delivered to farmers by private and non-
governmental bodies, by 2009 this policy reverted to have extension delivered mainly
through publicly owned bodies. The extension stations that had been slated for
privatization were effectively renationalized and brought under the budget of the
MAFWM. This new reality led to the need for restructuring of the project as soon as the
project became effective as funding could not be channeled through budgeted public
bodies. The grants were to be made in accordance with a grant manual that was only
completed by 2009 after several iterations, thus the number of grants altogether was
substantially lower than had been estimated at project design. The delays also were
related to grant administration mechanisms and the lack of local knowledge for effective
application and management of grant funded applied research. As a consequence no new
grant funded activities were authorized after the mission of 2011, allowing only the
closure of already contracted activities.

For Component 3 there were no significant changes in design except that altogether the
number of community grants and infrastructure investments were reduced in large part
due the cost overruns on the construction on a number of projects. The lodge for the
SPNP Manager – Srbijasume (Visitor Center) in particular cost nearly double what had
been envisaged at design. This had several reasons including an agreement to drop the
counterpart funding from Srbijasume with the investment fully financed from grant
resources, but also problems with design that had overlooked a number of issues related
to sanitary installations and waste management requirements to obtain occupancy permits.
Overall, the community investments and infrastructure works were started very late and
were the main reason why the Bank approved altogether 3 project closing date extensions
cumulatively amounting to some 23 months.

Unfortunately, the implementation difficulties were not helped by the fact that the Bank
had assigned a series of seven Task Team Leaders (TTLs) starting from preparation until
closing. The changes in Bank staff were disruptive and at times also led to a lack of
responsiveness from the Bank to client requests, delays in providing No Objections and
implementation advice. For instance while restructuring of the project was identified as
soon as the project became effective, it was only undertaken some 16 months later after
effectiveness. Only in the last 3 years of implementation was there effective continuous
and responsive engagement from the Bank through its TTLs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization




                                           10
The PDO for the IBRD portion of the project defined as “to enhance the competitiveness
of Serbian Agriculture” was rather broad and appears a carryover of the preparation work
that had been done before the contents and activities of this project were finally agreed.
The accompanying outputs and indicators could only indirectly contribute to this
objective. While the establishment of institutions for management of payments and for
rural policy making as well as advisory services, all provide a potential for improving
competitiveness, they play only a limited role and many other factors 5 have a greater
influence on this envisaged outcome. Consequently, the indicators for measuring progress
towards PDO suffer from an attribution problem. While a number of indicators have been
substantially achieved, it is somewhat difficult to link that achievement with the objective
of the project.

The indicators suffered from the optimism of project preparation where many activities
had been agreed that then subsequently could not effectively be delivered due to recurrent
policy changes with the arrival of each new MAFWM administration. While overall the
indicators were appropriate in terms of measuring performance towards achieving a
number of crucial elements that would help Serbia on the path to the EU on their own,
they can hardly be thought of having measurably contributed to the ambitious PDO
focusing on competitiveness of the sector.

The GEO defined as “to conserve the globally important eco-system in the Stara Planina
mountainous area” has a similar issue with overstating what can reasonably be achieved
with a US$4.5 million regional investment. The project without a doubt made significant
contributions that will help the area revive economically and bring in more agricultural
activities back to help manage the overgrowth and loss of pasture and revival of
autochthone livestock species in the area. However, depopulation and neglect remains a
fact that will only be alleviated if the new rural development programs currently being
prepared includes measures to help revitalize such less favored areas.

In part due to the serious delays with project implementation and contracting, and despite
the preparation of a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan pre-project, M&E
was also undermined as a baseline was effectively only established in 2011 nearly 4 years
after the project had been negotiated. In the end a very large M&E contract was awarded,
but due to poor data collection before the contractor was on board, a good baseline to
compare progress before and after, could never be really established. The PIUs M&E
responsibilities in terms of providing regular status reports were also neglected and
regular updates against indicators were not performed very diligently. The lack of a
clearly assigned project coordinator at the PIT to assume responsibility for the project
outcomes including M&E data collection played a role as well.

Finally, the indicators defined in the PAD and Legal Agreement were not systematically
followed as the ISR included other intermediate indicators that were in many cases more


5
 These factors include financial resources for farm investments and modernization, land consolidation,
access to developed value chains and markets, agriculture support policy



                                                   11
effective in measuring progress under the components, but left some indicators without
data.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Given that the project primarily dealt with institutional capacity building it presented few
safeguards risks and during its implementation there were never any issues raised from
either the environmental or social side. There were some problems with getting goods
purchased under the project delivered to their rightful beneficiary institutions. While
procurement and financial management processes always followed Bank guidelines and
audits were always clear the lack of accountability at the Ministry of Agriculture resulted
in a significant number of vehicles never being distributed to the designed beneficiaries.
This was the case for the vehicle dedicated to the Project Implementing Team as well as
for vehicles assigned for extension and advisory services. Given that the vehicles had all
been purchased and paid for in accordance with Bank rules, the end effect of having
fifteen cars (out of 90 purchased) left at the parking lot of the dealership without
registration was mainly an embarrassment and the illustration of the lack of continuity
and institutional accountability at MAFWM. With a new Administration in charge at
project closure the situation was finally satisfactory resolved and the vehicles were
distributed to the rightful beneficiaries.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The systems and institutions that were developed and strengthened under the STAR
project, even in their somewhat incomplete shape, are fundamental to Serbia’s
progression to eventual EU accession and will serve to improve agricultural
competitiveness, especially for less well capitalized farms. The recent recommendation
for Serbia to commence negotiations for accession the EU only strengthens the
sustainability of the investments under component one, as they lay the ground work for
further investments towards an eventual IACS system as required from new candidate
countries. This step is accompanied by the promise for significant IPARD resources. As
such the investments under this project will pay for themselves many times over and are
consequently assured financing from budget resources, thus mitigating many of the
typical sustainability risks. While EU accession will require significant further
investments in public administration, it will be important for Serbia to carefully and
selectively increase its ranks of public servants so as to remain within sustainable
budgetary envelopes. In a number of neighboring countries the Bank is implementing TA
operations to support them in optimizing the planning, delivery and monitoring of their
agricultural and rural development programs.

There remain questions as to the optimal shape and structure of extension services which
today are under the budgetary responsibility of the MAFWM. The fairly large land
holdings that the stations are endowed with provides for their capacity to survive from
sale of production, but the optimization of services delivery remains questionable and
value maximization of the assets extension services possess remains unfulfilled.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives of the project remain highly relevant to Serbia’s path towards EU
accession and its ability to integrate its agricultural sector in economic environment of
the EU. Aligning with EU requirements and the necessary competitive and structural
adjustments remains the primary policy driver in the Serbian agricultural sector today.
Serbia’s CAS continues its focus on improving sector competitiveness and alignment
towards the EU and, as such, the project remains fully in line with overall Country
Assistance Strategy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Both the PDO and GEO were equally broadly defined and not in tune with what could
reasonably be achieved within the framework of a US$22.00 million project. While
many of the project activities were substantially delivered, in neither case could it be
legitimately claimed that the project measurably contributed to the competitiveness of
Serbian agriculture or that the GEF activities have effectively and sustainably secured the
globally important eco-systems in the Stara Planina mountainous areas.As it relates to the
activities and indicators of each component the outcome is more balanced.

Outcomes towards objectives of Component 1 - The Directorate for Agricultural
Payments (DAP) in Sabac and a Managing Authority are both effectively in place and
operating and the DAP has recently obtained national accreditation. The DAP fully
processes all the subsidy payments in the agricultural sector in line with EU
requirements; however it only now is going through national accreditation and EU
conferral of management which will, at best, be obtained by summer 2014. Under its
current set up and limited staff resources, it is regularly overwhelmed with the large
volume of direct payments that it has to process, often at short notice 6, rather than focus
on EU IPARD like rural development grants which was the primary objective for its
establishment. In spite of these facts, an EU IPARD compliant payment mechanism is
slowly emerging in Serbia. However, the progress with these two institutions cannot be
attributed to this project alone, a number of coordinated EU support activities helped with
achieving the current results. The location in Sabac has clearly had a negative impact on
the DAP in terms of staffing and effective communications with the MAFWM itself and
in terms of attracting and retaining qualified staff. Similalry, the move of the MA to
Vojvodina, its dissolution and recent reconstitution back in Belgrade have undermined
the development of the MA into a credible representative policy body that reflects the
regional structural differences. However, the recent completion of the rural development
strategy and program does show that this body in spite of its tumultuous history, with
Bank support has acquired the capacity to develop a coherent sector policy. While the
project did not fully meet the two key indicators defining this component, i.e., a Paying
Agency with EU compliant procedures that is accredited, and a Managing Authority with
a functioning Monitoring Committee, the structures are substantially in place. Conferral


6
    This is due to delayed approval of government subsidy policy




                                                           13
of management is expected in 2014. As it relates to the PDO, competitiveness of Serbian
Agriculture appears to have substantially grown as can be observed from the growing
export volumes. The subsidy policy however left large swath of smaller and medium
sized farms that would have benefitted from EU IPARD falling further behind widening
the competitiveness gap between the major agronomic regions of the country. The
outcome of this Component is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory in large part due to
distractions that have fraught the establishment of these institutions and the inability to
affect policy to help convergence in the sector with well-targeted IPARD measures to
help competitiveness of smaller and medium size farms..

Outcomes towards objective of Component 2 - The objective of Component 2 was to
improve farmers' access to appropriate technology. Under the Project a competitive
applied research and extension service system providing broad range of services was
piloted through competitive grant schemes (CGS), while the capacity of the public
extension service was strengthened by improving the infrastructure for service delivery
and by delivering a training program for accreditation of over 250 farm advisors. At the
inception of the project Serbia was at the cusp reforms in the structure of its extension
services with a major role to be played by the private sector, a pluralistic delivery
mechanism of extension/advisory services and a more demand driven program design.
The back tracking on reforms with extension services that took place early on in the
project ultimately meant significant restructuring of this component. In particular,
farmers were not empowered to guide extension delivery. On the side of the applied
research while a number of grants produced quite interesting and practical outputs, the
lack of commitment by the MAFWM to the competitive grant model under this project
and lack of vision for continued financing of applied agricultural research by MAFWM
undermine the sustainability of the activities under this component. Most of the indicators
such as the number of accredited extensions services providers was achieved, and bodies
such as the Institute for Science Application in Agriculture (ISAA), with its aggressive
pursuit of funding from various donors to deliver a variety of training and knowledge
programs to extension services and other stakeholders, appear quite successful and
sustainable. A similarly positive outcome can be assigned to the comprehensive farm
management training program developed and implemented with USDA co-financing for
all extension agents provided an understanding of the multifaceted aspects farmers need
to take into account in their business and operational planning. The fact remains that
productivity and competitiveness increases have mainly taken place on the large farms in
Vojvodina that have the resource base to pay for their advisory services and are only
marginally dependent on the publicly funded extension services diminish the outcome
rating under this component to Moderately Satisfactory.

Outcomes towards objectives of Component 3 –The aim of the component was to
improve sustainable land use and ecological management in SPNP. A management plan
for the park has been prepared and a number of investments have been made under the
project to help with improving accessibility and viability of the residents living in or near
the park. The key challenge is to restore livelihoods that will bring back economic life to
the region thus preventing the slow depopulation of people and livestock and its return to
full wilderness. This was addressed through community-based investments in rural



                                             14
infrastructure, and individual grants to stimulate rural tourism that facilitate access to the
remote villages in the area. While the population in the region has not stabilized yet, there
is anecdotal evidence that, given the improved infrastructure and access to services, some
younger locals are considering making their life in the region. Livestock numbers have
grown including of autochthone breeds, and if the trend of growing livestock numbers
continues the prospects for maintaining the large pasture areas are improving. The
catalysis provided by the project could be significantly boosted by EU IPARD measures
that target “Less Favored Areas” not only aiming at agricultural productivity but also
alternative income sources from services such as the hospitality and tourism industry.
The delivery of technical advice for the expansion of organic production as well as
protection of the regional brand “Stara Planina” for a variety of cheese, agro artisanal
activities and home crafts (tanning and weaving) have had a good response and
significant adoption. By supporting production but also processing and creating a
consumer market (tourists and weekenders) the value chain that will prevent overgrowth
of pastures will be secured. While the lack of effective implementation of the SPNP
Management plan limits the impact of the project, it is only one factor that will determine
the sustainability of the area. Due to the overwhelmingly positive impressions from field
visits and beneficiaries (reflected in a brief film) and substantial achievement of most of
the indicators under this component support an outcome rating of Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
The economic and financial analysis for this project was based on the underlying
assumption that the project will contribute to the more effective use and absorption of
Serbian Government structural funds for agriculture. While delayed, Brussels recent
approval of Serbia as a candidate country, and the forthcoming accreditation of the
paying agency including the foreseeable conferral of management in mid-2014, the
potential benefits from the Project will still yield major benefits to the country largely in
line with original estimates but delayed by some 3 years. The capacity to absorb the funds
made available from IPARD, of course, is also dependent on the ability of farmers to
prepare adequate business plans and overall business acumen by farmers as a result of
component 2.

As a candidate country, Serbia has access to EU IPARD funding ranging from EURO 37
to 57 million per annum. While this outcome will not be attributable to this project solely,
the rate of return if IPARD funds are fully absorbed relative to the small investment of
some US$9.5 million (EURO 7.5 million) under this components is between 4to 7 fold
each year for the period of IPARD 2013- 2020. Using various absorption and plausible
funding scenarios the Net Present Value of these activities under component 1 are as
follows:
  IPARD                Net Present Value                 Internal Rate Of return
  funding
   (US$        At 10%        At 15%     At 20%     At 10%       At 15%        At 20%
  million) absorbed absorbed absorbed absorbed absorbed                       absorbed
   45.00      -1,778,381     404,089   2,586,559   -14.00%        14.00%        31.00%
   60.00       -323,401     2,586,559 5,496,519     7.00%         31.00%        51.00%



                                             15
  75.00     1,131,579    4,769,029    8,406,478    20.00%        47.00%        70.00%

In addition, the paying system is not only a requirement for IPARD but will also be used
for later implementation of EU CAP funds and thus will generate benefits beyond that
period. As such, in spite of their significant deficiencies, the two components are to be
considered highly efficient in terms of the potential returns to which they contribute to
the country.

For component 2 taking the conservative approach of the M&E report and a GVA growth
of EURO 3.0 million is assumed per year by maintaining the practices and technology
developed with project support, the following outcome can be calculated stemming
purely from the competitive grants for research and extension. At a constant rate of
growth over 20 years and a discount rate of 12% the investment under the component
would generate a Net Present Value of the investments of US$ 2,054,853 with an IRR of
17%.Taking data from a sample of projects based on cost/benefit analysis performed by
beneficiaries, and assuming a wholesale adoption across the sector, the GVA grows to an
astonishing US$392 million.

For Component 3. GEF investments in sustainable farming in the SPNP were of a pilot
nature and included the reintroduction of traditional breeds and products, a substantial
expansion of organic farming, creation and registration of a collective brand “Stara
Planina”, a decline in pasture degradation and initiation of agri-tourism with local
infrastructure investments and grant support to households and communities. There was
no quantification of the benefits from improved pasture management in part due to a lack
of an adequate baseline, nor were the environmental benefits estimated as the effective
implementation of the management plan of the SPNP remains lacking. From the survey
undertaken in Stara Planina for the grant program, 68% of recipients claim an increase in
income, while 21 % did not report a change and another 5% did not know. Overall, 42%
of the recipients claim income increases of up to 50% while another 16% had incomes
above 50%. Finally as required by GEF, the PAD included an Incremental Cost Analysis
to justify funding for the component and is reflected in annex 3.

As it relates to project efficiency and costs incurred, the cost of goods, services and
works appear within the regional averages. Cost of some items where higher than
estimated mainly because the designs had not adequately taken into account the need for
auxiliary investments and the national building code. For example at the visitor center
for Serbiasume and at a training center, septic tanks had to be built subsequently. The
poor utilization of vehicles purchased by the project was also not an optimal use of
resources. On balance relative to the utilization of funds while only about 2/3 of project
resources were absorbed in component 1 and 2, component 4 expenditures were fully
absorbed mainly as a consequence of the project closing date extensions to effectively
implement the GEF financed component.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory for the PDO. The project’s outcomes related to the
PDO is a mixed bag. While recent agricultural statistics indicate higher productivity in
Serbian Agriculture, this outcome is difficult to attribute to the activities under the project.
The subsidy policy in the country has, over the duration of the project focused on uniform
area payments that overwhelmingly benefited large field cropping farms, especially
wheat and maize producers that are predominantly found in the agronomically favored
Vojvodina region 7. It needs to be noted in this context, that these direct payments have
been quite successfully handled by the DAP which very substantially benefitted from the
capacity building under the project. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the
capacity of DAP substantially affected productivity in the less favored Central or
Southern parts of Serbia. The competitive grants did produce some interesting technical
research that could significantly benefit the country if adequately replicated and adopted
on a larger scale. A willingness to introduce a more pluralistic structure of the extension
and advisory services and a continued program to support to financing of competitive
grants for applied research and training are necessary to reap the full potential of the
investments made by the project. Overall, here is a need for a clear policy vision that
would be more inclusive of small and medium farmers found in these regions, however
this may well be something that is beyond the scope of influence and the investments
under this project.

Achievement towards GEO is somewhat easier to assess, simply because the indicators
have been substantially achieved and field visits do reflect a certain economic dynamic
and slowly increasing livestock numbers (only in a limited fashion for those breeds
supported under the project) returning to the Stara Planina region. More livestock means
less forest encroachment, a key issue in the region, and supports the economic revival
necessary to preserve livelihoods and the natural and cultural assets of the region. On the
flip side, the lack to date of a support program that will continue these investments, and
the lack of implementation of the SPNP management plan for pasture biodiversity,
somewhat undermine the sustainability of the gains achieved.

For these counter acting reasons the outcome of the project relative to its GEO, in spite of
the catalytic impact it has on improving both livelihood and sustainability of the Stara
Planina region is rated as moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Given the nature of the project, focusing mainly on institutions had no direct poverty or
gender focus. Its investment under GEF however clearly aimed at improving livelihoods
in one of the poorest areas of Serbia. Elderly people living in the remote villages were
rural infrastructure was rehabilitated (roads, bridges) will benefit from increased
economic activities from more traffic and dynamic farming which might with time also

    Also reflected in the agricultural chapter of the most recently produced CEM of Serbia



                                                      17
lead to a slight repopulation. More population and more economic activity will increase
the value of their small holdings and attract crucial local government services such as
better access to health services, the return of schools and a more involved approach in the
development of these remote areas.

If or when a future rural development program that includes measures for less favored
areas, along IPARD principles is adopted livelihoods for smaller more remote farms the
benefits from the experience gained in Stara Planina will be exponential. The uniform
area payments helped in improving competitiveness but only provided limited benefits to
small diversified farms with limited access to land.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Unfortunately, one has to draw the conclusion that the project was not able to reach its
institutional strengthening objectives as laid out at design. While the project
significantly contributed to strengthen the capacity to the DAP to implement agricultural
policies, the legal and regulatory grounding of both the DAP and MA and their budgetary
independence remains unclear. However the recent EU approval of Serbia as a candidate
country will renew the focus and, in all likelihood, the political will to make the DAP and
MA not only functional but also rooted in an adequate legal and regulatory framework in
line with EU requirement for IPARD. As it relates to the institutional capacity building
with extension services and competitively funded research little progress has been made.
In fact, the return to public ownership of the regional extension offices including all the
land and other assets and the cessation of competitive extension grants, which existed
pre-project, is a retrenchment from pluralistic demand driven extension and advisory
services.

Nonetheless, the project also had significant beneficial institutional impacts, especially as
it relates to the work with rural grants and infrastructure in the Stara planina where local
municipalities, communities, interest groups and government agencies coalesced to
define priorities. This capacity to reach consensus and prioritize and play an active role in
determining where and how public resources are spent will serve the region well for any
future EU LEADER programs that help regions develop a strategic vision for which then
funding can be sought for priority investments.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
There are not really any unintended outcomes from this project, as it primarily deals with
institutions that have specific functions in a country on the threshold of joining the EU.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
The summary of the project closing stakeholder workshop is attached in annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate. In spite of the lack of clear vision and continuity of Serbia’s
government as is relates to the agricultural sector, overall the activities related to the
establishment of EU compliant systems have reasonable sustainability prospects simply
because EU accessions remains a key objective for the Serbian authorities. The risk to
Development Outcome for component 1 consequently is low. The effectiveness of the



                                             18
current structure of the extension services and funding of research is suboptimal, and is
likely to undergo further changes as part of the EU accession process. There is full
understanding of the crucial importance advisory services have to play to optimize the
impact of EU IPARD funding and absorption capacity. The reforms to arrive at a
pluralistic demand-driven extension system providing information that is useful to the
farmers will entail political backlash from those who benefit from the status quo, and it is
unclear whether the immediate prospects to pre-accession funding will reignite the
willingness of policy makers to such a model. With EU IPARD funding access becoming
a reality, resources for less favored regions also are likely to become available and the
project provided a model to help improve livelihood and environmental sustainability in
remote areas such as Stara Planina.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Several activities were prepared in parallel and
eventually combined under this project. In line with a reforming and modernizing team at
the MAFWM, and in collaboration with the EC Commission, a set of activities were
agreed that would contribute to align the government’s strategy with parallel EC efforts
supporting Serbia’s pre-accession path. Although the Bank had prepared a sector study
before project reparation identifying critical policy gaps and issues affecting the potential
of Serbia’s agriculture, it had not sufficiently taken into account the changing mood in
the country and potential political backlash that would follow once the reformist
government fell. EU accession was considered uncontroversial however also meant that
the institutional commitment to reforms at lower levels in the Ministry would be
necessary for the reforms and for the project to be successful. The subsequently elected
government had a more conservative approach to the sector with a public sector
extension services delivery focus, block grants for research without a competitive
element, and a subsidies policy focusing on area payments at the expense of rural
development financing, which, while largely in line with EU objectives, disproportionally
benefited large specialized farms relative to the smaller family farms with diversified
production thus deepening the competitive gap.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Serbia required a lot of hand holding in supporting
the Project Implementation Team to handle Bank procurement procedures and contract
management. The lack of continuity with TTLs was not conducive to provide this
intensive support that was necessary given the lack of continuity at the administration
level. In two distinctive periods the Bank lacked proactivity in resolving poor project
performance. This included during the long lapse until effectiveness, in late 2008 and
later after effectiveness when it was recognized that amendment to the legal agreement
was necessary for disbursement under component 2 but was processed only some 16
months later in March of 2010. In the last 3 years of project implementation supervision
became more proactive and effective in restructuring and cancelling activities that were
not progressing. A pragmatic approach was used to respond to the strong commitment to



                                             19
delivering activities particularly as related to the GEF objectives. The project was
considered low risk in terms of social and environmental safeguards risks, consequently
there was only occasional participation by safeguards colleagues in the regular
supervision missions. The GEF activities generally started very late in the project, but,
once started, progressed quite swiftly and were the primary reasoning for the repeated
project closing date extensions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
68. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory – The Bank’s overall performance is uneven with
a lack of clarity at preparation, merging two substantially disconnected operations (IBRD,
GEF) pushing for a tight delivery deadline and underestimating the risk posed by political
upheaval resulting from elections as well as government reshuffle. Implementation was
characterized by frequent changes in Task Team Leadership which has been disruptive
with periods of near inactivity and very long response times to clearing No Objection
requests and overall responsiveness with restructuring at crucial points in time. In the
later part of the project engagement by the Bank and frequency of supervision intensified
and the Bank showed a clear willingness to engage with the client to get the project to
work. In spite of this improvement, overall Bank performance in rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory

5.2 BorrowerPerformance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory - as reflected above, with the frequent changes in government,
there was a lack of vision at the MAFWM as to how the project could support the
modernization and competitiveness of the sector. The various succeeding administrations
lacked coherence and continuity and made decisions that effectively undermined the
sustainability of some of the activities funded by the project. The treatment of the DAP
and the MA are good examples of this lack of coherence at the policy level. The handling
of contracts and the complete distrust between the various incoming administrations as to
how implementation was handled by its predecessor led to systematic “investigations” to
try to identify misappropriation, and had the corrosive effect of completely undermining
the decision making process at the PIT. Project implementation effectively became
politicized and decisions were needlessly delayed due to often unwritten “administrative”
procedures to stall effective decision making and avoid accountability.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory - Given the above described climate the PIT faced huge
administrative challenges and failed to effectively coordinate the implementation of the
project. Due to the lack of continued support from government, the project decision
making process was pushed to the highest common denominator with the Minister and
his cabinet the only persons authorized to sign contracts, or make decisions. The PIT was
effectively devolved to a glorified courier service handling request from the field by
passing them on to the Ministry level and waiting for either decision or clearances. At
times several months passed before any decisions would be made and then several more
months for them to be implemented. The PIT tried to overcome these challenges and its




                                            20
efforts were beneficial for finalizing activities in Stara Planina for instance but also in
properly closing the competitive grants program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
71. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory - The Borrower lacked clear commitment to the
objectives and activities under the project once a new administration took charge. The
suspicion towards the previous administration and ensuing review of all contracts and
payments without real grounds was highly disruptive created an atmosphere of fear and
lead to project management decision paralysis. The willingness to introduce reforms was
also affected by the lack of clarity of the schedule leading to EU accession that included
extraneous political considerations and delayed the process.

6. Lessons Learned

The Bank needs a clearly agreed vision when negotiating a project. While project
preparation took nearly 2.5 years in the end there was considerable pressure to deliver in
the given fiscal year. Negotiations should probably not have been held with a care taker
government that does not really have the mandate to push through deep rooted
administrative reforms opposed by a number of stakeholders and lacking buy in from the
new administration. Suspending preparation until more clarity as to the policy direction
may have helped in formulating assistance that had more buy in by policy makers.
However, when administrations change as frequently as they have in Serbia, the
uncertainty and lack of continuity cannot effectively be eliminated.

In a political environment as dynamic as Serbia’s the frequent change of TTLs may
not have given the project the attention and management continuity required for a
strong dialogue and successful implementation. Institutional development takes time
and needs close coordination between all the various actors which is easier to realize with
continuity in the Bank’s team. However, even when the Bank does everything right, in
the end government may take decisions based substantially on political factors such as
with the choice in location for the DAP and the MA.
Agricultural and Rural Development policy within the EU neighborhood is largely
determined by the EU who is the largest donor and policy influence to the sector while
the Bank plays a complementary role only. This means that Bank interventions have to
substantially agree with EU objectives and schedules and take an opportunistic approach
to close gaps that EU support does not finance but are necessary for the institutional
systems to function.
The Bank needs to better assess the risk of engaging in institutional capacity building
in the agricultural sector in pre-accession countries given that perspectives of
readiness towards a candidate State can change for reasons extraneous to the sector or
the project. In the case of this project the delaying of the candidacy status from 2008 to
2012 had a significant impact on the borrower’s commitment to institutional structures in
alignment with EU requirement given that IPARD funding would remain unavailable.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: Strengthening the Agriculture and Rural Development Support System

This component has supported establishment of a transparent rural development
programming and payment system. The MAFWM has recently established a Department
for Rural Development (DRD) including the Division for Programming and Publicity
containing two groups: the Group for Technical Assistance and the Group for
Programming. The Department also includes a separate Group for Extension Services.
The Department is planned to serve as a future Managing Authority (MA) for IPARD,
tasked with programming and monitoring of the IPARD program and coordination of the
IPA rural development structures.

A Monitoring Committee (MC) is scheduled for establishment at end-2013. It will
include a recently established inter-ministerial council (agriculture, economy, finance,
environment, local administration, education and social and labor), an expert group
(institutes and faculties) and a Council for Farmers’ Associations.

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is drafting a law on the implementation of IPA. Once
enacted, the MAFWM will prepare a decree on the decentralized management of EU
financial assistance under IPARD. This decree will designate the MAFWM Department
of Rural Development as the designated MA and the MAFWM Directorate for Agrarian
Payments as the designated Paying Agent.

A National Rural Development Program of the Republic of Serbia, 2010-2013 (NRDP),
which was adopted by government on 28 October 2010, defines the following strategic
goals for the sector: (i) improving the competitiveness of the agricultural, forestry and
food sectors; (ii) environmental protection, conservation and improvement in accordance
with sustainable rural development policies; (iii) preparation and promotion of local rural
development initiatives and strategies for improving the competitiveness of and the
quality of life in rural areas; and (iv) improving the quality of life of the rural population
through increasing the possibilities for economic activity expansion, both in the
agricultural production and processing areas as well as in the non-agricultural economy.
A new agriculture and rural development strategy and plan (the Strategy) for the period
2014-2020 is under preparation. The development of core principles and key elements of
the Strategy were supported under the project.

The Government has also recently passed a law on incentives/subsidies in agriculture and
rural development, which sets out the conditions for subventions in agriculture and rural
development in Serbia. The law includes: (i) incentives for investments in agriculture to
improve competitiveness and achieve quality standards; (ii) incentives for rural
development including agro-ecological measures, organic production and animal welfare;
and (iii) support to diversify the rural economy. The law envisages that 70-80 percent of
subventions will be direct aid payments, with the balance financing rural development


                                              25
measures. In 2012, area-based payments (production-based direct aid) formed 90% of
government agriculture and rural development subventions. Measures under this law are
not fully IPARD compliant.

Based on the NRDP, a Serbian IPARD program 2013 has been drafted and undergone
several unofficial consultations with the European Union Directorate General for
Agriculture as prerequisite for official submission to the Commission of the program by a
candidate country. The Program foresees measures under Axis I – Improving the
competitiveness, and measure 501 - Technical Assistance. The beginning of
implementation of the IPARD Program 2013 is foreseen in 2015 for the MA, MC and
PA; and iv) receiving EC’s accreditation and conferral of management decision. The EC
Progress Report for 2012 outlines the importance of appointing the MA, and staffing of
the DAP, while building inter-ministerial mechanisms for coordinating rural development
policies. It also emphasizes the need to (i) bring direct payments in Serbia into line with
EU rules, decoupling direct aid payments from production; (ii) strengthen the agri-
environmental orientation of Serbia's rural development policy; (iii) establish a farm
accountancy data network (FADN) – a pilot FADN is presently being implemented by
the Institute for Science Application in Agriculture (ISAA); (iv) strengthen the
administrative structure and legal provisions for producer groups; (v) strengthen the
administrative capacity of the institutions involved in controlling food chain safety
particularly the MAFWM veterinary, phytosanitary and national reference laboratories;
and (vii) strengthen the administrative capacity for the management of common market
organizations.

Overall, project support to the MA and DAP has been fractured and unsystematic, due
primarily to weak management and frequent changes of administration in MAFWM,
exacerbated, until recently, by the retreating prospect of achieving EU Candidate Country
status. Over its life, the project has supported three variations of the MA, while, at least
initially, the DAP management showed little interest in project support, benefiting instead
from a strong stream of government funding that led it to pursue the early and, ultimately,
unsuccessful establishment of an IT-based agrarian payment system. The underutilization
of STAR funds largely centers around the inability of the MAFWM to apply a consistent
policy to the development of these agencies and of an IPARD-compliant agriculture and
rural development strategy and program.

Nonetheless, the STAR project has made important contributions to both agencies. It has
provided vehicles, equipment, training and key staff to the MA over an extended period,
has supported the development of the IPARD 2013 program, including its ex-ante review
and is currently supporting the preparation of the IPARD 2014-2020 program. The PA
has also received substantial project support in the form of vehicles, office and computing
equipment, equipment for on-the-spot field control, technical assistance for IPARD-
compliant payment systems development and subsequent implementation, financing for
key IT staff, and extensive staff training in payment systems application. That both
agencies are expected to receive national accreditation in 2013, with EU accreditation
likely in 2014 and that an IPARD compliant NRDS has been developed, can, in no small
measure, be attributable to STAR support, however, it must be recognized that both
agencies could have been much further advanced in their accreditation processes, had the


                                            26
MAFWM maintained a consistent vision of and commitment to the EU integration
process.
Overall expenditure under this component amounted to US$ 3.51 million over 40% less
than envisaged at appraisal.


Component 2: Building Knowledge and Capacity of Agricultural Producers and
Processors

This component has supported a Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS) for applied research
and extension service projects implemented by research institutes, farmers associations,
NGOs, private sector extension agents, etc. (the CGS for extension service grants was
open for all non-public agriculture extension service providers). It has also supported the
public agricultural extension system through technical assistance and training, and
extension-related equipment, such as IT and vehicles.

In 2010, Serbia’s agriculture stations in charge of delivering extension service to farmers
were converted to limited liability companies with 100 percent Government ownership
and integrated into the MAFWM supported by a new law on extension services.

This approach was different to that negotiated with MAFWM management at project
design, which envisaged a more independent, publicly financed but privately owned
extension service, with strong stakeholder engagement in its management, wherein
extension funding would be allocated by a new MAFWM extension department on a
more competitive basis, both between agricultural sectors and agricultural stations. The
project also envisioned performance-based extension contracts with a strong, independent
monitoring and evaluation role for the ISAA.

Subsequent project-led discussions with a wide range of advisors and agricultural stations
resulted in a paper on “Management of agricultural extension work in Serbia”, which was
agreed by MAFWM management. The project also reinforced the MAFWM Agriculture
Extension Group and initiated an innovative training program working on close
cooperation with USAID to train extension officers in farm management and business
planning. The Project has also supported the establishment of an Agricultural Research
and Extension Council (AREC), which awarded 52 extension service and 24 applied
research contracts to non-public extension service providers with an objective to expand
the network of farm advisors and implement some non-traditional instruments for
transferring knowledge and innovations, such as media, study tours for farmers, farmers
exchange programs, etc.

13. Following the project extension to 15 June 2012, applied research and extension
service grants contracts were extended. However, in all cases, those extensions were for
short periods and provide only limited opportunity to complete project activities, due,
initially, to the delayed assembly of the Agriculture and Research Extension Committee
(AREC) followed by a 20-day lag within the MAFWM in signing annexes to extend
grant contracts, which were finally signed only on 20 April 2012. Of the original 24
applied research grants, 2 were never initiated; 20 were extended; and 2 were not


                                            27
extended due to their completion. Of the 52 approved extension grants, 2 did not sign
contracts; 2 were cancelled prior to the 1st tranche payment; and one at the time of the
2nd tranche payment. Of the remaining 47 grants, 46 have been positively assessed by the
ISAA, which is in charge of coordination, monitoring and evaluation of all extension
work in Serbia; and 27 grants were proposed for extension. This decision was
subsequently confirmed by AREC and 27 extension service grants were extended to 15
May 2012. ISAA evaluated all extension grants following their closure and submitted a
final report on 10 June 2012.

The extension grant program was evaluated by the STAR monitoring and evaluation
contractors. They estimated that a “minimum 2,100 farmers have been involved in the
projects” and that “most of the projects indicate that a minimum of 2,550 farmers are
benefitting from STAR”. In addition, 2,125 processors were determined to have
benefitted from the program. A separate PIT survey of extension grant managers
estimated about 28,000 farmer beneficiaries from the extension grant program. Grant
managers reported a relatively high level of satisfaction with the extension grant program
(see Table 1 below).

For the applied agricultural research projects, the M&E report recorded that 55 new
technologies have been developed and disseminated thanks to the applied research
funding and that a minimum of 1,114 farmers were directly involved in the projects with
a minimum of 1,094 indirect farmer beneficiaries. A further 630 processors participated
in the research, while a minimum of 710 processors benefitted from the project results.
Applied research project managers expressed a high level of satisfaction with the grant
program.

Component 3: Management of the Stara Planina Nature Park
The following items were completedas part of the fourmain project activities under this
component:
Increase populations of endangered breeds of farm animals inside the SPNP
The following breeds were identified as endangered: Domestic Mountain Pony, Balkan
donkey, Busha cattle, Mangalitza pig, group of Zackel sheep breeds (Bardoka Sheep,
Pirot Sheep, Karakachan Sheep and Krivovir Sheep), Balkan goat and Svrljig chicken.
The activities aimed at increasing the number of livestock of rare animal breeds through
grants for interested households and individuals. A total of 66 grants were allocated with
around RSD 36 million (EUR 360,000) of investments. These projects were implemented
in 2010 and 2011.
Management plan for SPNP prepared in participatory manner with communities,
landowners and Srbijašume. The plan for SPNP has been developed by the SPNP
Managing Authority Srbijašume. The plan was adopted in April 2010 by the Ministry of
Spatial Planning and Environment. Visitor Center was constructed in Vrelo locality.
Additional activities include: engagement of 22 rangers, demarcation of border line of
Nature Park core zone and Nature Park border, application for the SP Collective Brand
and application for SP Designation of Biosphere Reserve.

Area of abandoned and degraded meadows/grasslands and pastures restored through local
grants. A total of 49 projects were approved (29% of all approved projects) in the amount
of RSD 24 million (approximately EUR 240,000). In the period June-October 2010,
project team reports that 2,250 ha of pilot pastures (Mucibaba, Vrtibog, Kovacevo,
Ponor) were pastured by 400 livestock units. In 2011 the pilot pastures were pastured
with 532 livestock 8, covering territory of more than 3.000 ha.

Increase in number of RD grants to SPNP municipalities. Within the framework of the
grant program, three funding cycles (call for applications) were launched. In the first two
rounds a total of EUR 1,000,000 was disbursed and the rest (EUR 230,000) was allocated
through a third round. A total of 177 grants were approved in five sub-programs (76 in
the first round, 89 in the second round and 26 in the third round).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic and financial analyses were based on the underlying assumption that the
Project will (i) contribute to the more effective use and absorption of Serbian
Government structural funds for agriculture; (ii) improve farmer access to appropriate
technology, raising the profitability and competitiveness of Serbian agriculture; and (iii)
in the case of the SPNP, pilot profitable conservation-based farming practice having
wider application in Serbia. These assumptions while delayed due to the lapsing
candidacy status still hold substantially true.

Potential benefits stemming from improved payment system PA and MA, Component 1
Approximately 3.5 million US$ have been spent on supporting the PA and MA under the
project. Of course, this does not present the totality of the resources invested, as the EU
and the government both have supported these facilities. As Serbia achieved candidate
status in March 2013, it is estimated it will receive each year € 12 per hectare of
agricultural land in IPARD. This projection is based on the experience of the new
member states, where the average SAPARD/IPARD 9 allocation from 2000 to 2011was €
12.8per hectare of agricultural land which amounts to some EURO 57.0 million
(US$74.0 million) per calendar year. However, recent discussions with the EU seems to
point out a lower per ha level that would amount to around EURO 40.0 million
(US$52.00 million) per annum. The table below assumes that the project investment only
generated 20% of benefits from access to IPARD, and different funding scenarios and
absorption capacities with the resulting Net Present Value and Internal rate of Return
based on 8 year funding cycle from 2014 to 2021 (8 year funding cycle) and a discount
rate of 12%with a continuous staff increase at the Paying Agency to the required levels of
a similarly sized country. The lower end of absorption of 10% is considered an absolute
minimum, and is the critical variable on the economic benefits of this component.
Changes in absorption rates make a dramatic difference on NPV and rate of return. It
needs to be noted that once the Common Agricultural Policy sets in with Serbia’s
membership, these two bodies will continue to generate significant returns.

Potential Benefits from Farmer access to appropriate technology, Component 2.
Some US$ 6.11million were invested under this component. STAR support to the
competitive grant schemes will, sooner or later, materialize into benefits for the farmers
and food processors in Serbia once the dissemination and adoption of the technology and
practices have been absorbed in the sector.. Figures from the Monitoring Evaluation
Report are based on two extreme assessments of the expected impacts. One assessment is
based on sector average productivity in agriculture and food processing and a theoretical
increase in these indicators stemming from the projects for those farmers and food
processors able to take advantage of the project results. The other is based on the
estimates from the project holders, where the project holders have provided STAR PIT
with estimates of the economic benefits from the projects (the so-called cost benefit
tables), when and if the results are disseminated to the sector.

According to the first approach, the total annual expected impact is a growth in GVA of
EUR 3 million and an average of EUR 1 per 1 EUR invested in support to the projects, if
the impacts are generated within one year. If the dissemination period is assumed to be 3
years, the impacts will be EUR 1 million the first year, EUR 2 million the second year
and the full impact will be EUR 3 million the third year. The aggregated contribution to
the GVA will be EUR 6 million over three years, equal to EUR 2 per 1 EUR invested.
Assuming this rate of growth in Gross Value Added is maintained over 20 years and a
discount rate of 12% is assumed the Net Present Value of the investments under this
component amounts to US$ 2,054,853 with an IRR of 17%.

According to the second approach, project beneficiaries provided their own cost benefit
assessment of the project once benefits have been fully absorbed in the sector. Based on
this selection of projects, representing a total of EUR 517,000 in investment support from
STAR, and assuming all other variables to remain constant, the potential benefits in terms
of GVA increase would amount to some EURO 392 million (US$500 million).

The big difference is that the first approach only estimated the benefits for a share of the
farmers and food processors taking advantage from the projects, while this second
approach estimates the full advantage for the sector taking the full production of a given
crop or animal into consideration. There are very big variations from one project to
another, and some of the projects generate very big benefits, which multiplied to full
sector level become quite extraordinary.

Benefits from GEF financing under Component 3

Cost: Total expenditures under the Baseline Scenario were estimated at US$8.85 million,
including US$1.78 million from the Government of Serbia municipal budgets.

Benefits: Implementation of the Baseline Scenarios without GEF funding were expected
to result in only limited protection of biodiversity within the production landscape in and
around Stara Planina and limited integration of environmental sustainability measures
into local agricultural practices.



                                             31
    Many of the initiatives listed under the Baseline Scenario are grant or loan programs for
    rural communities and farmers for basic rural development activities, and are consistent
    with the criteria under Pillar 2 of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However,
    since these programs are essentially demand-driven, the degree to which they will
    support sustainable rural activities such as eco-agriculture, eco-tourism and other
    environmentally-friendly entrepreneurial activities is uncertain. Only very limited
    resources were available, mainly from local NGOs, for public awareness and planning
    activities to strategically guide and assist local stakeholders as they transition to
    environmentally friendly agricultural practices including maintenance of agro-
    biodiversity. The lack of a rural development program with focus on support to less
    favored areas limits the potential impact of the GEF investment. While investments made
    with GEF appear sustainable and benefit from a great level of beneficiary satisfaction the
    lack of a measure in the rural development strategy at present limits the potential offered
    by the project activities to expand.

    Management of the SPNP almost exclusively focused on timber production, with little
    capacity for or investment in ecological management, biodiversity protection or
    monitoring. Thus, under the Baseline Scenario, the valuable landscapes around the
    national park were to continue to be degraded and provide limited environmental benefit
    over the next decade. The adoption of the Management Plan offers basis to take a more
    integrated approach to the management of the SPNP and the surrounding territories.
    However, implementation of the plan requires substantial resources and commitment to a
    broader approach than the narrow focus on resources generating timber production. In an
    environment where forestry services are expected to generate most of their own revenues,
    aligning of the priorities for implementation of a management plan that focuses on
    ecological management and biodiversity protection which is mostly an operational cost is
    not likely to take place unless the services are restructured separating policy and
    enforcement services from revenue generating timber operations and sales.

    The project’s GEF activities were subjected by a STAP review and underwent an
    incremental cost analysis, the matrix of which is attached hereby.

 PARTICIPATING IN A BETTER FUTURE – A VISION FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN
                                  SERBIA

                                  Pirot, 29-31 May, 2013

                 Report from the discussion sessions at the workshop


The workshop was organized to build awareness of current trends in agriculture policy
and rural development especially in the less favored areas and to link it to the current
situation of the Stara planina, challenges and restrictions faced by different stakeholders,
and a vision of strategic action towards improving the rural population’s quality of life in
the future.

Participants have been representatives from various stakeholder groups that have been
involved and/or supported the implementation of the WB STAR project activities, and
the leaders of community initiatives, women and farmer groups, local NGOs and
cooperatives, managers and employees of the as well as the will include community and
youth leaders, women’s organizations, local non-government organizations, municipal
rural development managers, municipal tourism managers, , national technical
institutions (tourism, nature protection, geographic indication, etc.), representatives of
leading private and public companies in S.E Serbia, STAR PIT team… Majority of the
participants had good history of joint cooperation and implementation of the activities
within and beyond STAR project, which contributed to the good exchange and
envisioning the possibilities for the future.

The workshop was organized as two day presentation-information sessions on the policy
framework and financing opportunities for the rural areas in Serbia and in Stara planina
region, which included the experiences from the neighboring EU countries Bulgaria and
Croatia. The time limits conditioned that the group discussion was organized only in two
sessions at the end of the each day, while each of the presentations was followed with
question and answer session.

Upon the presentation of the possibilities for the niche market products – organic
production, geographic indication and tourism, there has been discussion about the on
and off the farm diversification and opportunities for creating a supportive environment
for development of entrepreneurship and cooperation among various stakeholders. The
following ideas have been given:

   •   Initiate and develop stronger connections with “Slow food” movement and explore the
       possibilities to promote and organize the Convivium for some of the Stara planina
       products




                                             37
   •   work on direct marketing and strengthening the consumer understanding on the values of
       the products from Stara planina,
   •   transform know how and experiences from other successful cases such as German “Unser
       land” trademark that supports the market position of the producers from the mountainous
       areas of Bavaria.
   •   Support measures to establish further processing of the organic milk and meat and
       establish organic diary and meat processing workshops and small scale production;
   •   use local market for promotion of good quality food (including neighboring bigger
       cities);
   •   support livestock farmers to increase size of their flocks and improve or preserve generic
       properties of the animals, and therefore create more milk and meat for further processing.
   •   establish cooperation between producers and processors based on the experiences of
       other GI value chains such as those functioning in Switzerland, EU etc.
   •   explore the potential for crossborder cooperation between the producers and associations
       of similar products or product groups;
   •   strengthen the position of the education and training and use the existing Diary
       production vocational school as unique point in the Serbian secondary education system
       to help preservation of good quality diary, meat and baking products and to position as a
       leader in traditional and quality food vocational training;
   •   initiate regional coalition of various traditional products in the region that could help to
       promote the “regional basket of products” elsewhere. The certification sign “Stara
       planina” is a good initiative to follow and to expand to food products as well;
   •   initiate association of “brands” of South Eastern Serbia and base it in Pirot, to link and
       establish cooperation between all registered GI products in the wider region;
   •   build coalition of ten (or similar) municipalities with the most prominent GI products that
       would promote the marketing of those products through large supply chains and
       supermarkets.
   •   Initiatecooperation and support of the Ministry of Agriculture to create the platform of
       various stakeholders.
   •   Base it on strong producer involvement and cooperation.


The understanding between the participants was that the processes last too long, however
that similar situation is in the other countries and that building successful coalitions needs
a lot of commitment and time.

Minutes from the last session of the WB Pirot workshop

 The objective of the final workshop session was to initiate discussion related to the
vision for joint regional development, regarding selection of topics/areas for development
and stakeholders/coalitions to be addressing these priorities.




                                               38
To make the best use of the limited time, the participants were asked to fill in the
questionnaire that would help in prioritization of the development issues and sectors by
two criteria:
    •   measuring the progress comparing to other regions in Serbia;
    •   measuring the importance of the topic, sector for the regional development

Out of 11 development areas the following results were obtained:

Figure 1: Ranking of development priorities with comparing results on the national level




                                                    39
The results of this survey show that the protected natural resources are considered as the
biggest asset and the most important development potential for the region, followed by
the premium quality food products.

At the same time Cooperation and associations of producers are considered as one of the
most important (rank 2) but with the worst achievements comparing to the rest of the
country. Low ranking of development themes such as entrepreneurship, institutions,
tourism was discussed in the group in order to understand the logics and reasons behind,
and the group has agreed that the balanced development of all is necessary. Two
workgroups were formed in order to collect the ideas for actions – a group on
environmental resources for sustainable development and agriculture and food products.


Group 1: Agriculture and quality food products

Members of the group have offered ideas regarding innovation and transfer of new
knowledge as well as increase of competitiveness as according to the EU policy axes.

Support to competitiveness:

   •   increase of volumes in meat and dairy production
   •   support to small processing units on farms (where the role of local authorities was seen as
       particularly important ) in particular in diary sector, bee keeping and fruit production
   •   reconstruction and reactivation of existing deteriorated premises (processing and storage)
   •   planning livestock production and fruit production (berries)
   •   support to innovation in investments (such as electrical fences or milking units)
   •   coordination of priorities for the existing local agricultural funds

In addition the following areas were proposed for support:




                                               40
Group 2: Protected environment as resource for economic activities

1. Support to nature protection through research and analysis to establish grounds for
sustainable use of resources and development with:
   -   analysis of the status of the natural and semi natural systems in relation to sustainable
       development
   -   organizing field research and activities for research and academia (biologists, nature
       protection workers, foresters etc..)
   -   Study for development of entrepreneurship in the Nature park area, by using “clean
       technologies”
   -   monitoring of environment (air, water, soil) as well as population of plant and animal
       species and their habitats

through nature protection
   -   creation of eco tourism offer to generate income for the activities in protecting local
       biodiversity
   -   introduction of species of large herbivores to preserve the biological and landscape
       diversity and
   -   aesthetic values of the Nature park and to increase touristic values and interest
   -   reintroduction of vultures (Gyps fulvus)

2. Support to education and information with
   -   Collection and promotion of best practices in function of further investments in the
       agriculture, construction, tourism, etc., in the Nature park
   -   Building capacities for the management of the Nature park: education, equipment,
       infrastructure, network development of training modules for private forest owners for
       improvement of forest management
   -   lobbing and advocacy on integration of environmental concerns in development
       processes
   -   promotion of obligatory “schools in nature” or other forms of environmental education
       for allages (from elementary school onwards)

3. Intensified communication about natural resources and their values
   -   web site about Stara planina Nature park, natural values, touristic attractions, business
       opportunities, cultural heritage
   -   Traffic signalization and hiking signalization with touristic information: android
       application and promotion of touristic potentials and offer through internet.
   -   work with local population on raising awareness of the natural resources, promote
       voluntary activities, and voluntary ranger service

4. infrastructure improvements
   -   better waste management infrastructure in the region
   -   establishment of early warning system for control of forest fires (and also education to
       the local population for the threats of illegal fire)




                                                41
   -   improvement of paths and rest areas for mountaineers, hikers, campers in order to
       preserve natural habitats and prevent disturbance of species, but also to provide access to
       the natural values

5. promotion of sustainable business
   -   in agriculture: promotion of organic agriculture, introduction of growing of medicinal
       herbs (education for sustainable collection from the nature),
   -   in energy: small scale renewable energy sources – biomass, solar,
   -   tourism: promotion of standardization of touristic offer through seal “Stara planina”,
       SAVE touristic offer (Scientific Academic Voluntary Environment)

Both groups have agreed that there is need to continue or initiate work on:
   -   cooperation and networking of various stakeholders to support local initiatives and create
       broad consensus is essential;
   -   identification of local leaders and supporting their teamwork as local motivators and
       community developers;
   -   initiating a pool of local volunteers for the protection and promotion of Stara planina
       values in local communities and elsewhere;
   -   jointly and systematically work on establishing LAG Stara planina based on the existing
       partnerships – Forum for Stara planina and Association for the promotion of certification
       seal “Stara planina”

Conclusion:
In terms of group dynamics and cohesion, there is need of further support of the
processes that would give mandate to each involved stakeholder in joined development
efforts and promote culture of cooperation. Nature resources at most, and to some extent
human resources are recognized as a valuable asset, however their linking and
synergizing seen as weak point. Still, many of the success stories and best practices were
shared during the workshop, valid for other similar regions in Serbia, and that could add
to the confidence and motivation of the group. Some of the unique features are the results
of the STAR project (efforts made in the area of nature management, rural tourism
development, development of quality schemes) could be recognized in a wider national
network and further improved. The initiatives of cooperation through Forum for Stara
planina and Association for the promotion of certification seal “Stara planina” should be
further strengthened.

The issue of leadership and motivation are the important ones for the participants group–
the first in endorsing the local leaders and opinion makers through joint vision and
cooperation and the second in developing the self-confidence and power to take
meaningful role in the development of the region. Though state structures and local
governance were often identified as the main leading force, it is the people of the region
who have the ideas and drive to see the Stara planina region thrive. This workshop was a
good tool to build this self-esteem and recognize good work done, as well as to envisage
bricks for the future actions.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The STAR project was planned to start in July 2007 after the signing of the loan
documents between the IBRD and the GoS, but the process of the national parliamentary
ratification of the loan documents caused a 1½ year delay in the launch of the project.
Consequently, the STAR project was initiated in November 2008 with a budget of
EUR 12.50 million in loan capital from IBRD and USD 5 million (approximately
EUR 3.22 million) in grant from the GEF to component 3. The total budget was
EUR 15.72 million. After cancellations of EURO 2.3 million in February of 2012, and
EURO 2.2 million remaining unspent at closing, project resources amounted to EURO
11.2 million.

The STAR project had the aim to achieve several important development objectives
through combining institutional capacity building, knowledge generation and
dissemination and direct investment support:
(i)     to increase the efficiency and transparency of public funds use (structural support
for agriculture and rural development) through European Union (EU) pre-accession and,
eventually, Common Agriculture Program (CAP) funding mechanisms;
(ii)    to enhance the competitiveness of Serbian agricultural products in local, regional
and international (particularly EU) markets, thereby increasing rural incomes and
strengthening rural economies; and
(iii) to preserve biodiversity in natural and agri-ecosystems and promote sustainable
land use through reinforcement of traditional agriculture and cultural practices in
ecologically fragile areas.

STAR project consists out of 4 Components, each with a number of specific objectives:
Component 1: Strengthening the Agriculture and Rural Development Support System
Component 2: Building Knowledge and Capacity of Agricultural Producers and
  Processors
Component 3: Management of the Stara Planina Nature Park
Component 4: Project Management and Coordination

Relevance of the project
Support under component 1aimed at build-up of Managing Authority and Paying Agency
(Directorate of Agrarian Payments) was very relevant at the STAR program level, where
the overall objective was to strengthen the agricultural and rural development support
system. No MA and PA were in place in 2007 and 2008 and these institutions were
urgently needed to support the development of the sector and to facilitate EU accession.

Regarding component 2 it is concluded that the support to the competitive grant schemes
and the training activities were highly relevant taking into account the identified needs in
Serbia in 2007 with a weak extension service, low competiveness and low profitability in
Serbian agriculture. Interviews with different stakeholders and project holders (applied
research and extension service grant schemes) indicate that the STAR program was and
still is highly relevant. The agricultural sector and the extension service in Serbia are still
facing huge challenges and therefore the need to strengthen and build up capacity in the



                                              43
sector and among the extension service providers. Yet on the other hand it may be put
into question, if all the selected and supported projects are sufficiently relevant and
fulfilling the project development objectives of component 2. For instance it can be
discussed whether all supported information and media projects as well as some of the
softer strategy-oriented projects are relevant.

Regarding extension training under component 2, it is obvious that the participants have
gained a lot of knowledge from participating in the training, and that the training topics
were considered to be relevant for an individual trainee. More than 80% of the trainees
have responded that the training met the current training needs of their clients, thus
making it very useful for them.

Results and impacts
In conclusion for component 1, the results of the STAR support to the MA and the PA
relate to the utilization of deliverables in order to prepare the structures and procedures
for a new effective support system for agriculture and rural development. All deliverables
in terms of furniture, cars, IT equipment and technical assistance including training from
international and national experts have contributed positively in preparation for the
formation of MA and PA, but it must also be concluded that the STAR support has not
been decisive in the process of building up the MA and the PA.

The conclusions regarding results and impacts from component 2 support are summarized
here, first for agricultural extension projects and then for applied agricultural research
projects.

Regarding agricultural extension projects, the number of farmersi nvolved per project is
for the majority of projects above 50 farmers. It can be calculated that minimum 2,100
farmers have been involved in the projects. Beside this, most of the projects indicate that
minimum 2,550 farmers are benefitting from STAR. It is in itself a big number given the
small number of projects, but it is still a small number of farmers compared to the total
number of households in Serbian agriculture.

The number of processors involved directly in the projects is minimum 1,750, while
minimum of 2,125 processors have benefitted in total.
The project holders also summarize positive results and impacts in terms of the following
topics, where the percentage inferred in brackets indicates the share of the project holders,
who agree with positive results and impacts under each topic:

   •   New ideas for product and technology development (83%)
   •   Increased competences of farmers (82%)
   •   Increased possibilities to cooperate with other institutions (76%)
   •   Increased cooperation with farmers (73%)
   •   Increased farm income (67%)
   •   Larger networks (61%)
   •   Increased productivity through more effective production methods (61%)
   •   Increased interest in rural development by media (59%)


                                            44
   •   Increased local rural development capacities (56%)

The conclusions are positive and that is that supported projects to a large extent
contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the farmers involved in and benefitting
from the project results. The projects contribute to meeting the objectives of the
component and of the STAR project.

Regarding applied agricultural research projects, it is indicated by the project holders that
55 new technologies have been developed and disseminated thanks to funding from the
STAR project. Furthermore, a minimum of 1,114 farmers are involved in the projects
according to responses received by the project holders, and a minimum of 1,094 farmers
benefits from the projects. The numbers of processors involved and benefitting from the
projects are 630 processors, while minimum 710 processors are benefitting from the
project results. Again, it can be concluded, that it is in itself a big number from the small
number of applied research projects, but it is a small number of farmers compared to the
total number of farms in Serbian agriculture.

The project holders also summarize positive results and impacts in terms of the following
topics, where the percentage inferred in bracket in the same way as above indicate the
share of the project holders, who agree with positive results and impacts under each
topic:

   •   New ideas for product and technology development (100%)
   •   Cooperation with other institutions (90%)
   •   Quality of products (90%)
   •   Increase in competences and in farm income (85%)
   •   Knowledge of more effective production methods (85%)
   •   Knowledge on sustainable agriculture (70%)
   •   Larger network (70%)

The applied research projects also contribute to creating jobs, although at a small scale.
In total the project holders expect that 139 people will be able to keep their jobs due the
STAR project, while 59 jobs will be created indirectly as a result of the STAR project.
Regarding extension training, participants of various training modules have experienced
an increase in their knowledge and capacity in relation to ‘farm management knowledge’.
All said they had a ‘good’ knowledge level as minimum after attending the training, and a
number of those who have an ‘excellent’ knowledge has increased from 7% to 39%. For
most participants the training modules were positive experience in terms of being
involved in the discussions during the training course. 49% said they could participate
‘excellent’ on all the important issues during the training course. “The relationship
between theory and practical application” within the training modules is assessed to be
‘good’ to ‘very good’ for most of the participants (71%).

Only very few respondents found that the training modules did not have any impacts on
the factors listed below. In contrast, the majority found that the training modules are
contributing and benefitting to the listed factors.


                                             45
The same situation is summarized below. The majority either ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’
that the trainings are contributing to:
         • increases my focus and knowledge on sustainable agriculture

Finally, 53% of the trainees found that the training module on “Farm management” had
the greatest impact or importance to their work. This topic is followed by the issue
“European Integration” (26%) and the issue “Counselling skills” (37%) as the third most
important impact.
In total it can be concluded that the results and impacts of the support from STAR under
component 2 contributes in itself to good project results, involving and benefitting
relatively big number of farmers and processors, and representing an appropriate effort
regarding development and dissemination of new technologies. The capacity building of
the extension service is absolutely also an important result of the project.
On the other hand the effort is too limited and the results are too few to change the
situation in Serbian agriculture radically. A much more devoted national effort is needed
making national and EU co-funded support available for farmers and processors at a
higher level than seen today. The support systems are under construction (MA and PA)
and these systems need to have practical experience with EU compliant interventions in
order to develop the procedures in an effective and efficient way also demonstrating good
administrative practice. Any future intervention based on grant support should as a
consequence be based on the criteria outlined in relevant EU regulations.

Component 3 was designed to provide targeted technical and material assistance to
Srbijašume and local communities to improve both the management of the SPNP and the
capacity to use its natural resources in environmentally sustainable and profitable ways.
In the Stara Planina area EUR 1.2 million was to be provided as competitive grants to
support the global objectives of promoting sustainable land use (particularly well-
managed extensive grazing), ecological restoration, sustainable rural tourism and related
enterprises, and preservation of natural and agro-biodiversity, including using the
LEADER approach where appropriate. Another important element of this component is
the preservation of autochthonous livestock varieties, which represent an important
genetic (agro-biodiversity) heritage.
There were 4 outcome indicators:

    1. Outcome Indicator 1: Increase populations of endangered breeds of farm animals
        inside the SPNP
The following breeds were identified as endangered: Domestic Mountain Pony, Balkan
donkey, Busha cattle, Mangalitza pig, group of Zackel sheep breeds (Bardoka Sheep,
Pirot Sheep, Karakachan Sheep and Krivovir Sheep), Balkan goat and Svrljig chicken.
The activities aimed at increasing the number of livestock of rare animal breeds through
grants for interested households and individuals. A total of 66 grants were allocated with



                                            46
around RSD 36 million (EUR 360,000) of investments. These projects were implemented
in 2010 and 2011.

    2. Outcome Indicator 2: Management plan for SPNP prepared in participatory
       manner with communities, landowners and Srbijašume
Management plan for SPNP has been developed by the SPNP Managing Authority
Srbijašume. The plan was adopted in April 2010 by the Ministry of Spatial Planning and
Environment. Visitor Center was constructed in Vrelo locality. Additional activities
include: engagement of 22 rangers, demarcation of border line of Nature Park core zone
and Nature Park border, application for the SP Collective Brand and application for SP
Designation of Biosphere Reserve.

    3. Outcome Indicator 3: Area of abandoned and degraded meadows/grasslands and
        pastures restored
Pasture restoration was achieved through local grants. A total of 49 projects were
approved (29% of all approved projects) in the amount of RSD 24 million (approximately
EUR 240,000). In the period June-October 2010, project team reports that 2,250 ha of
pilot pastures (Mucibaba, Vrtibog, Kovacevo, Ponor) were pastured by 400 livestock
units. In 2011 the pilot pastures were pastured with 532 livestock, covering territory of
more than 3.000 ha.

    4. Outcome Indicator 4: Increase in number of RD grants to SPNP municipalities for
        targeted activities
Within the framework of the grant program, three funding cycles (call for applications)
were launched. In the first two rounds a total of EUR 1,000,000 was disbursed and the
rest (EUR 230,000) was allocated through a third round. A total of 177 grants were
approved in five sub-programs (76 in the first round, 89 in the second round and 26 in the
third round).

The conclusion is that the interventions under component 3 have contributed to the
fulfillment of several of the objectives of the component. The Increase in the local
populations of autochtonous livestock breeds is fulfilling the set target, while the area of
restored grassland only is 80% of the defined target. On the other hand a management
plan is prepared for the SPNP and support has been provided for a number of rural
development projects including those providing support to animals and pastures,
processing facilities, but also to rural tourism projects.
Also a number of infrastructure projects is under implementation in 2012 also
contributing to the improvement of the quality of life in the area, with improved road
access and bridge access to remote villages, better management of water supply, waste
water and sewage as well as solid waste management.
The targeted support has proven to be useful for the local community and the
implementation has demonstrated how difficult it is to operate with targeted support in
remote areas like SPNP. The lessons learned from the implementation of the component
are useful for future interventions.

Expected impact



                                             47
STAR support to the competitive grant schemes has been an important part of the
program, and the support will sooner or later materialize into benefits for the farmers and
food processors in Serbia.
We have in this report provided two assessments of the expected impacts. One
assessment is based on sector average productivity in agriculture and food processing and
a theoretical determined increase in these indicators stemming from the projects for those
farmers and food processors able to take advantage of the project results. The other is
based on the estimates from the project holders, where the project holders have provided
STAR PIT with estimates of the economic benefits from the projects (the so-called cost
benefit tables), when and if the results are disseminated to the sector.

According to the first approach, the total annual expected impact is a growth in GVA of
EUR 3 million and an average of 1 euro per 1 euro invested in support to the projects, if
the impacts are generated within one year, equal to 3 euro per euro over three years. If the
dissemination period is assumed to be 3 years, the impacts will be EUR 1 million the first
year, EUR 2 million the second year and the full impact will be EUR 3 million the third
year. The aggregated contribution to the GVA will be EUR 6 million over three years,
equal to 2 euro per 1 euro invested.
         According to the second approach, the selected projects represent a total of EUR
517,000 in investment support from STAR, and EUR 392 million in potential benefits in
terms of GVA increase, all other factors kept constant. The benefit per euro in STAR
support is EUR 597. This is much higher than estimated with the first approach.
         The big difference is that the first approach only estimated the benefits for a share
of the farmers and food processors taking advantage from the projects, while the second
approach estimates the full advantage for the sector taking the full production of a given
crop or animal into consideration. There are very big variations from one project to
another, and some of the projects indicate to generate very big benefits, which multiplied
to full sector levels are extraordinary. In general improved agricultural practice, including
better use of pesticides and improved yields seem to be the key to better results. In wine
production (table grapes and grapes for wine) and in field crops, such as maize, the
potentials are big, due to the high scale of production.
Under the Component 3, The grants had positive impact on the income of the
beneficiaries. As reported in the survey, 68% of the recipients record increase in income,
21% do not report, while 5% does not know. However, when it comes to the assessment
of the increase in income, results tend to be less conclusive: 42% of respondents claim
increase in up to 50%, 16% more, while as much as 42% of respondents did not answer.
Furthermore, only 10% of respondents claim that the grants led to creation of new jobs.
Apparently, the greatest impact has been recorded vis-à-vis endangered breeds, where
42% of respondents claim there has been an increase in the number of these animals.
Slightly less favorable results have been noted while assessing impact of grants on the
number of tourist and grassland areas.15 communal infrastructural projects were
proposed for realization and the final list was approved at the end of December 2011.
Communal infrastructural projects were proposed by local communities of Senokos,
Dojkinci, Gostuša and Municipalities of Pirot and Dimitrovgrad and approved by SPAC.
All works on projects were finalized by May 30, 2013.

Recommendations
Component1 and 2:
   • The evaluation demonstrates the need for training of 1) extension service
     advisors, 2) beneficiaries as well as 3) ministerial and municipality staff in the
     importance of identifying environmental indicators, in understanding the
     importance hereof, and how to measure and report on these indicators. The
     environmental assessment approach is essential in the view of the IPARD, where
     fulfillments of EU requirements related to environment and nature protection are
     among the most important requirements. The competences and the understanding
     are therefore extremely important. It is thus highly recommended to organize
     training within the field.
   • It is recommended to assess the currently used project evaluation and selection
     criteria in order to streamline them to EU requirements where relevant. It is also
     important to consider eligibility, ranking and selection criteria contributing to
     increased additionality of projects and to reduce deadweight loss.
   • Furthermore, today relatively many projects are supporting media companies and
     mass communication towards farmers about e.g. good agricultural practice and
     use of modern technologies. This type of project is relevant in order to reach a
     large number of potential users of the information, but it is very difficult to ensure
     an appropriate uptake of knowledge among farmers from TV programs only.
     More effort should be put on extension service as the main channel for
     dissemination of knowledge to farmers.
   • In prolongation of this, it is difficult to assess these media projects in terms of
     results and effects. It is for instance difficult to assess if a TV program about good
     agricultural practice will change practice and procedures at farm level, and it must
     be considered difficult for farmers to absorb new knowledge from TV alone
     without the hands on advice from extension service providers.
   • Feedback received from the extension service advisors during training sessions
     tells, that the trainees are very much interested in acquiring hands-on experiences
     through the training. It is therefore recommended that future training is less
     theoretical and more practical oriented providing the advisors with more hands on
     experiences, which they better can pass on to the farmers.
   • The current distinction between the Applied Agricultural Research projects and
     Extension Service Grant Scheme in practical terms is not that obvious. This is
     also noted by some of the peer reviewers, who furthermore found that scientific
     level was relatively low in the applied agricultural research projects. Here of
     course there is a choice to be made. The scientific level of the current projects is
     relatively low, but on the other hand the supported projects reach and include
     many farmers making the projects user-friendly in their approach. It is, however,
     recommended that STAR PIT considers, which types of projects, it wishes to
     support in the future. Where in the value chain should the focus be:
     Research/science oriented projects not involving many farmers and advisors, or
     practical oriented projects, which include more advisors and farmers?!
   • Training of farmers and extension service providers is generally needed to
     enhance the human capital and to facilitate the access to support schemes like the



                                            49
       grant schemes under component 2 and 3, but also national support schemes that
       are currently in the process of implementation.
Regarding information to potential beneficiaries, it must be taken into consideration that
many potential beneficiaries in remote rural areas do not have internet access, do not
watch TV programs or read newspapers. Alternative more direct information activities
are needed in order to make sure that the potential beneficiaries are informed. Here the
extension service advisors from the agricultural stations are relevant as kitchen table
advisors coming directly to the farmhouse.

Component 3
  • It is important that big national interventions are anchored sufficiently in the
     MAFWM from the very beginning and that the objectives of the project/ program
     is seen in context with the overall agricultural policy of the country. In case of
     STAR component 3, it had no impact on the anchoring that the country has a
     priority for EU accession and that the intervention also should contribute to the
     build-up of competencies and capacities to manage the challenges stemming from
     the accession process. It has not been considered in the implementation of the
     activities that the project should contribute to this overall objective. Instead the
     project has suffered from sub-optimal activities within each of the components,
     including component 3, leaving aside potential synergies internally within STAR
     and externally in relation to other national interventions.
  • Implementation of the grant schemes is accomplished without cooperation with
     the Directorate for Agrarian Payments (PA) and the MA. It can be concluded that
     the component 3 interventions are only very loosely anchored, if at all, in the
     MAFWM and the PA and the MA and for future interventions this should be
     avoided.
  • The implementation is not in line with EU procedures, and for future
     interventions these procedures should be applied.
  • The grant scheme under component 3 has demonstrated that it is possible to
     recruit farmers in mountain areas to invest in grazing of mountain pastures, which
     otherwise would not have been grazed and therefore would have been covered
     with shrubs and semi forests representing a loss of biodiversity. This lesson can
     be used in future interventions.
  • With the grant scheme for grassing of rare animals, it is succeeded to increase the
     number of autochthonous species, the area of mountain pastures under
     management and the biodiversity is improved (plants, birds, animals) and the
     farmers have attained an increased income from milk from the autochthonous
     animals, sheep in particular.
  • Use of organic production as a ranking criteria in the selection of projects has
     caused an increased interest from farmers in converting to organic production,
     supported in 2010 per hectare and per animal.
  • Financial engineering instruments are needed in order to loosen the liquidity
     squeeze the farmers are in, due to lack of collateral and difficulties is obtaining
     bank credits. Advance payments, guarantee funds and high aid intensities are
     needed, and a balance between EU requirements and national designs is needed.
