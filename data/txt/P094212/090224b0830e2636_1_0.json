Life is coming back\n            to Gostusha, a village on Serbia\u2019s famous Old Mountain.\n            Until recently, Gostusha was fading away, the village\u2019s\n            traditional architecture and way of life vanishing, taking a\n            piece of Serbia\u2019s heritage with them. With support from the\n            World Bank, the Serbian Government is offering small grants,\n            tempting people back to deserted villages. Tourism in\n            Gostusha, Senokos, and Dojkinci are helping do that. Through\n            farming and tourism, the grants aim to bring life back to\n            these lovely hills and pastures. The project also finances\n            small repairs to roads and other infrastructure, as well as\n            trails for hiking and biking. Up on Old Mountain\u2019s pastures,\n            the animals are coming back, too. The land here was once\n            famous for its cattle. Now farmers are investing in rare\n            breeds, and once-neglected pastures are being used once\n            again. Water buffalo, mountain ponies, Busha cattle, and\n            donkeys are once more grazing this land. Serbian officials\n            want the region to catch up with European agricultural\n            standards. Grant money is used for the production of\n            renowned local cheeses, for wool manufacturing, and for the\n            sustainable management of Old Mountain\u2019s abundant natural resources."}, "docdt": "2012-10-05T09:00:02Z"}
