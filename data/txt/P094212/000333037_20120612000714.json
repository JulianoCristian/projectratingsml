The\n            Ministry of Agriculture, Trade, Forestry and Water\n            Management (MATFWM) has now made great efforts, following\n            Serbia acquiring an European Union (EU) candidate country\n            status in March 2012, to improve its rural development\n            programming (RDP) and payment system (PA) by establishing an\n            authority to manage the RDP and building the capacity of the\n            PA staff to process agriculture payments in an EU compliant\n            manner. The project-funded training program for extension\n            service providers was expanded from 250 to 1,800 farm\n            advisors since November 2011. Critical investments in\n            community infrastructure in remote rural areas supported by\n            GEF under the Project have been initiated and contribute to\n            improved accessibility of rural tourism ventures.  After a\n            project stalemate in early 2011 caused by changes in key\n            leadership within the MATFWM, project performance has\n            notably improved with all actions met in the action plan\n            agreed with the Bank. Consequently, project disbursements\n            improved substantially, and currently stand at 71 percent\n            and 64 percent for the International Bank for Reconstruction\n            and Development, or IBRD loan and GEF grant, respectively.\n            This represents a 23 and 25 percentage point increase in\n            disbursements for the IBRD loan and GEF grant, respectively,\n            since the last implementation support mission conducted in\n            May 2012. This will be the second extension of the project,\n            with both extensions totaling 9 months. There are no overdue\n            audits and previous audit reports have been found\n            satisfactory to the Bank. Overall financial management is\n            rated satisfactory."}, "docdt": "2012-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
