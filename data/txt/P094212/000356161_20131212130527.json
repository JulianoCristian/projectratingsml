moderately unsatisfactory; GEO outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Risk\n            to GEO outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the Bank\n            needs a clearly agreed vision when negotiating a project.\n            While project preparation took nearly 2.5 years in the end\n            there was considerable pressure to deliver in the given\n            fiscal year. In a political environment as dynamic as\n            Serbia's the frequent change of TTLs may not have given\n            the project the attention and management continuity required\n            for a strong dialogue and successful implementation.\n            Agricultural and rural development policy within the\n            European Union (EU) neighborhood is largely determined by\n            the EU who is the largest donor and policy influence to the\n            sector while the Bank plays a complementary role only. The\n            Bank needs to better assess the risk of engaging in\n            institutional capacity building in the agricultural sector\n            in pre-accession countries given that perspectives of\n            readiness towards a candidate State can change for reasons\n            extraneous to the sector or the project."}, "docdt": "2013-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
