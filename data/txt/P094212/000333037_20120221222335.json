The project is currently rated\n            moderately unsatisfactory for progress towards achievement\n            of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and moderately\n            satisfactory for overall implementation progress. However,\n            in view of recent demonstrated implementation progress, an\n            upgrade of these indicators is expected to be conducted\n            following the next implementation support mission\n            (tentatively April 2012).  This is a noteworthy development\n            since, in the first three years following approval, the\n            project had suffered severe delays, including a 16-month\n            effectiveness delay, and disbursed only 6 percent of the\n            loan.  Following a mixed implementation history between\n            mid-2010 and mid-2011, project performance has meanwhile\n            vastly improved, with all actions met in an action plan\n            agreed with the Bank, and having laid the foundation for the\n            December 2011 extension of the project closing date to June\n            15, 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
