                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final Project Implementation Status Report. The Project's Development Objective (PDO) has been only partially met, thus the overall progress toward enhancing the
                         competitiveness of Serbian agriculture is moderately unsatisfactory. In spite of the challenges faced by the Project, it has achieved the following: (i) a paying agency has been
                         established, equipped and trained, currently undergoing a self-assessment process as part of the EU accreditation process, but it does not yet disburse rural development funds in
                         accordance with EU-compliant procedures; (ii) a small managing authority has been re-established, after multiple changes in its staff, physical location and organizational structure,
                         and although under-resourced, it has a clear work program to develop a rural development strategy compliant with the EU Instruments of Pre-Accession Assistance for Rural
                         Development (IPARD) by end-2013; (iii) research and extension grants were delivered, of which a substantial number provide a good basis for further technology dissemination; and
                         (iv) the extension agents (both public and private) have undergone an extensive training program which has substantially strengthened the capacity of advisory services.

                         Concerning GEF objective (GEO) to conserve globally important ecosystems, the areas under ecological management and/or restoration within the Stara Planina Nature Park and
                         surrounding area have been expanded by: i) reversing the trends in pasture degradation, and depopulation and loss of rare breeds; ii) expanding organic agriculture production; iii)
                         developing and implementing the Management Plan for the Nature Park (plan was developed in participatory manner), with a partial monitoring plan implemented by Srbijashume
                         (Nature Park Management Authority) for forests, water, fishery and endangered species, but monitoring of pastures is still lacking. The Nature Park is currently in the accreditation
                         process for the UN network for biosphere reserves, and the Stara Planina name obtained a protected geographical indication certificate. A number of small grants for rural tourism
                         have been implemented and the number of visitors to the region is growing thus providing livelihood to the residents of the region. The renewed interest in livestock holding, with
                         several young farmers increasing their flocks after having benefited from support to improve farming facilities through the grant program, is contributing to the sustainability of pasture
                         lands and will mitigate the overgrowth of brush in the region.

                         In September 2012 a further project closing date extension was sought and obtained, with May 31, 2013 established as the new closing date. The objective of the extension was to
                         consolidate the achievements under the GEF-funded activities.
