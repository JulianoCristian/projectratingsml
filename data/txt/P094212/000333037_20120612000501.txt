                   LOAN 7465-YF AND TF90454

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing dates for Serbia, Transitional Agriculture Reform Project, Loan 7465-
YF, P094212, and Serbia, Transitional Agriculture Reform GEF Project, TF90454,
P093545, will be extended from June 15, 2012 until September 30, 2012.

2.      The Project has made significant progress toward the Project Development
Objectives over the last six months. The Ministry of Agriculture, Trade, Forestry and
Water Management (MATFWM) has now made great efforts, following Serbia acquiring
an EU Candidate Country Status in March 2012, to improve its rural development
programming (RDP) and payment system (PA) by establishing an authority to manage
the RDP and building the capacity of the PA staff to process agriculture payments in an
EU compliant manner. The Project-funded training program for extension service
providers was expanded from 250 to 1,800 farm advisors since November 2011. Critical
investments in community infrastructure in remote rural areas supported by GEF under
the Project have been initiated and contribute to improved accessibility of rural tourism
ventures. After a project stalemate in early 2011 caused by changes in key leadership
within the MATFWM, project performance has notably improved with all actions met in
the action plan agreed with the Bank. Consequently, Project disbursements improved
substantially, and currently stand at 71 percent and 64 percent for the IBRD loan and
GEF grant, respectively. This represents a 23 and 25 percentage point increase in
disbursements for the IBRD loan and GEF grant, respectively, since the last
implementation support mission conducted in May 2012.

3.      The project is currently rated as Moderately Satisfactory for progress towards
achievement of the project development objective (PDO) and global environmental
objective (GEO), and for overall implementation progress. The proposed extension is
necessary to allow the project to fully benefit from investments that have been initiated,
but are currently at risk of not being completed within the current closing date of June 15,
2012. Those are mainly investments in construction works under the small community
infrastructure projects, which started with a delay due to an unusually harsh winter in the
Balkan Region. There will be no new activities initiated under the Project within the
extended implementation period. While this extension would not allow the project to
fully meet the PDO and GEO, it would substantially increase implementation progress
and progress towards reaching the objectives. The Borrower and the Bank have agreed
on an action plan to complete these activities by the proposed new closing date of
September 30, 2012.

4.      The extension would also allow continued Bank assistance to the government
until the European Union’s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance for Rural
Development (IPARD) Program is approved. During this period, the Bank and the
government will continue its joint investment needs assessment that will define an

                                             1
Agriculture and Rural Development Project for the second half of the current Country
Partnership Strategy (FY12-15).

5.    This will be the second extension of the project, with both extensions totaling 9
months.

6.      There are no overdue audits and previous audit reports have been found
satisfactory to the Bank. Overall financial management is rated Satisfactory.
