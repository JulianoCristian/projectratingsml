                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall progress against the objective to enhance the competitiveness of Serbian Agriculture the following achievements to date are noted - in spite of a very difficult environment
                         with the investments under the project (i) a paying agency has been established, equipped and trained, (ii) after a lot of challenges a small managing authority has been
                         reestablished that will require continued capacity building before it will be able to program EU- compliant rural development plans, (iii) research and extension grants were delivered
                         of which a substantial number providing a good basis for further dissemination, (iv) a number of training programs for extension agents especially as it relates to business planning
                         and business management have been delivered strengthening the capacity of advisory services.

                         As it relates to the GEF objective to conserve globally important eco systems - the Stara Planina national park is in process of UN certification UNESCO biosphere reserve, a number
                         of small grants for rural tourism have been implemented and the number of visitors to the region is growing thus providing a livelihood to the residents of the region. There is renewed
                         interest in livestock holding, with several young farmers increasing their flocks after having benefited from support to improve farming facilities thus contributing that will contribute to
                         the sustainability of pasture lands and mitigate the overgrowth of brush in the region.

                         In September 2012 a further project closing date extension was sought and obtained with May 31, 2013 established as the new closing date to consolidate the achievements made
                         so far under the project mainly as it relates to the GEF activities.
