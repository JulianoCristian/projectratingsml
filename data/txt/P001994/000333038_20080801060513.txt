    IEGWB Mission:Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensurethe integrityof the Bank`sself-evaluationprocess and to verifythat the Bank'swork is producingthe expected
results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawnfrom experience. As part of thiswork, IEGWBannually assessesabout 25 percent.ofthe Bank'slendingoperations
through fieldwork. Inselecting operations for assessment, preference is givento those that are innovative, large,or
complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; thosefor which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likelyto generateimportantlessons.
     To prepare a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents, interviewoperational staff, visit the borrowing country to discussthe operationwith the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bankstaff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand in local
offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attached to the
documentthat is sent to the Bank`s Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has beensent to the
Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multipleevaluation methodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, projectdesign, or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their
project ratings. Followingis the definitionand rating scale usedfor each evaluation criterion (additional informationis
availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes relevance
of objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project`s objectivesare
consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporategoals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which the project's design is
consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacyis the extent to which the project`s objectiveswere achieved,or are
expectedto be achieved, taking into account their relativeimportance.Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved,or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capitaland benefitsat least cost
comparedto alternatives.The efficiencydimensiongenerally is not appliedto adjustment operations. Possibleratings
for Outcome: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, ModeratelyUnsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or expected
outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized).Possibleratings for Risk to Development Outcome: HighSignificant,
Moderate,Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
     BankPerformance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(including ensuring adequatetransition
arrangementsfor regularoperation of supportedactivities after loankredit closing, toward the achievementof
developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possibleratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe governmentand implementingagency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements, toward
the achievementof development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performanceand
implementingagency(ies) performance.Possibleratings for BorrowerPerformance: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,
ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Perfonnance Assessment Report (PPAR) preparedby the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for three projects inNiger: The Pilot Private IrrigationPromotion
Project (PPIP), the NaturalResourcesManagement Project (NRMP), andthe Ago-Pastoral
Export Promotion Project (APEP).

The PPIP was approvedinFY95 for a credit o fUS$6.8 million. At closing, 18months
behindscheduleinDecember 2001, total project costswere US$5.2 million, 69percent of
the appraisal estimate o fUS$7.5 million.

TheNRMPwas approved inFY96 for acredit ofUS$26.7 millionwith agreedcofinancing
from Denmark andNorway o fUS$8.7 million. At closing, 6 months behindschedule in
September2002, total costs wereUS$ 27.4 million, 67 percent o fthe appraisal estimateof
US$42.7 million. Cofinancing from Norwaywas disbursedat 88.4 percent while that o f
Denmark never materialized, which brought total cofinancing to US$1.9 million, or 22
percent o fthe appraisal estimate o fUS$8.7 million.

The APEP was approved inFYOOfor a credit o fUS$10.4 million. At closing on time in
October 2005, total costs were US$12.7 million, 6 percent over the appraisal estimate o f
US$12.1 million.

This report is basedon the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) preparedbythe
Africa Region, the Credit Agreements, StaffAppraisal Reports, project documents and files,
and discussionswith Bank staff and other stakeholders, includingthe Government o fNiger,
project implementing agencies, donors, the private sector, NGOs, andbeneficiaries. An IEG
mission visitedNiger inDecember 2007. The cooperation andassistance o f central
government andregional officials and staff, non-governmental stakeholders, donors, and
other interestedparties are gratehlly acknowledged.

These projects were selected for a PPAR becauseo f their support for complementary aspects
o f agricultural development inNiger, becauseof their innovative approachesto assistingthe
government's policy o f disengaging from the provision o f services and forging a strong
partnership with the private sector, andbecauseo f some questionsraisedby IEG's ICR
reviews. IncludingPPIP and APEP inthe present PPAR also providedthe opportunity to
compare the outcomes o fthese projects with those o f similar projects inMali which IEG
assessed in2007.

Following standard IEGprocedures, the draft ofthis PPARwas sent to the borrower for
commentsbefore it was finalized. The Borrowerhadno comments on the report. In
accordancewith the Bank's disclosure policy, the final report will be available to the public
following submission to the World Bank's Boardo fExecutive Directors.


Summary

1.       With sixty-one percent ofits populationlivingon less than a dollar a day and an
averageper capita income estimated at US$280in2006, Niger is considered the poorest
country inthe world. Niger's economy i s largely agrarian -predominantly rainfed-
characterized by a low levelo f agricultural productivity, a large informal sector, and a
relatively large public sector. Boththe Government o fNigerand the World Bank recognize
that the agriculture sector is a major potentialsource o f economic growth. Niger's Poverty
ReductionStrategy Papers(2001 and 2007), the Government's NationalNaturalResources
Management Program (1992) and RuralDevelopment Strategy (2003), andthe Bank's
Country Assistance Strategies (1994, 1997, and 2003) all emphasizethe importance o f
improving the access o fruralpopulations to economic opportunities, through irrigation and
trade, inorder to promote conditions for sustainable economic growth inthe sector, enhanced
food security, and sustainablemanagement o fnatural resources.

2.       The threeprojects reviewedinthis PPARwere implementedunder the tutelage ofthe
MinistryofRuralDevelopment, andaimedto assistthe Government ofNigerin
implementingits policies of (a) disengaging from the provisionof services, (b) forging anew
andstrong public-private partnership, and (c) providing the basic enabling environment for a
sustainableprivate sector-led agricultural growth and natural resources management. The
PilotPrivateIrrigation PromotionProject (PPIP), which was approved inApril 1995,
aimed to promote private small-scale irrigation inNiger through testingand disseminating
technologies that would meet small-farmer requirements and capabilities. The Natural
Resources ManagementProject(NRMP), which was approved inDecember 1995,
constituted the first five-year time-slice o f Government's long-term NationalNatural
ResourcesManagement Program whose ultimate objective was to reverse the process o f land
and natural resource degradation inorder to secure sustainable agricultural productionand
growth, and alleviate poverty. NRMP's specific objectives were (a) to assist rural
communities design, finance, andimplement community-based natural resources
managementplans, and (b) to assist the Government ofNigerbuildnational capacity to
designnational natural resources managementpolicies and coordinate diverse related
initiatives. The Agro-Pastoral Export PromotionProject (APEP), which was approved in
June 2000, aimed to give private sector enterprises andproducers the tools for increased
production, profitability, andmarketingo f agro-pastoral products, and to increase exports to
regionaland international markets.

3.       This PPARratesthe overall outcome ofPPIP as highlysatisfactory.Theproject
achieved its immediate objective o fpromoting simple, low-cost andhigh-returnsmall-scale
irrigationtechnologies which meet small-farmer requirements and capabilities. PPIP
successfully demonstratedthe potentialo f the small-scale irrigationsector to bringabout
substantial improvements inproductivity, thereby increasing food security. Ithasprovided
the ingredients to motivate smallholders to adopt adaptedtechnologies, and the stepping
stone to launch small-scale irrigationmorebroadly inNiger.

4.       The PPAR rates the overall outcome o fNRMP as satisfactory.Overall, there has
been a noticeable reversal inthe process o f land andnatural resource degradation inNiger
according to a detailed assessment study in2005 onthe impacts o fdesertification control in

Niger, andthe NRMP project hasbeenone of several donor projects that has contributedto
this achievement.NRMP successfilly provided government institutions andcommunities
with the tools necessaryto betterand sustainably managethe country's natural resources.
NRMP covered more than twice the area it targeted at appraisal, andpioneered the
introductiono fcommunity-based procurement procedures (CBPP), an approach to further
foster grass-roots decision making, and later adoptedbyother donors. CBPP was also cited
bygovernment officials to have contributedto Government's efforts inimplementingits
decentralization law.

5.      The PPAR rates overall outcome o fAPEP as unsatisfactory.APEP was not able to
increaseago-pastoralexports despite a favorable environment for export development. The
project's influence on aggregatenationalproductionand exports o f ago-pastoralproducts
was negligible. The project's efforts resultedina mere 0.4 percent share o fnationalago-
pastoral exports duringthe life o fthe project. This unsatisfactory outcome was causedby
significant shortcomings inproject design and implementation arrangementswhich were too
ambitious, didnot generate a strategic and integrated approachto export development, and
didnot take proper consideration ofthe country's constraints.

6.      Several lessons-bothpositive andnegative -relatingto project design have
emergedfrom this review:

(1)     Empoweringcommunitiesto take controlof the implementationof their own
        developmentplansimprovescommunity ownershipand motivationto engagein
        sustainabledevelopmentpractices.Boththe PPIP andthe NRMP worked very
        closely with the beneficiaries to generate grass-rootsdemandfor project activities. In
        the case o fPPIP, successful testing and innovativedissemination o f low-cost small-
        scale irrigationtechnologies playeddecisive roles intechnology promotion and ledto
        a steady increaseintheir adoption despite the population's low literacy rate. Inthe
        case ofNRMP, the introductionof CBPP empowered the communities by putting
        them incharge o f designing, recruiting andpaying for the implementation o ftheir
        collectivelydeveloped community development plans. This significantly improved
        communityownership and motivationto engage insustainablenatural resources
        managementpractices, and increased community investments.

(2)     Exportdevelopmentneedsto follow a well-definedstrategy, and a commodity
        chain approachneedsto emphasizeproducer-exporterlinkages.APEP was not
        able to help increase agro-pastoral exports, despite a favorable environment for export
        development, for two mainreasons: the absence o f a coherent export strategy, and
        missinglinks betweenproducers and exporters. APEP allocated its matchingfunds on
        subprojectson an ad hoc basis, spreading its resourcestoo thinly, not focusing on
        commodities that hadthe best export potential, nor selecting beneficiaries basedon
        the economic viability o f their activities. It also neglected the importance o f linking
        producers and exporters to develop sustainable supply chains with free-flowing
        informationon opportunities andmarket standards, so that exports ofhighquality
        incremental productionwould result.

(3) Similar agriculturaldevelopmentprojectsinneighboringcountriescan have
    oppositeoutcomes due to the quality of projectpreparation,the levelof
    engagementof the implementingagencies,andthe prevailinglandtenure security
    situation.Niger's PPIPhad a highlysatisfactory outcome, while Mali's PPIPhada
    highlyunsatisfactoryoutcome (assessedinaPPARbyIEGin2007). InNiger, the
    implementing agency, ANPP, was fully engaged inproject activities and worked very
    closely with the farmers -testing simple low-cost and high-return small-scale
    irrigation technologies, demonstratingtest results, and creating advisory services
    groups. This motivated farmers to invest inthese technologies from their own
    resources. InMali, the project's implementing agency -the Agricultural Supply Chain
    Promotion Agency (APROFA)-was not fully engaged, didnot work closely with
    farmers, and didnot activate project activities on time to encourage farmer demand for
    small-scale irrigation. Differences inlandtenure security also played a decisive role in
    bothprojects' outcomes. InNiger, its Rural Code provided farmers andpastoralists
    with the incentive o flandtenure security to invest intheir lands and livestock herds. In
    Mali, where land tenure law is still traditional, Malian farmers hesitated to andmostly
    didnot invest inlands that they didnot officially own.

    Niger's APEP had an unsatisfactoryoutcome while Mali's Agricultural Trading and
    Processing Promotion Pilot Project (ATPPP) had a moderately satisfactory outcome.
    InMali, the ATPPP took four years from inceptionto Board approvalwhichmade
    possible an in-depth preparationprocess. InNiger, the APEP took only six months
    from inception to Boardapproval. The hasty process resulted ina shallow analysis o f
    implementation risks and ineffective mitigation measures, and the deferral o f
    important activities to project implementation. Also, Mali's ATPPP financed the
    rehabilitation or establishment o f collective export infrastructure such as
    handling/processing and storage facilities, while Niger's APEP included a matching
    grant facility that dispensed highlysubsidized funds to individual associations o f
    producers or exporters. This probably influenced the diverging outcomes o f the two
    projects by causingMalian exporters to work harder to maximize their profits from
    the use o f the collective assetswhich were accessible to the different groups at
    predetermined and set times, while the individual Nigerien associations were secure
    inhavingthe assetsontheir own lands whether they madeuseo fthem or not.

1. Background

1.1      Niger is, bymostmeasures, the poorest country inthe world. Itwas ranked 177out of
177 countries on the UNDP's HumanDevelopment Index in2006. Sixty-one percent of
Niger's population lives on less than a dollar a day andthe averageper capita income was
estimated at US$280 in2006. Rural areas account for almost 80 percent o fthe country's
populationestimated at 14million, the majority o fwhom live along a narrow bando f arable
landon the country's southern border. About 90 percent o fthe populationrelies on
agriculture for their livelihood. Niger's economy i s largely agrarian -predominantly rainfed
-characterizedbyalowlevelofagriculturalproductivity,alargeinformalsector,anda
largepublic sector. In2006, agriculture -including forestry and fishing-accounted for 43
percent o fnational GDP, the highest sectoral share, and for 33 percent o f total exports.

1.2      The Government ofNiger andthe World Bank recognize that the agriculture sector i s
a major source o f economic growth. Niger's PovertyReduction Strategy Papers(2001 and
2007), the Government's NationalNatural ResourcesManagement Program (1992) and
RuralDevelopment Strategy (2003), andthe Bank's Country Assistance Strategies (1994,
1997, and 2003) all emphasizethe importance o f improvingthe access o f ruralpopulations to
economic opportunities, through irrigation and trade, inorder to promote conditions for
sustainableeconomic growth inthe sector, enhanced food security, and sustainable
managementofnatural resources. The World Bankhasbeen strongly supporting the
implementation o fthe Government's poverty reduction, andrural and natural resources
development strategies through its lendingportfolio which includes investments inrural
development, promotiono f agricultural exports, irrigation, and a community action program
to support development programs at the community level.

1.3      ThePilotPrivateIrrigationPromotionProject(PPIP), whichwas approvedinApril
1995 as apilot operation, aimedto promoteprivate small-scaleirrigation inNigerthroughtesting
anddisseminatingtechnologiesthat wouldmeet small-farmerrequirements andcapabilities.
Total costs were US$5.2 million at completion. TheNaturalResourcesManagementProject
(NRMP), whichwas approvedinDecember 1995, constitutedthe first five-year time-slice of
Government's long-termNationalNatural ResourcesManagementProgramwhose ultimate
objective was to reversethe processo flandandnaturalresourcedegradationinorder to secure
sustainableagricultural production andgrowth, andalleviatepoverty. NRMP was a community-
drivendevelopmentoperationwhose specific objectiveswere (a) to assist selectedrural
communities indesigning,financing, andimplementingcommunity-basednaturalresources
managementplans, and(b)to assist the GovernmentofNiger(GON) inbuildingnational
capacityto designnationalnaturalresourcesmanagementpolicies andcoordinatediverserelated
initiatives. Total costs wereUS$27.4millionat completion, makingthis the largest ofthe three
projectsbeingreviewedinthis PPAR. TheAgro-PastoralExportPromotionProject(APEP),
whichwas approvedinJune 2000, aimedto giveprivate sectorenterprises andproducersthe
tools for increasedproduction, profitability, andmarketingofagro-pastoralproducts, andto
increaseexportsto regional andinternationalmarkets.Total costswere US$12.7 millionat
completion.

1.4      All threeprojects were implementedunderthe tutelage ofthe MinistryofRural
Development (MDR), and aimed to assist the Government ofNiger inimplementingits

                                                     2


policies of (a) disengaging from the provisiono f services, (b) forging a new and strong
public-private partnership, and (c) providing the basic enabling environment for a sustainable
private sector-led agricultural growth andnatural resourcesmanagement.


2. PilotPrivateIrrigationProject(PPIP)
Objectives

2.1     The objective o fthe Pilot Private IrrigationProject (PPIP) was to promote the
development ofprivate irrigationinNiger, bypromotingtechnologies which would meet
small-farmer requirementsandcapabilities.' PPIP was to helpincrease small-farmer
productivity and incomes, andimprove rural well-being. The project focused primarilyon the
poorest small irrigation farmers, and selectedprivate commercial irrigators.

DesignandImplementation

2.2      PPIP was a four-year pilot for capacity buildinginsmall-scale privateirrigation
which had five components:

    e    Private Irrigation Management Agency (US$2.0 millionat appraisal, 27 percent o f
        project costs): to buildthe institutionaland technical capacity o fthe already
         established association ofprivateirrigators which was the designatedimplementing
         agency;

    e    Small-scale Mechanized Irrigation (US$1.8 million at appraisal, 24 percent o f
        project costs): to test and disseminate simple, low-cost mechanizedtechnologies for
         small irrigation farmers;

    e    ImprovedManualIrrigation Technology (US$0.8 millionat appraisal, 11percent
         o fproject costs): to test and disseminate improved small-scale manual irrigation
         technologies and help local artisansmanufacture them;

    e    EnvironmentalProtection (US$0.3 millionat appraisal, 4 percent o fproject costs):
        to monitor shallow aquifer levels, and soil andwater quality inthe project zones, and
         implementsome soil erosion controlwork; and

    e    Savings and Credit Schemes (US$O.9 millionat appraisal, 12percent o fproject
        costs): apackage o ftechnical assistance and training services for promotiono f
        savings and credit schemes inthe project area.

2.3     Project preparation took five years, duringwhich more than one approach to
developing private small irrigationwere considered. At the request o fthe Bank's project

sector, to implementthe project. The StaffAppraisal Report (SAR) identified four risks to
project implementation, three ofwhich related to the GON, such as subjecting ANPIP to
bureaucratic controls andpressures o fpolitical patronage, the inability to provide counterpart
contributions, andpotential government interference through restrictive legislationand
controls that could stifle grass-rootsinitiatives infinancial intermediation. The fourth risk
relatedto the possible misuse ofpublic funds on the part o fANPIP.

2.4     The project preparation team built severalmitigationmeasuresinto the project design,
such asjoint Government-Bank performance reviews as well as requiringthe GONto make
up-front, followed by annual, deposits into an account for counterpart funds and to provide
an appropriate legal framework for grassroots savings andcredit unions. The S A R also
incorporated clear performance criteria for ANPIP, pre-approved annual work programs,
training, adequate internal regulation andmonitoring systems, and strict enforcement o f
ANPIP'Soperational guidelines as safeguards againstmanagerial risks. There was no formal
Quality at Entry (QAE) Review, since the projectpredated the establishment o fthe Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) within the Bank, andno logical framework since the project
predated this requirement too. At the recommendation ofthe mid-term review (MTR), the
project was retrofittedin 1999, a monitoringand evaluation unit was created inside the
project managementunit (PMU), andmore emphasiswas put on testing andimproving
manual irrigation techniques versus mechanizedtechniques, since they fit better withinmost
Nigerien farmers' socioeconomic conditions.

2.5     The mitigationmeasuresprovedeffective andno significant implementation
problems were reported, except for delays inand lower amounts o f counterpart fundingthan
agreed-upon at appraisal. The GONprovidedonly 43 percent o f its agreed contributionby
project closing due to the country's deteriorating public finance situation at the time o fthe
project. Butthis didnot cause major delays inexecution. The Bank's task team leader (TTL)
delayed ingiving some "no objections" for procurement and disbursement transactions
sought bythe project duringthe first part o fthe project, but this was resolved once a TTL
was appointed inNiamey.

2.6     Manygovernment officials, bothinside and outside the Ministry o fRural
Development (MDR), were initially unenthusiastic about the idea o f aprivate entity-
created at the insistence o fthe Bank's project design team basedonproject preparation
findings-managing the project andpublic finds. Butthe GONdidnot interferewith the
management of the project's public funds and becamevery supportive o fthe project when
the irrigationtechnologies were developed and farmers from all over the country expressed
enthusiasm for this new approach. MDRactually reassignedsome o fthe project activities -
such as extension and environmental monitoring-from governmental agencies to ANPIP,
dueto the agencies' lack ofpublic funds andnon-adherenceto the World Bank's procedures.
Themonitoringofshallow aquifers didnot take place as planned, though, since the
installationprocess for the piezometers was inadequate, which didnot permit a good reading
andinterpretationofdata.

Outcome

2.7     PPIPhas successhllydemonstrated the potentialo fthe small-scale irrigation sector
to bringabout substantial improvements inproductivity, and thereby increasing food

security. Ithas provided the ingredients to motivate smallholders to adopt adapted
technologies that are low-cost andhigh-return, so that the small-scale irrigation sector has
flourished. This PPARupgrades the overall outcome o f the project from satisfactory (inthe
ICR) to highly satisfactory.

RELEVANCE
2.8     Niger's overarching development objective at project preparation was to reverse the
trends o f declining levels o fper capita income and social welfare. To that end, GONhad
decided to foster a public-private partnership aimed at achieving sustainable economic
growth, higher levels o f income growth, andpoverty alleviation. The government's strategy
inthe irrigation sector was to reduce the role ofthe stateinmanagingirrigation schemes and
to promote smaller-scale private ownership andmanagement. The Bank's country assistance
strategy (CAS) o f 1994 supported this private sector-led development strategy, as stated in
one o fthe CAS' four buildingblocks "buildingpublic andprivate sector institutions to
promoteprivate sector based growth         ."
2.9     The government's Rural Development Strategy (SDR) o f 2003 supported the
expansion o f irrigation -including small private irrigation -and the modernization o f
agriculture as a means to reduce poverty andincrease food security. The government's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which were approvedin2001 and 2007,
supported irrigation development as one o f their priority sectoral interventions, andthe
government's national strategy for irrigation development andwater harvesting(SNDICER),
which was approved in2005, also supported small private irrigation as one o f the irrigation
categories to be developedinNiger. What is noteworthy about this current irrigation strategy,
however, is its departure, to some extent, from a private sector-led approach and a return to
the concept o f large irrigatedperimeters developedby government and collectively managed
by farmer cooperatives. The Bank's 2003 CAS emphasized smallprivate irrigation inone o f
its four pillars -"the development ofproductive sectors, especially in rural areas, to
mitigate vulnerability and stimulate income generation" -which addresses Niger's high
vulnerability to climatic shocks and food insecurity. But the CAS also expressed some
reservations about the conclusions o f the 2001 PRSP that production and growthwould be
fueled equally by increased private andpublic investment inthe rural sector (irrigation). The
CAS stated that this would need further examination and research.

2.10    Thus, the objective o f PPIP was fully aligned with GON's strategy inthe 1990s, but
to a lesser extent inits current strategy. Onthe other hand, the objective o f PPIPremains
fully aligned withthe Bank's strategy.

                                                 5


2.11 PPIP's components and activities were highly appropriate to achieving its objective,
since these addressmost o fthe constraints o fthe small irrigation subsector, notably, the
inefficient irrigationtechniques; limitedinformation on, andaccess to, commercial markets
for products and factors o fproduction; lack o f access to financial services; andlack o f access
to basic technical and farm management skills. The project activities provided specialized
assistanceand training to helpbuildthe technical and institutional capacity necessaryto
overcome these constraints, andprovided an incentive for greaterprivate investments in
farmer-owned andoperated small-scale irrigation schemesthroughpromotionalwork,
studies, andprice andmarket information collection.

2.12    This PPAR concurs with the ICRthat quality at entry andproject design were
satisfactory. Theproject objective statement was simple andunderstandable,but couldhave
been more precisely worded. The design fostered ownership at the grass-roots levelby
empowering beneficiaries through their associations, and accounted for institutional
constraints andrisks by incorporating flexibility and the participationo f stakeholdersin
project oversight and decision making. One ofPPIP's greatest contributions to development
outcomeswas its flexibility -recognizing that promotingaprivate approach ina rural
environment such as Niger, which hasbeenhighly dependent on public interventions, i s a
slow and complex process. Constant adjustments were necessarythroughout the five and a
halfyears o fproject activity. The first two years were spent inpromotingthe approach,
sensitizing, training and organizing. Iti s only inthe third year that project activities startedto
beimplemented. Results didnot materialize untilthe fifth year ofthe project.

2.13    Theproject designpredated the Bank's requirementto elaborate a logical framework
butwas retrofittedafter the MTR. The indicators selectedinthe SAR were measurementsfor
the project's inputs and some outputs at project's closure. No outcome or impact indicators
were identified. After the MTR, adequate outcome indicators were identifiedandquantified,
which made it possible to measureproject outcome andbenefits.

2.14    Bothproject objective and design are highlyrelevant. However, inlight of the
government's current irrigation strategy which to some extent represents a departure from the
private sector-led approach anda returnto the previous approach o f large irrigated
perimeters, relevance i s rated substantialand not high.

EFFICACY
2.15    The small-scale irrigation subsector inNiger i s flourishing. The Bank's financial and
technical support from 1995 to 2007 -through PPIP and its follow-on operation, the Private
IrrigationProject, Phase 2 (PIP2) -has leddirectly to the following:

        An additional 16,000 hao flandbelonging to about 22,300 farmers hasbeenput
        under small-scale irrigation;
        3,138 manual and 10,485 mechanized pumps have beeninstalled byproject
        beneficiaries;
        4,132 tube wells have beendug and 2,357 conventional wells rehabilitated or dug
        following improved traditional practices;
        25,600 small-scale irrigators have been grouped into groups o f similar economic
        interests (GIEs) and adhering to the apex organization ANPIP;
        29,297 farmers becamemembers o fdecentralized savings and credit unions (SCUs);

                                                         6


         61 groups ofadvisory services have been formed; and
         558 craftsmen have been trained on the manufacture and maintenance ofirrigation
         equipment and farm implements.

2.16     This brightpicture has materialized because ofPPIP. BothGONand donors credit
PPIPwith launching the small-scale irrigation subsector inNiger on a broad scale. PPIPhas
indeed established a solid base for launching small-scale irrigationby successhlly adapting,
testing and disseminating low-cost irrigation technologies, by organizing farmers into groups
with common economic interests, bymotivating them tojoin credit unions, andby creating
advisory services groups. PPIP (a) introduced the pedal pump and simple water distribution
systems, not knownpreviously inNiger; (b) improved the manual pump2and reduced its cost
byabout one half, (c) maderecommendations for less expensive butrobust mechanized
pumps, and (d) reduced the costs o f tubewells by about two thirds from US$400 to US$120
bytesting differentmaterial and drillingtechniques. One ofthe factors inits success was its
demand-driven approach to small-scale irrigation. PPIP created highdemand for irrigation
equipment throughthe encompassing and effective dissemination ofits tests results. It
carried out publicity through demonstrations infarmers' fields, fairs, and at road sides, radio
and television broadcasts, brochures, books, and technical notes. It also encouraged
craftsmen to lease irrigation equipment for one season to undecided farmers.

2.I 7    PPIPmade small-scale irrigation accessible to small farmers byreducingthe costs o f
the needed technologies and equipment, andincreasing the return on farm investment. The
benefit-cost ratio o f a combined investment ina tubewell, a manual pump and water
distribution system reached a rewarding 3.5: 1. The project also succeeded inestablishing a
sustainable supply chain of irrigation equipment by training craftsmen inthe manufacture
and maintenance of the simple irrigation equipment retained bythe project. The irrigation
manufacturingbusiness continues to flourish: One craftsman inthe Region ofDosso, south
o fNiamey, reported to the PPARmissionthat he had 10 staff in2000, and 100today. Some
o fthose who have trained inhis business have opened their own. His revenues have
increasedby about 50 percent since 2000. Project benefits cited bybeneficiaries to the PPAR
mission, and confirmed inPIP2's progress report of August 2007, include yield increases
compared to a no-project scenario, that reached 45 percent for onions, 175 percent for wheat,
and 186 percent for ~abbage.~        PIP2's progress report also confirmed highmargins per hectare
for small-scale irrigation, reaching up to $6,224 for onions and US$7,884 for tomatoes.

2.18     Other important successes ofthe project include the launching of specialized private
advisory services groups which are filling the gap left bypublic institutions, such as
extension services, which have lacked funds, staff and competence. These groups, who
acquired their expertise throughinterning and training under PPIP, have increased from 2 in




2. One o fthe project's outputs was a manual pumptotally manufactured inNiger and called "commitment and
courage".
3. Additional benefits have included farming all year round whichprovided seasonal employment and limited
the exodus o f youth by about 40 percent; better technologies for post-harvest conservation o fcrops; lower
consumer prices; a healthier nutrition and easier food preparation; and other social benefits such as competition
among farmers which has awakened the rural population, and the opportunity for mutual assistance.

1998 to 59 in2007.4 Another success was the pioneering style ofproject management:
ANPIP, a private association o f irrigation farmers andprofessionals ofrelated disciplines
was designated as implementing agency to manage public funds. This approach was
successful on the one hand, because ANPIP was an interlocutor respected by GON, other
donors, andbeneficiaries who kept a good working relationship with them, and because it
was a cushion against political interferen~e.~ the other hand, ANPIP proved successful in
                                                       On
eliciting support andthe rightto represent grass-roots beneficiaries, inpromoting the
Government's private sector strategy for development of small-scale irrigation, ineffectively
organizing irrigation farmers, indevising an efficient communication strategy, and in
providing services to its members such as training, advisory services, and distributing inputs
closer to the field. GON, the Bank and beneficiaries all praised ANPIP'Smanagerial
capacities.

2.19      Finally, PPIP achieved partial results inmobilizing its beneficiaries to form saving
and credit unions. The results were less thanprojected at project design and MTR, mainly
due to the traditional no-savings culture6 caused by extreme poverty and poor harvests.
Twenty seven schemes were established with farmers funds -five ofwhich benefited from
small donor trust funds -and GONrespected the autonomy andthe private character o f
these schemes. However, the small amount o f savings mobilized (US$60 per member) made
possible only modest loans (an average ofUS$243 per loan). Inaddition, only 18 percent o f
the loans were devoted to irrigation; most were used to finance social events as well as
diverse commercial and other productive activities. By2007, five schemes hadbeen
liquidated, andonly 8 of the remaining 22 schemes were performing, following strict
financial management rules as approved by MCPEC, the apex Savings and Credit Union.7

2.20      Inlighto fthe major impact which PPIP hashadon facilitatingthe launchingo fthe
small-scale irrigation sector, and despite the mixed results obtained inthe savings and credit
unions activities, efficacy is rated high.




4. One o f them, the NIYYA group, was formed in 1998 with 7 staff. Itmanaged an average o fUS$622/month
inirrigationdevelopment finds. In2007, this groupnowcounts25 staffwithadiverse rangeoftechnical
expertise to include livestock production, rural development, and environment, distributedover 3 regional
offices to cover all o fNiger. They are working with several donors and managing an average o fUS$6,220 per
month-ten times as muchas when they started. They report being better paidnow for the same work. Several
similar groups were created after internship and training at NIYYA.
5. PPIP's national director and ANPIP's management resisted requests o fpoliticians and other government
officials to show favoritism inselecting beneficiaries o fproject finds and training, as well as inawarding
contracts.
6. The rural finance sector is performingpoorly. PIP2 dropped its microfinance development subcomponent in
2005 and an IFAD-financedPilot MicrofinanceProject didnot proceedto a second phase because o fpoor
results.
7. MCPEC, the apex organization, has experienced shortages inoperational funds and some financial
mismanagement which prompted GONto place it under the tutelage o fthe Ministry o fFinance in2001. Ithas
not been able to follow some of its member credit and saving schemes closely and no longer guarantees their
operational integrity.

EFFICIENCY
2.21    The project's SAR didnot calculate an economic rate o freturn (ERR) because o f
PPIP's institution-building and service nature. However, the ICR calculated an ERR for two
o f the project's components -the Small-scale Mechanized Irrigation andthe Improved
ManualIrrigation-because these achievedresults that can be expressed infinancial and
economic terms. The I C R found the ERR for the mechanized irrigation to be 66 percent and
that for the manual irrigation to be 68 percent, and cited the following among the most
significant indicators making it possible to appraise the results o f the project on the incomes
o fbeneficiaries:

         The net margin o f farms usingmechanizedpumps averaged US$1,304 with a
         standard deviation o fUS$639, a minimumo f US$390 and a maximum o f US$2,189,
         according to a survey conductedby the project on some beneficiaries operating
         mechanizedpumps;

         The acquisition o f a pedal pump makes it possible to triple the cultivated area and to
         increase net income by 156percent, from US$222 to US$568, according to a survey
         conducted by the project on some beneficiaries operating non-mechanizedpumps;

         Economic profitability is around 104percent for the mechanized technologies, and
         217 percent for the manual technologies, according to the same surveys.

2.22     The ICR also mentioned that the savings and credit schemes cover the poorest and
help alleviate their poverty level byproviding them with means to develop income-
generating activities. The project made it possible for 5,473 persons to receive small loans
amounting to US$1.3 million, with the hnds coming from their own deposits.

2.23     The farmers, whom the PPAR mission met, confirmed their highdegree o f
satisfaction with small-scale irrigation, andthe financial benefits they received from such
investments. They praisedthe project for helping them generate these extrabenefits. The
2007 monitoring and evaluation report o f PIP2 also confirms highmargins per hectare for
small-scale irrigation, reaching up to US$6,224 for onions andUS$7,884 for tomatoes. PPIP
has clearly demonstrated that small-scale irrigation can be highlyremunerative. Efficiency is
ratedhigh.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

2.24     Sustainability o f the benefits acquired under PPIP is threatened by three concerns
associated with the follow-on project PIP2, and a fourth which falls outside the control o f
either project. First, the design o f PIP2 includes a matching grant facility, to enhance the
availability o f rural credit, which provides hnds to farmers for the purchase o f small-scale
irrigation equipment. The cost-shares o f these grants are 80 percent from PIP2 and 20 percent
from the farmer. PIP2 has observed in2007 that many farmers, taking advantage o f these
matching grants, have beenpurchasing mechanizedpumps rather than manual pumps, even if
their farming conditions didnot require mechanizedpumping.8This is threatening the


8. PPIPhas motivated the sale o f 1,082 manual pumps.No mechanizedpumps sales were recorded, probably
becausePPIP didnot provide a credit facility. Onthe other hand, PIP2 established a target o f4,550 manual

                                                        9


sustainability o f the successful supplychain o f manualpumps established under PPIP. This
matching grant facility has also caused the EUdonor who is financing a parallel but smaller
project -the Support to Food Security through Small-scale Irrigation (ASAPI), 2001-2007
-tocomplaintoMDRatPIP2'sappraisalthatthematchinggrantwouldpreventASAPI
from implementing anddisbursing from its credit component. Neither the Bank nor MDR
paid attention to this complaint, andthe EUhad to divert its credit component funds to other
activities to enable them to disburse the earmarked funds.

2.25      Second, in2007, bothMDR andthe Bank's project TTL have withdrawn their vote o f
confidence inANPIP, which was the implementing agency for PIP2, PPIP's sequel. And
thus, ANPIP i s no longer PIP2's implementing agency since April 2007. ANPIP's prospects
for institutional and financial sustainability hadbeen very highsince it was respected by
GON, donors andits members alike, andhadattracted more funds from other donors in
addition to those o fPPIP and PIP^.^ However, ANPIP didnot prove to have sufficient
integrity to manage the large PIP2 financing -about US$40 million -and seems to have
caved into political pressure." MDRtook over management o fPIP2 andthe present PPAR
thinks that the GONis not likely to repeat the experience o f having a private entity manage
public funds inthe near future. This is undermining to some extent the desired public-private
partnership for development, and the private-led initiative to develop irrigation, supported by
GONat the inception o fPPIP.

2.26      Third, PPIPwas assigned an environmental category Bysince it was designed to
create the necessary capacity to make future on-farm investments profitable, sustainable, and
environmentally sound. PPIP didnot threaten to deplete the shallow aquifers mainly because
o f its pilot nature andbecause the water extraction it encouraged was within the capacity o f
the aquifer to regenerate. However, with the large expansioninirrigation that has taken place
under PIP2, which draws mainly on undergroundwater resources, careful monitoring has
become a necessity. PIP2's MTR in2005 reported that 99 sites within the project area were,
or would be, fragile as a result o f irrigationpractices, andrecommendedaquifer recharge and
an environmental assessment for all subprojects financed by PIP2 to enable a rational

pumps and 5,936 mechanized pumpsto be sold as a direct result o fthe different incentivesprovidedby the
project. PIP2's 2007 monitoring indicators show that 2,056 manual pumps and 10,485 mechanizedpumps have
beensold to farmers touched bythe project, i.e. 1manualpumpis sold for every 5 mechanizedpumps.This
represents 45 percent and 177percent o fthe targets set at PIP2's appraisal for manual and mechanizedpumps,
respectively.
9. Duringthe life o f PPIP, ANPIP managed two other externally-funded projects which related to food security
andhad an irrigationcomponent, one financed by the French donor and the other by the West African
Development Bank. Ithas managed three additional projects since the start o f PIP2, financed by the EUand
FAO.
10.ANPIP hadappointeda new national director for PIP2 whose appointment seems to have beenpolitical and
imposed on ANPIP and the Bank. The national director yielded more politicalpower than ANPIP's
management and selected project beneficiaries and awarded contracts based on criteria not inconformity with
those agreed by GON and the Bank during project appraisal and negotiations. This resulted inmisappropriation
o f some funds and ineligibility o f some expenses. The Bank's project management issued several warnings to
ANPIP, but didnot have sufficient power to replace the national director. GONhad to returnthe ineligible
expenses to the Bank. The Bank then insisted onremoving ANPIP's responsibility for project implementation.
MDRand other GONofficials who hadnever reallyaccepted aprivate entity managingpublic funds took the
opportunity to have project implementationresponsibility fall back to MDR. This, unfortunately, i s not
guaranteed to shieldthe allocation o f project finds from continuedpolitical favoritism.

continuation o firrigationactivities. Ifenvironmental monitoring andmitigation are not
implemented, expansion of small-scale irrigationmaybecome an environmental risk.

2.27      The fourth concern relates to ruralcredit. The apex Savings andCredit Union,
MCPEC, hasnot been able so far to stand on its own feet. MCPEC and its member SCUs
were undermined by few cases o fmisappropriation o f funds inthe past so that the Ministry
o fFinanceput MCPEC's managementunder tight, but provisional control in2001. As a
result, MCPEC lost credibility and could not market itself as a paid service provider to
donors, as ANPIP did, to increaseits operating budget andhasnot, therefore, beenable to
provide free support and audit services to halfo fits members. MCPEC reorganized and let
go o f 16 (out of 51) of its membersin2005-2006, as some were liquidatedand others were
quasi non-operational,' and grouped its remaining members into 2 equal groups, performing
andnon-perfonning.12The non-performing group does not pay membership fees andhas to
pay MCPEC for advisory and audit serviceswhen requested. Although the deposits o fboth
groups have doubled since PPIP closed, the non-performinggroup risks mismanagement o f
hnds sinceitbenefits from little follow-up andguidance. This reducesclient confidence in
these schemes andmay reduce deposits over the long run, leading to an inevitable decreasein
its ability to provide loans. This would ultimatelyreduce farmers' access to credit to
purchase small-scale irrigation.

2.28      The four concerns put PPIP's achievements at a substantial risk. Risk to development
outcome i s rated signficant.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
2.29      The Bank's preparation team carehlly considered several alternatives, including a
line o f credit to promote the small-scale irrigation subsector inNiger, and finally settled on a
phasedoperation with a narrow focus on testing and disseminating simple, low-cost
smallholder irrigation technologies and institution-buildinginthe pilot phase. The Bank's
project design team insisted on having a private association that representedbeneficiaries to
managethe project.13The project's success can inlarge part be attributed to this narrow
focus andinnovative institutionaldesign. The project team also incorporated an
environmental conservation component to monitor aquifer extraction, which was very
appropriate for a country set to expand irrigationbut with scarce replenishablewater
resources.

2.30      The Bank's project supervision team closely supervised the private implementing
agency, conducting 15 supervision missions at an average o fmore than two per year because

11. Eight o fthe savings and credit schemescreated byPPIPhadbeen liquidatedby2002.
12. Eightand eleven savings and credit schemes created by PPIP belong to the performing and non-performing
groups, respectively.
13. SAR, page 15, paragraph 5.4: "Based on the disappointing experience with public irrigation agencies, it was
deemednecessary to establish an association o fprivate irrigators, hereinafter referredto as the Agency. The
Agency has already beenestablished with private legal status inorder to insulate it from the ex ante control and
political interference that preventedpublic agencies from effectively performing their responsibilities as
executing agency o fpast irrigationprograms,"

o f PPIP's pilot nature. The project was retrofittedwith a logical framework after the MTR,
some o f its indicator targets revised, and a monitoring and evaluation unit created within
ANPIP which contributedto a sound evaluation o fproject achievements. The Bank
appointed a project TTL inNiamey which helped address project requests and issues
promptly, an additional ingredient to the project's success. The Bank's project management
advanced the preparation o f the second phase inorder to minimize the transition period
between the pilot phase and the investment operation.

2.3 1 Although some GON officials, both inside and outside MDR, considered ANPIP to
be an inappropriate implant imposedbythe Bank, and inspite o f the woes that ANPIP
experienced, relating to political interference rather than its institutional structure, Bank
performance is rated satisfactory.

2.32    A multidisciplinary Nigerien group, assisted byan FAO/CP team, participated
actively inPPIP's design andpreparation. Farmer organizations, various NGOs and
representatives from all the counterpart agencies were consulted. The design benefited
greatly from the leadership andvision provided by the main counterparts inthe ministries o f
Planning, Finance and Rural Development which ensured that the project fitted well within
the country's context. Although the GONprovided counterpart funds with some delay and
incompletely because o f limited financial resources at the time, but this didnot cause major
delays inexecution. When MDRwas unable to respond to project needs inrelation to
extension, facilitation o f input accessibility, price and market information, due to limited
funds, it transferred management o f these activities to ANPIP. It also placedmanagement o f
the rural microfinance component with MCPEC. However, many GONofficials inside and
outside MDRwere unenthusiastic about private entities managingpublic funds and
expressed displeasure at the fact that ANPIP was created by the project to manage the
project. Support to PPIPwas elicited only when farmers expressed their appreciation for this
new approach to irrigation development and enthusiasm for the technologies developed.
Nonetheless, throughout the project GONdidnot interfere inthe management o fproject
funds, andrespected the autonomy andprivate character o f the savings and credit schemes,
as well as its commitment to a public-private partnership for the development o f irrigation.

2.33    The implementation agency, ANPIP, fulfilled its obligations with due diligence. It
installedthe necessary tools andprocedures to ensure that financial and administrative
management was carried out inaccordance with Bank and GONrules. Procurement
procedures were respected, the recruitmentprocess was transparent, and competent staff
were hired. Upon closing o f the Bank-financed Extension Services Project, ANPIP was
proactive to encourage fresh university graduates who interned at ANPIP to fill the gap and
not disruptproject implementation. Thus, two advisory services groups constitutedby young
graduates were able to advise farmers on the procurement and use o f new technologies.
Project reportingwas regular and comprehensive. ANPIP succeeded inmaintaining good
working relationships with GON, the Bank, and farmer associations. ANPIP's performance
was assessedhighlysatisfactoryby GON andbeneficiaries.

2.34    Inspite ofMDR's lukewarm ownership ofthe project duringits initial stages,
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory because the GON continued to support PPIP's

                                                     12


objectives and modus operandi throughout the project's life andbecause MDR and ANPIP
ensured smoothproject implementation.

Monitoringand Evaluation

2.35     Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was critical for a pilot operation like PPIP, since
moving to a second phase requiredthe assurance that the objectives o f the pilot phase were
achieved. The design o f PPIPpreceded the Bank's requirements for a logical framework, and
thus didnot include one. The S A R identified a set o fperformance indicators which, although
little more than input and output indicators, were nonetheless quantified with end-of-project
targets, and specified that implementationprogress was to be reported on a quarterly and
yearly basis. The S A R made provision for monitoring the performance and recharge
characteristics o f the shallow aquifers and the danger o f excessive extraction.

2.36     PPIPwas retrofitted with a logical framework following the MTR. New outcome
indicators were added, some indicator targets were revised to better reflect the potential o f
activitie~,'~and a monitoring and evaluation unit was created within ANPIP which
contributedto a valid assessment o f the project achievements. Monitoringprogress was done
through monthly visits to the field by ANPIP'Sdirector general and heads o f departments, a
series o f surveys and studies, andthe regular field data collection by the M&Eunit staff.
Quarterly and yearly reports were preparedina comprehensive and regular way. The data
collected was analyzed and used to inform the Bank's and ANPIP'Steams on decision
making such as reallocatingresources to higher impact activities.l5             Monitoringo f shallow
aquifers didnot take place as plannedthough, since the installation process o f the
piezometers was inadequate which didnot permit a good reading andinterpretationof data.

2.37     Monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial. The monitoring and evaluation o f
PPIP's achievements confirmedthat the country was ready for an expansiono fthe pilot
phase. Thus PIP2 was launchedon a nation-wide scale. This assessment proved, ex post, to
be correct since PIP2has exponentially multiplied PPIP's achievements interms of land
surfaces put under small-scale irrigation, from about 1,100 ha at PPIP's closing to the current
16,000 ha.




14. For example, targets for improvedhand dug wells methods tested andmechanizedwater distribution
technologies tested were lowered becauseenough had already been done andproject resources could be better
usedelsewhere, and targets for established savings and credit associations were also lowered becauseMCPEC
advised that the communities' capacities didnot meet appraisal expectation. Targets for craftsmentrained in
irrigationequipmentproduction and maintenance and for manualpumpsales motivated by the project were
increasedbecause the project was obviously on its way to exceed the appraisal targets.
15. After the MTR, PPIP put more emphasis on testing and improving small-scale manual irrigation techniques
versus the mechanizedtechniques, becausethe MTRhighlightedthe fact that manual irrigation fittedbetter than
mechanizedirrigation within most o f the Nigerienfarmers' socioeconomic conditions.

3. NaturalResources Management Project (NRMP)
Objectives

3.1     The Natural ResourcesManagement Project (NRMP), which was approved in 1995,
constituted the first five-year time-slice o fthe GON's long-term NationalNaturalResources
Management Program (NNRMP) which was elaborated in 1992 andwhose ultimate
objective was to slow down, stop and ultimately reverse the process o f landand natural
resource degradation inorder to secure sustainable agricultural productionand growth,
alleviate poverty, and improve the living conditions o fNiger's rural communities. NRMP
was a community-driven development (CDD) operation whose specific objectives were (a) to
assist selectedruralcommunities indifferent agro-ecological zones indesigningand
implementingcommunity-basednatural resourcesmanagement(CBNRM) plans for their
lands and to providethem with the necessaryknow-how, information, technical and financial
resourceswithin aproper institutional and legal framework; and (b) to assist the GONin
buildingnational capacity to promote, assist and coordinatethe diversenatural resources
management(NRM)initiatives within the framework o f a long-term national program, as
well as indesigninga comprehensive set ofnational NRMpolicies and strategies.

DesignandImplementation

3.2     Representingthe first five years o fthe implementation ofthe NNRMP, NRMP
implementedthe innovative anddemand-driven CBNRMapproach for amorecoherent
managementand use o fthe renewable natural resources on a wide scale inNiger.l6It
addressedproblems identified as a result o f the poor perfonnance o f earlier projects -some
beingtoo sectoral andtop-down, others beingmultidisciplinary butwithno links between
sectoral components.NRMP had4 components:17

        Design and Implementation o f CBNRM Plans (US$26.7 million at appraisal, 63
        percent o fproject costs): to help 380 communities prepare and carry out community-
        basedlanduse andNRMplans;

        NRMSupport Operations (US$7.5 million at appraisal, 18percent ofprojectcosts):
        to train all project stakeholders, conduct awareness campaigns, andbuildup a data
        base and an informationnetwork on the national natural resourcebase;

        Implementation, Management andMonitoring Support (US$0.2 millionat appraisal,
        0.5 percent o fproject costs): to draft policy documents, monitor policy
        implementation, and establish three LandTenure Commissions; and


16.The CBNRM approach was tested through severalpilot projects inthe Sahel inthe 1980s. The "Terroir" or
local community lands, management concept was endorsed duringa regional conference inSegou, Mali, inMay
1989organized bythe Club duSahel andthe Interstate Committee to Combat Desertification inthe Sahel
(CILSS), where representatives o frural communities, donors, governments and NGOs agreed that this approach
neededto be tested on a larger scale inthe Region. Since then, substantial investments have beenmade to
promote this approach inNiger and elsewhere inthe Sahel.
17.There was no complete list o f components inthe SAR section, "Detailed Project Description." Instead,
components were extracted from the project costs summary table inthe SAR, page 15.

                                                       14


         Monitoringand Evaluation, Project Management, and PPF Rehnding (US5.7
         million at appraisal, 13 percent o fproject costs).

3.3      The S A R identified3 risks to project implementation inrelationto (a) the willingness
and ability o f communities to commit to the project objectives and engage inparticipatory
planningand long-term investments; (b) MDR's capacity to implementthe program; and
(c) the implementation o fM&E activities includingthe competence andmotivationo f staff,
efficient data collectionand flow o f information. The project design incorporated several
measuresto mitigatethe first risk, including conducting awareness and information
campaigns, focusing on technological packages consistent with those adoptedby the national
agriculture extension services, working only with interested groups, and involving farmers in
the planning and selection o f activities. To mitigate the second set o f risks relatingto MDR's
capacity, annual reviewswould concentrate onperformance, and the project would work
closely with MDRto identifycorrective action. As to the risks related to M&E, close
supervision would help address these.

3.4      Inspite offive changesofadministration andgeneralpoliticalinstability, the GON
maintained strong support for the NNRMP and to the project. It followed through on the
MTRrecommendation to introduce simplifiedcommunity-based procurement and
disbursementprocedures (CBPP), despite some internal resistance, which immediately
accelerateddisbursements earmarked for the im lementation o f CBNRM plans and
dramatically increasedcommunity investments!8                 The PMUwas givena large degree o f
autonomy over project implementation, andcommunities were given autonomy inowning
their NRMplans. Project staffwas recruited quickly and at the requisite level.

3.5      Project implementation faced some, but no insurmountable obstacles. The design
team failed to anticipate that the planned degree o f cofinancing by GONand the other donors
would not materialize -a combined total o fUS$8.7 millionfrom Denmark andNorway.
Although the government contributionwas delayed and incomplete and the Danish
contributionnever came about," this only affected the scope o fthe project to some extent but
not the overallimplementation o f activities.20There were two informal suspensionso f
disbursementsin1999,due to disagreementsbetweenthe Bank's project TTL andnational
project managementover outsourcing someproject activities to the NigerienOrganization o f
Volunteers for the Conservation of the Environment (ONVPE), a localNGO, whose
performance was not at the levelrequired. The MTR pointedout strongly that NRMP's
regional teams hadmainly performed desk work andhadhad limiteddirect contact with
communities, that operational expenseshadreached almost 70 percent o f the allocated
budget after only three years ofimplementation while community investments hadfallen


18. Only 300, or 23 percent o f the subprojects representing implementation o f CBNRM plans, out o f the total
of 1,300 subprojects fundedby the project, were fhded inthe first 3 years o fthe project, i.e. prior to the mid-
term review. Subproject financing more than tripled after the introduction o f the CBPP.
19. The ICR, paragraph 5.1, reportedthat the grant never materialized due to the political turmoil inNiger in
1997.
20. This was because government contribution was reducedbythat amount which was counterpart to the
Danishcofinancing, and the Danish fhds were not earmarked for specific activities. Also, the sharp increase in
community investment after the MTRincreased the contribution frombeneficiaries and reducedthe needfor
government counterpart funding for the implementation o frelated activities.

                                                     15


behind schedule reaching only 14.6 percent o fbudget allocations. Therefore, it was felt
necessary then to bringabout a turnaround inthe PMUto improve national project
management. The PMUcoordinator was replaced, field-level staff were extensively
redeployed to allow for more direct engagement with the communities, andnew rules on
allowances andper diem were introducedto alleviate budget pressure on operational
expenses. These measures, combined with the introduction o f CBPP, improved operational
efficiencies and reversed the disbursement imbalance that had existedbefore the MTR.

Outcome

3.6       Overall, there has been a noticeable reversal inthe process o f land andnatural
resource degradation inNiger according to a detailed assessment study in2005 on the
impacts ofNRMprojects on desertification control inNiger, and the NRMP has been one o f
several donor projects that has contributedto this achievement. NRMP successfully provided
government institutions and communities with the tools necessary to better and sustainably
manage the country's naturalresources. The project outcome is rated satisfactory.

RELEVANCE
3.7      The objectives o fNRMP were fully aligned with the GON's strategy innatural
resources management at the time since it constituted the first five-year time-slice o f the
government's 1992 NNRMP. The GONhad also prepared a Rural Code in 1993, designed to
establish a legal and social framework for determining land use patterns and rights, which
NRh4P helped to implement. NRMP was fully inline with GON's Rural Development Policy
Framework (RDPF), adopted in 1992 as well, which focused on NRM, the empowerment o f
rural communities, an improved policy-making process, and the redefinition o f the role of the
State and decentralization. The project objectives were fully inaccordance with the Bank
strategy at the time since two o f the major objectives o fthe 2004 CAS were to reverse
environmental degradation and improve food security. The CAS also supported further
reforms inthe agriculture sector, including giving local communities autonomy to manage
natural resources, improving landtenure, and implementing the Rural Code.

3.8      NRMP's objectives remained highlyrelevant to the GONand Bank development
strategies o f more recent years. BothNiger's first PRSP in2001 and the Bank's 2003 CAS,
which supported that PRSP, focused on fostering integrated development o f natural resources

                                                        16


andenvironmental preservationthrough environmentally soundlandusepolicies, arational
managemento fnatural resources, and a continued implementation o fthe Rural Code intheir
secondpillar: "The development of productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate
vulnerability and stimulate incomegeneration." Integrated development o fnatural
resources and environmental preservation were again stressedinGON's 2003 Rural
Development Strategy andthe 2007 PRSP.

3.9      Thepreparation ofNRMP startedin1987 andtook seven years. Finalappraisal was
delayed to incorporate lessons learned from other projects, implement some prior pilot
operations, and due to an "in transition government" inthe early 1990s. The final project
design benefited from lessons learned andhadthe opportunity to conformto new directions
inGON's development strategy.NRMP's objectiveswerewell articulated andits design
incorporated all ingredients to achieve its objectives -i.e. technical and financial assistance
to communities for the design and implementation o f CBNRMPlans; natural resource
informationupdate andnetworking, researchand studies; policy formulation and
implementation support; and capacity buildingfor all stakeholders.

3.10     The project design precededthe Bank's requirement to elaborate a logical framework,
and the project was not retrofittedwith a lo ical framework later, becauseo f the extensive
M&E systemthat was devised at appraisal. Butretrofittingthe projectwith a logframe
                                                     a
would have simplifiedmatters andmade it possible to check project progress more readily,
since the M&E systemwas very elaborate andcomplicated, which might have been
confusing for those who hadto use it, especially inNiger where national capacities were
limited.

3.11 Taking all these factors into consideration, the overallrelevance o fproject objectives
and design is rated substantial.

EFFICACY
3.12     Despite often qualitative data, a clear trendinreversin environmental degradation
hasbeenobserved inNiger, as reported by the Sahel Studies,2K an assessment study
publishedin2006 onthe impacts ofNRMprojects on desertificationcontrolinNiger. This
studyreviewedthe long-termeffects ofthe differentNRMand landuseplanning activities
for the past 30 years to answer the question whether it paid to invest insustainable land
management. It found that cereal yields increasedby an averageo f 19percent inthe
managedzones; the tree cover became 10to 20 times denser despite rapidpopulation growth;
groundwater levels rose by aremarkable 7 meters insome areas allowing for a dramatic
increaseingardenvegetable farming; women's socioeconomic status improved; andrural-to-



21. Two sets o f indicators were defined at the design stage, for implementationprogress and for impacts at the
level o fboth objectives, and some targets were set. It was not possible to set ex ante targets for all indicators
due to the demand-drivennature o fthe project's investments inthe implementation o f CBNRM plans.

22. The Sahel Studies are part o f the reflections CILSS and its partners have initiatedon the future o fthe United
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification inthe Sahel countries. The study took place inNiger in2005 and
concentrated on the Regions o f Tillaberi, Tahoua, and Maradi where NRMP operated. Itwas carried out by a
multidisciplinary team made up o f scientists from the Moumouni University at Niamey, the Universite Libre o f
Amsterdam, the U S Geological Survey Center, and the InternationalResources Group.

urbanmigrationbecame less significant. NRMPis one o fseveral donor projects23that has
contributed to these achievements. This PPAR, however, focuses on the achievements o f
NRMP's specific objectives as opposed to the long-term objectives o f the government's
National NRMProgram.

appraisal,2 which represented one-third o f the entire population o f the five participating
          Re9arding its first objective, NRMP coveredmore than twice the area it targeted at
districts. Every community that was assisted by the project developed its own CBNRM Plan
andmost communities effectively implementedtheir plans drawing onNRMP's hnds
earmarked for community subproject^.^^ Overall, a net area o f 233,775 ha was coveredwith
improved landmanagement interventions bythe end o f the project, representing 11percent
o f the total gross area o f 2 million hatouchedbythe project.

3.14      NRMPputthe users o fnaturalresources at the center o fthe action, anddemonstrated
how to facilitate sustainable development at the grass-roots level. NRMP's approach elicited
a constructive collective participation from the local communities, and a responsible attitude.
Enthusiasmrose to record levels when NRMP pioneeredthe introduction o f CBPP, an
approach to further foster grass-roots decisionmaking, and later adopted by other donors
such as the EUintheir Rice Project (PAFFUZ, 2002-2007). The introduction o f CBPP was
also cited by government officials to have contributed to GON's efforts inimplementing its
decentralizationlaw. The project also established decentralized andcommunity-driven
financing mechanisms -or savings and credit unions (SCUs) -inseveral areas to support
a multi-sectoral range o f subprojects after its closing. The NRMP's remaining undisbursed
funds, equivalentto US$1.7 million,26were usedto form the SCUs andto help communities
continue with implementing their CBNRM plans untilthe follow-on project -Community
Action Program (PAC) -was approved in2003.

3.15      Communities met bythe PPARmission enumerated many community benefits:27
technology transfer, preservation and increased productivity o f their lands, higher value put
on the natural resources belonging to them, higher revenues, and literacy. They said that it

International Agroforestry Project, and the EUTahoua Rural Development project.
24. The original target was to cover 380 rural communities (then understood as villages or hamlets, with an
average population o f 700), or a total o f270,000 people, livingon a land area o f 1millionha. Ultimately, the
NRMP touched 126rural communities (including 568 villages and hamlets) with an average population o f
4,000, or a total o f over 566,000 people, livingon a landarea o f 2 millionha. This outcome i s related to the fact
that beneficiaries could freely determine the scope o fthe villages/hamlets they considered to envelop their
community, perceived as a group o fpeople recognizing that they share many things incommon, usually a land
area, history, culture, beyond ethnic and language barriers, and determined, under this project to share some o f
their fiture.
25. A bit less than one-quarter o f the 1,300 completed subprojects directly benefited women.
26. The bulko f the project funds, i.e. for the implementation o f the CBNRM plans, were disbursedvery slowly
upto the mid-termreview.After the changes effectedinproject management and the introduction o fCBPP,
disbursement increased more than 3-fold, as described under "Design and Implementation" above. However, at
closing, six months behindschedule, some funds earmarked for implementation o f CBRNM plans remained
unusedbecausesome procurement andreceipt o fcontracts couldnot be finalizedbyclosing. US$1.7 millionof
these finds were then usedto form the SCUs.

would have been very difficult to make a livingwithout the NRMP. They particularly praised
subproject financing whether this was from NRMP's funds proper or the established credit
unions. One community o f farmers was able to purchase livestock and then double its herd,
thereby increasing the fertility o ftheir soils by adding manure.28A group o f women were
able to prevail over their husbands to lease them a large area o f landto plant vegetables
irrigated with the assistance o fthe project. N o w they have extra income and a more
diversified source for feedingtheir families. One farmer benefited from 4 increasingly larger
loans from his community's credit union. His net income from the investmentshe made in
fattening cattle was about US$350, not a small amount inrural Niger. H e used this extra
income to invest inthe rehabilitation o f some o fhis lands and to meet the needs o f his family
for food and clothing. The credit unions o f these communities were reportedto have no loan
recovery issues, andto have increased their operating capital by about 30 percent since their
establishment in2002.

3.16     However, on the downside, GTZ who has financed two NRMprojects since the
1980s inclose vicinity to NRMP-the Agro-sylvo-pastoral Project (PASP, 1998-2003) and
the Fight Against Poverty (LUCOP, 2004-2006) -has reportedthat communities assisted
byNRMPare not engaging inspontaneous sustainable NRMactions. GTZhas further said
that CBPP didnot by itselfbring about a change inattitude towards better NRMas the
project's design stressed more training on the financial aspects rather than the technical.
Other important reasons include the fact that NRMP continued to finance subprojects untilits
closing, to which community co-financing only contributed 5 to 10percent. Unfortunately,
this was echoed bythe president o f the Nikbkrk-Bella community inBirni,who said that now
that they are no longer funded byNRMP, the community suffers and still does not feel
confident enough to be proactive and seek financing from other donors.

3.17     With respect to the second objective, NRMPpresented a revolution inmonitoring
natural resources andbrought together the tools and elements necessary for decisionmaking.
The project was instrumental instrengthening national capacities for mapping and
environmental monitoring through equippingthe National Geographic Institute (IGNN) and
the Ministryo f Environment's Technical Assistance Unit (UTA), and training their staff. As
a result, IGNNproducedthe first reliable digital maps inNiger which used GIS to elaborate
digital geo-reference maps with six layers. This was highly appreciated by the GON and
donors since, previously, Niger could only copy its old maps locally or have them reprinted
inFrance, andwas unableto meetthe donors' needs for specific mapsnecessaryto planand
supervise development interventions. This also enabled the Institute to create derivative
products such as town and touristic maps. Its map sales, which bringinan average CFAFl8
million, or US$26,000, a year, have enabled IGNNto invest inmore equipment. The UTA
builta comprehensive database onnaturalresources andaNaturalResource Information
Network (SIRN), enabling it to produce thematic maps based on the basic IGNNmaps, such
as a land use map for Niger's agricultural zone south o f the 16thparallel. UTA now follows
the evolution o f naturalresources and land use and provides data to decision makers, donors,
and local communities to develop sustainable NRMplans. Their work has made it possible to

deep rootedmistrust and conflicts, the Peul community didnot share or sell its manureproduce to the farmer
community which hadno other means to add manure to their lands to increase their productivity.

track the encroachment o f the GrandSahara from Libya and Chad. Both entities are being
contracted by GONand donors to work on more project^.^'

3.18      The density and substantive training supported byNRMP was highly appreciated by
all the partners indevelopment -GON, donors, and local communities alike. It facilitated
the drafting o f manuals and guidelines on NRM; the development o f simple, standard
contract templates adapted to local community needs and capacities; the design and
implementation of simple participatory monitoring and evaluation systems; and the
adaptation o fprocurement anddisbursement procedures to rural communities, enablingtheir
tendering and supervision o f subprojects. NRMP's training left a residual effect and an
imprintonNiger's development course: keytrainees found themselves electedbythe
communities to municipality councils, and extension agents formed NGOs that partnered
with other projects at NRMP's closing. Through the financing o f studies andconsultancies,
NRMP set the stage for policy formulation andimplementation. Project assistance
contributed to the drafting, implementation andmonitoring o f the Forestry Code; the
National Action Program o f the Convention to Combat Desertification; the Rural
Development Policy Framework; the Law on National and RegionalDevelopment -or
Decentralizationlaw; andNiger's first PRSP in2001.

3.19      NRMP, along with other Bank and other donors' projectsY3'also contributed to the
implementation o fthe Rural Code, Niger's land tenure policy, which creates a platform for
dialogue andpeaceful coexistence between farmers andpastoralists, resolving land
ownership andtenure issues inthe project area o f interventi~n.~~              NRMP financed studies to
develop some texts ofthe Rural Code and the establishment o f Land Tenure Committees
(COFOs) in5 Districts (against only 3 Districts planned at appraisal). Inaddition, 200
grassroots COFOs were created at the village level. These COFOs are playing a key role in
administering legal land titles incompliance with the Rural Code. Landtenure transactions
were deliveredbythese COFOs which facilitated project implementation as approval of
subprojects necessitated clarification on landtenureship inorder not to create conflict.
Opposition by some village chiefs to the implementation o fthe Rural Code has been
recordednationwide because it removedtheir ower over allocating lands, but mitigation
measures have been incorporated inthe Code.'               One incident inthe project area was reported


29. For example, IGNNi s currently negotiating an agreement with the Ministry o f Finance to digitize the land
tenure registry for about CFAFlOO million or US$207,470. UTA has become counterpart to an Italian-financed
project, the Training and Support to Environmental Management Project (PAFAGE), which assists GON inthe
environmental management decision making process. Both entities are also being asked to produce various
maps to GONand donors.
30. Niger has agreed with the donor community that all pertinent donor projects would help inthe formulation,
refining, and implementation o fthe Rural Code. The Bank has beendoing so through training the Rural Code
staff, financing studies to develop some texts within the Rural Code -which is still an evolving document -
and establishing and equipping LandTenure Committees (COFOs) at the district, commune, and community
levels.
31. One farmer expressedhis extreme satisfaction for getting his land title after havingpaid CFAFlO,OOO/ha, or
US$14.00, for surveying and a final CFAF1,000, or US$1.40, to get his legaltitle. Although this couldbe an
enormous expense to most o fthe rural populationinNiger, he said that this was little compared to the peace of
mindhegot andthe knowledge that his heirs willnot have aproblemascertaining their landrights.
32. Mitigation measuresinclude a village committee assisting the chiefs invetting requests for land titling, fully
absorbing the village chiefs inthe democratizationprocess by making them members o fthe COFOs at the

                                                    20


whereby ownership o f a piece o f landwas contested, but this was resolved quickly through
the intermediation o f the community. The PPARmissionwas not able to collect sufficient
data to determine whether women were treated differently when it came to approving and
issuing land titles inthe project area. However, ingeneral, women do not have as easy access
to landas men, although this may improve with the advent o f the Commission to Eliminate
Discrimination Against Women (CEDEF) program which is already ratified by Parliament.
The Permanent Secretary o fthe Rural Code told the PPARmission that it would bebetter at
the moment to concentrate on givingwidows the right to own andmanage the land
inheritance o f their underage orphan children.

3.20      Inspite ofthe shortcomings mentionedinthis PPARinrelationto the project's first
objective, overall project efficacy i s rated substantial.The NRMP elicited a concerted
response by communities to manage their natural resources ina sustainable way, andhelped
the GON increase its capacity to coordinate, formulate and implement NRMpolicies and
strategies, all ofwhich contributedto the noted reversal inenvironmental degradationin
Niger.

EFFICIENCY
3.21      The project preparation team didnot attempt to estimate a financial rate o freturn
(FRR)becauseNRMP included a large institutional support component whose benefitswere
difficult to quantify, andbecause o fthe demand-driven nature of subproject investments
which didnot allow a precise ex-ante determination of the final composition o f community
activities andtheir success rate. However, illustrative benefits andcosts from a sample o f
activities estimated the net present value (NPV) at CFAF20,OOO or US$29,33and the internal
rate o f return (IRR) to range from 16percent to 35 percent. Two socioeconomic impact
assessment surveys (SEIAS) were carried out by independent consultants hired by the
project, one at MTR, and the other at project closing. The social or economic rate o f return
(ERR) for the entireproject was estimated at 41percent, all implementation expenses
accounted for. The ERRincreased to 104percent when operational costs were excluded. The
I C R calculatedthe average NPV for a package o f 10income-generating activities (out o f the
approximate 15 adopted by a large number o f farmers) to be about CFAF37,OOO or US$53.
Activities initiated bywomen though were among those with the lowest NPV (e.g., peanut
oil production, and small animal fattening).34

3.22      The NRMP didnot appear to be as financially efficient as other similar projects such
as the GTZ PASP. Basedon rough calculations made by the PPAR mission, NRMP's costs
per ha o frehabilitated land were about US$62 per ha compared to about US$24/ha for PASP
-about158percentmoretoachievethesameresult.Oneexplanationforthisisthatthe
NRMP financed landrehabilitation and NRMsubprojects at an average o f 90 percent, while
PASP followed a decreasing incentive structure over its 15 years o f existence (1988-2003),


commune and department levels, and the possibilityto complainto the local administration andjustice officials
ifproblemspersist.
33. Based onUS$1 equal CFAF697 in2002.
34. N F V s rangedfrom CFAF9,000, or US$13, for peanut oil production to CFAF304,900, or US$437, for
nursery production. These values canbejuxtaposed against the cost o f one family labor day, whichranged from
CFAF750 or US$1.1 to CFAF1,OOO or US$1.4 inthe project zones.

                                                        21


which totally stopped in 1998.35Nonetheless, the NRMP, on its own, generated a highreturn
on community investments, andthus efficiency is rated substantial.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

3-23    Regarding sustainability o f CBNRM plans, the project effectively demonstrated that
transfer o f responsibilities to rural communities can leadto rapid sustainable development
gains. A number o f first-generation communities appear to have reached a degree o f
autonomy interms o fNRMplanningand implementation. Some second generation
communities have also emerged, aidedby the SCUs created with the encouragement o f the
project andthe deposit o f U w . 7 million, the project's undisbursedfunds at project closing,
with an average amount per community o fUS$14,000 inSeptember 2002. These SCUs have
become an important source o f community self-financing, and ina few cases, such as
Toudou inBoboye District in2002, the CBNRM plans were financed usingSCUs resources
at twice the amount providedby the NRMPproject. These SCUs appear to be well managed
and sustainable as illustrated bythe Asusun Raya Karkara SCUinthe district o f
Dogondoutchi, whose members have increasedby 61 percent since 2003, whose deposits and
guarantee capital increased nine-fold, and whose lending volume three-fold. Inparallel, its
non-repaymentrate decreased from 12percent in2003 to 8 percent in2007. However, the
noted lack o f pro-activity and spontaneity insome communities to seek additional funding
from other donor or their own sources may eventually hamper a continuedprogress inthe
preservation anddevelopment o f natural resources. This PPAR is o f the opinion that this
could very well be true to a varying degree according to the capacity level o f the different
communities, but is certainly exacerbated by the fact that Bank projects are o f a relatively
short duration, compared to those o f some bilateral donors who are inthe country for the
longhaul and whose projects are much smaller ingeographical coverage, thereby allowing
them to give more individual attention to the communities.

3.24    Onthe institutional andNRMpolicy formulation and implementation front, NRMP
helped set the stage for an irreversible institutional process for monitoring and evaluation o f
natural resources bybuildingcapacity within governmental institutions to collect, process,
digitize, andinterpret data followingmodern technologies, as well as produce reliable maps,
all o fwhich can efficiently inform decisionmakers inthe elaboration and implementation o f
NRMpolicies. The two institutions at the baseofthisprocess, IGNNandUTA,havebeen
able to engage with other donors andto offer their services on a commercial basis to the
government and donors alike, as described under the section "Efficacy" above. Inaddition,
IGNNhas beenable to reinvest inits capital equipment and enabled to participate inthe
Global MappingProject -a collective global effort to produce an environmental map o f the
world, including land use at a 1kilometer square resolution, within the Agenda 21
framework adopted at the Earth Summit in 1992. Inparallel, UTA has beenupgraded from a
unitto aDivision-the Divisiono f Statistics andForestryCartography-within the
Ministry o f Environment.




35. The PASP financed landrehabilitation and NRMactivities through a food-for-work programfrom 1988 to
1993, and specific food aid activities before the harvest season, when food shortages occur, from 1994 to 1998.
Financial support to communities stopped totally up to the end o f the project in2003.

                                               22


3.25     The establishment of district andvillage level COFOs, which are now operational and
delivering landtitling transactions, has advancedthe implementation ofthe Rural Code. The
project has also aided GON's decentralization policy throughthe introductiono fthe
innovativeCBPP processwhich hasput communities inchargeo fthe implementation o f
their own development plans. A spirit o f sustainablemanagement o fnatural resourceshas
been largelyinstilledingovernment and local stakeholders through intensive awareness and
training programs, which is now beingperpetuated through key community leaders elected to
office, emergingNGOs whose membershave beentrained byNRMP, and communities
which have been awakenedand are able to elaborate development plans centeredaround the
sustainableuse o ftheir natural resources. Also knowingthat community-level NRMwill
continue to benefit from external financing for the foreseeable future through projects such as
PAC which is the first phase o f an APL, and the GTZ LUCOP, the risk to NRMP's
development outcomes i s considered moderate.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
3.26     The Banktook its time to designNRMP and incorporated carefully analyzed lessons
learned from other projects and its ownpilot operations inother Bank-financed projects. The
final project designhadthe opportunity to conformto new directions inGON's development
strategy. Supervision was extensive andthorough, andwas aidedbymissions fieldedby
BankResidentMissionstaffon anad hoc basis.Two socioeconomic impact assessments
occurred, one in2000 and the other in2002. The project team dealt effectivelywith
implementation issues as these arose such as recommending the redeployment ofproject field
staff; tighteningcontrol over project operational expenses; appraising the follow-on PAC
project; andpreparing a work program covering the transition period. Most importantly, the
project team introduced CBPP which improvedproject performance, and accelerated
implementation anddisbursements.This placed communities at the center o fthe tendering
process for subprojects as well as inthe driver's seat for managing their ownNRMplans,
which facilitated the achievement o fproject objectives and increasedbeneficiary ownership
and the sustainability ofNRMplans. Overall, Bank performance i s satisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
3.27     NRMP was developed at the request o f GONwhose commitment to the project and
its objectives remained consistently highthroughout the project duration. I t worked inclose
collaboration with the Bank to prepare the project, regarded as a key instrument to advance
the RDPFwhich highlightedlanddegradation as the most serious threat to Niger's
development strategy. MDRprovided strong support to the P M Uand gave it a large degree
o f autonomy over project implementation. MDRwas always keento follow up on
supervision recommendations as exemplifiedby its support for the Bank's project TTL
recommendation to introduce CBPP procedures despite some internal objections, viewing
this as part ofthe implementation o fits decentralization policy. MDRalso gave communities
autonomy inowning their NRMplans. It went along with the Bank's project TTL
recommendation to changenational management o fthe project to improveproject
performance. Disagreement over the award o f a contract to one NGO causedthe Bank to
informally suspenddisbursementstwice for short periods. Butthis situation was resolved
quickly. Towards the endo fNRMP, MDRhelpedensure the sustainability ofNRMP's

                                                23


achievementsbytransferring NRMP's physical assets, and as mucho f its human assets as
possible to the follow-on PACproject. Although the GONdidnot pay its counterpart
contributioninfull or ina timely manner, project implementation didnot suffer much.

3.28     As to the implementingagency, its performance was only marginally satisfactory
duringthe first three years ofproject implementation, but improveddramatically after the
change inmanagement, andthe speedy implementation of the Bank's recommendations to
redeploy field staff andto put tight controls on operational expenses. This contributed to a
greater degree o f direct engagementwith communities inthe field, a significant
strengthening inthe PMU's organizational capacity to implement CBNRMplans, andmore
rationaluse o fthe operational budget. This, together with the introductiono f the CBPP
procedures allowedthe implementation o fmore than 77 percent o fthe community projects in
the remaininglife ofthe project. Overall, Borrowerperformance is satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation

3.29     The project design team gaveprominent attention to monitoringand evaluation
withinNRMP. An international consulting firmassistedthe PMUinthe design o fan
elaborate M&E systemwhich covered all aspects o fproject implementation progress,
outputs, and outcome. Theproject selectedfour primary indicators to monitor project
performance during annual reviews-covering NRMplans approved, proportion o fvillage
landplaced under sustainablemanagement systems, implementation level of CBNRMplans,
and the level o f cofinancing by local communities. Impact monitoringand evaluation was
performed at three levels: the individual investment level to appreciatethe efficacy o f each
technology; the community level to measurethe effects o fthe package of actions proposedin
the CBNRMplans; and the overallprogram level to appreciatethe degree to which the
institutional, legal andtechnological support activities createdthe proper enabling
environment for project's success. Reportingwas regular and comprehensive on a trimestrial
and annualbasis.

3.30     A national natural resourceassessmentwas carriedout bythe project towards the
beginningo f its implementation, thereby providing abaseline for monitoringand evaluating
all NRMactivities. Project monitoringwas managedby the PMU's M&E Director and
carried out by the project's regional teams assistedby local technical staff and the full
participationo f community members. M&Eperformance was put under tight supervision
which helpedimprove M&Eprocesses and data collection andmanagement. It also served as
a model for a national M&E systemat the level ofthe UTA. The M&Ewas utilizedbythe
Bank and national project teams andhelped take corrective actions to speed upproject
implementation and increaseproject performance such as the introductiono fthe CBPP and
tighter controls onthe project's operational expenditures. Benefits accruing from M&E
utilizationalso included the updating o f the national databaseon natural resourcesandthe
elaboration o fthematic maps; the drafting o fmanuals and guidelines on NRM;the discovery
o fthe Grand Saharaencroachment from Libya and Chad which is promptingGONto direct
its efforts to addressthe issue; and the ability to participate inthe Global MappingProject to
produce an environmental map of the world, includinglanduse. NRMP's M&E also guided
the appraisal of the follow-on PAC project. M&E i s rated high.

4. Agro-Pastoral ExportPromotionProject (APEP)
Objectives

4.1      The Agro-Pastoral Export PromotionProject (APEP)'s objective is, as statedinits
PAD, `)reducers and exporters are efficiently supplyin the agro-pastoral export market,
reacting to market changes, and seizing opportunities." Theproject was aprivate sector
                                                               4
development intervention, andwas to giveprivate sector enterprises andproducers the tools
for increasedproduction, profitability, andmarketingo f agro-pastoral products, and to
increaseexports to regional and international markets.

DesignandImplementation

4.2      APEP was a five-year project focused on technical assistance and the alleviationo f
physicalbottlenecks to export marketing through a matching grant facility. It had four
components:

    0    Trade PromotionandInformationServices (US$2.10 millionat appraisal, 17
         percent o fproject costs): a cluster o f activities includingproduct andmarket
         identificationand development, and trade information services.

         InstitutionalSupport to ProducerandExporterOrganizations(US$1.30 million
         at appraisal, 11percent o fproject costs): a variety o f support and advisory servicesto
         existing andpotential organizations.

    0    ExportPromotionGrantFacility (US$6 million at appraisal, 50 percent oftotal
        project costs): a demand-driven matching grant facility made available to the
         organizations assistedor formed under the second component.

         ProjectManagement(US$2.65 million at appraisal, 22 percent o ftotalproject costs)

4.3      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified eight risks, expressedas
assumptions, relatingto the efficient use o f information andresearch findings provided
through the project; producers' and exporters' willingness to organize, train, cost-share, and
ability to generateeligible proposals for subprojects' financing; and the ability to secure
competent localproject management and implementation capacity. The project design team
rated two o fthe eight risks as modest and the rest as negligible, and concluded that the
overallrisk rating was modest. The project design factored insuch mitigation measuresas a
proper communication and dissemination strategy, outsourcing, flexible cost-sharing, an
active M&E, and the hiringo f competent staff.

4.4     A Quality EnhancementReview(QER) ofthe project in2000 raisedabroadrange of
issues: highlighting the need for a more precisely definedobjective; questioning whether the
project was designedina way that would help addressthe most critical constraints inthe

                                                          25


export sector;37underliningthe highly supply-driven nature o fthe advisory services; calling
attention to the ambitious nature o f the terms o freference for the project's Steering
Committee (CSO) which was also responsible for vetting subproject proposals; expressing
reservations as to whether the required local capacity existed; and identifying significant
weaknesses inthe analysis o f the environmental impact o fthe project, deeming it too general
with limitedmitigationmeasures. The QER hrther found that the project monitoring system
was one o fthe weakest aspects o f the project design, an issue that was again raisedbythe
mid-term review. It concluded that the difficulty to recruit local project management and
secure implementation capacity constitutedby far the biggest risk for this project.

4.5       The project benefited from stable macro and fiscal policies and GON's continuing
andstrongcommitment to export andprivate sector development. Nonetheless,
implementation problems appeared early on, and several o f the risks identified came to pass.
Itwas harder than thought to recruit key staffsuchas the procurement specialist, aposition
that took more than two years to be filled satisfactorily. Inexperienced staff, and lack o f
internal controls resultedina series o f ineligible expenditures andmisappropriation o f funds.
Procurement delays o f goods and services delayed implementation o f some project activities.

4.6       The project didnot develop a coherent export promotion strategy due to a number o f
factors:

          Critical studies were delayed;
          The PMUwas not proactive incommunicating and working with stakeholders to
          ensure that subprojects were designed and implemented with a view to improve
          export performance;
          The CSO's composition andp e r f ~ r m a n c eadversely affected the decision making
                                                                  ~ ~
          process for approving subprojects;
          The subproject approval process experienced lengthy delays as the CSO failed to
          maintain its plannedmeeting schedule;39
          A misplacedadd-on focus onpoverty alle~iation,~'not includedinthe original
          project design, ledto the approval o f subprojects, even ifthey had a weak dossier and



37. These are: (a) Lack of informationand adherence to quality standardsin agro-pastoralproduction:
ignorance o fprices, selling opportunities, and needs o f foreign consumers; (b) Poor marketinginfrastructure:
Inadequate transport routes and insufficient storage facilities; and (c) Inadequate access to financing: No rural
development banks exist, and most producers and exporters have limitedcapital and no collateral, and are not
eligible for commercial loans.
38. The CSO was composed o f nominated individuals functioning on a pro bono basis, and the proposal
approval process didnot have adequate safeguards against political interference or conflicts o f interest.
39. The chairman o f the CSO explained that convening the committee was a factor o fthe number o f quality
proposals to vet. Since that number was small, there was no needto meet as frequently as planned.
40. The project started out as a non-poverty targeted intervention (PAD, page l), somewhere along the line
                                                                                   but
after Niger's first PRSP was ratified in2001, its focus shifted under pressure to have development investments
benefit the poor to the largest extent possible. Inone example, the mainjustification given by the CSO for
approving a weak dossier has been "poverty reduction" -i.e., that the subproject deserves to be financed
becauseit was submitted by a group whose members are said to bepoor. The poverty focus here was misplaced,
as the project i s more likely to benefit those who are already somewhat skilled, have a certainbusiness acumen,
and are already engaged inproductive agricultural enterprises.

                                                        26


          export prospects,just because they were submitted by groups whose memberswere
          said to bepoor.

4.7       A deficient qualityofsubproject proposalsresultedinanunacceptablerejectionrate
o f 77 percent inthe first period o fproject implementation. This was mitigated, after the
midtermreview, by creatingregionalcommittees for the support ofproject activities
(CRAAPs) to help the PMUpre-screenproposals before submittal to the CSO for final
approval, which helpedreduce the reject rate but causeda significant overrun on the budget
allocated to project management. Finally, the M&E system didnot function as intendedand
didnot help influence decision making.

Outcome

4.8       Although there were somepositive outcomes from the project inrelationto the
organization of the sector and individual revenues from exports, greater awareness o f the
factors that contribute to a successful agro-pastoral export performance, and a better
definition o fthe potential ofthe agro-pastoral export sector, the project's influence on
aggregatenational productionand exports was negligible. Overallproject outcome is rated
unsatisfactory.

RELEVANCE
4.9       The objectives o fthe project were fully aligned with the government's and the Bank's
development and assistancestrategiesat the time. The Bank's 1997 CAS statedthat "the
promotion of open economicpolicies and regional linkages to take advantage of external
growth opportunities" as one o f its three principal goals. The GON adopted an "Agricultural
Growth and RuralPoverty Alleviation Strategy" in 1999 which established agricultural
export development as a key element o fthe government's economic policy inan overall
context that was conducive to increasedrevenues from exports.41The government's first
PRSP in2001provideda framework for implementingsectoral strategies that sought to
achieve significant progresstowards the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and set
forth a national development programaround four central pillars, two o fwhich were: "the
developmentof productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability and
stimulate income generation," and "the strengthening of institutional and individual
capacity within and outside Government, at the central and local level." The PRSP also


41. Inpreparationfor regional integrationunder the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
Nigerhadimplemented a comprehensive tax reforminthe 1990sandreduced and simplified external trade
restrictions. Inparallel, the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994boosted the competitiveness of exports on regional
markets.

                                                      27


identified several sources o f economic growth including expanded trade inagro-pastoral
products within the subregion andbeyond. The Bank's CAS o f 2003 was fully aligned with
the 2001 PRSP inthis respect.

4.10     The GONissued its Rural Development Strategy (SDR) in2003, and the related
action plans in2006. The SDR revolved around 10 structural programs, one o f which is
"professional groups and organization of the commodity chains" with four subprograms
covering capacity buildingfor professional organizations, trade inago-pastoral products,
andprovision o f growth opportunities inthe rural sector. The newly approved PRSP in2007,
echoed the SDR inthat it proposedto support activities within a rural development cluster
program such as diversification o f crop production (targeting crops for which Niger has a
comparative advantage such as onions, nikbk, gum arabic, sweet peas), livestock and
byproducts production (specifically meat and skins and hides), and the development o f
marketing infrastructure (such as facilities for storage and conservation, and export
terminals). These activities were seen as an engine o f accelerated and sustainable economic
growth.

4.11 Thus, APEP's development objective clearly reflectedboththe GON's and the
Bank's past andpresent priorities, but it was too vaguely formulated and overly ambitious to
achieve in5 years inlight o fthe vastly informal and deeply unorganizedcharacteristics o f
the agro-pastoral export sector at the time.

4.12     The project components and activities were aligned with the PDO and could have
contributed to the achievement o fpositive outcomes except for the significant shortcomings
inproject designandimplementation arrangements. This PPARconcurs withthe ICRthat
project designwas unsatisfactory, since the project was not designed inlight o f the country
capacities andbusiness conditions. The principal shortcomings could be summarized as
follows:

         Lack of a strategic, integrated approach to export development. This is evidenced by
         several examples: First, it was known from the appraisal and midterm evaluation
         reports that enterprises and cooperatives that were already active inthe subsectors had
         the highest potential o fbringinginincreased export revenues. Nevertheless, this
         group o fbeneficiaries represented less than 25 percent o ftotal beneficiaries financed
         through the Export Promotion Grant Facility. Second, the project had an imbalanced
         emphasis on activities. It emphasized muchmore the development o fproduction
         capacity among smallholder farmers and on forming individual producer and exporter
         groups as opposed to linkingthem together to develop sustainable supply chains that
         couldprovide feedback on andrespondto market demand.42The project preparation
         team probably felt that representatives ofproducers and exporters would work
         harmoniously together once they were grouped inone commodity chain association.
         Here, the project design failed to take into consideration, for example, the traditional
         informal approach to marketing, or the level o f individualism, illiteracy, andpoverty



42. The mid-term and ICR evaluations identifiednumerous cases where small producers had achieved a
production increase but nevertheless, saw their revenues decline since they were unable to establish linkages
with the export market.

          which were not conducive to a speedy and efficient interaction and cooperation
          between stakeholders.

          Inadequate management structurefor the Export Promotion Grant Facility. At
          project design, there was a growing consensus within the Bank that matching grant
          funds, inorder to be effective, should be managed by independent technical experts,
          preferably from the stakeholder private sector, with clear and transparent criteria and
          ex-post controls by government. The design o f APEP's matching fund didnot reflect
          this c0nsensus,4~butrather gave responsibility to approve subprojects to the CSO
          which was ledby government officials working on a pro bono basis. The result was a
          cumbersome approval process without adequate safeguards against political
          interferenceor conflicts o f interest, and no coordinated action towards improving
          agro-pastoral export performance.

          Inadequate number of the PMUstaffand regional representation. For a project that
          was national incoverage and innovative innature, PMUstaffing was glaringly
          deficient. The central PMUwas composed o f one coordinator, 9 specialists, and two
          satellite offices were staffed with one PMUrepresentative each. Evenwith the
          possibility o f outsourcing some tasks, project staff were not able to get a grip on
          project implementation.

          Inadequate awareness of the signiJicant implementation risks. The PAD listed eight
          risks,deeming most ofthem negligible, thereby removing the necessity for project
          design to devise stronger mitigationmeasures. The implementation experience
          showed that most o fthese risks did significantly hamper the achievement o f the
          project's objective.44One risk was not anticipated at design, relating to the capacity
          o f the PMUto screen subproject proposals. Indeed, the PMUrequired continuing
          capacity buildingsupport throughout the duration o f the project andhad to be
          reinforced by the addition o f the CRAAps, which inturn contributedto a significant
          cost overrun for project management (by about US$2 million, equivalent to twice the
          original allocation).

4.13      The PAD included an extensive logical framework with numerous output and
outcome indicators at the PDO and component levels. Since the PDOwas vaguely stated, the
indicators didnot fare better, andwere to a great extent, inadequate, unclear andnot
measurable. They were not time-bound either. After the midtermreview, the PDO indicators


43. As mentionedinthe ICR, page 15, the originalproject designcalled for complete delegation o fproject
management to a team o f independent experts. At the objection o f GONthat the capacity for managing such a
project didnot exist inNiger, a compromise was reached whereby the PMUwas to manage components 1and
2, and assess the validity o f sub-project proposals under component 3 -the core o fthe project. The final
decision on these proposals was to be taken by the CSO.
44. Examples included the inability o fmany producer and exporter organizations to articulate their demand
effectively, which resulted inan initial 77 percent reject rate inproposals; the difficulty to mobilize expert
project staff which resulted inineligible expenses and misappropriation o f fimds; the system abuse inaccessing
matching grants whereby many associations were associations inname only and inreality were a front for a few
individuals to gain access to grant financing; and the faulty decision making process on the part o fthe CSO in
selecting subproject proposals to be financed by the project, many o f which were neither economically viable
nor alleviated poverty ifthis was the intention.

                                                           29


were revised andmade more specific and measurable, but this revision didnot have any
bearing since the M&E system never monitored outcomes but rather, only project inputs and
 some outputs (discussed further below). While an environmental analysis was conducted at
project preparation, the QERpointed out that this contained limitedmitigation measures and
 inadequate guidance on responsibilities, scheduling, costs, andprocedures for processing
projects.

4.14     The significant shortcomings inthe design and implementation arrangements indicate
that the project didnot incorporate the extensive lessons o fpast operations relating to clear
objectives andperformance indicators, an effective monitoring and evaluation system, the
 sustainability o f investments, and eliciting an entrepreneurial spirit among benefi~iaries.~~
Therefore, inspite o fthe relevance o f the project PDO, overall relevance i s rated modest.

EFFICACY
4.15     Project outcome indicators -increased production and exports o fproject
beneficiaries, and decreased transport costs -were                not monitored on a regular basis. But
according to one-time data compiled by the project M&Etowards the end o f the project,
APEP assisted the export associations insigning 15 export contracts worth o fabout
US$846,000 duringthe life ofthe project. This represented 0.4 percent o fnational exports o f
agro-pastoral products over the same period. Data compiled by the PPARmission46indicates
that national export revenues from the commodities supported bythe project47decreased by
an average o f 21 percent from 2002 to 2006. Only two commodities supported by the project
showed an increase inexport revenues for the same period: gum arabic whose revenues
quadrupled, andhides and skins whose revenues increased by 20 percent. National export
quantities o f all commodities supported by the project decreased on the most part, except for
onions, gum arabic, and hides and skins which increased by 39 percent, 365 percent, and 27
percent, re~pectively.~~      This leads to the conclusion that APEP could have usedits resources
better by concentratingon fewer commodities, those that were the most remunerative and
had a chance to impact exports the most.

4.16     The effects on individual beneficiaries' revenues were mixed. Evidence compiled at
the time o fthe mid-term review indicated that some beneficiary producers saw their revenues
decrease although their production increased because they could not connect with export
markets, so that their incremental production didnot bringinthe additional hoped for


45. PAD, pages 11 and 12.
46. Calculations based onnational statistics published bythe National Institute o f Statistics (INS) and on data in
select donors reports. Figures are not available for all commodities supported by the project.
47. The agro-pastoral commodities supported by the project were seven: gum arabic, livestocWmeat, nikbe,
onions, sesame, skinand hides, and sweet peas.
48. Several factors come to play inthe decreasing trend innational exports of agro-pastoral products over the
2002-2006 period. Production and exports o f ago-pastoral commodities were severely affected by the 2004
drought and locust infestation. Crops and animals were lost due to lack o f water, feed and greater vulnerability
to disease. Inaddition, official export statistics do not record exports made through the informal channels,
which are said to reflect somewhere from 10to 50 percent o f total exports. I t is noted here that international
prices didinfluence export revenues as inthe case o f onions, whose exports intonnage increased but the
monetary equivalent decreased.

                                                         30


revenues.49Onthe other hand, the ICRreports that business turnover for some export
associationsincreasedby 10percent to 500 percent -the latter beingone exceptional case
o f an onion exporter. Empirical evidence collected bythe PPARmissionindicated that some
beneficiaries saw a significant increaseinexport revenues as a direct result o fAPEP's
assistance, from 35 percent to 100percent.50All thesebeneficiaries showed amarked
entrepreneurial spirit, market knowledge, and a keen sense o fbusiness which contributed to
their success.

4.17      MDRanddonors credit APEP for beingthe first project inNiger to work onthe
commoditychain approach. Other donors followed suit, such as FA0which financed the
elaboration of a national strategy for gum arabic in2002-2003, andthe EUwhich financed
an ago-pastoral census in2004. APEP had an important strategic effect by demonstrating the
export potential for ago-pastoral products, andmakingNigerknown on the regional and
international level as an exporter o f ago-pastoral products.51APEP had a significant effect
on severalvital aspectso f the ago-pastoralexport sector, including (a) improvingthe
availability and quality o finformationon product prices and market opp~rtunities;~~                     (b)
assisting inthe creation o f a national standardscommittee in2004 inside the Ministry
responsible for Commerce which issued two project laws on standards for onions and dried
meat in2006; and (c) most importantly, helpingto restructure rural and export organizations
around commodity chains -ahighly appreciatedbenefit since it helpedstakeholders group
into commodity-centered associations, to get to know eachother, to work together, and to
beginto explore the collective interest andbenefit. The final achievement o fthis activity was
the creation ofthe Niger Agency for Export Promotion(ANIPEX), the apex organization o f
ago-pastoralproducer and exporter association, lodged at the Chamber o f Commerce to
create synergy and to foster sustainability. Byway o ftransition arrangements, the
responsibility for providing services to producer and exporter organizations at project closure
was transferred to ANIPEX. Several donors considered the idea and establishment o f
ANIPEX to bethe most important outputs ofthe project.



49. MidtermReview aide-mkmoire, page 3, and ICR, page 8.
50. This i s illustrated by two examples: (a) A livestock fattening enterprise, headedby a woman, which
benefited from APEP through investments ininfrastructure (fences, storage hangar, milkingmachines, etc.).
This business was able to increase the efficiency of its operation, double and increase the productivity o fits
stock inanimals, and increase its exports after contacts made withthe assistanceo fAPEP. The woman business
manager's share o f the benefits accrued allowedher to send two o fher children to study abroad; (b) An
association o fnikbk exporters (SOCOPAP) which benefitedfrom a storage hangar near the border with Nigeria,
trade promotion events, etc. Its revenues from exports increasedby 35 percent since project closure in2005, as
they were able to penetrate new export markets inGhana and Togo as a direct result o fAPEP's trade promotion
activities. They cite other benefits such as increased business net worth and the ability to access larger loans
becauseo ftheir increased turnover.
5 1.APEP succeededinpresentingNiger as an exporter of gum arabic with an important tonnage o f good
quality, according to GONand GTZ.
52. Informationwas disseminated through several publications, two o f which were publishedby the project, and
a project website. Trade promotion events and exchange visits o f Nigerien and neighboring countries' traders
took place withproject support. A number of studies were commissioned covering export potential to the
subregion, quality norms, etc. APEP also provided capacity building support for the crop and livestock Market
InformationSystems (SIMs) whichprovided informationon national markets; and the creation o f a freight
exchange mechanismwhich aimed to provide informationon transport services.

                                                31


4.18      However, this APEP-sponsored institutional reform inthe rural and export sector
generated much criticism as well. APEP should have placedmore emphasis on instilling an
entrepreneurial and professional spirit inmore stakeholders, and on strengthening the
linkages betweenproducers and exporters so that information on opportunities and market
standards would flow freely, and exports o fhighquality incrementalproduction would result.
The PPARmission found evidence to support these criticisms. Producers and exporters
expected to have the costs o f their market prospectiontravels covered by outside entities such
as donor projects, ANIPEX, or the Chamber o f Commerce. Many o f the organizations that
were formed during the project time periodno longer exist, suggesting that manywere
facades, formed only to access project funds. The production-export sector is still not
professionalized-contracts are not formalized inwriting, traders sell what they can get
from farmers, not what the market asks for, and little or no feedback is given to farmers on
market needs. ANIPEX draws much o fthis criticism since it was not able to generate funds
and, thus, could not provide services to its members inthe form o f training, collection and
dissemination o fprices and data on export markets, and connections to new export markets.
It was not able also to recruit new members, andto assume the role o f a strategic partner or
forge relationships with other donor projects to help export the extraproduction o fproducer
organizations supported by other donors. Its membership dwindled since APEP closed-
ANIPEX now counts only a dozenmemberscomparedto 100members at project closure.

4.19     APEP's positive outcomes are the reasons why MDRconsiders the project a success,
while the ICR views the outcome as unsatisfactory. MDRdidnot expect to significantly
increase agro-pastoral exports by the end o f the five-year project, when no financing was
provided directly to farmers for inputs andto exporters to buy the produce and transport it to
its destination markets. MDRviewed APEP as only preparing the ground, an essential and
unavoidable step for increased exports.

4.20     However, inlight o f APEP's stated objective, its few strategic and institutional
successes, and notwithstanding its positive outcomes on select individual beneficiaries, this
PPARrates efficacy as modest.

EFFICIENCY
4.21     The PAD had estimated an economic rate o f return (ERR) of 48 percent to
demonstrate the soundness o f the project. This analysis was based on a cost-benefit
methodology that calculated economic and financial returns using the "with-project and
without-project" criterion. The ICR questioned whether this methodology was appropriate
giventhat it applied primarily to projects with benefits measurable inmonetary terms, and
stated that data was not available to conduct a reliable ex post cost-benefit analysis. Three o f
APEP's four components -information services and trade promotion, capacity building,
and project management -were       difficult to quantify inmonetary terms and only the Grant
Facility component had the potential to generate export revenues. But the cost-benefit
methodology was inappropriate for measuring the potential benefits o f this component as
well, since the matching grants were not based on a clear-cut threshold for ERRbut were
also meant to satisfy social targets such as benefiting women's groups or other organizations
o f relatively poor individuals. The ICR concluded that the cost-effectiveness methodology
would have been a better choice as it applies to projects which benefits cannot be quantified.

                                                         32


4.22     APEP demonstratedthat it could have a spectacular effect on individualbeneficiaries,
butnot a significant aggregateeffect onthe agro-pastoral export sector as awhole. Itis not
possible to calculate an ERR for the subprojects financed byAPEP,53since only 25 percent
o fthe Grant Facility funds went to enterprises that had the potentialto bringinrevenues from
exports. Butit canbe safely assumedthat the ERR for the subprojects, ifthese couldbe
calculated, would not match the 48 percent mentioned inthe PAD. Comparing the costs o f
the subprojects (which amounted to US$5.5 million) with the value o f exports that ensued
(US$846,000), one caninfer that APEP was not an efficient investment from apurely
financialperspective. Efficiency i s thus rated modest.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

4.23     Thepicture is not encouraging, lookingex post at the status ofthe producers and
exporters associationssupportedby the project, the state of the trade promotion and
information services, andthe likelihood o f continued improvements inproductionand
exports o fthe subprojectsthat were successful. Only 8 months after project closure, the ICR
pointedout that only 40 percent o fthe 57 organizations that received project support were
functional andthat an even smaller portion could survive independentlyfrom the project. The
PPAR mission found that this predictioncame true since only about a dozen organizations
(compared to 100at project closure) are payingmembers o fANIPEX, the intended successor
to APEP. ANIPEX itselfi s struggling andreports that the membership dues are not sufficient
for it to provide services to its members.At the intellectuallevel, it has not beenable to
develop a viable strategy, to the disillusionment o fone DutchNGO which was ready to
partner with ANIPEX andprovide it with technical assistance.

4.24     The exporters whom the PPARmissionmet lamented that comprehensive
informationonprices and opportunities on export markets i s no longer collected. While they
try to get information from their contacts inneighboringcountries, they reportedthat this is
not enough. The EUi s assisting the Ministryo f Animal Resourcesto acquire andpublish
informationon the markets inNigeria, but the related project i s too limitedinits scope and
coming to an end soon. The producers and exporters who were assistedby APEP reported to
the PPAR missionthat funds were needed to maintainthe level o fproductionattained and
the infrastructure acquired at the time o f APEP. The majority o fthem didnot meet the
eligibility criteria54for loans from commercial banks, andthey foundit difficult to access
financing except sporadically from other donor projects, and not necessarily for the activities
needed.55

4.25     Inconclusion, riskto development outcome is highwithout continued foreign
support. The GONis currently preparing a new export promotionproject for Bank
financing.56

BankandBorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
4.26    APEP was a fast-track project, taking only about six months from concept to
appraisal. Despite this short periodo ftime, the preparation team was able to develop a
strategically relevant operation. However, as detailed under"Relevance", a QER identified
significant shortcomings inthe project's design andimplementation arrangementsfrom the
start, which the MTRhighlightedagain at midterm. Followingthis, some improvements
were made byrevisingthe performance indicators, focusing the project on a limitednumber
o fhigh-value products, and adopting a more demand-driven approach towards advisory
services. However, there were no substantial improvements inthe implementation
arrangements, or the M&E approach.

4.27    The Bank's Quality Assurance Group conducted a Quality o f Supervision Assessment
(QSA) in2004, which found that the project team was proactive insecuring a PHRD grant to
provide intensive capacity-building for the PMUwhen it was needed, inbringinginoutside
specialists to the MTR who addedsubstantial value to the process, and intaking the
necessary steps to resolve the issue of ineligibleexpenditures, including actions taken bythe
CountryDirector. On the other hand, the QSA found that supervision engagedmostly in
problem-solving, which overshadowed attention to the export promotionobjectives which
were the heart ofthe project, to the selection ofbest quality subprojects, to monitoringof
project progress, andto environmental and safeguards issues. The QSA rated quality o f
supervision marginally satisfactory.

4.28    Dueto the shortcomings indesign, implementation arrangements, and supervision
which contributed heavily to the inability o fthe project to monitor its progress and achieve
its objective, Bank performance i s rated unsatisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
4.29    Initially, MDR wantedAPEP to finance exports outright but gradually showed
commitment to APEP's concept andmaintained its commitment to private sector
development throughout the project's duration. The implementingagency, MDR, cooperated
closely with the Bank's project TTL to resolve some o fthe implementation issues identified
bythe MTR, butkeptquestioning APEP's approach that didnot include a line ofcredit for
farmers, and didnot correct the deficiencies identified inCSO performance. Shortcomings in
the technical and financial analysis o f subprojects and inrespect o fthe eligibility criteria
were evident.

4.30    The P M Unever developed a strategic plan to guide the formulation and analysis o f
subprojects, and lackedpro-activityincommunicating and working with stakeholdersto
ensure that subprojects were designed and implementedwith aview to improve the export
performance o fthe subsectors.Financialmanagementwas lacking as were subproject
approval process, andmonitoring and evaluation. Bank management hadto allocate
additional resourcesto support its project supervision team and to finance extra technical
assistancefor the PMU. This translated into a gradually improving performance towards the
endofthe project, butno improvements took place with respectto M&E. Inthis light, this

                                                34


PPAR downgrades the ICR's rating o fBorrower performance from moderately
unsatisfactoryto unsatisfactory.

MonitoringandEvaluation

4.31    Deficiencies inM&Edesign are rooted inthe vaguely stated project objective, and
the choice o fnumerous indicators that were to a great extent, inadequate, unclear andnot
measurable, as well as there being only one PMU staff responsible for M&E at the sub-
national and national levels, who was responsible for monitoring project management and
results, and supervising the monitoring and evaluationo f environmental impact o f
subprojects. These responsibilities were too much for one person alone, considering the
national coverage o f the project andthe wide ranging subproject activities. Indicators were
not time-bound and didnot include simple andmeasurable indicators, such as the number o f
export contracts signedbyNigerien exporters, the types and quantities o fproducts available
for export produced byproject beneficiaries, exports byproject beneficiaries, etc., which
would havemade it possible to monitor project progress, inform decision making, and
measure project outcomes. Although a baseline study was envisaged at appraisal, this was
not conducted until2003, halfway through the project. After the mid-term review in2003,
the PDO indicators were revised andmade more specific and measurable but still difficult to
collect data for.

4.32    M&Eimplementationmainlyinvolvedpresenting data inannual reports onproject
inputs and outputs, i.e. disbursements, procurement, training, fairs/workshops, external visits,
studies, andnumber of subprojects. Towards the end o f the project, a final M&Ereport
included the measurement o f suchindicators as the number, volume and value o f the
contracts signed by the beneficiary exporters o f the project up to 2004. This information
would have been o f great value ifit hadbeen collected and analyzedperiodically since the
beginning o f the project. Unfortunately this was not the case, and the information didnot
have the opportunity to influence decisionmakingon subproject selection andthe allocation
o fthe matching Grant Facility funds, nor did it help the project inthe much neededtask o f
defininga strategy to help increase overall exports o fagro-pastoral products. The QER, the
MTR, andthe QSA all pointedto the weak M&Edesign and implementation. Thus, the
overall quality o fproject monitoring and evaluation i s rated negligible.


5.      Other Issues (Safeguards, Fiduciary, Unintended
        Outcomes-PositiveandNegative)

PilotPrivateIrrigationProject(PPIP)

5.1     The PPP demonstrated the profitability o f small-scale irrigation andhelped launch it
on a national scale. Small-scale irrigation draws heavily on Niger's underground water
resources from shallow aquifers, some o f which are fragile and do not regenerate above the
rate at which water is being extracted. The GON's capacity to monitor aquifer withdrawal is
not yet up to speed and at the requisite level, which ifnot given adequate attention, may
cause the expansion o f remunerative small-scale irrigation to turn into a highenvironmental
risk.

                                                 35


NaturalResourcesManagementProject(NRMP)

5.2      The introductiono f CBPP significantly improved community ownership and
motivationto engage insustainablenatural resourcesmanagementpractices. An unintended
beneficialeffect was departing from the previous practice o frelying upon cumbersome
government procurement procedures and large businesses and contractors basedinthe
capital, and selecting local enterprises instead, often from the informal sector, betterknown
bycommunitymembersandwith whom negotiations were easier. Thisprocess strengthened
local enterprise andhad a positiveimpact on the local economy. It also builtup the
negotiating andtendering capacities o f communities and inmany cases revealedhitherto
unknowncapabilities within largely illiterate communities.

5.3      Disagreement over the award and conditions o f a contract to one localNGO,
ONVPE, to provide advisory servicesto communities, causedthe Bank to informally
suspenddisbursementstwice for short periods becauseONVPE was not fulfilling the terms
o f its contract and was not adhering to its status o f anNGO. But this situation was resolved
quickly with the support o fMDR.

Agro-PastoralExportPromotionProject(APEP)

5.4      APEP was designatedas an environmental category B operation, subjected to a
partialenvironmental assessment as well as an environmental analysis at projectpreparation.
Nonetheless, the QER identifiedsignificant weaknesses inthe analysis o fpotential
environmental impacts, pointing out that the project's environmental assessment document
contained limitedmitigationmeasuresand inadequate guidance on responsibilities,
scheduling, costs, andprocedures for processing projects. The MTR and QSA reportednon-
compliance with the Bank's safeguardpolicy on involuntary resettlement. The PPAR mission
was told that this involvedsubproject financingto groups o f farmers to intensifytheir crop
production. The FA0 expert participatinginthe MTRreported that APEP had financed
several crop productionintensification subprojects with parcel fencing on pasturelands and
traditionaltranshumance corridors. Since pastoralists lost access to these traditional
pasturelands and corridors, the Bank's safeguard on involuntaryresettlement should have
been triggered. The project arguedthat this was not the case becauseAPEP never financed
subprojects on lands without aproper landtitle, and that project funds went to groups andnot
individuals which meant that prior community approval hadbeen given. However, funding
subprojects financed by groups or associations does not automatically mean that everyone in
the group has agreedto a courseo f collective action andthat there is no needto monitor the
compensation process through the elaboration and implementation o f a resettlement plan.
Landuse conflicts arise easily ina country like Nigerwhich is known for its pastoralism and
transhumance. The project designteam should have anticipated an issue o f this type, and
incorporated mitigationmeasuressuch as a proper investigation, a resettlement plan, or
resettlement policy framework, since the risk existed.

5.5      Concerning fiduciary compliance, the PMU's inexperienced staff, and lack o f internal
controls resulted ina series o f ineligibleexpenditures and misappropriation o f funds totaling
US$115,000, as well as a numbero f delays injustifying expenditures. The situation
improved when the PMUrecruited a more competent procurement specialist, and the Bank's

                                                36


project management provided intensive capacity buildingon fiduciary aspects inthe form o f
a long-term technical assistance.


6. Lessons and Considerations for Future Development
6.1     Several lessons -bothpositive and negative -relating to project design have
emerged from this review:

  (1)   Empoweringcommunitiesto take controlof the implementationof their own
        developmentplansimprovescommunityownershipandmotivationto engage in
        sustainabledevelopmentpractices.

6.2     As demonstratedbythe example o fboththe PPIP andthe NRMP, eliciting demand
for low-cost small-scale irrigationtechnologies by farmers inthe PPIP, and putting
communities incharge o f designing, recruiting and paying for the implementationo f their
collectively developed community development plans inthe NRMP, resulted inthe
successhl achievement o f project objectives. Inboth cases, intensive sensitization and
awareness campaigns as well as regular direct contact with the targeted beneficiaries were at
the base o fprojects' activities.

6.3     Inthe caseofPPIP, welltargeted andinnovativepublicity towards farmers-
including radio and TV broadcasts, road-side demonstrations, and seasonal leasing o f
equipment with no obligation to buy-played a decisive role intechnology promotion and a
steady increase intheir adoption despite the population's low literacy rate. Farmersmade
investments inthe purchase and installation o f small-scale irrigation equipment almost totally
from their own funds and through the community saving andcredit unions (SCUs) which
they formed. Funds for these SCUs were mobilized almost totally by farmers themselves,
with the exception o ffive out o fthe 27 SCUs established, which benefitedfrom small donor
trust hnds.

6.4     Inthe caseofNRMP,theintroductionofCBPPputgrassrootsbeneficiariesatthe
center o f the action, and significantly improved community ownership and motivation to
engage insustainable natural resource management practices, as demonstrated bythe fact
that 77 percent o f the requests for financing from project funds were presented after the
CBPPwas put into effect. An unintendedbeneficial effect was the unique opportunity to
depart from the common practice o f relyingupon cumbersome government procurement
procedures and large businesses and contractors based inthe capital. The selection o f local
enterprises instead had a positive impact on the local economy.

6.5     APEP took only about six months for its preparation anddesign. As a result, the
project design ideas didnot mature enough. The preparationprocess failed to define the
broad lines o f an export strategy for ago-pastoral products, and the poor design didnot
match country capacities and business conditions. Nor didthe preparation team anticipate the
seriousness o fthe implementation risksit identified, almost all o f which came to pass while

                                                  37


the proposedmitigation measureswere not effective, which contributed heavily to an
unsatisfactory project outcome, despite the strategically relevant objectives. Inaddition, one
riskrelatingto the capacity ofthe PMUto screensubproject proposals was not identified.
This contributed to a significant cost overrun o fproject management costsby about US$2
million, equal to twice the original allocation.

6.6     A project such as APEP shouldhavebeen apilot operation, or a first time-slice ofa
longer APL investment operation, giventhe difficult environment it hadto navigate through.
This includedthe first attempt to take acommodity chain approach to marketingand exports,
a nonexistent export strategy, a highlyinformal export sector, inadequate availability of local
technical andmanagerial expertise, a highly individualistic culture among stakeholders, an
insufficient entrepreneurial spirit, a low literacy rate, and an insufficient exposure to foreign
market standards. A pilot could have preparedthe ground, determining the best commodities
to concentrate on, and focusing on linking exporters to producers. Subsequentinvestments
could have then assisted stakeholdersover a longer haul to maximizerevenues from exports.

        chain approachneedsto emphasizeproducer-exporterlinkages.

6.7     Theprevailingeconomic situation inNiger hadestablished an enabling environment
for export development. The GONhadengagedina comprehensive tax reform, reducing and
simplifyingexternal trade restrictions inpreparation for regionalintegration underthe West
African Economic and MonetaryUnioninthe 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ the devaluation o f the CFAF in
                                                            and
1994hadboostedthe competitiveness o f exports on regionalmarkets. However, APEP was
not able to positionNiger to take advantageo fthese favorable conditions for two main
reasons: the absenceo f a coherent export strategy, andmissinglinks betweenproducers and
exporters.

6.8     APEP didnot help define an export development strategy early on. Thus, it allocated
its matching funds on subprojects on an ad hoc basis, spreading its resourcestoo thinly and
not focusing on commodities that hadthe best export potential, such as onions and the
livestock sector. A misplaced add-on focus onpoverty alleviation, not includedinthe
originalproject design, exacerbatedthis situation, leading to the approval o f subprojects,
even ifthey had a weak dossier,just becausethey were submittedby groups whose members
were said to bepoor. As aresult, enterprises that were somewhat skilled, hada certain
business acumen, were already active inthe commodity subsectors, and hadthe highest
potentialo fbringinginincreasedexport revenues representedless than 25 percent o f total
beneficiaries financed through APEP.

6.9     Although APEP was praised for its institutional buildingo fproducer andexporter
associations, it neglectedthe importance oflinkingthem together to develop sustainablesupply
chains with free-flowing informationon opportunities andmarket standards, so that exports o f
highqualityincrementalproductionwouldresult. These linkagesdidnot form spontaneously
either, as traders still triedto sell what they could get from farmers, not what the market asked
for, and little or no feedback was givento farmers on marketneeds andstandards. Here, the
project didnot take into consideration, for example, the traditional informalapproachto
marketing, or the levelo findividualism, illiteracy, andpovertywhich were not conducive to a
speedyandefficient interaction andcooperationbetween stakeholders.

  (4)   Similar agriculturaldevelopmentprojectsinneighboringcountriescan have
        oppositeoutcomesdue to the qualityof projectpreparatioddesign,the levelof
        engagementof the implementingagencies,andthe prevailinglandtenure
        securitysituation.

6.10    Itis interesting to notethat similar projects with similar development objectives -
small-scale irrigationpromotion and agricultural products export promotion -implemented
intwo neighboring countrieswith similar socio-economic conditions-Niger andMali-
had opposite outcomes.57

6.11 Niger's PPIP, which was approved inFY95, had a highly satisfactory outcome while
Mali's PPIP, which was approvedtwo years later inFY97 had a highlyunsatisfactory
outcome. The major differences betweenthe two projects which resulted intheir opposite
outcome ratings concern the level o f engagement o fthe implementing agency and the degree
o f landtenure security.

6.12    Niger's PPIP implementing agency, ANPIP, was fully engaged inproject activities
and worked very closely with the farmers. The successhl testing o f simple low-cost and
high-return small-scale irrigationtechnologies, the encompassing andeffective
demonstration and dissemination o f tests results, and the creation o f advisory services groups
helpedmotivate farmers and generate highinterest in, anddemand for, the small-scale
irrigation technologies to the extent that Nigerien farmers investedinthese technologies from
their own meager resources. Although these activities were built into the design o f Mali's
PPIP, the project's implementing agency -the Agricultural Supply Chain Promotion
Agency (APROFA)-was not fully engaged. It was implementing another Bank project, the
Agricultural Trading and Processing Promotion Pilot Project (ATPPP) and didnot devote
sufficient time to PPIP, work closely with the farmers, or activate project activities on time to
generate demand for small-scale irrigation from farmers. It showed little interest inPPIP
which resulted inits highlyunsatisfactory outcome.

6.13    Another factor that played a decisive role inthe respective outcome ratings o fboth
projects was landtenure security. Niger, aided by the international community, had decided
to put land tenure security at the heart o fnational development, andwas fully committed to
provide farmers andpastoralists with the incentive o f land tenure security -whether land
ownership or land-use rights -to motivate them to invest intheir lands and livestock herds.
Niger's government simplified the process bydecentralizing it to the community level
through the establishment o f Village LandTenure Commissions, and subsidized its costs.
Since the GONis fully committed to this process, it has also built inlegal measures to protect
the rights o f land ownership seekers. Suchwas not the case inMali which decidednot to
tackle this thorny subject yet. As a result, Malian farmers hesitated to invest inlands that they
didnot officially owninfear o fhavingtheir land-use rrrights'rrevoked when these lands
gained invalue due to the investments inirrigation. This was demonstrated bythe fact that
Mali's PPIP generated initial highinterest and demand by farmers to participate inproject
activities -which included a small land tenure component to encourage farmers to start the
process o f formalizing their landtenure situation. Once farmers understoodthat this

development projects inMali- Report No. 40206, dated June 25, 2007 -which has beenpublicly disclosed.
The same consultant, Jumana Farah, preparedbothPPARs.

component was not going to finance all the costly and centralized process, which outcome
would not benecessarily respectedbythe village chiefs, farmers lost interest inthe project
anddidnotparticipate inPPIP. Mali's PPIP resultedinonly 10hao frehabilitated irrigated
landandno new investments insmall-scale irrigationschemes, comparedwith the
expectation at appraisal o f 400 ha o frehabilitated irrigatedland andthe establishment o f 600
ha o fnewlyirrigated land.By contrast inNiger, it is estimated that an additional 1,100 ha
were put into use through the promotiono f small-scale irrigationtechnologies.

6.14    As to the agricultural export promotionprojects inMali andNiger, Mali's
Agricultural Trading andProcessingPromotionPilot Project (ATPPP) which was approved
inFY95 hadamoderately satisfactory outcome, whileNiger's Agro-Pastoral Export
PromotionProject (APEP) which was approved inFYOl had an unsatisfactory outcome. This
was despitethe fact that bothprojects faced the same challenging environment to their
implementation, i.e., a highly informal sector, limitedaccess to information, technical and
marketing know-how, weak professional associations, inadequate access to credit, lack o f
export infrastructure, andineffective quality control o f exports. The opposite outcomes can
be attributed to shortcomings imbeddedinproject preparation anddesign.

6.15    To start with, Mali's ATPPP took four years from inceptionto Board approval which
made it possible to holdparticipatoryworkshops with potentialprivate sector beneficiaries,
to establish an export promotionstrategy and action plan, to test private initiatives inagro-
processing, to test internal and export markets and transport modes, and to conduct specific
studies. This in-depth preparation processhelpedthe design ideasto mature, and to
realistically assess the country's capacities andother implementation risks which allowedthe
elaboration ofmitigationmeasuresthat provedeffective. Most importantly, ATPPP was
designed as apilot operation due to the challenging environment it hadto navigate through.
Despite the testing o fproject ideas, the conduct o f studies, and the elaboration o f an export
strategy, the design team still felt necessaryto widenthe testingthrough ATPPP rather than
engageina fill-fledged operation. Incomparison, Niger's APEP took only six months from
inceptionto Boardapproval. The hastyprocessresultedina shallow analysis o fthe
implementation risks andineffectivemitigationmeasures. A key factor o f success such as the
elaboration of a solid andintegrated export strategy which should have guided the funding of
subprojects didnot get proper attention.

6.16    Inaddition, Mali's ATPPP financed therehabilitation or establishment ofcollective
export infrastructure such as handling/processing and storage facilities, while APEP included
a matching grant facility that dispensedhighly subsidized finds to individual associations of
producers or exporters. This probably influenced the divergingoutcomes o f the two projects.
Itmighthave causedMalianexporters to work harder to maximizetheir profits from the use
o fthe collective assets which were accessibleto the differentgroups at predetermined and set
times, while the Nigerienexporters were secure inhavingthe assets on their own lands
whether they made use o fthem or not. Finally, staffing o f the regionalbranches o f the
projects' implementingagencies seems also to have influenced project outcomes. Mali's
ATPPP regionalbrancheswere each staffed with 3 high-level staffinaddition to 4 support
staff, while Niger's APEP regionalbrancheswere only composedo f one project
representativewith 2 support staff. APEP's regional staffwere not able to get aproper handle
onproject activities, nor to follow beneficiaries closely.
