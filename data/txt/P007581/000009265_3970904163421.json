      development program for the State of Chiapas, in\n            Southeastern Mexico.  The Chiapas Development Plan is\n            designed to address the main constraints to the development\n            of the State through an integrated approach placed in the\n            context of a wider development scheme for the southeastern\n            region of the country.  At the core of this program are the\n            investments required to achieve a more balanced\n            socioeconomic development in the areas of influence of the\n            proposed parallel agriculture and rural roads projects.  The\n            project supports the initial phase of this program through\n            execution of an agricultural development program in\n            coordination with other social and economic development\n            efforts.  The project covers an area of about 317,500 ha.\n            To achieve its objectives the project provides for:  (a)\n            construction of flood control and road works; (b)\n            strengthening of administration; (c) carrying out on-farm\n            development works; and (d) provision of soil conservation\n            structures.  It further includes; (e) strengthening of\n            production support services; and (f) preparation of studies."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
