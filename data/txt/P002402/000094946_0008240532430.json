"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the project was highly\n            unsatisfactory, in light that no major project objective was\n            achieved, nor is it expected to yield any significant\n            development result. Thus, and due to the civil war,\n            sustainability is unlikely, since the country will need to\n            rebuild its physical infrastructure, as well as reconstitute\n            the absence of institutions, and human capital. Although the\n            Bank did restructure the project to fit the changing\n            circumstances, the re-design relied on institutional, and\n            policy reforms, which went beyond the government's\n            capacity to implement. Lessons take the above into\n            consideration, and suggest that it is preferable to cancel\n            the original operation altogether, and, as circumstances\n            evolve, prepare a small targeted operation, liable to\n            address the existing emergency situation. The privatization\n            of state monopolies, though necessary, is not sufficient for\n            the prompt rise of private sector involvement in providing\n            expected services. Rather, it is essential that incentives\n            be provided for an expanded private sector participation.\n            Under circumstances of civil crises, the report reinforces\n            the importance for Bank support, to be based on close\n            consultation, and coordination with other donors, to avoid\n            duplication of efforts, and most importantly, to ensure a\n            harmonious approach in providing its assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
