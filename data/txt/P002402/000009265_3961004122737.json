increasing domestic food\n            production and agricultural exports.  It would comprise:\n            (a) an action program for rationalization of the\n            institutional framework in the agricultural sector,\n            including merger of ongoing integrated agricultural\n            development projects with the reorganized Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  In addition, this\n            project would enable privatization of Ministry operations in\n            agricultural mechanization and palm oil processing, and\n            improvements in operating systems in the MANR and in\n            agricultural policy-making.  Furthermore, there would be:\n            (b)  significant reductions in numbers of unskilled support\n            staff in MANR; (c) financing of improvements in operating\n            facilities for MANR; (d) provision of foreign exchange to\n            finance key imports for the sector; (e) support of tree crop\n            and swamp development programs; and (f) technical\n            assistance.  Provision of finance for imports would be\n            linked to progress in the action program. Provision of\n            imports principally fertilizers, spare parts and\n            agricultural equipment, and support of swamp development and\n            tree crop programs, would directly benefit about 80,000\n            farmers, most of whom have incomes close to the absolute\n            poverty level. The primary objective of this project is to\n            create an enabling po institutional environment conducive to\n            the recovery of agricultural ou The project is being\n            implemented over a period of four years. The capa front-line\n            extension officers to transfer technology to farmers will\n            strengthen the dissemination of existing improved technology\n            for food crop cultivation.
