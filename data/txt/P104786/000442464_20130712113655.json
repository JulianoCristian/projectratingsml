Some lessons learned included:\n            during implementation, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\n            should mainly play a supportive role to the Local\n            Governments (LGs) to enable LGs to take responsibility for\n            development programs in their jurisdiction. Future\n            development programs should aim at having a working system\n            and resource allocation that raise the status of the LGs and\n            their staff. Development programs in fragile environments\n            should ensure that some expertize and capacity remains in\n            program areas to continue assisting beneficiary communities.\n            Government commitment that assures the continued employment\n            of the trained and experienced extension staff is necessary.\n            Project design should refrain from ex-ante selection of\n            institutions to provide exclusive services or inputs, and to\n            become sole implementers of parts of a project in a\n            situation where the authorities are uncertain about the\n            idea. Even in rapid response programs, project design should\n            endeavor to define and specify in detail all tasks to be\n            accomplished.
