The changes\n            are twofold: (i) the revision to the project development\n            objective (PDO) to make it consistent with of the PDO of the\n            additional financing approved in March 2011 and (ii) the\n            extension of the closing date of both the original grant and\n            additional financing from October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.\n            At approval of the additional financing it was clear that\n            the completion of the expanded scope of activities will\n            necessitate an extension of the project closing date to June\n            30, 2012.  However, since the closing date of the parent\n            Multi Donors Trust Funds- Southern Sudan, or MDTF-SS was set\n            at December 30, 2011 and the process to extend it was still\n            underway, the extension of the closing date of SAFDP to June\n            2012 could not be granted. The extension of the closing date\n            of the parent trust fund to December 31, 2012 has been\n            completed and it is possible now to extend closing dates of\n            both the original SAFDP and the Additional Financing, or AF\n            to June 30, 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
