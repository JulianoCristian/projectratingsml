geological and hydro-meteorological phenomena are\n            determinants in the increased risk. Deficiencies in\n            knowledge and incorporation of environmental restrictions\n            and risk conditions in planning processes and urban and\n            regional planning; the inability to meet the needs of\n            livelihood; socio-economic exclusion; actions such as the\n            draining of wetlands and marshes, and forest loss and\n            vegetation coverage; generate increased settlement in\n            unsuitable areas and the growth of informal settlements\n            associated with poor infrastructure, and influence in\n            increasing the vulnerability to the occurrence of various\n            physical events. In this context it can be said that there\n            is a two-way relationship between configuration risk\n            conditions and development processes, to the farsighted\n            extent and that no corrective action is implemented, and the\n            unknown restrictions, constraints and potentials of each\n            territorial unit. In that sense, the incorporation of\n            disaster risk management (DRM) in the territorial\n            administration becomes a key to the safety and\n            sustainability at the local level. That is, in the same\n            context of development and population growth, trends\n            accelerated urbanization, environmental degradation and\n            conditions vulnerability; make the causes of disasters are\n            changing and its impacts are being amplified. This situation\n            and scenarios of potential disasters could undermine the\n            efforts and progress made so far in relationship to economic\n            growth, quality of life and poverty reduction."}, "docdt": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
