outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: there is existing demand at the municipal\n            level for in-depth and continuous technical support for risk\n            mitigation actions. Instituto de hidrologia, meteorologia, y\n            estudios ambientales, institute of hydrology, meteorology,\n            and environment studies (IDEAM's) work has the\n            potential to contribute to the development of climate risk\n            parametric insurance tools. Such tools can be supported in a\n            follow-up operation, and furthermore, use the successful\n            experience from other countries in that area. An in-depth\n            institutional assessment as well as the preparation of a\n            capacity development plan for unidad nacional para la\n            gestion del riesgo de desastres, national unit for disaster\n            risk management (UNGRD) will help define the institutional\n            and implementation arrangements for a potential phase II. In\n            terms of monitoring and evaluation (M and E), the project\n            demonstrated the limits of a quantitative results framework\n            (RF). It highlighted the critical need to design, from\n            entry, some indicators and or an M and E system that can\n            capture the outcomes produced by the project. There was a\n            good synergy between this International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) operation and global\n            facility for disaster reduction and recovery (GFDRR) grants,\n            targeting specific areas of technical assistance (TA) and\n            delivering extra-outcomes and positive impacts around the project."}, "docdt": "2014-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
