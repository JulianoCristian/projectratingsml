Hurricane Georges Emergency Recovery\n            Project seeks to: a) help restore or maintain growth in key\n            sectors of the economy; b) support the reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation of key social and economic infrastructure\n            damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Georges in September 1998;\n            c) reinforce vulnerable infrastructure facilities in order\n            to reduce losses and interruption of critical public\n            services from future natural disasters; and d) strengthen\n            the country's institutional capacity to prepare for and\n            respond to future natural disaster emergencies. The project\n            consists of three components. First, the quick-disbursing\n            component will finance critically needed imports for the\n            recovery program, including food, medicine, housing\n            construction materials, and chemical products. Second, the\n            reconstruction & mitigation component will reconstruct\n            bridges and highway sections in three phases. It will also\n            rehabilitate the principal irrigation schemes, rehabilitate\n            and upgrade part of the 69 kilovolt transmission system and\n            an 8 megawatt hydropower plant and access road, and\n            restructure and modernize key national institutions\n            responsible for emergency preparedness and disaster\n            management. The third component will be responsible for\n            project implementation support."}, "docdt": "1998-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
