"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objectives of the Demand-Side\n            Management and Energy Efficiency Project are to: (a) develop\n            and expand demand-side management (DSM) business programs\n            and test new market transformation efforts within the\n            national electric utility, Electricity of Vietnam (EVN); and\n            (b) develop sustainable business models and mechanisms to\n            support energy efficiency (EE) retrofit investments in\n            commercial and industrial facilities.  The project consists\n            of two components: (i) a second phase DSM component under\n            EVN; and  (ii) a pilot commercial EE program under the\n            Ministry of Industry (MoI).  The main focus of the first\n            component will be to implement EVN's DSM business plan\n            developed in Phase 1 by: a) expanded time-of-use (TOU)\n            metering by procuring and installing TOU meters; b) pilot\n            direct load control (DLC) Program introduced by using ripple\n            control systems; c) compact fluorescent lamp (CFL)\n            promotion; d) Fluorescent tube lamp (FTL) market\n            transformation; and e) supporting programs and technical\n            assistance for DSM efforts.  The second component seeks to\n            test appropriate business models and mechanisms to catalyze\n            a service market to support EE investments by supporting\n            commercial service providers or \"project agents\"\n            in all phases of EE project identification, development and\n            implementation.  Specific activities under this component\n            are: a) comprehensive project agent training program to\n            provide basic technical, financial and business knowledge to\n            facilitate the development and implementation of project\n            proposals as well as some customized technical assistance to\n            develop their marketing and business plans; b) subproject\n            audit and investment grants for energy audits and\n            investments to project agents and their customers; and c)\n            program marketing, monitoring and administration including\n            program marketing."}, "docdt": "2003-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
