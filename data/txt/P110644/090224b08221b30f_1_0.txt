                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Based on the project's Mid Term Review in March 2013, it was decided to restructure the project and to focus on key activities to increase effectiveness and impact. As such, this
                         project will be closed and selected activities will be transfered to a parent project (Financial Sector Rapid Response Project) through an additional financing (which was approved in
                         November 2013).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
