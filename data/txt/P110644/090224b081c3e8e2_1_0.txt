                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist DAB to improve its core function of banking supervision and regulation, and to help improve access to formal banking services
                         by establishing key initial building blocks for further financial sector reform.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has been slower than expected mostly due to procurement delays (with several failed procurement processes). Two major achievements of the project are the
                         establishment of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance (in November 2010) and the launch of the Collateral Registry (in February 2013). The contract for the establishment
                         of the Public Credit Registry was signed in February 2013.
