received an unsatisfactory\n            performance outcome with substantial risk to development\n            outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received moderately\n            unsatisfactory performance ratings. The project was\n            restructured only once. The restructuring, in coordination\n            with a parallel project (the Financial Sector Rapid Response\n            Proejct, saw the undisbursed SDR 4 million (US$5.6 million)\n            of the FSSP was to be cancelled and selected activities of\n            FSSP would be transferred to the FSRRP under additional\n            financing in order to complete them. Three main lessons were\n            learned from this project and are as follows: (1) in a\n            conflict-afflicted environment, the project team should\n            review the general constraints to implementation faced by\n            ongoing projects in the country\u2019s Bank portfolio to better\n            understand the operating environment, (2) attracting good\n            quality individual international consultants in a conflict\n            environment is a major constraint to implementation, and (3)\n            corrective actions need to be taken earlier on in the\n            implementation phase if implementation progress (IP) is\n            consistently \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d. The delay in taking\n            corrective actions can lead to loss of resources and time as\n            seen in this project where a number of contracts had to be\n            advertised at least twice."}, "docdt": "2015-04-30T10:02:00Z"}
