                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has been slower than expected due to delays in recruiting the IT consultant, responsible for implementing about 60% of the project. There has however been
                         significant progress in procurement since January 2011. The contract for the movable collateral registry was signed in June 2011 and implementation is underway. The contract with
                         the IT consultant contract was signed in October 2011.
