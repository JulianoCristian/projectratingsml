                         by establishing key initial building blocks for further financial sector reform.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has been slower than expected due to initial delays in the procurement of the IT consultant, responsible for implementing about 60% of the project. There has
                         however been significant progress in procurement since January 2011. The web-based movable collateral registry, housed in DAB, will be operational by July 2012. The procurement
                         of the Public Credit Registry will be re-launched in July 2012 (with the advertisement of the revised bidding document). The IT consultant (firm) started working in October 2011 and
                         its assignment is progressing satisfactorily.
