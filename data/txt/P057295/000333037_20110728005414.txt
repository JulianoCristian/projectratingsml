SUMMARY
1.     The proposed reallocation of proceeds is necessary to enable the Project
Implementing Unit (PCU) to have sufficient funds to meet its operational costs to
continue to effectively monitor and support project activities up to the end of project in
July 2011. This is in line with the attached request for reallocation of proceeds from the
Government of Rwanda dated December 17, 2010. We are proposing to amend the legal
agreement for the project by reallocating the Credit proceeds from two categories to one
category to enable a smooth preparation for the closure of the project by July 31, 2011.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      Following the recently concluded mission of January 2011 and frequent
consultations with the PCU, overall project performance towards achievement of the
Development Objective (PDO) was rated satisfactory. The Legal framework for business
continues to improve after the completion of amendments to the key commercial laws
which continue to improve the investment climate. The implementation of the
privatization program continues to be satisfactory as the Government of Rwanda (GoR)
completes its first Initial Public Offer (IPO) for one of its most profitable companies –
breweries Bralirwa. Financial sector reforms have contributed to reducing non
performing loans and expanding access to financial services although access to long term
finance remains a critical bottleneck to private investments. Project implementation (IP)
was also rated satisfactory. All the project components are being implemented
satisfactorily including activities under Institute of Certified Public Accountants of
Rwanda (ICPAR) which were lagging behind due to lack of leadership. A new Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) has been appointed and has assumed work since January 2011.
As a result, ICPAR’s Action program is being successfully implemented as it provides
training to accounting and auditing professionals in the country. This program is crucial
for the improvement of access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and
to strengthen banking supervision in Rwanda. The restructuring of Rwanda Enterprise
and Investment Company (REIC) has also been completed with injection of new money
to the fund from new investors while a fund manager is also on board. Procurement
performance is rated satisfactory. The project is now more focused with a detailed
procurement plan with activities and contracts which are manageable by the PCU.
Financial Management is rated satisfactory. The project has made significant
improvement in the quality and timeliness of its financial reporting and has completed
implementation of recommendations of external audit. The project is expected to close as
planned on July 31, 2011.

Operating Costs is necessary to enable the Project Coordinating Unit to monitor and
support full completion and implementation of the remaining activities before the project
closing date, on July 31, 2011

Briefly summarize project implementation progress.

2.       The project being the longest in the Rwanda portfolio has financed many
activities which have changed the landscape of Rwanda including the Doing Business
ranking. The project has four components: (i) Improving Business and Legal
Environment which included Financial Sector Development and its reforms; (ii)
Reducing Cost and Improving Efficiency;; (iii) Promoting Tea Industry ; and (iv) Support
to Private Sector Federation and Project Coordinating Unit. Progress towards
achievement of development objectives and implementation performance is rated
satisfactory as per implementation status report filed in March 2011. With three months
remaining, an action plan and procurement plan have been developed for closer
monitoring to ensure completion of the remaining activities. The next and final
supervision mission is scheduled for June 2010.

3.     The Credit was approved by the Board on April 19, 2001, signed on June 7, 2001
and became effective on December 7, 2001. The original value of the credit was SDR
31.8 million (US$ 40.8 million equivalent at the time) and in 2008, an additional grant
financing of SDR 3.8 million (US$ 6.0 million equivalent) was approved. In addition,
SDR 8,014,190 was deducted from the project as part of the MDRI. This made the total
funds to be reduced to SDR 23,704,608. A total of SDR 32.3 million (US$ 49.4 million
equivalent) has been disbursed with SDR 2.5 million (US$ 3.21 million equivalent) is
undisbursed. The project is expected to be closed on July 31, 2011 as scheduled in 2008.

4.     The proposed reallocation of SDR 56,911.89 into Category 4 - Incremental
Operating Costs is necessary to enable the Project Coordinating Unit to monitor and
support full completion and implementation of the remaining activities before the project
closing date, on July 31, 2011.
