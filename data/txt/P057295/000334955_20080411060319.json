The\n            project is designed to promote a competitive climate by: (i)\n            streamlining the business environment; (ii) reducing costs\n            and increasing the efficiency of telecommunications, water\n            and electric utilities, and the tea industry; and (iii)\n            improving access to financial and support services to local\n            entrepreneurs.
