satisfactory; the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible; the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Factors such as strong\n            political commitment and continuity of project leadership\n            are essential for the success of a project. Promotion of\n            trust and group solidarity based on a common purpose is an\n            important element for building inclusive community\n            institutions. A poverty reduction project should focus more\n            on building the capacity of rural communities rather than\n            the capacity of the government. Capacity building should be\n            given very high priority. Implementation of sub projects\n            should start only after sufficient capacity building is\n            achieved. Any attempt to fast track without proper\n            foundation can result in manipulation and diluting project\n            objectives. The project confirms the lesson learned from\n            other livelihood programs across the region that promotion\n            of trust and group solidarity based on a common purpose is\n            an important initial element of building inclusive community\n            institutions. The project experience shows that social\n            mobilization and capacity building is process oriented, and\n            therefore, takes time to start-up but produce good results\n            when matured. It implies that project planning should\n            emphasize social mobilization as early in the project cycle\n            as possible."}, "docdt": "2007-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
