In order to understand\n            community based procurement in relation to value for money\n            (VfM), governance and accountability, a study was needed to\n            explore these concepts and their dynamics. The present study\n            focuses on Community Based Procurement (CBP) outcomes across\n            completed sub-projects with a focus on the following key\n            questions: 1) value for money - is community based\n            procurement more economical for implementation? 2)\n            Sustainability - is there evidence of better operation and\n            maintenance of items and services created through CBP? 3)\n            Participation - what is the extent of community\n            participation in CBP? 4) Enabling factors - what are the\n            facilitating processes and environmental factors that\n            positively influence the outcomes in CBP? The study on CBP\n            was carried out in 84 successful subprojects from three\n            community driven development (CDD) projects in India (in the\n            states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) and\n            local government units (Gram Panchayats1) in the state of\n            Kerala, to explore linkages both in terms of enablers and\n            outcomes.
