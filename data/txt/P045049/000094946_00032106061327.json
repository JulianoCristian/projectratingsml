     reviews the location, and classification of sub-projects,\n            under the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives\n            Project, which aims at economic, and environmentally\n            sustainable development, in six districts of Andhra Pradesh\n            Province, with an emphasis on poverty alleviation. However,\n            adverse effects on human health, and natural resources are\n            envisaged, and, sub-projects may have, negative\n            environmental impacts. Mitigation measures require that: 1)\n            air pollution levels be tested, on account of increased\n            vehicular traffic due to the construction of roads and\n            bridges; 2) bacterial contamination on surface, and ground\n            water be monitored, due to the construction of community\n            halls, schools, and education centers, as well as health\n            facilities. Furthermore, possible changes in regional water\n            levels may occur, with negative impacts on sanitation and\n            bio-diversity, thus test monitoring should be required; 3)\n            because of possible flooding, and soil erosion as a result\n            of construction works, soil fertility, fisheries production,\n            and water levels require environmental testing. Likewise,\n            crops improvement, will suffer reduced water levels in\n            streams, and water contamination, due to the use of\n            pesticides and chemicals, hence regular sampling, and\n            analysis of water quality, and levels should be conducted. A\n            summary of social development issues is presented in the\n            second volume, the South Asia social data sheet."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
