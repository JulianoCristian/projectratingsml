the\n            potential of the eastern part of the oilfield; and\n            recovering liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from associated\n            gas. It will include a 3-D seismic survey of the South\n            Wenliu and part of the East Wenliu structures, drilling of\n            production, injection, exploration and appraisal wells, and\n            construction of an LPG plant and ancillary facilities. A\n            very important objective of the project is to introduce\n            modern technology and methods of the petroleum industry in\n            China - a process initiated under the Bank's first\n            petroleum project in Daqing. The project will help optimize\n            oil recovery and production rates through appropriate\n            secondary recovery techniques and improved completion\n            practices. It will also provide modern oilfield equipment,\n            computer and training centers, laboratories and technical\n            assistance (including 416 man-months of expatriate\n            consultant services). The main benefits from the project are\n            production of crude oil, gas and natural gas liquids, highly\n            probably discovery of additional reserves, and transfer of\n            technology that will improve operational practices."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
