MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Performance Audit Report on China
Daqing Oilfield-Gaotaizi Reservoir Development Project
(Loan-2231-CHA)
Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum Project (Loan 2252-CHA)
Karamav Petroleum Proiect (Loan 2426-CHA)
Attached is the Performance Audit Report on China - Daqing Oilfield-Gaotaizi Reservoir
Development Project (Loan 2231-CHA), Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum Project (Loan 2252-CHA) and
Karamay Petroleum Project (Loan 2426-CHA) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department.
The objectives of these projects were to enhance exploration success and petroleum
production levels, through the introduction of modern oilfield technology and through training in the use
of these advanced technologies.
Although there were significant delays in implementation, due primarily to the complex
institutional arrangements required for foreign procurement in China at that time, the projects all met
their major objectives. In particular, sophisticated technologies were effectively transferred. Both
production levels and reserves increased substantially under all projects. Safety practices studies, drilling
and completion studies and modern technical training facilities for oilfield workers and technicians were
also introduced.
The outcome of all three projects is rated as highly satisfactory, their sustainability as
likely, and their institutional impact as substantial.

PREFACE
This is a Performance Audit Report (PAR) for the Daqing Oilfield-Gaotaizi Reservoir
Development Project involving a Bank Loan of US$162.4 million, US$161.9 of which was disbursed;
the Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum Project, involving a loan of US$100.8 million, US$96.8 of which was
disbursed; and the Karamay Petroleum Project, involving a loan of US$100.3 million, US$89.5 of which
was disbursed. The main objective of the three projects was to transfer modem oilfield technology to
China and to increase petroleum production at the three fields. Project Completion Reports were issued
on May 21, 1991, December 10, 1992, and June 29, 1992, respectively.
The PAR was written in the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). To prepare it, OED
reviewed the Presidents' Reports, Staff Appraisal Reports, legal documents, transcript of the Board
Proceedings, Bank files, and held discussions with Bank staff associated with the project. An OED
mission visited China in October 1993, where it held discussions with Govemment officials, officials
of the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC), China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC), and the management of the Daqing Petroleum Administration Bureau (DPAB), Zhongyuan
Petroleum Exploration Bureau (ZPEB), and the Karamay Oil Company (KOC). The effective and
pleasant cooperation and assistance of these Chinese authorities, and particularly of CNPC, is gratefully
acknowledged.
The PCRs, which were of acceptable quality, concluded that the implementation of all three
projects was successful and that the results were all satisfactory. This audit report supplements the
PCRs. It makes recommendations on ways that similar projects could be implemented with less delays
in the future, and highlights the practices used for the successful transfer of technology and recommends
that these practices be used in similar circumstances elsewhere.
Following standard OED procedures, this draft PAR was sent to the Borrower for comment.
Comments received are attached as an annex to the PAR.

PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
CHINA
DAQING OILFIELD-GAOTAIZI RESERVOIR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2231-CHA)
1. BACKGROUND
1.1    China's petroleum production increased from 10 million tons per year in 1960 to nearly 110
million tons in 1980, but declined during 1981-1982. There had been no new major discoveries in the
1970's and there was little likelihood that future large discoveries could augment production during the
1980s. Offshore exploration, with its high risks and specialized requirements, had been contracted out
to multinational oil companies. The Ministry of Petroleum Industries (MOPI) came to the conclusion
that China was unlikely to increase petroleum production, or even maintain it at its current level, as long
as the industry continued to use outdated technology. In the short and medium term, increased output
would have to be achieved primarily through expanded production in and around existing oilfields, and
this could only be accomplished through the introduction of modem production and exploration
technology. It was within this framework that the Government of China (GOC) approached the Bank
for assistance in rehabilitating and modernizing China's petroleum sector.
1.2    The Bank's petroleum sector lending in China had three basic objectives: first, to improve the
development of the known hydrocarbon-bearing structures, thereby partially off-setting the anticipated
decline in domestic oil production; second, to provide a vehicle for the introduction of modern
technology through the financing of modem equipment and the technical assistance in optimum
utilization of this equipment; and third, to upgrade the operating, technical, and managerial skills of
China's oil industry personnel.
1.3    The Daqing project was identified by MOPI as among the highest priority projects for
modernizing the operations of petroleum industry, primarily because Daqing was the largest petroleum
field in China, where a successful rehabilitation program would have an important impact on China's
aggregate petroleum output. The introduction of modern technology would be a critical element in the
success of Daqing's long-term  operations, because the company's largest oilfield had been fully
developed, and in spite of an extensive secondary recovery effort through water flooding, production
was beginning to decline. Oil was no longer free flowing but had to be pumped, and the limits of
secondary recovery efforts through water flooding were becoming apparent. Furthermore, oil had been
discovered in a much deeper horizon, but Daqing lacked the technology needed to efficiently drill and
complete production wells at this depth.

2.1    The broad objectives of the Daqing Oilfield Project were:
(a)    To augment oil production through the development of the Gaotaizi reservoir;
(b)    To establish a training center for skilled workers and another for engineers and
technical staff,
(c)    To increase reserves through the support of an exploration program using modem
seismic data gathering and processing equipment; and
(d)    To implement this program  in addition to the imported equipment, DPAB would
receive technical services in the form of six studies covering all aspects of oilfield
operation practices;
2.2    One of the most innovative features of this project - and the following two petroleum
development projects - was the effort made to maximize the impact of the transfer of modem
technology, which was the central project goal. First, it was agreed that Bank funds would be used only
for the import of equipment that embodied modem technology, such as drilling, cementing, and
down-hole testing equipment, and a seismic data processing center, instead of standard oilfield materials
such as tubing and drill bits. Second, it was agreed that, since the transfer of technology required an
extended learning process, all equipment purchase contracts would include a requirement that the
equipment supplier provide on-the-job training in the use of the equipment, both in China and in foreign
countries where the equipment was in operation.
2.3    The project was appraised in February 1982, approved by the Board in January 1983, and
completed in October 1990, four years after originally planned. Project implementation and results were
essentially as described in the PCR, and are summarized in the following section. There were no sector
policy conditionalities associated with the loan.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  AND RESULTS
3.1    The Gaotaizi reservoir was successfully developed. It proved to be substantially larger and
more productive than originally anticipated. On the basis of the exploration data generated during
project implementation, the estimated areal extent (size) of the oilfield has increased substantially, as
have the reserve estimates. Reserves, which had originally been estimated by the Bank consultants at
32 million tons, and by DPAB at 51 million tons, are currently estimated at 76 million tons. The
extended size of the field resulted in an expanded development program with the first phase, covered
under the project, implemented between 1982 and 1985, and a second phase, which was outside the
project scope, implemented between 1986 and 1989.
3.2    As a result of the recommendations made in the reservoir engineering, well drilling and well
completion studies implemented under the project, production has also increased significantly above
appraisal estimates, both on a per well and a total basis. Average daily production peaked at 26 tons



3
per well in 1985, compared with the appraisal estimates of 19 tons, and total field output peaked at 5.0
million tons in 1987 and 1988 compared with the appraisal estimate of 3.8 million. Accumulated
production in 1989 was 24.8 million tons, compared with the projected 17.7 million tons.
Exploration
3.3    The introduction of state-of-the-art seismic data acquisition, processing and interpretation
equipment and technology and the training associated with its introduction contributed to a marked
improvement in DPAB's success in identifying prospective locations for its exploration drilling program.
As a result, the success ratio increased from 32% to 48%, under much more difficult terrain than could
have been worked on with the older equipment.
The Prototype Production Station
3.4    The facility was completed three years behind schedule, primarily as a result of delays in the
completion of the consultancy study. The first design was for a facility more expensive than estimated
at appraisal, primarily because the optimal size suggested by DPAB was to handle 100 wells, far larger
than expected at appraisal. The cost for this first design was almost four times the amount allocated
under the project -- US$22 million versus US$6 million. Since the foreign exchange was not available
under the project and MOPI was unable to allocate the additional funds required for the prototype, the
design was changed to a much smaller, 20 well plant. Since this was a prototype plant, the smaller
facility was considered appropriate.
3.5    DPAB engineers leamed how to use up-to-date standards and specifications for the design of
oilfield collection and gathering stations, and are now able to design all their own facilities. However,
because some of the contractors delivered faulty equipment, the monitoring aspects of the facility never
worked. As a result, the prototype facility was unable to meet its target of improving the standards for
monitoring individual well operating conditions and production levels on a continuous basis.
Studies
3.6    Five studies related to the transfer of oilfield technology were implemented under the project.
The Reservoir Engineering Study, Drilling and Completion Practices Study and Safety Study formed
the core of the program for transfer of technology outside the technology embodied in equipment
purchases.  While all the studies were successfully implemented and were highly successful in
transferring modem oilfield technology to DPAB, they all suffered from delays ranging from two to six
years.
3.7    The Reservoir Engineering Study was completed two years late. Its objectives were, first,
to design a master plan for development of the Gaotaizi reservoir and, second, to provide training in
advanced methods for designing and implementing reservoir modeling, so that they could continue to
plan future reservoir development programs. Some of the study results were of considerable importance
for improving the way DPAB implemented its field development program. The study identified oil
bearing sands that had previously been omitted from production plans. Completion of wells in these
sands has been an important element in allowing Daqing to maintain its planned production levels. The
study also identified additional reservoirs that had not been previously identified by DPAB, thereby
providing additional suitable locations for drilling new production wells.



4
3.8    The study also proved highly successful as a vehicle for the transfer of technological know-how.
DPAB staff engineers were able to use the methodology they had learned to create their own reservoir
model, using software they had obtained with the purchase of their computer. With this new software
they were eventually able to update the development plan for the Gaotaizi reservoir, and to model other
reservoirs in the area.
3.9    However, the study failed to meet the expectations of DPAB, in that it did not establish a
masterplan for the development of the Gaotaizi oilfield. By the time the final report was delivered to
DPAB, its broad recommendations had already been incorporated into DPAB's thinking, but its
masterplan was already obsolete.  Because the contract had failed to include the purchase of the
underlying modeling software and hardware needed to rerun the model, DPAB was unable to update
the model results to take into account new drilling and production data that had accumulated since the
original field data had been transmitted to the consultant.  The report on the model and the
accompanying proposed development masterplan was, therefore, useful only as a historical document.
3.10   Lesson. It is imperative that the operating company should acquire the hardware and software
needed to continue to carry out their own reservoir modeling requirements, even if this equipment is
incompatible with the modeling equipment used in their training.
3.11   The objective of the Drilling and Completion Study was to identify the ways DPAB could
improve their oilfield development technology. It was started two years behind schedule and was
completed almost four years behind schedule. One of the main delays was caused by an inaccurate
description in the Terms of Reference for the study of DPAB's drilling needs. The problem appears
to have been that the terms of reference were completed by a consultant who had only visited the
Daqing oilfield briefly, and had only a limited knowledge of the geological conditions encountered
there. As a result many changes had to be made, both before and after the bidding took place, to ensure
that the study would be one that would fit more appropriately DPAB's requirements. For instance, one
of the components was an evaluation of water jet injection drilling, which could not be used in Daqing's
geological conditions, because it would damage the reservoir. Nevertheless, even with the long delays,
the final results were impressive. Using the recommendations of the study, DPAB was able to reduce
its drilling and well completion time by 30%. Perhaps even more importantly, its deep drilling
problems were satisfactorily resolved, enabling it to drill and complete successfully 122 new deep wells,
where the previous five attempts before the study was undertaken had all been abandoned before
completion.
3.12   Lesson:  Studies designed to evaluate and recommend improvements for oilfield and
management practices need to be designed jointly with the executing agency's management. Such
studies can be implemented far quicker when they are designed in a way that establishes ownership
on the part of the agency to be studied. This process should be accomplished during appraisal, or, at
the latest, before project effectiveness, if they are to be implemented on schedule.  If Terms of
Reference are being revised during contract negotiations with the successful bidder, close supervision
is also advisable.
3.13   The Safety Study was delayed by four and a half years. Much of the delay was due to the
lengthy intemal procedures needed to establish an acceptable Terms of Reference, and the long
negotiations required to reach agreement with the contractor on an acceptable study program. The study
was further delayed by the need to change contractors, (and renegotiate the study program) after the
original winning bidder went bankrupt. Eventually this study proved to be a highly effective tool for



5
improving safety standards at Daqing. Comparable statistics for before and after the study show a
decline in serious accidents after the study recommendations were implemented to less than one-third
their pre-study level.
3.14    The study was particularly innovative because it involved the operations personnel at every
level. It was organized as a joint activity between the consultants and numerous operational level
committees. Eight foreign experts held 34 separate group forums to identify and discuss over 500 safety
issues.  The final documentation was fully translated into Chinese to facilitate its dissemination to
operating personnel. Study results were instrumental in the modification of the design of the Daqing
multi-purpose oil tank storage facility, in the design of fire fighting facilities, and in the use of safer
drilling techniques.
3.15   Lessons. Safety studies are an important part of the modernization of any oilfield operation,
particularly when the operation has had little or no contact with modem western safety standards. The
direct involvement of oilfield operating staff greatly improved the likelihood of effectively implementing
the study recommendations.
Training
3.16   Training of both engineers and skilled workers was an important part of the project's objective
for the transfer of technology. A large part of the training was accomplished through the creation, for
the first time, of formal technical training centers within the oilfield region for skilled workers and for
engineers. The training centers have been staffed by personnel sent abroad under a program financed
by the project to learn the most up-to-date technical standards and teaching methods, and by foreign
experts who were invited to Daqing to design courses and specifically train local staff. The program
has been extremely successful, with more than 10,000 engineers and skilled workers already having
completed various three-month to one-year courses.
4. PROJECT ISSUES
Delays In Project Implementation
4.1    Delays of up to two years were encountered in the procurement of goods and services for the
project. There were, of course, many causes for these delays, including: (i) the late start in preparing
and issuing the draft bidding documents by outside consultants; (ii) the borrowers inexperience in
working with Bank procurement procedures; (iii) cumbersome internal clearance procedures combined
with a fragmentation of responsibilities among various Government agencies; (iv) protracted contract
negotiations after the contractor had been selected, particularly on revised terms of reference for the
studies and related revised fee structures;
4.2    In addition, there were frequent delays and extensions in the implementation of consultant
studies, due to differences in opinion about what the terms of reference required and sometimes due to
the desire on the part of the Borrower to expand the scope of the original terms of reference.
4.3    This was the first Bank loan to the petroleum sector, and one of the first Bank loans to China.
One should therefore not be surprised that implementation went less smoothly than planned, as both the



6
Bank and the Borrower learned about the operating practices, procedures, and policies of the other. The
PRC concluded that the problems of lack of experience were exacerbated by inadequate interagency
coordination and cumbersome internal clearance procedures.
4.4    The PCR suggested that the Bank could have helped reduce the delays in consultancy studies
by assisting the project entity in drafting a better focused scope of work in terms of reference for
consultant studies, and that these draft terms of reference should have been prepared before the field
appraisal rather than during project supervision. The Audit is in full agreement with these observations.
However, it found that there are a number of additional operational lessons that can be learned from
the experience with these three first petroleum projects in China. These lessons may help to minimize
procurement delays in the future, both in China and in other countries new to the Bank's procedures.
The Prototype Petroleum Production Station
4.5    The objective of this prototype facility was to introduce design technology and equipment which
would optimize the processing of crude oil, water and natural gas from the reservoirs (to minimize the
energy requirements to heat and transport them). It was also supposed to introduce an accurate method
for continuous metering of individual production and injection wells so that reservoir performance could
be monitored and optimized. As discussed below, this project component met with several difficulties
and was never made operational.
4.6    Although DPAB had never worked with foreign contractors, it decided, with the Bank's
concurrence, to act as its own prime contractor for this project component, coordinating all procurement
and construction activities. Based on the advice of the consultants, the project was subdivided into nine
bidding packages, with DPAB  taking responsibility for interfacing the nine contractors.  This
implementation structure could have worked if all contractors had performed to the letter of their
contracts. Unfortunately, the key contractor, who was to provide the central computer monitoring unit,
failed to provide the necessary computer software. Other less critical pieces of equipment also failed
to work as required. As a result, DPAB was unable to make the facility function.
4.7    Lesson. For complicated facilities that require efficient interfacing of many different pieces of
equipment it is important to have a turnkey contract with a prime contractor who will have sufficient
financial commitment in the project to ensure that all the equipment works together properly.
Furthermore, when things do go wrong, it is much easier to initiate corrective action, with litigation if
necessary, for one large contract where there are clearly defined responsibilities, than it is on a number
of small contracts where contractors can invariably blame the problem on the interface with the other
contractor's equipment.
4.8    Recommendation: The coordination and quality control function is probably the most difficult
part of the construction of any plant, and should not be left to an implementing agency who has had
only limited experience in working on such projects with foreign suppliers.
Choice of Technology
4.9    The Daqing and Karamay projects together purchased five drilling simulators for their training
institutions, all from the same supplier. Unfortunately, the equipment arrived without the electronics
that were necessary to allow them to function. The experts who were supposed to arrive to put them
together never showed up, and sometime shortly thereafter the supplying company went bankrupt. No



7
replacement equipment has been bought, and all these centers have been operating without this central
training activity. When it was discovered that the supplier had declared bankruptcy, the Borrowers tried
to find other ways to make the equipment function, even at a limited level. Unfortunately, this could
not be done, since the time and cost needed to make it work is much greater than the cost of new digital
equipment. A number of lessons and recommendations can be drawn from this unfortunate experience.
4.10   Lessons: The choice of appropriate technology may require specialized technical knowledge.
The technologies employed by the two suppliers who bid for these contracts were very different. One
was an analogue technology and the other was a digital technology. The digital technology, which was
much newer, was claimed to be able to accomplish more than the older analogue technology, but was
somewhat more expensive. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two technologies was particularly
important in this case because the bids were relatively close, and the question of which was the lowest
evaluated bidder hang from the evaluation of the various claims and counter-claims about what each
piece of equipment could do. However, in reviewing the bids, Bank staff appears to have made no
effort to ensure that an adequate evaluation and comparison was made of the effectiveness and
usefulness of the two technologies.
4.11   Recommendation: For the procurement of highly complex technical equipment, where Bank
staff have no expertise, a special effort should be made to ensure that the appropriate technology is
used. When radically different technologies are being proposed for accomplishing the same goal, Bank
should insist that a knowledgeable, independent consultant is hired to compare the advantages and the
disadvantages of each.
4.12   Lesson: Bank borrowers should not be used as experimental subjects for new and untested
equipment when there are alternative, tested equipment available in the market. The lowest evaluated
bidder offered an "advanced" model that was not yet on the market. As a result, it was difficult for the
executing agency to judge the validity of claims about how the machine would function. In the end,
the machine offered by the successful bidder failed to function at all, most probably because the
company, under extreme financial pressure, rushed it into production before all the bugs had been
worked out.
4.13   Recommendation: Bidding documents should require verification that equipment with similar
characteristics and capabilities should be in operation. Preferably, similar equipment should have
already been sold and installed so that claims about its effectiveness can be assessed. If the equipment
is a new model, especially one with expanded capabilities, then the contract should stipulate the
condition that it be tested and approved by the borrower, or an independent agency representing the
borrower, as a condition of acceptance of the export letter of credit.
4.14   Lesson: The Borrowers have been unable to resolve the problem, and still are without this
important piece of training equipment. After finding that the company was bankrupt and could not meet
it's obligations, the Borrowers spent most of their efforts on attempting to salvage the useless
equipment, and have yet to consider purchasing substitute equipment. Essentially, those involved appear
to have lost sight of the project goal, which was to provide a complete training facility for skilled
workers. To ensure that this goal was accomplished, the Bank should have advised the Borrowers to
recognize the loss, and to purchase similar equipment from another producer. If loan funds were no
longer available under the project, the Borrower should have replaced the equipment with its own
resources, to fulfill its obligations to complete the project.



8
4.15   Recommendation. Borrowers in non-market oriented countries, who have had little experience
with commercial law in their own country or in developed countries, may need guidance on what they
can and cannot expect in the resolution of commercial disputes. When major problems arise, the Bank
should provide assistance in suggesting the most likely successful strategy to follow, including, when
appropriate, to accept the loss and start over again, so that the project objectives can be met.
5. PROJECT OUTCOME AND SUSTAINABILITY
5.1    The Audit finds that the project results were highly satisfactory and successful in meeting all
its major objectives. Its institutional development impact was substantial. The transfer of technology
that took place during the project, through the program of studies, the introduction of modem oilfield
equipment and the training related to its operation and maintenance, and the technical training for skilled
workers and engineers all appear to be fully sustainable. The Audit is in full agreement with the PCR
that the potential economic benefits from continuing the field development of the Gaotaizi reservoir is
sustainable. Output from the field is expected to be greatly increased as a result of the enormously
positive results of the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) study undertaken under the project. It is expected
that one of the methods tested under this study (the polymer flooding) will increase the recoverable
reserves from Gaotaizi (from 30% of oil in place to 44%). DPAB has sufficient confidence in this new
technology to invest over $200 million in a polymer production plant.

ZHONGYUAN-WENLIU PETROLEUM PROJECT
(LOAN 2252-CHA)
1. BACKGROUND
1.1    China's petroleum production increased from 10 million tons per year in 1960 to nearly 110
million tons in 1980, but declined in 1981 and 1982. There had been no major discoveries in the
1970's, and the Ministry of Petroleum industries (MOPI) came to the conclusion that China was
unlikely to maintain its petroleum production level, let alone increase it significantly if it continued to
use the outdated technology. MOPI also decided that, while there was great potential for finding new
large sources of supply from prospective off-shore areas, there was little likelihood that new large
onshore discoveries would add to production during the next decade. Therefore, it concluded that
increased production would have to be achieved primarily through expanding the production in and
around existing oilfields, which would only come through the introduction of modem production and
exploration technology. It was within this framework that the Government of China (GOC) approached
the Bank for assistance in rehabilitating and modernizing China's petroleum sector.
1.2    The Bank's lending in the petroleum sector in China was to have three basic objectives: firstly,
to develop the known hydrocarbon bearing structures in order to partially offset the anticipated decline
in national oil production. Secondly, providing a vehicle for the introduction of modern technology
through the financing of modem equipment and the technical assistance in optimum operation of this
equipment. Thirdly, in training and upgrading the operating, technical and managerial skills of China's
oil industry personnel.
1.3    The Zhongyuan project was one of the first three projects identified by the Government of
China as among the highest priority projects (the other two were Daqing and Karamay) for modernizing
petroleum practices, where the introduction of modern technology would be a critical element in the
success of the country's oil development program. Modern technology was critical in the Zhongyuan
oilfields because the reservoirs were quite deep with high pressure gas zones, which made drilling very
difficult, and the field geology was quite complex, so that the primitive seismic equipment being used
made it difficult to identify optimum drilling locations.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.1    The broad project objectives of the Zhongyuan project were to:
(i)   increase oil and gas production and reserves in the project area;
(ii)   enhance operational efficiency and strengthen ZPEB's institutional capabilities through
staff training and the modernization of their oilfield operating practices; and
(iii)   extract LPG from the associated natural gas which was being flared.



10
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
3.1    All the major project objectives were successfully achieved, in spite of the long delays
experienced during implementation.
3.2    The transfer of advanced oilfield operating technology was the most important achievement of
the project. The transfer took place through many channels, the most important of which were:
*      The importation of modem  and sophisticated equipment and the related training
provided by suppliers of equipment and services, both in China and abroad.
*      The involvement of ZPEB counterpart staff working with the consultants on the
reservoir, oilfield practices and safety studies.
The field trips arranged by the equipment manufacturers and the study consultants
which acquainted ZPEB staff with actual operating practices in western oilfields, mostly
in the US and Canada.
*      Consultant assistance with the initial implementation of the recommendations emanating
from their studies, particularly in the areas of drilling and oilfield practices and safety
standards.
*      The establishment of a training center for 3000 workers a year and the training of
teachers, both in Zhongyuan and overseas, in the methodology for preparing the
specialized curricula for teaching advanced oilfield techniques and in the utilization of
modem audio-visual and simulation model for assisted teaching methods.
3.3    In addition to the transfer of technology, the project also reached its major physical targets, as
described in the PCR and summarized below:
ZPEB was able to implement the full development of the South Wenliu oilfield;
One hundred and twenty million tons of additional proven reserves were confirmed in
the East Wenliu structure and are now under development;
The gas processing plant for the recovery and treatment of LPG products from the
associated natural gas was installed and is fully functional.
3.4    Environmental impact became a serious concern during project implementation. During the
early supervision missions, Bank staff noted that corrosion from untreated water had caused serious
problems in the tubing of both injection and production wells, and in the production pipelines, which
was increasing production costs and also producing environmental pollution, as the number of water
and oil spills began to increase. The Bank recommended, and ZPEB agreed to amend the scope of the
project to include a study on the appropriate methods for treating water produced by the field and for
constructing a water treating facility. Once the water treatment study had been completed, a new water
treatment facility was constructed to treat both the produced and injection water. Recommendations



11
for upgrading water handling techniques have been disseminated to and applied in oilfields throughout
the country.
3.5    Four consultant assisted studies were also expected to introduce modem oilfield practices and
technology, as follows:
*     A Safety Practices Study, which was to bring the field operations safety practices in
line with Western safety standard;
*     A drilling and well completion practices study and demonstration program which was
to analyze the problems that had been encountered in the past and propose ways to
overcome them;
*     A reservoir analysis of the South Wenliu oilfield, which would include an optimized
long-term development plan for this field;
*     A Management Information System, which was to assist with the introduction of
modem oilfield management techniques, including modem cost accounting;
3.6    The first two of these consultant studies were highly successful; the third had many problems
and was never completed; and the fourth was never initiated.
4. PROJECT ISSUES
Findings and Lessons Learned from PCR
4.1    Procurement.  Factors that contributed to the early project delays were ZPEB's lack of
familiarity with the Bank's procurement procedures, cumbersome internal processing and clearance
procedures, and extended delays in contract negotiations. Coordination of clearances among three
entities, (ZPEB, CNPC and CNTIC) made the process particularly difficult. Recommendation: In the
future the central authorities should delegate procurement authority to the local implementing entity.
4.2    Studies: The Bank should help the executing agency prepare focussed terms of reference for
all studies during project preparation, rather than leave this to subsequent supervision missions. This
would greatly accelerate the implementation processes.
4.3    Petroleum Prices: Appropriate domestic pricing policies for oil and gas need to be established
to assure that production companies can remain financially sound.
4.4    The Audit agrees with all these conclusions and recommendations. Other issues, not fully
covered in the PCR are discussed below.
Delay in Project Implementation
4.5    The project met with substantial delays in all components with the exception of the drilling of
exploration wells. Import of oilfield equipment was delayed on average by two and a half years, studies



12
were delayed by about four years, construction of the building for the training programs, the computer
center and the laboratory were delayed by about five years, and operation of the LPG plant was delayed
by almost six years.
4.6    Learning Bank Procedures. Bank supervision missions and the PCR tended to lay most of the
blame for delays on the inexperience of the various Chinese agencies in working with Bank
procurement procedures. While this inexperience played an important role in perpetuating the delays,
it is neither a complete explanation nor an adequate justification for them. To the extent that it was a
major contributing factors it could have been substantially overcome if the Bank had recognized it early
and taken action to overcome it by establishing a procurement training program in the project cycle.
This training program was established many years later, after the problems became pervasive in all
Bank lending operations.
4.7    Coordination of Chinese Agencies. The problem of the Borrower's lack of experience with
Bank procurement procedures was exacerbated by the cumbersome Chinese intemal procurement
approval process, which required coordination of approvals by five separate Chinese agencies. The
executing agency (ZPEB) had to obtain the approval of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry (MOPI) and
the Machinery and Electrical Equipment Import Inspection Wing under the State Council for all
technical aspects of the bids. The National Import Agency (CNTIC) had to approve the specifications
and issue the bidding documents. All four agencies were jointly responsible for evaluating the bids and
negotiating details with the winning bidder. Finally, after the contract was written by CNTIC, the
National Committee for Contracts had to approve it.'
4.8    The bidding documents, the bid appraisals and the award of the final contract also had to be
reviewed by the Bank. All had to be translated into Chinese, reviewed, then translated back into
English for communication to the Bank. Furthermore, since the approval process was a sequential one,
in which Bank approvals were requested only after all other approvals were obtained, the whole
sequence of translations and approvals having to be repeated when the Bank requested changes to
conform with its standards. Finally, when the time came for payments to be made, the National Bank
of China had to also review the documentation and approve each step.
4.9    Even after the problems came to light during the first year of project implementation, the Bank
was unable to convince the GOC to make the changes needed to improve the situation. The GOC was
unwilling to remove CNTIC's monopoly position on foreign trade activities. Nor would the GOC
establish an effective inter-agency working groups to facilitate procurement processing.
4.10   The lack of urgency in resolving these types of problems can be seen in the agreement during
negotiations, that the project team for ZPEB would be in place within six months after Board
presentation (i.e. by September 1983, a year after the Appraisal). In fact, it was not until the first
procurement supervision mission in September 1983, that the institutional procedures were reviewed
by Bank staff. And in March 1984, a procurement mission noted that procurement was delayed as a
result of the Borrower's inexperience with Bank procedures. By this time the Bank had recognized the
problems created by the lack of coordination among the responsible agencies, but it appears to have
done little to find a resolution to them besides exhorting the GOC to set up a coordination committee.
'The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which has taken over the role of MOPI, has
noted that "the approved procedure among the five agencies was not exactly like that expected" in
this simplified description.



13
The problem was supposed to be resolved by the reorganization of CNTIC in March 1985, but Bank
missions continued to complain about inexperienced and overworked staff. With such a complex
process, it is not surprising to find that there were substantial delays in the initial project phases, delays
often of twelve months and more.
4.11   Lesson: This coordination problem should have been identified at the time of appraisal and
addressed early on in the project cycle. Although it was already recognized that these procedures would
be cumbersome, the Appraisal Mission failed to analyze the implications of these complex institutional
arrangements in terms of institutional interface requirements among the institutions through each
procedural step.
4.12   Lesson:  After a close inspection of supervision mission Back-To-Office  Reports and
Aide-Memoires, the Audit concludes large supervision missions and new project preparation missions
visited China, they held few, if any, discussions with senior level officials about the actions needed to
be taken for institutional strengthening. The Audit therefore concludes that one of the major reasons
that this problem remained unresolved for so long was that the lone petroleum project procurement
specialist was, for all practical purposes, the only person actively engaged in trying to establish the
institutional change needed to improve the situation. Although he was able to bring the problem to the
attention of the Government, he was unable to get the Government to commit itself to a specific course
of action to achieve institutional reforms that could improve interagency communications.
4.13    Both the Bank and the GOC have learned from their experiences with these projects. Many of
the procurement problems associated with these projects have for the most part been resolved during
the last few years, and it is likely that China's new procurement staff will be much better prepared.
In the recent Sichuan Gas Project (Loan 3716-CHA), the Government has organized a Coordination
Committee to ensure that procurement processing remains on track. The detailed operation of this
committee and its impact on the interface among the various agencies is yet to be determined, and its
effectiveness is yet to be tested, but its establishment does indicate that the problem has been recognized
at the highest levels.
4.14   Negotiation of Contracts. Substantial delays also took place after the winning contractor had
been agreed upon. Negotiations on the final terms and conditions of contracts often took up to 10
months, an exceptionally long time by Bank standards.  For consultant study contracts, some
negotiations took up to 18 months. In addition, implementation process was also far from smooth.
Studies were often extended or delayed due to the borrower's expectations about what the final results
should be. These delays were often caused by differences in opinion between the project entity and the
contractors on the appropriate scope of the work to be performed and, sometimes on the insistence of
the project entities to expend the coverage of certain aspects of the scope.
4.15    Writing the Bidding Documents: There were, in addition, other significant causes for delayed
project implementation that could be avoided in the future. The most critical of these was the initial
implementation delay, which was in writing the technical specifications for the bidding documents.. This
bid preparation process took nine to twelve months instead of the three that had originally been
scheduled. The Bank could have greatly reduced this delay. First, it initiated this critical path activity
rather late in the project preparation cycle: only shortly before the project was taken to the Board.
Second, it apparently chose a firm that it had not worked with before and failed to enforce the agreed
time schedule. Having started so late, the Bank needed to maintain a close control and supervision to
minimize further delays.



14
4.16   Recommendation: Training programs for Bank procurement and loan disbursement practices
should be a required part of any project with a new borrower or new executing agency. These programs
are particularly important when the country itself has only recently joined the Bank Group, is
undergoing a transformation to a more open economy and is, as yet, still unfamiliar with intemational
bidding and Bank procedures. Where inter-agency coordination is necessary, a procurement seminar
should be given exclusively for all the staff who will have to work together on the new project. In this
way the seminar could initiate the process of teamwork that is needed for efficient project
implementation.
4.17   Recommendation:  The Bank may need to consider intervening in the contract negotiations
when they extend beyond what would appear to be normal and appropriate, or when a pattem of
extended negotiations begins to develop. In such cases the Bank could request a participatory role as
a neutral facilitator, to keep the negotiations in line with the scope of the original bidding documents.
Such intervention could be particularly important when the recommendations of the consultant study
are considered critical for proper implementation of other project elements.
4.18   Recommendation: If a project is expected to be implemented quickly, it may be necessary to
hire a consultant company to prepare bidding packages during the Appraisal Mission, so that the initial
bidding documents could be ready for discussion at, or before negotiations.
The Reservoir Study
4.19   The Reservoir Study was supposed to be the central element of an optimal development plan
for the South Weiyuan oilfield. However it took four times as long to implement as expected, and
never produced the results expected by ZPEB. At appraisal (September 1982) it was agreed that it
would be initiated in April 1983, and would be completed within nine months, that is by the end of
1983. Such timing would have been highly optimistic under any conditions. In China, with its complex
procurement procedures, and its lack of experience in working with foreign consultant firms, it was
totally unrealistic.
4.20   The study was actually started in May, 1984, a year behind schedule. Part of the delay was due
to a six-month long negotiations with the winning bidder during which the terms of reference were
revised and refined.  The study got off to a bad start when ZPEB realized that the consultant's
experience was primarily with marine sedimentary basins, rather than continental sedimentary basins,
such as those found in Zhongyuan. The study was then dragged out for four years, during which time
ZPEB was able to get the consultant to substantially deepen its investigation. Only about 80% of the
agreed tasks had been completed when the consultant company declared bankruptcy and stopped
operating. However, by this time study results were of only an academic interest, since almost all of
the decisions on how to develop the field had already been made and the wells drilled and completed.
Furthermore, ZPEB would have been unable to expand on the reservoir analysis for the next phase of
secondary enhanced recovery, because the contract had not included the modeling software needed to
extend the results.
4.21   In spite of the failure of the study to come to closure, ZPEB reported some important benefits
derived from the study in terms of transfer of technical knowledge. Engineers who participated in the
study were trained at the consultant's headquarters in the advanced theory for conducting reservoir
engineering studies, including the handling of the software and hardware. The experience gained while



15
working with the consultants has enabled ZPEB to design its own reservoir model with independently
purchased software.
4.22   Lessons: First, technical studies in Bank projects often take much longer to organize and
implement than they would under ideal conditions in developed countries. Some of the more important
difficulties are:
The borrower may be unfamiliar with working with foreign consultants, and may
therefore not be able to take into account the limitations of the consultant.
*      There are likely to be confidentiality considerations and communications difficulties
between the consultant and the executing agency that make data transfer more
complicated.
*     The data base that the consultants must work with is often of a significantly lower
quality than that found in a similar situation in a technologically sophisticated OECD
country company.  In fact, information technology is often at the heart of the
technological improvements that the Borrower is looking for.
*      Physical distances and limited communications facilities that one often finds in oilfields
in borrowing countries can slow down communications and direct interactions.
4.23   Second, the method of implementing the study was more important for the transfer of
Technology in this project than the study's final technical conclusions. The process of sending the
Borrower's technical staff to the consultant's headquarters to assist in implementing technical studies
proved to be an effective method for obtaining maximum benefits from the transfer of technology.
4.24   Recommendations.  First, Bank staff need to take these difficulties into consideration if they
are to establish a realistic timetable for major studies; and if a study is supposed to be on the critical
path for project implementation, as this one was, then Bank staff need to identify the likely problems,
propose remedies, pay close attention to the implementation process, and react quickly to the first signs
of problems.
4.25   Second, when borrowers have had little or no experience in working with foreign consultants,
the Bank should consider suggesting that its technical staff be present during negotiations and during
interim project reviews, to act as neutral facilitators.
4.26   Third, in the petroleum industry, where data gathering is an integral and continuous part of
resource development planning, project design should include the transfer of technology for
continuously updating development planning studies. To accomplish this goal, petroleum reservoir
studies should always include funds for the purchase of the hardware and software needed to follow
through with continuous updating of the study results.
4.27   Finally, the Bank should consider copying in other countries the same framework as it has
utilized so successfully with the China petroleum loans for integrating on-the-job training with technical
assistance studies.



16
The Management Information System (NIS) Study
4.28   The Management Information System (MIS) Study was intended to establish a data management
and retrieval system that would allow ZPEB management to have at their fingertips up-to-date
information on the company's technical and financial operation, particularly those related to their
exploration and field development programs. This type of MIS is in use in all international companies,
and, in theory, should have been a good working tool for Zhongyuan. However, after the bidding and
bid proposal evaluation had been completed, ZPEB decided that the potential from the implementation
of the study would not justify the cost of over $2 million dollars. After many delays and much
discussion, the Bank finally agreed to cancel this project component.
4.29   The study had been strongly recommended by the Bank Appraisal Mission, but ZPEB was
never very enthusiastic about it. This difference of viewpoints was never fully resolved, at least
partially because Bank staff failed to recognize the basic reasons for ZPEB reluctance. This reluctance
was based on a strongly held belief that a computerized MIS system could not be effectively
implemented into their operations. The Audit believes that their assessment was correct. At that time
computers were very expensive and were used only for highly technical seismic analysis which could
be handled in no other way. Outside this area, managers and staff were unfamiliar with their operation.
More importantly, few people could be expected to learn to use the MIS system, because at that time
all programs had to be written and operated in English. (An effective method for writing in Chinese
on a computer keyboard was not developed until 1989.) Without the use of Chinese characters, the
system could be used by only a handful of English educated technical staff, and therefore, was highly
unlikely to become a working tool for management.
4.30   Recommendation: The Bank should continue to encourage enterprises in China to implement
MIS Studies and to computerize their operations. Conditions for implementing such a study have
greatly improved in the last few years. Inexpensive desktop computers are now found at all levels,
off-the-shelf software systems are available at a reasonable price, and a system for using Chinese
characters has been developed and is in general use. Therefore, an MIS program would most probably
be a useful component for any future petroleum project in China, as well as in other countries.
5. PROJECT OUTCOME AND SUSTAINABILITY
5.1    Despite the long delays in the implementation process, the project was highly successful in
transferring exploration and production technology to ZPEB, and in assisting ZPEB increase its oil and
gas production. It had an important environmental impact, in that it ensured the utilization of natural
gas that was previously being flared, and found solutions during implementation for eliminating
environmentally unsound water processing practices. The Audit finds that the project was highly
satisfactory, and that its successes in improving ZPEB operating capacity are likely to be sustainable.
It was less successful in helping ZPEB to improve its institutional management capabilities. Its
institutional development impact was therefore negligible.

KARAMAY PETROLEUM PROJECT
(LOAN 2426-CHA)
1. BACKGROUND
1.1    Until the late 1970's , China was remarkably successful in implementing a policy of total
self-reliance in petroleum production. However, the rate of discoveries did decline throughout the
decade, and there were no major finds in the early part of the 1980's. In the early 1980's GOC turned
to the Bank to provide technical assistance to enhance the productivity of Chinese oil companies,
primarily through the identification of technological problems, appraisal of hydrocarbon prospects, and
assistance in the selection of technologies which could be disseminated rapidly and would help upgrade
ongoing production and exploration efforts.
1.2    The basic rationale for the Bank's participation in China's petroleum sector therefore lay in the
packaging of technical assistance programs and subsequently overseeing their implementation. Because
conditions are so diverse within the different petroleum producing areas of the country, technical
problems of each oil company are quite unique and require the creating of an individually focused
package of technical assistance for each oilfield.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.1    Karamay was the third and last Bank project to focus on increasing oil production. As in the
preceding Daqing and Zhongyuan projects, the project objective was the provision of technical
assistance to enhance long-term  productivity.  In Karamay the assistance was tailored to the
requirements for enhancing its heavy oil recovery program, in addition to updating its light oil
exploration and production technology.
2.2    The project had four major components:
*     Support for an expanded exploration program for light oil, including seismic data
acquisition, geological and reservoir studies, and processing and the drilling of about
370 exploration, appraisal wells. This massive exploration program was expected to
add some 350 million tons of light oil reserves (oil-in-place), in support of KOC's plans
to increase light oil production from 4 million tons in 1983 to 7 million tons in 1990.
*     Evaluation of the potential for establishing production from heavy oil oilfields that have
already been discovered Karamay and in Liaohe, including design of pilot projects to
test alternative methods for thermal recovery of this oil. This component was expected
to begin to increase heavy oil recovery in the 1990's.
Support KOC's overall operations by providing critically needed technical inputs for
KOC's exploration and development program, and establishing a training center for
skilled workers, while maintaining, through supervision, the implementation and



18
dissemination of new technologies, and implementing a costing study to improve
KOC's methodology for investment planning.
Support future operations for the development of China's off shore gas resources by
carrying out a Gas Utilization Study for gas that had been recently discovered offshore
in Southern China.
2.3    The project was approved by the Board on May 29, 1984, became effective September 15,
1984, and was completed on March 31, 1991.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
3.1    As in the first two petroleum projects, there were significant delays in procurement and in the
execution of technical assistance components. As a result, some project benefits were delayed and the
closing date of the project had to be extended by two years. The primary reasons for these delays were
similar to those for the previous projects: (i) lack of coordination in the procurement process among
concerned agencies, with KOC responsible for deciding what to purchase, the International Trading
Corporation responsible for communicating with purchasing from foreign suppliers, and the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) responsible for approving all disbursements; (ii) the subsequent
slow process of soliciting and evaluating bids; (iii) protracted contract negotiations, with frequent
changes in technical specifications; and (iv) frequent revisions of scope of contractual work, both during
contract negotiations and during implementation.
Light Oil
3.2    The exploration program for light oil was much smaller and less successful than expected
during appraisal. Only 201 exploration/appraisal wells were drilled, compared with the 370 well
program expected at appraisal. Discoveries of new fields and extensions of known fields added about
150 million tons new light oil reserves (in-place). The relative lack of success led to substantial
adjustments in developing drilling plans, including a shift in drilling efforts to the developing of the
new reserves, with the drilling of 500 development wells. The resultant increase in production of light
oil was about 1.9 million tons per year in 1990, compared with the increase of about 4.1 million tons
expected during appraisal. Total light oil production from previous and new discoveries is expected to
average about 4.4 million tons in the first half of the 1990's and decline to 2.2 million tons by 2000.
Heavy Oil at Karamay
3.3    Support for the heavy oil program  was greatly expanded under the project.  Instead of
supporting experimental pilots, the project was restructured to support a program for full development
of KOC's heavy oil resources, including the drilling of over 1100 wells. The development program has
been highly successful. Production, which was originally projected to remain at below 50,000 tons per
year, rose to 1.4 million tons in 1990 and is expected to increase to more than 2.7 million tons per year
by 2000. The reason for the restructuring is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 4.5-4.8



19
Heavy Oil at Liaohe
3.4    The studies for the Liaohe heavy oil pilot development program, which included an economic
analysis of the benefits, showed that while the program was feasible, the development would not be
economically viable for Liaohe heavy oil. The large scale pilot was abandoned. The transfer of
technology was, however, effectively implemented in that it was applied subsequently to other heavy
oil fields in the Liaohe region.
Training Center
3.5    As in Daqing and Zhongyuan, a training center was built, a training curricula was established
to systematically train KOC's skilled workers and engineers, and instructors for these courses were
trained. Completion of the center was greatly delayed by almost four years, primarily because it took
KOC a long time to initiate construction of the physical facilities and to initiate and implement the study
needed to design the course program. When the program was established, a core of instructors were
trained abroad in modern training techniques and they returned to Karamay to train a cadre of local
instructors. When finally established, the program was highly successful, training some 4000 skilled
workers since it was opened. It has been hampered, however, by the failure of the drilling rig
simulation machine to function.
Studies
3.6    Four independent studies were carried out under the project in addition to the work related to
establishing a training program for skilled workers. The two technical studies were carried out by
consultants with the assistance of KOC staff. Both encountered significant delays, both before and after
the contracts were signed. In addition to the direct benefits from the results, the studies created
important indirect benefits through the transfer of technical know-how to the KOC staff who worked
with the consultants, and were trained by them  in modern methodology.  The other two were
implemented by local groups.
3.7    The Reservoir Study was successful in optimizing the development of the Wuerhe light oil
field. The study included the creation of a computerized dynamic reservoir simulation model, and the
testing of modern well completion techniques in the difficult "tight" reservoir conditions found in this
oil field. The results far exceeded expectations. Implementation of the consultant recommendations
for existing wells in the field resulted in a doubling of production from 300,000 to 600,000 tons per
years and a reduction in the normnal decline in field production from the pre-study expectation of 15%
per year, to only 3% per year.
3.8    The Geological Study was less than fully successful in providing new leads for KOC's
exploration efforts. It had originally been intended to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
structural geology and hydrocarbon potential of the entire Junggar basin where the Karamay oilfields
are located. As implemented, however, it focused on only one small section of the basin, where KOC
had direct control of the operations. The results were of limited use for KOC because they focused
almost exclusively on identifying potential drilling locations in a set of local structures where KOC had
made one small discovery. The study provided discouraging data on the quality of the reservoir rock,
which was confirmed through the drilling of three exploration wells on the most promising identified
locations, all of which were non-productive.



20
3.9    The Costing Study was carried out by Chinese experts, rather than foreign consultants as
originally proposed. Experts were chosen from ten petroleum institutions to recommend ways to
introduce modern financial management and cost control methodologies. Terms of reference were
reviewed in depth with Bank staff. The comprehensive study identified the most serious problems in
KOC accounting and cost methodology, and recommended specific practical improvements. These
improvements have allowed KOC to have a much more accurate picture of both the cost of producing
oil from individual fields, and in many cases from individual wells, as well as the income generated by
these fields and wells. It also allowed KOC to determine the cost of drilling each well and to establish
standard drilling costs that could be used as comparators to judge future efficiency gains. KOC
reviewed the study recommendations with the Bank and has integrated them into their operating
practices.
3.10   The South China Gas Utilization Study was implemented by staff of the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), rather than by foreign experts as originally envisaged. CNOOC
requested that it do the work itself because it had a direct interest in the study and because it owned
the gas that was the subject of the utilization study. The study was less than fully successful. It did
a good job of evaluating the cost of developing and transporting the gas to potential users, but it failed
to cover issues related to the economics of end user investments, which was the most critical input for
the process of developing an optimum gas utilization plan.
4. ISSUES
Findings and Lessons of PCR Report
4.1    Economic Return and Sustainability: The project is expected to have a 31% ERR, based on
the incremental cost and incremental volume of oil produced. In 1991, the cost of producing heavy oil
was $53 per ton compared with a value of $95 per ton, while the cost of light oil was $33 per tons, and
its value was $110 per ton. While costs may have gone up slightly since 1991, the PCR found that the
rate of return is expected to still be in the highly respectable 25%-30% range. The production increases
are expected to be maintained over the next 10 to 12 years, assuring sustainability of the project. The
KOC staff were highly motivated to absorb new skills and use new technology.  The technical
enhancement of KOC operations can be expected to be maintained with continued contact with the
outside world for exchange of technical knowledge, which is expected. The Audit is in full agreement
with these findings.
4.2    Studies: Some of the consultant studies were expanded to cover a wider scope than was strictly
necessary for the purpose of the project, which greatly increased the time required for their completion.
The Bank could have assisted in trimming the scope to the project needs, and thereby helped to avoid
delays in study completion. (The Audit is in full agreement with this conclusion.)
4.3    Other issues and lessons that were covered in less detail in the PCR are discussed below, along
with recommendations for improving implementation in the future.



21
Procurement
4.4    As with the previous two projects, procurement for the Karamay project started slowly, with
the same problems of coordination among the three concerned entities, KOC, CNTIC, and MOPI. After
three years of project implementation (end 1987) disbursement was only 41% of the appraisal estimate.
Loan completion was delayed by two years. While the procurement coordination problem had been
recognized shortly after the first two projects started to be implemented, little had been done to resolve
the problem before this third project had been sent to the Board. The Government had promised that
a coordination task force would be established by December 1984, but they had still not been organized
by mid 1990. It might have been better to have focused early on this coordination problem and make
it a condition of Board presentation or at least of disbursement.
Lesson. The Bank should have insisted that these problems be resolved as a condition of
moving forward with the Karamay project. Both the Bank and the GOC have learned from their
experiences with these projects.
The Shift to Heavy Oil Development
4.5    Conditions in KOC's oilfields changed rapidly during the implementation of the project. At
the time of the Bank's first identification mission to Karamay, KOC was producing less than 40,000
tons of heavy oil per year, from a reserves estimated at that time of 1.2 billion tons. With the
technology in use at that time, KOC was unable to establish an effective production program. In the
hope that the use of modern technology would solve some of KOC's problems, MOPI requested that
the Bank include a heavy oil component in the Karamay project.
4.6    The mission identified the most important reasons for KOC's lack of success in its previous
attempts to recover heavy oil through steam injection ana encouraged KOC to expand it's heavy oil
program. Solutions were suggested for many of KOC's technical problems, including those related to
inadequate well completion and cementing techniques, untreated water that corroded the tubing,
inadequate well spacing, and low quality steam boilers. However, the mission took the position that
these solutions should be tested on a pilot basis, and some pilot programs should be undertaken to
establish the data needed to design an optimum investment program before full field development was
initiated. The Bank project supported the work needed for these pilot programs, with the idea that
subsequent projects would support full field development if it proved economically viable. Progress,
however, proved much faster than anticipated.
4.7    Within a year after project effectiveness, KOC had successfully developed a number of small
scale heavy oil pilots and had decided to shift much of its attention to expanding heavy oil production.
The shift was particularly timely in light of the lack of significant successes in the exploration program
for light oil. Subsequently, the consultant firm hired by KOC for design of the special pilot studies was
also employed, with Bank concurrence, to undertake the basic conceptual design for full field
development and to review the technical parameters of this development.
4.8    The Bank worked closely with KOC to restructure the project to take advantage of new
opportunities in the rapidly changing conditions in the oilfield. Funds were shifted from the light oil
project component to support a greatly expanded program to drill delineation and development wells
(an increase from the original 160 to a final 1,126) and a concomitant growth in surface facilities,



22
particularly steam generators, which increased from 4 to 40 (29 of which were eventually financed
under the loan).
4.9    The program was highly successful: Production reached 1.5 million barrels by 1992, and
benefits of increased production will continue well beyond the turn of the century.
4.10   Recommendation: However, the resulting project went well beyond the scope of the original
project, and the changes were made without formal agreement by Bank Management or the Board.
Majority changes of this nature should be formally reviewed by Bank management and approved by
the Board. They do not always produce such positive results.
Training
4.11    Seven drilling rig simulators were bought for the three training centers financed by the Bank
(Daqing, Zhongyuan and Karamay), and all had the same problem with their computer hardware and
software.
4.12   Recommendation: If the executing agency is unable to inspect the specialized equipment before
it is shipped, contracts should call for inspection before shipping by an independent inspection agency.
In this case such an inspection would have demonstrated that the design was incomplete and machine
would not work.
4.13   While on-the-job training for the use of new equipment was quite effective, the overseas
technical training program for engineers and managers got off to a very slow start, and did not train the
number of people that it should have. By early 1989, four years after the project had started, only 15
people had been sent for training at foreign academic institutions, out of the 55 people planned. The
training on heavy oil development was also cut short, with field training reduced by over 50% (29 to
14 man months) and technical training at the headquarters of the consultant reduced by 25%. In all
cases the problem appeared to be the organization and implementation of foreign language training
needed as a prerequisite.
4.14   Recommendation:  Where foreign language training is needed, it should be included as a
specific project component. Institutional arrangements need to be worked out for this training at
appraisal or, at the latest, at negotiations, since learning a foreign language is always a time consuming
process. Some of this training need to be done in the foreign country. This language training program
should include training of management and business staff, in addition to technical staff, since technical
staff rarely have time to translate materials when they return.
4.15   Conclusion: All of the training programs focused on the development of technical expertise
in the fields of exploration and production. None were developed for the equally important area of
modem management techniques for line managers and senior managers.
4.16   Recommendation:  More attention should be paid to the training of managers, since this is
where the modern attitudes towards operational efficiency can be most effectively introduced.



23
Technical Studies
4.17   For the Geological Study, the Bank failed to convince the implementing agency (KOC) to
implement the original terms of reference for a broad-based study of the entire basin, which would
provide wider benefits for all the petroleum enterprise operating in the region under the auspices of the
Xinjiang Petroleum Administration. The approach of looking at only one small part of the basin limited
its ability to determine the prospectiveness of the area and to prioritize regional exploration investment
opportunities. Thus, the results of the study provided minimal benefits to KOC, limited primarily to
a confirmation of their existing understanding of the basin's geology and potential in their area of
operation. Nevertheless, KOC believed that it benefitted indirectly through thc training and transfer of
know-how in terms of the consultant's research methodology, and its techniques for computerized data
compilation for sophisticated geological maps. The study ran into a number of difficulties because the
consultant company changed many of the study team during the study implementation. This change
was made without the consent of the borrower, although the contract called for such consent to be
received.
4.18   One of the most important aspects of the Reservoir Engineering Study was that the technology
developed was used by KOC staff after the study was completed. They were able to do so because the
computer work stations and the reservoir simulation model software that was used for the Wuerhe
reservoir study were supplied by the consultant to KOC as part of the study package. Since KOC staff
had been trained in the operation of the model through on-the-job training, while they worked with the
consultants in the design and modification of the model to fit the Wuerhe reservoir, they were able to
continue to update and optimize production programs as updated information was retrieved from newly
drilled wells.
4.19   Equally importantly, they were able to use the technology to design optimal production
programs for many of their other oilfields. Although the study was extremely important for KOC, it's
initiation was delayed by over a year, primarily by protracted negotiations on details of responsibilities,
coverage, and costing of deleted and added components. The negotiations did, in fact, lead to better
contractual conditions for KOC in terms of breath of coverage and cost. However, KOC paid a high
cost in terms of delays in implementation and confusion about the extent of the consultant's contractual
obligations. This confusion was exacerbated by repeated KOC's requests during project implementation
for the modification and extension of the consultant's work program. Many of these requests were
acceded to, although few led to a substantially improved final product. As a result, the study took 40
months to complete instead of the contracted 18 months.
4.20   The Costing Study was highly successful in introducing modem management techniques for
economic decision making both for day-to-day decision making and cost control and for longer term
strategic investment decision making. The increased consciousness of the importance of financial
analysis that these new techniques create has had an identifiable effect on how management makes
operational decisions. For instance, the analysis techniques has been used to decide which heavy oil
field development programs were economically justified and which were technically feasible but
economically unjustified because of the excessively high costs. In addition, the study recommendations
have been distributed to all the oil companies whose experts worked on the study.



24
4.21   The creation of a special group of experts from a wide range of local oil enterprises, instead
of just from the executing agency (KOC) ensured that there would be an openness to outside
information and cross fertilization of ideas. Bank support through detailed review of the final terms of
reference with the technical group helped to assure that the study would focus on finding solutions for
critical issues. Finally, sector wide participation made it easier to disseminate the recommendations to
all sector institutions.
4.22   The Gas Utilization Study considered only the issues of gas production, and neglected the
issues of gas utilization that are central to the establishment of priorities for maximizing the benefits
from the use of the gas. The study therefore failed to meet the Bank's objectives for undertaking the
study, which was to establish the basis for making a gas masterplan, or at least the basis for agreeing
on meaningful economic priorities for its utilization.
4.23   Lesson: The implementing group was from the CNOOC, the entity that was responsible for
overseeing the study's implementation. This arrangement created three problems. First the narrow
institutional base of the study team made it more difficult to view issues from a broad national
perspective. Second, CNOOC had difficulty implementing the gas utilization portion of the study,
without appearing to undermine the authority of the Ministry of Petrochemical Industries. Third,
lacking an arms length relationship with the study team, CNOOC, the responsible agency was less
prepared to take a critical view of the study's weaknesses.
4.24   The Bank also failed to fill these gaps by undertake the critical review process or by insisting
that a technical consultant be used to help with structuring the study and/or reviewing its progress.
Supervision missions failed to review with CNOOC management and the study team the final Terms
of Reference to ensure that it maintained its original focus, probably because these missions did not
include the needed technical skills.
Lessons Learned from Implementation of Studies
4.25   Changes in Terms of Reference (TOR) for consultant studies after they have been agreed with
and approved by the Bank were, in many cases, detrimental to successful implementation of the study.
If the study is on the project's critical time path, the TOR should to be confirmed by appraisal. It is
important that all parties agree with the scope and direction of the study. The Bank should then make
every effort to discourage borrowers from changing the TORs after bids have been received. Such
efforts have led to long, drawn out negotiations with the successful bidder, to the detriment of project
implementation timetables.  Since such practices are contrary to the Bank's normal procurement
practices, Bank staff should request to participate in negotiations to help both parties come to closure,
when negotiations extend beyond the normally expected one or two weeks.
4.26   Studies were also delayed when borrowers suggested, and consultants agreed, to change the
study scope in the course of its implementation. With hindsight, one can see that Bank staff should
have carefully monitored any agreed changes in study scope and should have worked with both parties
to ensure that unrealistic expectations on the part of the borrower did not push the consultant to promise
more than could be delivered, with eventual inconclusive results.



25
4.27   The inclusion of the hardware and software to continue to carry out the reservoir simulation
modeling allowed the implementing agency "to take possession, of' and " to own" the new technology.
This ownership is a critical element in it adaptation and continued use. The alternative of just receiving
a completed study with recommendations from a consultant has been shown, in other projects in China
to be unsuccessful in having the new technology adopted into the ongoing operational procedures of
the enterprise. Therefore, all studies that use computer modeling should include sufficient hardware and
software to enable the implementing agency to continue the activity, either on its own, or, where
appropriate, in conjunction with a local institution that specializes in this activity.
4.28   Financial accounting and costing studies can be successfully implemented by local groups, if
these groups have access to the techniques used in more advanced countries.  There are many
advantages to implementing such studies with local groups, the most important of which may be that
it establishes the internal "ownership" of the results which makes dissemination and adoption much
more likely.
4.29   When gas utilization planning studies are considered important for improving the planning
process for optimization of investment programs, the Bank needs to ensure the cooperation across
agencies responsible for planning supply and utilization. Such a study is unlikely to be successful if
only one of the concerned agencies is involved in its implementation. If a local group is to undertake
the study it should be composed of a sufficiently wide range of participants to ensure access to data
needed to cover both production and utilization data. There should be an arms length relationship
between the study team and the executing agency. If Bank staff are unavailable for detailed supervision
of studies undertaken by local groups, arrangements should be made to have an international expert
review the study at critical junctures during its implementation.
5. PROJECT OUTCOME AND SUSTAINABILITY
5.1    The project was highly successful in meeting its development objectives of introducing modern
oilfield technology, including management financial costing and control, and of assisting KOC to
increase its oil production levels. It was less successful than expected at appraisal in increasing the
production of light oils, but was much more successful than expected in increasing heavy oil production.
Institutional development, particularly that related to financial management and controls also appears
to have been significant. The benefits are likely to be sustainable in the future.
5.2    The project scope was substantially altered to meet the evolving oilfield conditions. The shift
of emphasis to the development of heavy oil after it was learned that the potential for light oil was less
than originally thought was appropriate. However, given the size of the shift in project scope, some
more formal internal approvals should probably have been sought.

CONCLUSIONS FOR ALL THREE PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
1.     The three projects of this Audit reflect the first stage of the development of Bank assistance to
China's Petroleum Sector. They focused primarily on introducing modem technology, the training of
staff at all levels in the use of this technology, and utilizing this technology to improve the productivity
and safety of oilfield operations and to increase the volume of oil that could be produced from these
fields.  In these endeavors they were completely successful.  New technology was successfully
introduced, training centers were established to train staff in all aspects of modem oilfield operations,
productivity was increased, and a great deal more oil was produced than would have been possible using
the older, outdated technology previously available.
2.     The results of the technical assistance and staff training must be ranked as the most important
achievements of these three projects, in spite of the delay caused in the actual training program by the
other delays in the procurement process and in overall project implementation. In this respect, the
capabilities of all three operating companies and their contribution towards the petroleum industry in
China have been significantly enhanced by the implementation of these projects.
3.     A great many difficulties were encountered in procurement processing, many of which can be
attributed to the cumbersome institutional arrangements that the Bank felt obliged to accept as a cost
of rapidly expanding its lending program in a country with highly centralized decision making
institutions. The projects were less successful in establishing institutional change in financial self
reliance, and financial decision-making using modem management tools.
4.     The projects were appraised without any significant sector review or sector policy dialogue.
Recognizing that it would take considerable time to develop a successful policy dialogue on institutional
and economic issues, the Bank accepted many constraints that might not have been accepted in
countries where a dialogue had already been established over an extended period. By sidestepping
sector policy issues, the Bank was able to assist in speeding up the rate of technical progress in the
petroleum sector at a critical juncture in China's petroleum development efforts. The Audit believes
that this flexible approach greatly enhanced the Bank's effectiveness in making an important impact on
the sector.
5.     There were, however, many sector issues where a policy dialogue might have helped sector
performance.  The project entities continued to suffer from the effects of operating in a highly
centralized central planning environment. The most important of these constraints was the lack of
independence of the executing agency.  Petroleum  enterprises were closely controlled by central
govemment agencies: by MOPI/CNPC for their investment policies and by CNTIC for their foreign
purchases. They were never expected to be efficient, profit maximizing entities, but were, instead,
expected to meet specific quantitative output targets. Furthermore, prices were controlled, by the central
government, and were never allowed to approximate international prices, while most operating profits
were redistributed to the central authorities.
6.     The possible usefulness of a policy dialogue on these issues in the early 1980s is, of course,
questionable. China was not ready to make the structural policy changes that were needed to make each
entity an independent efficiency oriented entity. However, China has been moving rapidly to a more



27
market oriented, decentralized economy, and the petroleum industry is likely to see significant structural
reform in the next few years. The Bank has been working with the Government on evaluating
altemative ways of restructuring the sector so as to increase the level of competition among the many
operating entities, and to introduce further competition through expanding the role of foreign producers
and service companies.
7.     The Bank has done little in the way of basic sector studies that are an essential element for a
future policy dialogue. The choice of the first projects was left to the Chinese authorities (MOPI), and
there was no independent effort made to determine whether these projects were the most important ones
for the sector as a whole. Given the time constraints, the size of the country, and the significance of
the first three projects, this approach was a reasonable way to initiate a sector lending program. It was
undoubtedly expected that knowledge of the sector would mature over time. Unfortunately, the Bank
stopped virtually all oil sector work after the introduction of the OMS 3.82 in 1984, along with the
elimination of projects to assist China upgrade its technical capabilities to develop other already
discovered oil resources. The Region did undertake a sector policy review in 1990, but this review
looked mostly at the institutional aspects of the sector. It has yet to undertake a review of all the
country's major oil and gas operations, and is, therefore unable to discuss sector investment priorities
with the petroleum authorities. Clearly, if the Bank intends to continue to be active in the energy
sector, it needs to better understand sector priorities.
Bank Lending for Oil Development in China
8.     The Bank stopped virtually all oil sector work in China after the introduction of OMS 3.82 in
1984. The next two projects were for technical assistance. OMS 3.82 presents a reasonable approach
to the development of petroleum  resources in countries with limited petroleum  activities.  It also
represents a reasonable approach to exploration programs, where the high risk nature of the undertaking
makes it unsuitable for the use of borrowed funds, and where international companies have a clear
comparative advantage in technology know-how. However it makes much less sense when applied to
countries with a very large, established sector and with a massive petroleum production. In these
limited number of cases, a substantial part of the established resources should and will continue to be
developed by local enterprises, since it is unlikely that these operations can be effectively transferred
to foreign joint ventures. It makes little sense in these cases to refuse to assist in the transfer of modern
technology to these local operations.
9.     In the former situation, the domestic industry may have no comparative advantage in building
up and maintaining an international level of expertise. Government support for such industries may,
therefore, be an inefficient and costly way of developing its national resources. In the latter situation,
since the domestic industry in countries is already well established, the alternative of selling off oilfields
that are under production to foreign joint ventures is unlikely to be a viable alternative.

ANNEX I
CHINA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
Telex 22312 PCPRC CN
Liu pu Kang, Beijing, CHINA
June 22, 1994
Dear Sirs,
We have reviewed your draft Performance Audit Report (PAR), passed by MOF, for four World
Bank financed projects in China's oil/gas sector.' As the coordinator of those projects, we would like,
on behalf of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), to give our comments as follows:
1)    We highly appreciate the Auditor's significant and helpful work on those four projects.
2)    We agree to the PAR's conclusion that implementation of all four projects are successful
and satisfactory, although Weiyuan T.A. project only partially achieved its original
targets.
3)    We agree to most basic points of PAR and the lessons and recommendation given by the
Auditors for project implementation, particularly to the analysis of implementation and
procurement delay which was the common problem in all four projects. We have already
taken some measures for the ongoing Sichuan gas project to avoid such delays since we
have become aware of the significance of this problem.
4)    Internal coordination among four Chinese agencies:  We admit that inadequate
interagency coordination and cumbersome internal clearance procedures did exist in the
project implementation, but the approval procedure among the four agencies were not
exactly like that expressed in PAR (See Zhong Yuan project 4.7-4.8).
