Supply Engineering\n            Project will lay the basis for the expansion of\n            Managua's water supply system to meet the demand of\n            future population. It will also help increase the efficiency\n            of INAA. The six components of the project are: (i)\n            preparation of plans, technical specifications and contract\n            documents for the construction of the Tisma water supply\n            scheme, which will include about 37 wells, a pumping\n            station, about 25 km of transmission main, and water\n            storage; (ii) preparation of a detailed water demand study\n            for Managua; (iii) development of a distribution system\n            master plan for Managua and identification of a first stage\n            distribution improvement program necessary to adequately\n            distribute the water from the Tisma scheme; (iv) preparation\n            of plans, technical specifications and contract documents\n            for the construction of the first stage distribution\n            improvements; (v) repair of production meters, pumping\n            station instrumentation and reservoir level control valves;\n            and (vi) provision of technical assistance for organization\n            and management to help INAA fully integrate its two\n            predecessor organizations into a single efficiently run\n            entity and to complete a tariff study."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
