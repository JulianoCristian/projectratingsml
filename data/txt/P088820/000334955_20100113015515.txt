1 Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Georgia was one of the poorest performing economies in the Europe and Central Asia
region during much of the first decade of transition, with 2003 GDP at about 40% of its 1989
level. From 1992 to the turn of the century, there were some intermittent periods of optimism--
several structural reforms were implemented and there was a short period of macroeconomic
stability. However, while important laws, regulations, and institutional reforms were approved on
paper, actual implementation was poor. By 2003, reform momentum sputtered to a halt and
Georgia was a near failed state. Political power was increasingly fragmented, corruption and
crime were rampant, there were massive arrears in pension payments and teacher's salaries, and
infrastructure was in a state of near collapse, with most of the country without power and the road
network increasingly deteriorated.

2.       Weak governance, civil conflict, and pervasive corruption seriously impaired the
Government's capacity to both marshal the resources necessary to provide basic public goods and
services and to deliver on key public sector interventions. Tax revenues were relatively low
during 2001-2003 (about 14.5 percent of GDP), reflecting low collections, tax evasion and
significant smuggling. While many Georgians made payments to government officials, these
payments did not reach the Treasury. The Government engaged in significant external borrowing
to contain the shortfall in resources, with external public debt climbing to 52 percent of GDP by
2002. Still, on the spending side, commitments on pensions and wages could not be honored, and
there were sharp erosions of basic public services, in particular electricity, but also education and
health care services.

3.       Under such conditions, Georgia was ill placed to follow the strong recovery that most
other CIS countries began to experience after the Russian financial crisis in 1998. GDP growth in
Georgia averaged only 3.6 percent during the 1999-2002, while the simple average for the rest of
the CIS was almost twice as much at 7.2 percent. At the same time, overall living standards had
deteriorated significantly by 2003. While reliable data on poverty was not available, government
estimates suggested that about 52 percent of the population lived in poverty and 15 percent in
extreme poverty in 2003. Furthermore, non-income indicators of poverty reflected a widespread
lack of access to basic services for both the poor and the non-poor, with a particularly detrimental
impact on the well-being of the poor who have little means to cope with such constraints.

4.      By 2003, the Bank's dialogue and program in Georgia had reached a low, with no
Country Assistance Strategy since the one discussed with the Board in 1997 and covering the
period 1998-2000. Bank lending was significantly reduced in view of the worsening governance
environment. No new budget support loans were approved during 2000-2003, following the
Third Structural Adjustment Credit approved in June 1999.

5.      The poor conditions at the time provided fertile ground for a popular and peaceful
uprising, the "Rose Revolution," which broke out in late November 2003. In January 2004,
presidential elections were held and a new President, Mikheil Saakashvili, was elected with 97
percent of the vote in an election which international monitors confirmed as generally free and
fair. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2004, resulting in an overwhelming majority for
the new ruling coalition. This brought in a team of reformers to power.
6.      The Rose Revolution ushered in a period of profound change in Georgia, with the new
government moving quickly to control crime and corruption, improve governance and public
sector management, and providing indication that it was serious about adopting and implementing
a strong structural reform program. As a result, a donors' conference in Brussels in June 2004
pledged more than US$1.0 billion in support, with the IMF approving a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for US$144 million in the same month. Furthermore, the
Paris Club rescheduling of Georgia's debt in July 2004 lowered the near-term debt service burden.

7.      The Bank's program was also scaled up through approval of the Reform Support Credit
(RSC) in June 2004 in the amount of US$24 million to provide urgent assistance to the new
Government in the first phase of its efforts to define and launch a bold program of economic
reforms. The RSC supported an initial set of reforms in the areas of governance and anti-
corruption, public finance management, and the energy sector. The RSC laid some of the
groundwork for the subsequent Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) series.

8.       The reforms launched by the new government yielded a payoff in the immediate term.
GDP advanced by 5.9 percent in 2004 and on the fiscal side, tax receipts began to improve, rising
from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 19.7 percent in 2004 which, in turn, allowed an overall
fiscal deficit of only 0.3 percent of GDP in 2004. During that year, the Government cleared about
two-thirds of the substantial wage and pension arrears accumulated over the several years prior to
2004, with the remaining arrears cleared in 2005. A new tax code was approved in January 2005
to simplify tax policy and to generate further revenue enhancements needed for the large planned
increases in public social and infrastructure investment expenditures.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The main objective of the Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) series was to
provide systematic support to the new Government of Georgia in the implementation of its
ambitious reform program to restore a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, strengthen the
public sector, improve electricity and gas sector services, improve the environment for private
sector development, and improve social protection, education, and health sector services.

10.     The blueprint for the reform program supported by the PRSO series came from the
government's PRSP (or EDPRP, Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program, as it is
known in Georgia) as well as from the annual Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document that
comprised the newly adopted medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). The EDPRP was
directed at achieving rapid and sustained economic growth and reduced poverty through reform
actions in six areas: (i) strengthening governance; (ii) improving macro fiscal performance; (iii)
improving the business environment; (iv) reducing vulnerability of the poor; (v) enhancing
development of human capital; and (vi) protecting the environment. The new Government was
committed to monitoring implementation of its PRSP--an EDPRP Progress Report was issued in
March 2005 and an EDPRP Update was prepared in August 2006.

11.      The Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, approved September 2005) covering
FY2006-09 was based on the EDPRP Progress Report of March 2005 and focused on three key
areas--(i) enabling income- and employment-generating growth; (ii) human development and
social protection; and (iii) improving efficiency in public services--in addition to maintaining an
appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. The PRSO series was a cornerstone of the new
CPS and each of the four PRSO operations was disbursed once agreed triggers of policy and
institutional reform were satisfied. The reforms supported were directed at achieving key
objectives in the following four thematic areas (Pillars):

                                                2
12.      Strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency. A key
objective of the Government's program was to establish strong, efficient, and accountable public
sector institutions that performed their functions in a transparent manner and made effective use
of public resources. This pillar, therefore, focused on improvements in the public sector that cut
across public expenditure management, fiduciary activities, and public administration. Specific
policy areas included: (i) strengthening public budgeting and expenditure management; (ii)
enhancing transparency and efficiency in the public procurement system; (iii) improving
transparency and effectiveness of public financial management (PFM); (iv) strengthening local
governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations; (v) strengthening the public administration;
and (vi) enhancing public sector transparency and accountability.

13.      At the outset of the PRSO series, Georgia's capacity for public expenditure programming
was very limited, with little effort dedicated for a number of years to preparation of a formal
budget or a multi-year budget framework, and with minimal link between the Government's
strategic objectives and the budget. In the fiduciary areas, cash flow management practices were
poor, the Chamber of Control was suspended for a period of time to restore its basic function as
an external audit agency, and thousands of off-budget accounts created an environment for
corruption and made it difficult to allocate scarce cash to key priorities. In the area of
intergovernmental fiscal relations, the situation was characterized by a fragmented administrative
structure, unclear functional responsibilities between the second-tier rayons and the third-tier self-
governing authorities particularly in terms of delivering health and education services, weak
monitoring of fiscal conditions, and non-transparent allocation of local capital investment. In the
areas of public administration and transparency, governance was extremely weak and corruption
was pervasive, with the country ranking 133rd out of 145 on Transparency International's
corruption perception index in 2004.

14.     Improving electricity and gas sector services. The second pillar focused on addressing
the severe crisis faced by Georgia in the energy sector. Lack of dependable electricity and gas
sector services was significantly detrimental to economic activity and job creation, especially in
the rural areas, and had a heavy impact on the poorer segments of the population. The reform
effort was, therefore, directed at improving service and financial viability in the electricity and
gas sectors, including addressing electricity sector debt, improving payment collections, and
diversifying supply sources in the gas sector.

15.      At the outset of the PRSO series, the electricity sector and the north-south gas pipeline
were near the point of total collapse. The country was receiving an average of only seven hours
of electricity supply a day and since electricity supply was concentrated around Tbilisi, most of
the country was virtually without electricity. Collection rates were low, money collected was
siphoned off at various levels, payrolls of electricity companies often included ghost workers, and
managers would often take loans from banks in lieu of collecting payments from customers in
order to give the illusion of higher collections rates. As a result, the capital stock for supplying
electricity eroded significantly and the sector suffered from a heavy debt overhang.

16.     Improving the environment for private sector development. This pillar recognized that
the development of the private sector was critical to generating rapid economic growth and
creating employment opportunities for the poor in Georgia. Policy measures under this pillar
were directed at reducing constraints to private sector development and improving the investment
climate by simplifying tax legislation, and streamlining the regulatory framework.




                                                  3
17.      At the outset of the PRSO series, it was extremely difficult to start and maintain a
successful business in Georgia, with the country ranking 112th out of 175 countries on the World
Bank's Doing Business publication for 2005. This poor ranking was partly the result of a corrupt
and arbitrary regime for business registration and licensing, cumbersome customs and tax
legislation and inspection procedures, and generally low competence of public officials. An
excessive number of taxes and arbitrary administration of the tax code were serious deterrents to
private sector development, and the informal economy was estimated to account for more than
half of the country's economic activity.

18.      Improving social protection, education, and health care services. This pillar focused on
improving access, accountability, and affordability of services in the social sector and social
protection for the vulnerable. The Government's reform program included: (i) in social protection,
mitigating poverty by improving protection of the poor and vulnerable (through introducing a
fiscally sustainable targeted assistance program); (ii) in education, improving equity of access,
financing and quality of general and higher education, including the systematic use of information
to strengthen accountability, policymaking and management capacity (by implementing a
capitation financing model, systematic testing and monitoring of results, and strengthening
quality-enhancing dimensions including educational materials and curricula); and (iii) in health,
improving quality and access to essential health services especially for the poor and vulnerable
(including adopting a revised basic benefits package).

19.      At the outset of the PRSO series, the social protection system was suffering from a
number of fundamental problems including shortage of funds, corruption, and policy and
institutional deficiencies. The Government was in substantial arrears to pensioners and social
assistance recipients and the whole system was on the verge of collapse. The education sector
was grossly underfunded with wage arrears to teachers, dilapidated physical infrastructure,
outdated curricula, and leakages of funds and widespread corruption. The health sector was
characterized by overcapacity and low utilization of health services, the lowest in the ECA region.
Out of pocket expenditures were high, between 60 and 70 percent of total health expenditures,
which was double and triple the rates in CIS and EU countries, respectively. Given poor service
quality, the government had a strong desire to privatize much of the sector, particularly hospital
services, but also primary health care facilities--so as to become an independent purchaser of
insurance for the poor and the vulnerable rather than to manage service delivery.

20.     Section 3.1 provides an assessment of the relevance of the PDOs, and Section 3.2 reviews
the achievement of the program's key objectives and outcomes.

1.3 Revised Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators

21.     The original Program Development Objectives within the four pillars were maintained
throughout the PRSO series, with only marginal changes in program elements mainly to reflect a
highly successful pace of reform implementation, but also to better reflect the conditions on the
ground:

            In a number of sectors, the envisaged reforms were achieved well ahead of original
            expectations and new targets needed to be established in order to deepen the reform.
            This applies in particular to the electricity sector, public expenditure management,
            functioning of the Chamber of Control, tax and customs, and the education sector.
            The area of civil service reform needed revisions to better reflect developments on
            the ground. Initially, the PRSO series envisioned supporting comprehensive civil


                                                4
            service reform through implementation of a medium-term reform program, as well as
            full implementation of a personnel data base. However, this type of civil service
            reform proved to be too ambitious, with the Government instead undertaking a
            targeted case-by-case restructuring and rightsizing of priority areas of the public
            service. The civil service subcomponent of the PRSO program was therefore
            adjusted in favor of a necessary stocktaking of reforms, progress in developing the
            personnel data base, human resource policies for the Ministry of Finance, and the
            important initial step of being able to budget and deliver full payment of civil service
            personnel salaries.
            Finally, in the health subcomponent of Pillar IV, the emphasis of the reforms shifted
            from hospital sector modernization toward primary health care (PHC) services.

1.4 Original Design and Revisions

22.      The PRSO series was initially designed as a series of three operations to support the
Government's medium-term reform program. The design was implemented as planned and at the
time of PRSO III, its timetable was accelerated and a fourth operation was added. This was done
to maintain the direction of reforms (in the context of more rapid than expected pace of
implementation in some key policy areas) and also to help mitigate the impact of external shocks.
The external shocks included especially sharp energy price increases, with the price of imported
gas rising from $65 in 2005 to $110 in 2006 and further to $235 per 1000 c/m in 2007.

23.     The other significant change to the PRSO program was the addition at the end of the
PRSO series of a Supplemental Credit for US$40.0 million, which was launched to sustain
implementation of the PRSO program in the face of unanticipated budgetary pressures associated
with the August 2008 conflict. The conflict resulted in a sharp downturn in economic activity,
destruction of property, and large numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The economic
downturn generated unanticipated budgetary pressures, with the decline of tax and non-tax
revenues and the increased need for social safety net and other post-conflict expenditures. The
impact of the economic downturn on unemployment and poverty was aggravated by 130,000 new
IDPs at the peak of the crisis, of which approximately 30,000 were expected to need long term
resettlement. These numbers are in addition to the 220,000 IDPs from the conflicts in the 1990s
following Georgia's independence. The Government of Georgia responded quickly to the crisis
by taking decisive first steps to address the needs of IDPs and restore civilian infrastructure. It
also moved swiftly to implement a countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate the economic
downturn, provided liquidity and regulatory support to the banking sector, and worked closely
with the international community to secure donor support.

2 Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
24.      Georgia implemented deep economic, social, and governance reforms over the period of
the PRSO series. The reform directions included impressive progress in reforming the role of the
state vis-à-vis the private sector, dramatically reducing crime and corruption, and strengthening
the business environment. Other achievements included far-reaching reforms in both the quality
and efficiency of social protection, education, health care services. Many of these reforms were
supported directly by the PRSO series, as described below.

2.1 Program Performance

25.      Macroeconomic framework. Over the PRSO period, Georgia restored and maintained a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The economy achieved and sustained a higher growth
rate during this period, fueled by strong inflows of foreign direct investment and led in part by
construction and the services sectors. Macroeconomic stability was supported by a low even if
rising fiscal deficit that was financed in a non-inflationary manner. Core inflation remained in the
single digits. The external current account deficit widened mainly due to the large FDI and other
capital inflows, which also led to an appreciation of the currency, as the authorities pursued a
flexible exchange rate policy. Effective debt management and strong growth ensured a
considerable decline in the public external debt to GDP ratio during this period.

26.     The overall impact of the reform program on poverty incidence is difficult to assess
because data limitations prevent reliable tracking of the poverty rate over time. However,
important non-income dimensions of poverty improved, including for instance a significant
increase in access of the poor to electricity, natural gas, safe water, basic health care, and
education. While living standards have improved across the board, the agenda of improving
poverty monitoring in a systematic way still remains.

27.     Policy Reforms. Impressive progress was achieved across the structural reform agenda
supported by the PRSO series in the following areas:

            Public sector efficiency, accountability, and transparency were significantly
            strengthened through the establishment of a systematic budgetary process, the
            preparation of an MTEF covering all spending units, the establishment of a Treasury
            Single Account.
            Service and financial viability of the electricity and gas sectors were improved
            dramatically, with electricity service increasing from 7 hours/day to 24/7 service for
            all paying customers and collection rates rising from 35 percent to over 90 percent.
            The environment for private sector development improved considerably, with
            Georgia's Doing Business ranking vaulting from 112th place in 2005 to 18th in 2007.
            Social protection, education, and health care services improved significantly with the
            introduction of the targeted social assistance program, through transparent national
            entrance examinations and regular participation in international assessments, and
            through the adoption of a revised basic benefits package of health care.

28.      The implementation of individual operations of the PRSO series proceeded according to
plan with only a six-month extension of the closing date for PRSO I. Implementation of the
reform triggers of the PRSO series (see Table 1) was achieved according to or ahead of plan
during the program. As will be elaborated in Section 3, several areas of the program
(e.g., reviving the electricity sector and enhancing tax revenues) over-performed and the targets
were revised upward. For instance, in view of the faster pace of reform in reopening and
resuming the audit function of the Chamber of Control (CoC) under PRSO I, a trigger was added
at the time of PRSO II to submit and enact a Draft Law on the CoC, elevating its mandate to a
supreme audit institution. The timeframe for enacting the Draft Law was later extended to allow
more time for Parliamentary consideration and for further improvements to the Draft Law, which
was enacted before the closing date of PRSO IV.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

29.      A number of factors contributed to success and pace in implementation of the policy and
institutional reforms supported by the PRSO program, including:

                Government's clear reform vision and ownership. One of the most important
                factors affecting implementation was the Government's clear vision of its reform
                strategy. This vision was well captured by the PRSO series, thus contributing
                significantly to enhancing government ownership of the reform actions supported by
                the PRSOs. Both reform vision and ownership of the reform program transcended
                individuals and remained intact even through changes in the Prime Minister and other
                key Ministers.
                Government's focus on delivering results on the ground. In addition to its reform
                vision and ownership, the authorities showed great enthusiasm for reform
                implementation and were sharply focused on achieving well-defined results and
                outcomes on the ground. They were well aware of the short window of opportunity
                created by the change in political regime and prioritized actions that improved living
                conditions (e.g., restoring energy supply and basic social protection). The set of
                indicators used by the PRSO series to monitor achievement of outcomes was well
                aligned with the Government's own results framework.
                Government's strong mandate. Another important factor affecting implementation
                was that the Government received a strong mandate to implement its reform vision.
                The President was elected with 97 percent of the popular vote in his first election in
                January 2004 and Parliamentary elections in March 2004 resulted in an
                overwhelming majority for the new ruling coalition. This strong mandate allowed

            a fast schedule.
            Favorable global environment during the PRSO period.                     The external
            environment was highly favorable through mid-2008, which facilitated significant
            foreign direct investment and other private capital inflows, following a series of bold
            and successful reforms to improve the business environment. The resulting favorable
            impact on growth and incomes in Georgia as PRSO was being implemented helped to
            improve public perceptions of the reform program. At the same time, the external
            environment deteriorating sharply following the August 2008 conflict and the global
            economic downturn. As previously discussed, the authorities responded swiftly and
            decisively to mitigating the impact of the crisis and the Bank and other development
            partners provided strong support to help sustain implementation of the reform
            program in the face of the shocks. There has been no backtracking on reforms
            supported by the PRSO series during the crisis and the authorities have made
            extraordinary efforts to safeguard and improve budgetary allocations in 2009.
            Strong Donor coordination. Effective coordination among donors, including the
            EC, USAID, the Netherlands Government, DFID, SIDA, IMF, and the World Bank,
            among others, was important to successful implementation of the Government's
            reform program. The Netherlands Government provided co-financing for the PRSO
            program. The donor community worked well together and coordinated effectively,
            including through the provision of various lines of technical assistance to build the
            Government's capacity for implementation in key reform areas supported by the
            PRSO series.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     The Government took the lead on the design, implementation and utilization of M&E. A
detailed set of monitorable outcome indicators was established at the beginning of the series and
updated for each operation. This results framework not only specified end-program targets for
the indicators, but also intermediate target values for each operation. This helped track the pace
of achievement of results along the course of the programmatic series. At the same time,
although the design of the M&E system was not perfect (e.g., a robust poverty monitoring system
was not put in place), it was consistent with the capacity of the country at that time.

31.      The Government pursued a results focus in the PRSO series and as a follow up is
currently moving toward a results-based budget. The M&E conducted during the PRSO series
fed back into program management in a number of key areas: (i) raising targets in the areas of
tax reform and electricity supply; (ii) determining the size of the cash benefit, as well as the target
population for the successful Targeted Social Assistance component; (iii) scaling back of
expectations (and scope) for the procurement and civil service components; and (iv) raising
expectations at the time of PRSO-II that the Chamber of Control (CoC) could be elevated to the
status of Supreme Audit Institution (which was ultimately achieved shortly before the closing of
PRSO-IV).

32.      Each pillar had several key performance indicators. Some indicators, particularly in
Pillar I, were based on the completion of a process or the submission of a draft law. Other
indicators were more quantitative in nature. Overall, the indicators were broadly appropriate for
the purpose of measuring progress in the achievement of outcomes and development objectives.
At the same time, data limitations in the quality of the national household budget surveys (HBS)
prevented reliable tracking of the poverty rate over time, so that the PRSO program was not able

                                                  12
to utilize meaningful, specific poverty targets. A Living Standards Measurement Survey
conducted by the Bank in 2007 and the subsequent Poverty Assessment (2009) provides detailed
indicators of the incidence of poverty at one point in time (see Section 3.2), but improvements to
the national HBS are important for the tracking of poverty trends going forward.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

33.       Given the strong record of the PRSO program and the impact of the global economic
crisis, the Government of Georgia requested and the Bank has agreed to move forward with a
follow-up series of three Development Policy Operations (DPOs). The objective of the DPO
program is to support the Government's policy reform program to: (i) mitigate the impact of the
economic downturn in the short-term; and (ii) facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-
crisis growth in the medium term under a more difficult external environment. The First DPO
was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors in July 2009 and the Second DPO is
planned for July 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.      The reform program supported by the PRSO series was highly relevant to the
development challenges facing Georgia during this period. At the outset, the new administration
faced enormous development challenges, given widespread corruption, the lack of basic elements
of public financial management, and disarray in the delivery of basic services, such as electricity,
health, education, and social protection. The primary objective of the PRSO series at the outset
was to support select reforms necessary to significantly improve the functioning of the Georgian
state, to generate tangible results, and to mitigate the risks of derailment of the new reform
process. As the PRSO series unfolded, it became clear that the program would be different from
many development policy operations at the Bank; the enthusiasm and rapid pace with which the
Government proactively implemented the reform program was exceptional. Rather than having
to nudge decision-makers toward difficult reforms that consume political capital, the Bank played
a supportive role of advising on ways to enhance or deepen reform actions to accomplish the
specific goals that the Government had already decided it wanted to achieve on an accelerated
schedule.

35.     This design of the PRSO series in each of the four reform pillars was also appropriate in
addressing the specific challenges facing Georgia in the respective policy areas. The standard
requirement of maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic framework was based on indicators
agreed with the IMF and was directed at generating sustained and robust economic growth with
low inflation and with sustainable fiscal deficits and debt levels.

             Pillar I: Public Sector Accountability, Efficiency and Transparency

36.     The Government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) of
July 2003 (and its Progress Report in 2005) identified a number of weaknesses in Georgia's
public sector management, which benefited from key findings of the Bank's ESW, including the
CPA, PER, CPAR and CFAA completed during the 2002-04 period. These weaknesses included
the lack of multi-year budgeting, a dysfunctional Chamber of Control (CoC), lack of monitoring
of Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPLs), significant problems with extra-budgetary revenues and


                                                13
expenditures, and major deviations between planned and actual budgets. Pillar I was designed to
address these weaknesses.

            In the area of budgeting and public expenditure management, the establishment of a
            Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) integrated into the budgetary
            process was seen as critical for improving the efficiency of allocation of budgetary
            resources in the achievement of the Government's key objectives. The PRSO
            program supported the authorities in establishing the MTEF, with technical assistance
            provided by DFID and the World Bank's PEMPAL program.
            In the area of procurement, transparency was limited and information on tenders was
            not widely available. The first two PRSOs, therefore, supported the publication of
            procurement procedures and performance indicators on the website of the State
            Procurement Agency (SPA). In addition, the program supported amendments to the
            Public Procurement Law to conform to international practices.
            In the area of public financial management, in order to consolidate the
            Government's fiscal accounts and to eliminate opportunities for petty corruption
            from numerous extra-budgetary accounts, the PRSO program supported the
            establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). Furthermore, in order to address
            the lack of monitoring and reporting of LEPLs (quasi public entities receiving
            substantial transfers from the state), the program supported development of reporting
            guidelines for LEPLs. Finally, prior to the PRSO series, the CoC had developed such
            a poor reputation that its operations were actually suspended for a period of time after
            the Rose Revolution. The program, therefore, supported reopening of the CoC and
            subsequently, a legal framework to elevate its role to a supreme audit institution.
            In the area of intergovernmental fiscal relations, in order to address the issues of a
            fragmented administrative structure, unclear functional responsibilities between
            different tiers of government, and weak monitoring of fiscal conditions, the program
            supported the Law on Local Self Government and the implementation of budgetary
            rules for third-tier self-governing units.
            In the area of public administration, the program initially supported a comprehensive
            reform of the civil service, but, as discussed in the previous section, this sub-
            component was scaled back to establishing a strategic vision for civil service reform
            and a consultative process to implement the vision.
            In the area of public sector transparency, in order to address the widespread
            corruption leading up to the Rose Revolution, the new Government sought Bank
            support to adopt a National Anti-corruption Strategy, which was to be monitored by
            surveys of public officials and users of public services. The PRSO program
            complemented this by supporting a periodic implementation report for the anti-
            corruption strategy.

                   Pillar II: Improving Electricity and Gas Sector Services

37.      In order to remedy the very poor level of energy services at the outset of the PRSO series,
with the country receiving only seven hours of electricity per day nationwide, the authorities
developed a clear vision of reform. With generation, transmission and distribution services
already previously unbundled, the central thrust of the reform vision was privatization of
electricity services. The PRSO program complemented the Government's reform vision by
supporting an Energy Sector Medium-Term Strategic Action Plan, which included legislative and

                                                14
regulatory measures, extensive metering of the gas and electricity distribution systems, improved
collection rates, financial viability of sector entities and monitoring financial flows from the state,
and service targets. The PRSO series also supported submission of a Debt Management Law for
the electricity sector to Parliament, in order to deal with the sector's large debt overhang. Finally,
the program supported a system for monitoring power service to consumers. These policy
reforms supported by the program were complemented by an investment operation of the Bank in
the energy sector, the Electricity Management Support Project (EMSP, approved in 2002). The
Bank also operated in coordination with other donors, who covered generation (EU) and
distribution (USAID), while the Bank covered transmission.

           Pillar III: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development

38.      Through this reform pillar, the PRSO program supported reforms to ease the most
significant constraints to business activity and private sector development. The tax legislation
was simplified to reduce the tax burden on firms and individuals and the inspections process and
licensing requirements were streamlined to reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector. In
addition, a new Customs Code was developed and enacted with the aim of easing impediments to
trading across borders. Both the tax reform and the reform to the customs code improved revenue
collection while simplifying and improving administrative procedures. Finally, progress was
made in developing a standardization system in line with the WTO requirements.

        Pillar IV: Improving Social Protection, Education and Health Care Services

39.     Given the absence of a functioning social safety net at the outset of the PRSO program, a
top priority of Government was to implement Targeted Social Assistance, particularly aimed at
the extremely poor. In addition, it was critical to pay pension arrears and re-establish on-time
payment of pensions. These core initiatives were supported by the PRSO program in the area of
social protection. In education, the PRSO program focused on addressing corruption in
nationwide entrance examinations, revising the capitation formulas for school financing, and
improving monitoring of school performance through performance in international assessments.
In health, the main goals of the PRSO series were to support the Government's priorities in
increasing access of the population to the BBP and improving quality of primary health care.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(Overall achievement of objectives)

Rating: Satisfactory

40.     Overall, the achievement of objectives of the PRSO program was satisfactory. In
maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic framework and in achieving the objectives of each of
the four reform pillars, Georgia made substantial and satisfactory progress. As detailed in Table
3 and in the discussion below, most of the specific PRSO objectives and expected outcomes were
met or surpassed and done so at a rapid pace.

Macroeconomic Framework
41.     The basic requirement to maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework was
met in most areas and exceeded in others (Satisfactory). Georgia experienced rapid economic
growth during the PRSO period, with growth averaging 10.5 percent during 2005-2007. This
rapid growth was driven in part by strong inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which
reached $1.7 billion (16.4 percent of GDP) in 2007, as a result of significant improvements to the

                                                  15
overall business environment (Pillar III) in Georgia. GDP growth surpassed the target of at least
5 percent during every year other than 2008 when the August conflict and the global crisis
resulted in a sharp downturn; nevertheless growth averaged more than 8 percent during the 2005-
2008 period. Although inflation increased during the course of the PRSO period, fueled by large
capital inflows and rising food and energy prices, the authorities succeeded in meeting the target
of core inflation within single digits.

42.     On the fiscal front, the Government was successful in increasing tax revenues from 14.6
percent of GDP in 2003 to 25.8 percent in 2007 as a result of measures to significantly reduce
corruption and simplify the tax regime; this important accomplishment enabled the Government
to significantly increase social and infrastructure investment expenditures. At the same time,
although the overall fiscal deficit widened from 1.8% of GDP in 2005 to 4.7% of GDP in 2007
(and further in 2008 due in part to the August conflict and global economic crisis), it was more
than fully financed by increased privatization proceeds through 2007. The authorities thus met
the target of maintaining a fiscal deficit consistent with macroeconomic stability. As a result of
effective macroeconomic and debt management, the external public debt burden that had plagued
Georgia in years past declined from 45 percent of GDP in 2003 to 17.5 percent in 2007.

43.     On the external front, the current account deficit widened as a share of GDP from 6.9
percent in 2004 to 19.7 percent in 2007 (and further in 2008) mainly due to large FDI and other
private capital inflows. Overall, the level of international reserves increased significantly from
1.8 months of imports in 2004 to 2.8 months in 2007. The large capital inflows led to significant
real exchange appreciation which to some extent inhibited the growth of exports. Georgia's
macroeconomic framework was supported throughout the PRSO period by an IMF program.

44.      The August 2008 conflict led to number of shocks to the key pillars of economic growth
and macroeconomic stability in Georgia. These included a weakening of investor and consumer
confidence, some infrastructure damage, large numbers of new IDPs, increased demand for
liquidity in the banking system, and stress on public finances. This led of a sharp downturn in
FDI inflows and economic growth and a widening of the fiscal deficit in 2008. The authorities
responded swiftly in the aftermath of the conflict to provide liquidity and regulatory support to
the banking sector, implement a countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate the downturn, and
work with the donor community to secure substantial support. The Government response has
received strong support from multilateral financial institutions, with the IMF approving a $750
million Standby Arrangement (SBA) in September 2008.




                                                  16
Overall Living Standards and Poverty Reduction
45.       Living standards, particularly of the poor, have improved along a number of dimensions
during the PRSO period. Important non-income dimensions of welfare improved for the poor,
including significantly improved access to electricity, natural gas, safe water, health, and higher
education. Specifically, between 2003 and 2006, the share of poor households with access to a 24
hour supply of electricity increased from 19 percent to 66 percent and the share of poor
households with access to natural gas supply increased from 12 percent to 26 percent. Estimates
based on a Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) indicate that the incidence of poverty
in Georgia in 2007 was 23.6 percent, while the incidence of extreme poverty was 9.3 percent.
The measurement of poverty trends during 2004-07 is complicated by questions about the
reliability of the annual national Household Budget Surveys (HBS). The figures tracking
monetary incomes of the poor are more reliable and showed that the poor experienced an increase
in their monetary purchasing power during the PRSO period. Finally, during the PRSO period,
Georgia put in place an effective social safety net which, according to simulations based on the
LSMS, has a very significant impact in mitigating the incidence of poverty.

46.     One of the factors contributing to poverty developments during the PRSO period was that
the deep productivity-enhancing process of economic restructuring was associated with labor
shedding, which affected employment. Nevertheless, the official unemployment rate held steady
at around 13 percent during the 2004-2007 period. Furthermore, the economic downturn
following the August 2008 conflict and the global economic crisis is estimated to have increased
unemployment and the incidence of poverty. The new DPO series is directed at mitigating the
impact of the economic downturn and addressing remaining structural challenges to prepare
Georgia for growth and poverty reduction going forward.

      Pillar I ­ Strengthen Public Sector Accountability, Efficiency, and Transparency

47.     Overall, the achievement of the PDO to strengthen public sector accountability,
efficiency, and transparency is rated as Satisfactory. Significant improvements were achieved
in the areas of budgeting, public financial management, intergovernmental fiscal relations and
anti-corruption, while improvements in the areas of procurement and civil service reform were
below expectations.

Strengthening public budgeting and expenditure management-Satisfactory
48.     Overall, the reforms supported by the PRSO series significantly strengthened Georgia's
public budgeting and expenditure management. By the completion of the first PRSO, the
Government had progressed from single-year budgeting to a multi-year budget framework. Over
the course of the PRSOs, all ministries had been incorporated into the MTEF, called the Basic
Data and Directions (BDD) document. As evidence of the success of MTEF adoption, the
documentation by spending agencies has been progressively more linked to policy during 2006-
08. The spending agencies are much more disciplined in their budget activities and are providing
standard financial reports in compliance with deadlines. While there are still substantial
deviations between planned and actual budgets, this has often happened during years with large
external shocks. The year 2008 witnessed large budget amendments in large part because of the
August 2008 conflict. The practice of monitoring and reporting these deviations has itself been
an achievement of the program. A periodic budget execution report is now produced and
discussed with parliament. The Government has not yet instituted performance-based budgeting,
but intends to move in this direction.



                                                17
Procurement-Moderately Unsatisfactory
49.      Despite the achievements of some of the targets in this subcomponent, reform
performance in this area has been somewhat below expectations, but nonetheless noteworthy in
light of international experience and the initial conditions in Georgia. Important progress was
made in the area of improving transparency though publication of information on tender
announcements and contract awards on the State Procurement Agency (SPA) website. The
nominal targets for tenders announced of 1,981 for September 2006 and 2,905 for September
2007 were met. Previously, the number of announced tenders was minimal. Also, the Law on
State Procurement and annual reports for last three years are available on the SPA website.
Furthermore, the SPA received supervisory authority in January 2006 under the new Procurement
Law, which improved national rules for procurement. However, accomplishments in other areas
fell short of expectations. In particular, at the outset of the PRSO program, it was envisioned that
the SPA would develop and implement a set of procurement improvement measures as part of a
comprehensive country procurement assessment during PRSO III. This trigger was subsequently
updated to a benchmark for PRSO IV to allow more time to reach agreement on the CPAR
recommendations. At the time of appraisal of PRSO IV, the CPAR was discussed with the SPA
but did not result in agreement on a set of procurement improvement measures. Factors
constraining the implementation of reforms in this area included the lack of a clear reform
champion and the need to build capacity within the SPA to oversee and regulate the procurement
process in Georgia. However, in October 2009, a new Chairman of the SPA was appointed by
the Government and a set of improvement measures is being finalized for submission to
Parliament, including amendments to the Law on State Procurement reflecting e-procurement
aspects.

Public Financial Management-Satisfactory
50.      Treasury and Accounting Reform. The establishment of the Treasury Single Account
(TSA) proved to be a complex but highly important and significant reform. Although many
constituencies benefited from the previous status quo, which provided a breeding ground for
corruption, the TSA was successfully established, which eliminated numerous off-budget
accounts and much of the associated pervasive petty corruption. The Government is now
providing annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with internationally accepted
accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the PRSO program supported implementation of
the GFS-2001 budget classification, with all ministries required to implement the new accounting
methodology. The new electronic Treasury Information System was established and is producing
reports on expenditures according to functional classifications. Data now goes automatically to
the Treasury so that payments can also go out automatically, thus increasing efficiency because
officials no longer have to queue up to receive payments/reimbursements. As part of the reform,
guidelines on financial and performance reporting of LEPLs were defined and implemented by
government agencies. The benefits of these reforms include improved accountability and more
efficient budgeting processes, with the Treasury receiving better financial information and the
ministries receiving the appropriate data needed to monitor LEPLs.

51.      External Audit-Chamber of Control. Under PRSO I, the CoC was re-opened to
resume its basic audit function, although the work of the CoC initially resembled more revisions
to financial statements rather than actual external audit. The CoC benefited from technical
assistance from the Bank's Public Sector Financial Management Reform Project (PSFMRP-
FY06), as well as from other donors (TACIS, GTZ and DFID), that worked in coordination with
the PRSO to build capacity at the CoC and put it on the path to become a Supreme Audit
institution of international standard. The CoC published completed audit results on its website by
2005.

                                                18
52.      Given the reopening and resumption of work of the CoC, the program decided to support
the development of a Law on the CoC elevating its mandate to a supreme audit institution in line
with international standards. A first version of the Draft Law required improvement and the Bank
helped the Government work with the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI) to improve the law. By PRSO II, a revised Draft Law was submitted to the
Parliament. Enactment of the Law was initially shifted from PRSO-III to PRSO-IV and the Law
was finally enacted in January 29, 2009, prior to closing of PRSO-IV. The program also
supported a reorganization of the CoC (PRSO 3) and new guidelines and a strategy for the
institution (PRSO 4) to improve scope, quality and timeliness of audits.

53.     One of the reasons why development of a Law on the CoC proved difficult, compared
with other PFM areas, was that the CoC is in the political realm of the Parliament, with its more
varied constituencies and more complex decision-making process. Other areas of PFM reform
moved more expeditiously because they are under the purview of the reform-minded government.
Another reason for slow implementation was the prevailing perception that the CoC audits were a
prosecutorial tool rather than one that offered opinions to improve accounting practices. The
PSFMRP funded a study tour of CoCs in other countries to address this perception and the Bank
also urged more independence in appointment of the Board of Directors of the CoC, and proposed
models followed by Baltic States and western European countries. Overall, while the pace of
CoC reform was initially accelerated, it subsequently lagged the scaled up expectations, but has
nevertheless moved in the right direction and will require further support to improve capacity.

Strengthening Local Govt and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations-Highly Satisfactory
54.     The Organic Law on Local Self-Government (December 2005) consolidated the third tier
self-governing authorities into their respective second-tier rayons. An action plan was established
with the support of PRSO-II and by the end of 2006 both the Law and implementation on the
ground had taken place. One major result was that the number of local governments was reduced
from 1,105 to 65 (including five rayons in Ajaria). This consolidation reduced fragmentation of
the administrative structure, enhanced clarity of functional responsibilities, and improved
supervision and monitoring of fiscal conditions. The strong mandate for reform received by the
Government made it possible to carry out in months what often takes years in other countries.

55.      Another major change was the consolidation of education and health services, which had
been the responsibility of rayons and third tier governments prior to 2006. This allowed better
matching of expenditures with enrollment levels and the institution of teacher standards
nationwide. Under the new system, the central government funds individual schools on the basis
of enrollment, with funding provided as a block grant. In the provision of health services, the
consolidation facilitated a shift of resources to primary health care (PHC), with private physicians
registering to receive resources to cover the number of patients served. Local governments
retained exclusive responsibility for infrastructure services, including heating, roads, trash
collection.

56.      The system of revenue assignment also changed dramatically. The negotiated shares
arrangement was replaced by a system where receipts from centrally-administered personal
income and property taxes are distributed to sub-national governments. Since this allocation is
distributed according to origin, disparities arise, with cities such as Tbilisi receiving a large share
of the total national personal income tax receipts. This situation is remedied through an
"equalization transfer." This model is similar to the one followed by most EU-8 accession
countries and is consistent with the Bank's general advice on decentralization. The particular
design of the equalization transfer is, however, complex with substantial data requirements.


                                                  19
Public Sector Administration-Moderately Unsatisfactory
57.      The PRSO series initially intended to support a comprehensive medium-term civil service
reform. However, this turned out to be not consistent with the Government's approach to reform
in the sector (which involved undertaking a targeted case-by-case restructuring and rightsizing of
priority areas of the public service) and was, therefore, appropriately dropped from the PRSO
program. As a result, the civil service reform portion of the program was scaled back to: (i) a
stocktaking of reforms; (ii) achieving progress in developing the personnel data base; (iii)
developing human resource policies for the Ministry of Finance; and (iv) a commitment to
budgeting full payment of civil service personnel salaries. By the end of the program, the core
reform triggers in this component were to develop a strategic vision for civil service reform
(PRSO 2) and to produce a stocktaking note on civil service reforms (PRSO IV), which were both
completed.

Public Sector Transparency and Accountability-Satisfactory
58.      Under the PRSO a National anti-corruption strategy was developed and adopted, and the
first two annual action plans were implemented by 2006. The findings of the GRECO report, a
joint initiative of donors and the Government to commit to improvements in anti-corruption, were
integrated into the anti-corruption action plan. The Government's approach to anti-corruption did
not involve a special institution to implement; rather, the Office of State Minister on Reform
Coordination (OSMRC) was responsible for leading the reform effort. The Government's
approach relied on inputs from the ministries which emphasized ways to prevent, as opposed to
punish, corruption. The achievements in the area of anti-corruption cut across the different pillars
of the program and included the reorganization and re-staffing of traffic police, streamlining the
customs and licensing regimes (pillar III), introducing impartial university entrance exams
(Pillar IV), and combining tax, customs and financial police under a single Revenue Services
Department in the Ministry of Finance (Pillar III). In January 2009, an Anti-Corruption
Interagency Council was established, which is chaired by the Minister of Justice.

59.     The BEEPS Surveys show a significant reduction in the percentage of firms citing
corruption as a problem in doing business in Georgia--from 66.1 percent in the 2002 survey to
38.7 percent in 2005 and further to 31 percent in 2008. Transparency International's corruption
perceptions index (CPI) ranking for Georgia also improved substantially from 127 out of 133
countries in 2003 to 67 out of 180 countries in 2008. This achievement was also important to the
gains under Pillar III-Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development. It should be
noted that many of the improvements in public sector transparency and accountability were
achieved in the area of public financial management, as well as in Pillar III with the
improvements in the tax regime.

                    Pillar II ­ Improving electricity and gas sector services

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve electricity and gas sector services is rated
as Highly Satisfactory, with program targets exceeded.

60.     The PRSO program supported the Energy Sector Medium-Term Strategic Action Plan
(ESMSAP), under which key targets were to improve electricity service and collection rates. The
reforms supported by the program also targeted reducing the large debt overhang of the electricity
sector and improving financial viability of sector entities.

61.     The Government's reform efforts in the sector tackled pervasive weaknesses and
corruption in the collection system. As a result, collection rates improved dramatically, from 35

                                                20
percent at the beginning of PRSO-I to over 90 percent by the time of PRSO-IV. The target
collection rate of 65 percent was substantially exceeded. To ensure that money collected actually
reached the sector, a system of payments at post offices or other authorized collection points was
instituted. In addition, metering was improved for both electricity and gas distribution, with
communal meters proving effective due to peer monitoring. In response to external shocks, the
gas tariff was raised by 30 percent in January 2006 and the electric tariff was raised by 60 percent
in June 2006. Despite these substantial increases, collections held at around 90 percent.

62.      One of the most successful strategic measures of the electricity sector reform was putting
in place the management contracts to run distribution, transmission and generation. The Bank
funded the managing consultants for the transmission network, while USAID did the same for
distribution and the EU for generation. These contracts, particularly for distribution, turned out to
be effective in restoring the provision of electrical services. The management contract funded by
the Bank was part of the Bank's EMSP. Effective measures taken under the management
contracts included an overhaul of management, reduction of staff/payroll, improved enforcement
of the electricity collection system, and replacing corrupt collectors with collection points.

63.       In addition, the Government allocated significant budgetary resources during 2004-06 for
needed rehabilitation of the power system, particularly hydropower facilities, which generate
about three-quarters of all electrical power in Georgia. Another key element of the Government's
program in the sector was the transfer of assets from transmission to distribution and the
privatization of assets in the sector. Today, all distribution has been privatized and all
hydropower generation is private other than the Abkhazia facility. Transmission remains
publicly-owned. Privatization was encouraged by reducing the debt overhang of the sector
entities.

64.      The turnaround in the sector occurred with striking speed. Within three years, the
average electricity provision went from seven hours per day and frequent blackouts, to 24 hours
per day of reliable service. The target of 24/7 electricity service for all paying customers was
achieved ahead of the end of the PRSO series, which was the expected date for achievement of
the target. In addition to reliable service, there are indications that the efficiency of utilization of
electricity has also improved.

                              Pillar III - Private Sector Development

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve the environment for private sector
development is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

65.     One of the most important achievements of this reform pillar was tax reform in which the
number of tax rates was reduced from 22 to 7. In addition to improving the environment for
private sector development, the improved tax regime and better compliance led to an increase in
tax revenues from only 14.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 22.8 percent in 2006 and 25.8 percent in
2007. These additional resources enabled a significant increase in social and infrastructure
investment expenditures, which in turn contributed to strong growth performance of the private
sector.

66.     Georgia achieved major improvement in other aspects of its business climate. Between
2005 and 2008, Georgia dramatically improved its Doing Business ranking, from 112th out of 175
countries to 18th out of 178 countries, which substantially exceeded the targeted 50 percent
improvement in the ranking. As a result, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows increased from
8.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 16.4 percent in 2007. The target of increasing the private sector

                                                  21
share of GDP was met, with the private sector share increasing from 65 percent in 2004 to 75
percent by 2006.

67.     These improvements can in part be attributed to specific measures to streamline the
process of starting a business. The process, which used to take 25 days on average in 2004 was
reduced to only 11 days on average by 2007, with the cost of starting a business falling from 23
percent of Georgia's per capita income to only 9.5 percent over the same time period. The
licensing and permits regime was also substantially streamlined. Anti-corruption and tax reforms
have also helped improve the business environment. The target of increasing the share of exports
to EU countries of 23 percent from a baseline of 20 percent was exceeded (share was 26 percent
in 2006), which is evidence of the increasing competitiveness of the Georgian economy.

        Pillar IV ­ Improving Social Protection, Education and Health Care Services

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve social protection, education and health
care services is rated as Satisfactory.

68.      The cross-cutting themes in the direction of reform across the three subcomponents of
this reform pillar are improvements in access to services, particularly for the poor, improvements
in the quality of services, and improvements in the effectiveness of resource use. All three
subcomponents experienced profound changes in the way resources are allocated and managed
and in the way business is done in Georgia.

Social Protection-Highly Satisfactory
69.     One of the greatest successes of the PRSO series is its support for introduction of
Targeted Social Assistance (TSA), which is very effectively targeted to the poor, has a significant
poverty-mitigating impact, and provides the extreme poor with a vital safety net. Following
introduction, the TSA program was rapidly expanded from a baseline of zero to reach a large
number of poor households in Georgia over the period of the PRSO series. The original target
was for 90,000 households to receive the TSA benefit by the end of 2006. This target was
surpassed--by September 2007, 118,627 households (about 12 percent of Georgian households)
received the TSA benefit in the average amount of 42.6 GEL per month.

70.      An LSMS survey conducted by the Bank at the end of 2007 showed that the TSA
program is well targeted compared to other such programs across the world--some 70 percent of
TSA beneficiaries were estimated to be pre-TSA poor, indicating a reasonable error of inclusion
of only 30 percent. The survey also showed that the TSA program has a significant impact on
mitigating poverty. The estimates indicate that without TSA, the overall poverty rate, poverty
gap and poverty severity would increase respectively by 6, 18 and 39 percent. The impact is even
more pronounced in the case of extreme poverty: the extreme poverty rate would increase by 17
percent, the extreme poverty gap by 50 percent and the severity of poverty index would double,
indicating that TSA significantly reduces inequality among the extreme poor.

71.     The key to successful Targeted Social Assistance was the establishment of the Household
Registry (under the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs) which provided Georgia with
the capacity to develop an effective proxy means targeting mechanism for use in various targeted
government assistance programs, including TSA, basic health care, electricity vouchers, and other
forms of targeted social assistance.




                                                22
Education Sector-Satisfactory
72.      In education, the PRSO program focused on improving education finance, improving
access by addressing corruption in nationwide entrance examinations, and improving monitoring
of quality through performance in international assessments. These reforms were complemented
by IDA's investment lending operation in education, the Education APL-I and APL-II.
Furthermore, complementary technical assistance was provided by other development partners.
The reform program in the sector included measures to modernize the sectoral management
infrastructure, through which 600 schools were consolidated in 2005 and 150 more in 2006,
which surpassed the target of 50 originally envisioned by the PRSO program. Schools gained
greater control of resource management through the adoption of new laws and regulations and the
institution of capitation grants. In addition, accreditation mechanisms were designed and quality
control and financial accountability instruments were implemented. APL I and II helped lay the
groundwork for the PRSO series by establishing a model for school financing under capitation
grants and an updating of school curricula.

73.      The PRSO program supported successful implementation of reforms to improve
monitoring of quality and access to education. Participation in the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress for International Reading Literacy Study
(PIRLS) assessments represented a major improvement in raising education assessments to
international levels. With respect to improving the higher education entrance process, satisfaction
surveys suggest that over 80 percent of applicants believed that the new nationwide university
entrance examinations made the admissions process fair and free from corruption.

Health Sector-Moderately Satisfactory

74.      In health, the main goals of the PRSO series were to support the Government's priorities
in improving access and quality of health care services for the population, in specifically
improving access for the poor, and in improving quality of primary health care (PHC). In
addition, the program supported the Government's efforts in implementing a broader health
sector modernization strategy. The Government's strategy emphasized promoting primary health
care, and midway through the PRSO program, privatizing health care services to the extent
possible (both in purchasing and providing health care services) in the context of the
Government's overall aim to improve service quality, limit the role of the public sector,
restructure hospitals, and build clinics in remote areas.

75.     One of the main components through which the PRSO program supported improved
access to health care services was the Basic Benefits Package (BBP), which provided universal
access for the entire population mainly to a limited set of health care services, and the
Supplemental Benefits Package (SBP) targeted to the poor, which provided a more
comprehensive set of health care services for the poor. The SBP, later also called the Medical
Assistance Program (MAP), was launched in June 2006 at the national level. By 2007, coverage
of the MAP had expanded to about 650,000 people, thus meeting the program target of covering
approximately 50 percent of the poor.

76.      The Government's emphasis on promoting PHC services by rolling out PHC reform
implementation initially in four regions and subsequently in two additional regions resulted in
rehabilitation of a significant number of primary health clinics and training of significant numbers
of family physicians and nurses in these regions. The PRSO program's support of the
Government's PHC reform was complemented by a Bank investment project for Primary Health
Care, which provided financing and technical assistance for renovation of primary health centers.
The EU also provided financing for this purpose.

                                                23
77.      The improvements in health financing and the emphasis on PHC and quality
improvements resulted in significant increase in utilization rates, from 0.8 PHC visits per person
per year in 2004 to 1.85 per person per year in 2006, according to administrative data. According
to the national HBS, consumption of health care by the poorest two quintiles increased from 3.5
percent of consumption expenditures in 2004 to 5.7 percent in 2006. At the same time,
significant challenges remained in providing access to health care for the population at the end of
the PRSO program. Specifically, with a low level of public expenditure on health, Georgia had
one of the highest shares of total health expenditure funded through out-of-pocket payments in
the ECA region. In the area of health financing, the government's policy vision is to continue to
provide public financing for health insurance for the poor and to provide some public co-
financing for insurance for the non-poor in an effort to stimulate development of the private
health insurance market. In the area of provision, the Government's policy vision is to privatize
ownership of the PHC clinics, while the government continues to support the PHC services in
rural areas. In addition, while the hospital master plan envisioned 100 new privatized hospitals, a
lack of access to private capital amid the global economic downturn will delay the 2-3 year
timetable for completion.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

78.      As discussed in the prior section, the PRSO-supported program generally exceeded
expectations in the achievement of objectives and outcomes in Pillars II and III and generally met
expectations in Pillars I and IV. Even within Pillars I and IV, expectations were exceeded in
some specific subcomponents. In some areas (e.g., energy, tax collection, and social protection),
Georgia achieved in a relatively short period of time objectives with which other low- and
middle-income economies have been struggling for years. This strong overall performance could
potentially meet the definition of an overall highly satisfactory rating. However, the program is
conservatively being assigned an overall outcome rating of satisfactory because of the following
reasons. First, in a small number of specific subcomponents (procurement and civil service
reform), the achievement of objectives and outcomes is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
Second, as discussed, although living standards of the poor appear to have improved along
several dimensions, data limitations have prevented the reliable tracking of consumption-based
poverty over the course of the program. Third, the shocks resulting from the August 2008
conflict and the global economic crisis provide a test of sustainability of some of the reforms,
given the potential impact of the downturn on development outcomes.

79.      The outcome indicators in Table 3, while reflecting strong performance overall, do not do
full justice to the degree of progress that occurred during the PRSO program. Across the gamut
of PRSO Pillars, institutions and processes were fundamentally changed, often moving from

           tripling the supply)
           Substantial improvement in tax revenues that allowed an increase in the size of the
           budget from US$700 million in 2003 to US$4.7 billion in 2008
           Cross-cutting improvements in governance, particularly in the areas of effectiveness
           of the public sector and the business environment
           The delivery of targeted social assistance to a significant share of the extreme poor
           population from a baseline of near zero

80.    Other important achievements include:

           Restoring the external audit function of the Chamber of Control
           Creating the Treasury Single Account and eliminating thousands of off-budget
           accounts
           Allocating resources to schools that were decaying, and establishing transparency in
           a formerly corrupt university admissions process
           Financing the provision basic health care to most poor people
           Fostering macroeconomic stability with high growth, increased foreign investment,
           and substantially reduced external public debt

81.     There were some shortcomings in implementation (e.g., procurement and civil service
reform) and there were also some adjustments in the PRSO design, which have already been
documented. However, the accomplishments that were supported by the PRSO series establish a
strong case for an overall outcome rating of satisfactory.

82.     The pace of Georgia's reform efforts is particularly noteworthy. PRSOs I-IV, including
the Supplemental Credit, were disbursed in about 3 years but more importantly, the reform
actions that were implemented improved conditions on the ground quite dramatically. Table 4
below shows some of the commonly used cross-country indicators of reform progress; Georgia's
policy and institutional framework improved considerably in a short four year period.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

(See discussion in section 3.2 on overall living standards and poverty reduction.)

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

83.     The reform program supported by the PRSO series included far-reaching institutional
change and strengthening in several areas. The budgetary process, the treasury, the revenue
administration including taxes and customs, the energy sector, the institutions for delivery of
social assistance, education and health care services all represent major institutional changes.
These are significant accomplishments of the PRSO series and the complementary projects, and
the general expectation is that these major institutional changes will be sustained and deepened
going forward. For example, in the area of public finances, the budgeting reforms during the
PRSO series are being followed by efforts to improve the results-orientation of the budget. The
gains and public benefit derived from many areas of institutional change suggest that these
reforms are entrenched and would be difficult to reverse. Another factor likely to contribute to
sustaining the institutional improvements is that the competence of the authorities has continued
to improve, following several years of experience in implementing and deepening reforms.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

84.     The overall risk to development outcome of the PRSO program is assessed as Moderate.
A number of factors affect the risk to development outcome in Georgia. First, the impacts of the
August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global economic crisis have resulted in a sharp
downturn in key outcome indicators, including growth and poverty; and the economic downturn
is presenting significant challenges in engineering economic recovery and in deepening
implementation of the structural reform program. Second, Georgia faces significant regional
tensions which remain elevated in the aftermath of the August 2008 conflict and could further
undermine investor confidence and the implementation of the reform program. Third, domestic


                                                29
political tensions have increased at times in recent years, often resulting from the perception that
the process of decision-making on policy options has not been sufficiently consultative.

85.      The rating of moderate risk to development outcome is on the side of caution since the
risks are subject to a number of mitigating factors. First, although regional tensions remain
strained, mediation efforts are ongoing with support from the international community and
bilateral partners.

86.     Second, although there have been periods of increased domestic political tensions in
recent years, an important factor sustaining reform implementation is that there appears to be
support across most of the political spectrum on continuing liberal economic reforms. In late
2007, domestic tensions grew and led to demonstrations, in response to which the Government
declared a brief period of emergency. Early elections were called and President Saakashvili won
a second five year term in January 2008. In 2009, domestic political tensions again increased,
with some opposition parties seeking fresh elections, although the protests were largely peaceful
and tensions have eased since July 2009. In spite of these episodes of heightened political tension,
the view of liberal reforms is shared by a wide spectrum of political parties. At the same time,
the tensions underline the need for wide dialogue on policy options and investment priorities
within and outside of Government.

87.      Third, regarding the risks posed by the impact of the August 2008 conflict and the
subsequent global economic downturn, the authorities have responded with a number of decisive
measures. These include providing housing and livelihood support for large numbers of new
IDPs, extending liquidity and regulatory support to the financial sector, and implementing a
countercyclical fiscal stimulus including a significant scaling up of public social and
infrastructure investment expenditures to mitigate the downturn. These measures have been
strongly supported by the international community which pledged $4.5 billion in financial
support over three years, including $850 million in support for the private banking sector, at a
donor conference in Brussels in October 2008. The groundwork for the donor conference was
laid in the immediate aftermath of the conflict by a Joints Needs Assessment (JNA) led by the
World Bank and the UN (with the collaboration of EC, ADB, EBRD, EIB, and IFC). The
authorities and the donor community are working together to monitor implementation of the
support pledged.

88.     The commitment of the authorities to reform implementation has remained strong
through the economic downturn. As a result, the Bank has followed up with a series of three
Development Policy Operations (DPOs) to support the Government's policy reform program to
mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in the short-term and to facilitate recovery and
prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term. The First DPO was approved by the
Bank's Board of Executive Directors in July 2009 and the Second DPO is planned for July 2010.
In addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework, the reform areas supported
include improving the efficiency of public finances, improving the social safety net, and
improving external competitiveness.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

89.      The Bank was responsive to a clear and energetic program of reforms laid out by the
Government. The PRSO program was based on the strategy articulated in the Government's
EDPRP. The Bank supported the Government reform program through a new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) in 2006 which included a number of policy and investment lending
operations and analytical products during the course of the PRSO series. The complementarity of
the PRSO series and the investment projects represented good practice. In addition the Bank
initiated a technical assistance project, the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Project
(PSFMRP) at the end of the first PRSO. The Bank selectively pursued and took the lead in policy
areas where it had comparative advantage and a relatively good track record: the energy sector,
external audit, targeted social assistance. The Bank also followed good practice in its analytical
underpinnings, in working with other donors, and in selectively defining its proper role in a fast
moving reform environment. As part of its risk assessment, the Bank acknowledged the
significant risks associated with regional tensions.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

90.      Throughout the course of the PRSO series, the quality of Bank supervision was
satisfactory in a number of respects. First, the Bank maintained an active dialogue with the
Government on all key areas of the PRSO program, and the dialogue was conducted not only
with the Ministry of Finance by the PRSO team but also with line ministries by the Bank's
sectoral staff. The coordinated approach followed by PREM and sectoral staff contributed to
sound supervision. Second, the Bank tailored its supervisory role to the needs of the specific
reform areas. In some areas, such as public financial management and budgeting, the Bank took
on a more proactive supervisory role. In other areas, Bank supervision did not need to be as
much of a driving influence as in other operations because the Government took firm charge of
their reform program and had a timeframe in mind within which to accomplish it. That the
Bank's expectations were exceeded in Pillars II and III and specific subcomponents of Pillars I
and IV underscores this point. The Government's approach to reforms in specific areas, such as
privatization of the hospital sector and the decentralized approach to civil service reform, may not
have followed exactly the path usually advocated by the Bank in these areas, but the Bank did not
insist that the Government diverge from its approach. In the case of civil service and
procurement reform, the Bank appropriately scaled back its initially conceived program.

91.     Third, Bank supervision benefited from a detailed results framework specified for the
PRSO program. The results framework was more elaborate than is found in many development
policy operations and while it may not have fully captured the program accomplishments in light
of the impressive progress, it was adequate for the purpose of undertaking an assessment of the
achievement of the program development objectives and outcomes.




                                                31
92.     Mitigating the Medium-term Risks from the August 2008 Conflict. The Bank
responded quickly to the August 2008 crisis. At the request of the Government, the Bank along
with the UN led the Joint Needs Assessment (with the collaboration of EC, ADB, EBRD, EIB,
and IFC) which, working closely with the Government, provided a coordinated assessment of
Georgia's recovery and reconstruction needs. In order to sustain implementation of the PRSO
reforms, the Bank also responded swiftly by approving supplementary financing for PRSO-IV
following an economic mission in the immediate aftermath of the conflict.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

93.      The Bank supported a broadly designed reform program that the Government
implemented rapidly. The Bank also showed flexibility in adjusting the program as needed to
reflect changing circumstances, such as in the case of civil service reform, but also provided
timely analytical support in key areas such as the social safety net and energy sector restructuring.
Finally, the Bank was highly responsive to the Government's request for financial assistance and
in exercising its convening capacity in the aftermath of the August 2008 crisis. These three
elements all support a satisfactory overall rating for Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

94.     The Government's performance was satisfactory due to a number of factors. These
include the clear commitment to reform implementation from the highest level of the Government,
continuity at the MoF where the commitment, vision and strategy have not changed, and an
overall dynamic and fast-moving government. While the strength of the performance benefited
from a focus of the Government on swift implementation, this also led to some lack of broad
public participation in the design and implementation of the reform program. The Government
was diligent about keeping reforms on track--for example, in the electricity sector, when various
stakeholders sought a relaxation of termination for nonpayment or amendment and abrogation of
contracts for managing contractors for electricity distribution, the Government showed resolve in
overruling the requests.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

95.     The performance of the implementing agencies was satisfactory for many of the same
reasons responsible for satisfactory government performance. In addition, the implementing
agencies including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Labor,
Health, and Social Affairs, coordinated well between each other in the implementation of the
reform program. The coordination between the implementing agencies also benefited from the
role played by the State Minister for Reform Coordination.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

                                                 32
96.     Both the government and implementing agencies performances were satisfactory, and,
therefore, overall performance is also satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
97.    The experience with the PRSO series provides a number of lessons for the design and
implementation of development policy operations in Georgia and elsewhere.

98.      First, strong Government ownership of the reform program was crucial to the
success and rapid pace of the PRSO series. The authorities took the lead in identifying and
implementing the reform program, with the Bank playing a catalytic and supportive role in
identifying ways to enhance what the Government had already decided to implement on an
accelerated time schedule. The PRSO program supported key elements of the Government's
reform program, as articulated in its Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(EDPRP) of July 2003, the EDPRP Update of August 2006, and the annual Basic Data and
Directions (BDD) document (which is the MTEF). The Bank's analytical work (including both
formal reports but also just-in-time technical advisory support) contributed to the formulation and
implementation of selected aspects of the Government's reform program.

99.      Second, the strong focus of the Government on results was vital in driving
implementation of the reform agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on achieving
specific development outcomes and results, and the PRSO team supported the authorities in
developing a detailed set of monitorable outcome indicators to track results from implementation
of the reform program. The focus on results and outcomes not only helped track implementation,
but also helped to more sharply define and formulate the reform triggers necessary for
achievement of the desired results. The set of monitorable indicators went beyond specifying
end-program status and value targets by specifying intermediate target values for each operation.
This helped track the pace of achievement of results along the course of the programmatic series.

100.     Third, the programmatic approach afforded important flexibility to advance and
deepen reform implementation in several areas (e.g., CoC, electricity provision, tax reform, and
targeted social assistance targets) and reduce the scope of or provide additional time for
implementation in other areas (e.g., CoC and standardization reforms). This approach allowed
the program to maintain its relevance to country circumstances, reinforced government ownership,
and contributed to a strong relationship of trust between the Bank and the Government. The
flexibility was particularly appropriate in light of the Government's sharp focus on achieving
results, which allowed the Bank to be flexible in supporting the path followed in arriving at the
desired results.

101.    Fourth, strong donor coordination to strengthen the Government's implementation
capacity was essential. The Bank's projects and other donors provided important technical
assistance to build capacity in key areas. Areas in which Bank projects complemented the
reforms supported by the PRSO series included public sector reform, education, and health care.
The PRSO team also coordinated closely with other donors including the EC, USAID, the
Netherlands Government, SIDA, and DFID. The Netherlands provided co-financing for the
PRSO program. Increasing the Government's implementation capacity and leveraging World
Bank Group resources through collaboration with other donors were critical elements in the
design of the PRSO series.



                                                33
102.     Finally, reform progress can be achieved in areas without a clear reform champion
if the area is selected carefully and if a flexible approach is adopted. A number of areas in
serious need of reform, including external audit, civil service and procurement, lacked a clear
reform champion. Given that the PRSO program was broad and ambitious, the Bank was
selective in pursuing challenging reform areas that lacked a reform champion. In the early
implementation of the PRSO program, the Bank team decided that all three of these areas could
not be pursued sufficiently to achieve successful results. The team decided to put more resources
into the pursuit of external audit reforms, mainly because the Bank team viewed external audit as
an area of comparative advantage for the Bank, vis-à-vis civil service reform. Coordinating well
with other donors (the EC, the Dutch and USAID) was an important ingredient in the success of
improving the external audit function and raising the status of the Chamber of Control to that of a
supreme audit institution in line with INTOSAI standards.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing gencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

103.    The Georgian authorities have provided written comments (inserted into Annex 2) to
indicate their agreement with the overall assessment of the ICR regarding achievement of
development objectives, to underline the results of their reform program during the course of the
PRSO series, and to emphasize their commitment to continuing implementation of the medium-
term structural reform agenda. Bank staff found these comments fully acceptable and have noted
that the authorities' reform agenda is being supported through the new Development Policy
Operation (DPO) series.

(b) Cofinanciers

104.     The Netherlands Embassy has provided written comments (inserted into Annex 3) to
indicate their broad subscription to assessments contained in the ICR, to draw attention to the
mixed picture with regard to poverty reduction during the course of the PRSO series, and to point
out follow-up work by the Netherlands in the area of anticorruption. Bank staff found these
comments very helpful and have reflected them in the text of the ICR. On the poverty issue, data
limitations have prevented the reliable tracking of poverty incidence over time; and it is estimated
that the economic downturn following the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global
economic crisis has resulted in an increase in poverty incidence. At the same time, the expansion
of the TSA program was successful in mitigating poverty incidence and the new DPO series is
directed at mitigating the impact of the economic downturn and addressing remaining structural
challenges going forward. Collaboration with the Netherlands along several dimensions was an
important ingredient in the success of the PRSO program and this useful partnership is continuing
into the new DPO series for which the Netherlands is providing co-financing.

Annex 3. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Date: December 18, 2009

As co-financier, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands subscribes broadly to the
assessments contained in this Implementation Completion and Results Report.

An issue of particular attention for the Netherlands is the mixed picture with regard to poverty
reduction. As the ICR rightly points out, the period assessed has shown notable achievements in
poverty reduction, in monetary and non-monetary terms, though - as the ICR rightly notes - there
is a lack of continuous data to adequately assess trends. The successful introduction of a Targeted
Social Assistance methodology to mitigate the incidence of poverty is a real success that forms a
basis for the future efforts of the government to combat poverty. At the same time, we do note
that poverty reduction has not kept pace with the impressive record of GDP growth prior to the
events of August 2008. We would like to point to some of the analysis contained in the follow-up
to the PRSO series, the Development Policy Operation -1, in particular paras 17 and 34 of the
program document. The estimated increase of the poverty headcount post-August 2008 deserves
attention in the frame of chapter 4 of this ICR: risks to development outcomes achieved over the
period of the PRSO-series.

The embassy subscribes to the notion of strong ownership of the government as a key factor
contributing to the success of the PRSO-series. With regard to the Anti-Corruption strategy (as
mentioned in para 3.1) the Netherlands has contributed to and followed-up on the PRSO-series by
funding a project executed by the Council of Europe. Since the abolishment of the post of state
minister of reform coordination (beginning of 2008), the implementation of the anti-corruption
strategy was lagging as there was no formal responsibility for it. The good news is that in 2009
the government re-established clear ownership by appointing an interagency coordination council.
This renewed ownership resulted in fresh efforts to update the anti-corruption strategy and
develop a concrete action plan.

The objectives related to Public Finance Management have also been supported by the
Netherlands by providing co-financing to the Public Finance Management Reform Support
Project (together with DfID, SIDA and the Bank).

The Netherlands has contributed to the follow-up of the PRSO Series by providing co-financing
to the DPO-1. The Embassy looks forward to carrying forward the achievements and challenges
that remain after completion of the PRSO-series also through its other bilateral assistance efforts.
