Borrower            Georgia
ImplementingAgency Ministryo fFinance
Amount              US$13.5 million inIDA credit and US$6.5 million inIDA grant (US$20.0
                    million equivalent)
Terms               IDA credit i s at standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace
                    period
Objective and       The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO), which i s the
Description         first in a series o f three proposed PRSOs, i s intended to support the
                    Government o f Georgia with the implementation o f reforms and policy
                    priorities o f Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
                    (EDPRP, or the PRSP as it i s known in Georgia). The proposed PRSO
                    would support the objectives and the policies of the EDPRP by: (i)
                    strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)
                    improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii)improving the
                    environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social
                    protection, education and health care services.

                    The first PRSO i s proposed to be extended on the basis o f policy and
                    institutional reform actions taken as agreed with IDA. Subsequent PRSOs
                    would be made available as further agreed triggers o f policy and
                    institutional reform are satisfied.

Benefits            There are several primary benefits o f this operation. First and foremost,
                    further progress with anti-conuption efforts and improved governance will
                    improve efficiency and transparency in the use o f public resources, the
                    investment climate, and will also improve the access to and affordability o f
                    key social services for the poor.          Strengthened public expenditure
                    management and accountability will greatly enhance the strategic
                    allocation o f resources through the medium-term expenditure framework
                    and contribute to fiscal sustainability. Improved electricity and gas sector
                    services will help to mitigate one o f the key impediments to business and
                   job generation as well as contributing directly to improved living standards
                    for the poor, notably for those outside the capital. The simplification and
                    clarification o f rules and regulations governing business activity will
                    provide further stimulus to private sector activity, while the reforms
                    envisaged in key social programs will improve the quality and targeting o f
                    social services and social protection for the poor and vulnerable.

Risks               The Govemment's reform efforts face several risks. The main risk i s weak
                    implementation capacity. This has been carefully factored into the design
                    o f this operation: notably, through a programmatic approach with proper
                    sequencing. The Government i s also taking direct initiatives to ensure
                    policy consistency across various initiatives and to address capacity


                                           ..

                  weaknesses. The Government i s developing an overarching strategy in a
                   Medium-Term Action Strategy building on and consolidating the policy
                   reforms o f the EDPRP, the Individual Partnership Action Plan for joining
                  NATO (PAP),the EU Neighborhood Policy Paper and other policy
                   documents. At the same time, the Government i s actively addressing
                   capacity weaknesses. Donors including the World Bank are actively
                   supporting these initiatives. The PRSO program focuses on key areas in
                   which donor technical assistance i s ongoing or expected in the near term.
                   During the preparation and at appraisal, the task team consulted closely
                   with other donors on the potential scope o f the participation o f donors in
                   capacity enhancement. Current plans include joint analytical work,
                   technical assistance and leamingltraining activities. A joint Monitoring and
                   Evaluation (M&E) framework derived from the Medium-Term Action
                   Strategy will be adopted between the Government and donors. The
                   outcome and monitoring indicators proposed in the PRSO program
                   represent a solid first step in this direction, as evidenced by the use o f
                   PEFA indicators, among other features.
                   Georgia remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks (e.g., climate-related
                   shocks to apculture and an unforeseen deterioration in the external
                   environment) because o f its limited economic diversification and relatively
                   high external debt burden. This poses risks for macroeconomic stability,
                   growth, and poverty reduction. The macroeconomic situation faces several
                   risks. On the fiscal side, the very strong revenue performance o f the past
                   year may prove difficult to sustain, while the pace o f and proceeds from
                   future privatization are subject to some uncertainty. The recent surge in
                   inflation also causes concern given the Government's plans for increased
                   spending on investment and social programs. The Bank and the IMF will
                   monitor the macroeconomic situation carefully and will closely coordinate
                   their advice.

                   Other risks include deterioration in the security and/or political
                   environment (e.g., due to rekindled tensions in the regions o f Abkhazia and
                   South Ossetia or resistance to reforms from vested interests). The
                   continued very high popular support enjoyed by the President and the
                   Government i s important in this regard. The Government's systematic
                   efforts to explain the rationale o f its economic strategy, and the anticipated
                   rapid improvements in governance and living standards, will be important
                   in maintaining this support. Timely and strong support from the
                   international community will be critical. Specific to the problem o f
                   territorial integnty, the recent return o f Adjara under the authority o f the
                   central government i s a very welcome development. It i s hoped that
                   continued international efforts will contribute to the peaceful resolution o f
                   the remaining territorial disputes.

                                      I.INTRODUCTION


1.      Since a reform-minded new Government came into power a year and a half ago,
Georgia has witnessed significant political and economic developments. The peaceful "Rose
Revolution" o f late November 2003 was a popular uprising against years o f mismanagement
and corruption in government, triggeredby frustration over fraudulent abuses inparliamentary
elections. Presidential elections were held in early January 2004 and the new President,
Mikhail Saakashvili, obtained 97 percent o f the votes in an election considered by domestic
and international monitors as largely corruption-free. The electionresults were interpreted as a
strong endorsement o f the call for a deep and far-reaching fight against corruption and poor
governance. Parliamentary elections were held on March 28, 2004, and the ruling parties
obtained an overwhelming majority in a ratification o f the mandate given in the Presidential
election. The ruling coalition has a solid majority inParliament and continues to enjoy broad-
based support in the country. While some progress has been made in normalizing relations
between the central authorities and the two regions o f South Ossetia and Abkazia, the
situation remains very uncertain.

2.      In the past, Georgia had undertaken many economic reforms with some success
particularly in price liberalization.     Although growth had occurred in some years, the
beneficial impact and sustainability o f the reforms had often been limited by weak
implementation.      Key economic problems had been, among others, very low revenue
collections, wasteful/inefficient public expenditures, and an unsustainable level o f external
debt. The mainreasons for this situation hadbeenthe sharp deterioration ingovernance and a
fragmentation o f power among competing groups in government and between the central and
local authorities. Poor public sector management meant that the sharp rise in poverty since
the collapse o f the Soviet Union was not effectively countered. In2004, the overall incidence
o f poverty stood at 52 percent o f the population and extreme poverty incidence stood at 17
percent. Income per capita was still some 50 percent below the pre-independence level, the
unemployment rate was high (about 15 percent), with many Georgians remaining
underemployed.       Until recently, Georgia's progress toward achieving the Millennium
Development Goals has been slow.

3.      From the outset, the new Government was determined to fight corruption, improve
governance, and raise the living standards o f the poor andvulnerable segments o f society. The
performance to date has been impressive. Revenue collection increased dramatically fromjust
over 14 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 18 percent in 2004. The Government also cleared about
two-thirds o f the substantial wages and pensions arrears accumulated over several years prior
to 2004. Inits 2005 budget, the Government focuses on clearing all remaining arrears and on
implementing poverty focused programs, including increases in basic pensions and the
introduction later inthe year o f a targeted poverty benefit.


                                                1

4.      The Government is also putting considerable effort into implementing o f the
Economic Development and Poverty ReductionProgram (EDPRP, i.e., its PRSP) prepared by
its predecessor in 2003 and which it endorsed upon taking office in2004. This commitment i s
clearly signaled inan EDPRPprogress report prepared inFebruary2005. The report indicates
that the Government recognizes the need for clearer prioritization and sequencing o f the
EDPRP, as well as the need to strengthen its capacity to implement the poverty reduction
strategy more effectively. This commitment has been further reaffirmed in the recent budget
document titled "Georgian Government, Basic Data and Directions (BDD) 2006-2009." The
fiscal strategy outlined inthe BDD i s consistent with the EDPRP policies and priorities and i s
aligned with the MTEF process. The Government i s now actively working to consolidate and
refine various sectoral and cross-sectoral elements o f its poverty strategy with a view to
issuing an updated strategy in2006 (the MediumTerm Action Strategy, see paragraph 2 o f the
Letter o f Development Policy). The policy measures identified by the EDPRP, its progress
report, and the BDD document are included in the Letter o f Development Policy, attached to
this document (Annex 1).

5.      The Government's reform program has received strong financial and technical support
from the intemational community. Inparticular, a donors' conference in Brussels in June
2004 pledged more than US$1.0 billion, the IMF approved a three-year Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) for US$144 million inJune 2004, and the Paris Club rescheduled
Georgia's debt inJuly 2004 which lowered the near-term burdeno f servicing. For its part, the
World Bank approved a Reform Support Credit (RSC) (US$24 million equivalent) on June
24,2004, providing urgent assistance to the new Government inthe first phase o f its efforts to
define and launch a bold program o f economic reforms. The Bank also provided two new
investmentprojects in2004 totaling US$23.6 million.

6.      Over the next few years the Government needs to translate these early gains into
lasting institutional change. Inaddition to further fiscal consolidation and the sustaining o f the
drive to eliminate corruption, it faces serious challenges to create functioning administrative
systems, build a professional civil service, enhance the business climate, and improve social
services. A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06-09 has been prepared. The CPS
aims to meet the Government's need for support in implementing o f its EDPRP through
carefully designed and targeted Bank activities selected to maximize their catalytic impact on
the reform process and complementarity with the activities o f other donors. The centerpiece
o f the assistance strategy i s a series o f three Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs),
which seek to deepen and broaden the structural reform agenda initiated under the FY04 RSC
operation. The new CPS i s being submitted to the Board together with the first PRSO, which
has been identified at US$20 million.

7.       The first PRSO operationwould support the objectives and the policies o f the EDPRP
by: (i) enhancing public sector accountability and efficiency; (ii)  improving the electricity and
gas sector services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector development; and (v)
improving health and education and alleviating poverty and vulnerability.

                                              11. ECONOMIC CONTEXT

A.        RecentEconomicDevelopments


8.        GDP Growth, Inflation, and Exchange Rate. Following the Russianfinancial crisis
and severe droughts in 1998 and 2000, the Georgian economy started its recovery in 2001
driven by a rebound in agricultural production and strong growth in transport,
communications, construction and trade. Agriculture continues to have a prominent role inthe
economy with an average contribution o f about 20 percent o f GDP. It also has the highest
share o f employment among sectors (54 percent). Thus, severe adverse weather and other
exogenous shocks to the agriculture sector have a major impact on growth and poverty.                           1

Owing to the continued positive agricultural performance, growth further accelerated to 11
percent in2003.2

9.        About one-third o f the growth in 2003 was accounted for by buoyant activity in the
industrial and communications sectors and the construction o f the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
oil pipeline. Economic activity remained strong in2004 although another bad harvest resulted
in a slightly lower real GDP growth of 6.2 percent. GDP growth is estimated at 7.3 percent
for the first quarter o f 2005. Despite the recent improved economic performance, the situation
inthe labor market remains largely unfavorable. The unemployment rate, which had declined
in 2003 to 11.5 percent, increased again to 12.5 percent in 2004 reflecting significant
economic restructuring inthe economy including public sector employment retrenchments.

10.       Growth i s being driven primarily by consumption and investment. Following an
adjustment path similar to other transition economies, imports are surpassing Georgia's export
capacity. Private sector consumption (about 75 percent o f GDP) and private investment (25
per~ent)~    have been the major contributing factors to growth on the demand side. However,
the large clearance o fwage and pension arrears in2004 resulted ina sharp increase inshare o f
government consumption, from 9.2 percent o f GDP in2003 to nearly 15 percent in2004.

11.       The pursuit o f a sound monetary policy kept inflation low at around 5 percent on
average during 2001-03 and the exchange rate remained relatively stable over this period.
However, inflation flared up from the second half o f 2004, with 12-month consumer price
inflation rising from 3.6 percent in June 2004 to 8.9 percent in May 2005. Contributing
factors included an easing o f liquidity conditions (partly due to a sharp increase ingovernment
spending), weather-related increases in foodstuff prices, a sharp rise in excise tax rates for
tobacco and beverages since January 2005, and the rise in international oil prices. Large
capital inflows, prompted by a rebound in confidence, complicated the conduct o f monetary
policy. Despite sizable NBG intervention (dollar purchases), the lari appreciated by 13.5
percent during 2004. Rapid monetary expansion has continued over the past few months                            -
reserve money at the end o f March 2005 grew by 36 percent year-on-year and currency in

' The   shares o f services (13 percent o f GDP), manufacturing (9 percent) and construction (6 percent) have also
been rising inthe last two years.
 As the policy environment continues to improve, the size of the registered economy i s expanding. Hence, GDP
growth rates partly reflect an increased account o f the unrecorded activities in Georgia's national accounts
statistics.
 The high share of private investment i s mostly associated with investments inthe BTC pipeline construction.

                                                        3

circulation by 41 percent. The increased monetization from 13 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 15
percent in 2004 i s a welcome sign o f growing confidence in the economy. The share o f
foreign currency deposits in total deposits remains high at 77 percent as o f March 2005.
However, the inflationary pressures needto bekept incheck.

12.     Fiscal Stance. Despite the relatively robust economic growth, there was no progress
on the fiscal front duringthe period 2001-03. Tax revenues were low (at 14.5 percent o f GDP
in 2003), reflecting low collections, high corruption, tax evasion and massive smuggling.
Current expenditures decreased as a share o f GDP from 18.2 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent
in 2002 before recovering to 17 percent in 2003. Poor budget preparation and execution
resultedinthe accumulation o f large expenditure arrears which amounted to about 4.7 percent
o f GDP by the end o f 2003, with two-thirds o f this amount owed to wages, pensions, and
other social payments. The 2003 budgetdeficit on a commitment basis stood at 2.5 percent o f
GDP, andwas two-thirds larger thanplanned.

13.     The new Government took decisive actions to start addressing the underlyingrevenue
problems o f corruption and poor tax administration in 2004. Anti-corruption measures intax
administration resulted in significant progress, with tax collections rising from 14.5 percent of
GDP in 2003 to 18.2 percent in2004-a              level exceeding the budget target. Inaddition, there
was a one-off surge in non-tax revenue (partly stemming from funds collected from former
government officials suspected o f corruption), raising the total Government revenues
excluding grants to almost 21 percent o f GDP and resultingin a fiscal surplus (commitment
basis) o f 2.3 percent o f GDP in 2004.               The strengthened revenue position allowed the
Government to begin clearing o f a legacy o f accumulated expenditure arrears (by an estimated
2.6 percent o f GDPa4)The fiscal boost and the rebound in investor confidence has resulted in
increased maturities and lower yields on treasury bills, with the average weighted interest rate
falling from 43 percent in2003 to about 13 percent in2005.

14.      Tax collection increased sharply during the second half o f 2004. This trend continued
in the first quarter o f 2005, following the adoption o f a new tax code in January which
lowered rates on income and social taxes. Tax revenues increased to 18 percent o f GDP, an
unprecedented increase o fmore than 50 percent as compared to the first quarter o f 2004.

15.      External Sector. The external current account deficit narrowed to an average o f 5.4
percent o f GDP during 2001-02 as compared to an average o f 10 percent in the late 1990s.                       5

The lower deficit in early the 2000s was partly due to an increase inregisteredexports, owing
to improved data reporting by customs, and partly to the reduction in the import o f large
capital imports as the construction o f the Supsa oil pipeline was completed. However, the
rapid rise in energy and capital imports associated with higher oil prices and the construction
o f the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline and the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCP)
has placed renewed pressure on the external current account, and the deficits were 7.2 percent
and 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2003 and 2004, respectively.                             The increased deficits
notwithstanding, gross official reserves increased from an average o f 1.4 months of non-
pipeline imports in2001 to 2.0 months in2004.


 The fiscal deficit on a cash basis was contained at less than 0.2 percent of 2004 GDP.
  Metals are a large part o f Georgia's exports and rising metal prices in 2004 (copper by 60 percent, steel by 50
percent, gold by 13 percent) raised export revenues substantially.

                                                          4

16.      Georgia has a heavy burden o f external indebtedness, especially from a fiscal point o f
view. The stock o f total external debt was US$1.9 billion at the end o f 2003, equivalent to 49
percent o f GDP with more than 97 percent o f it inthe form o f public and publicly guaranteed
debt. The Government has sought to ease this burden through several rounds o f debt
rescheduling. In2004, Georgiahad accumulated a total o fUS$lOO million inprincipal arrears
from 2003 in addition to the debt service due in 2004. This was equivalent to almost half o f
the country's gross international reserves. In July 2004, the Government reached a debt
agreement with the Paris Club, which rescheduled approximately US$161 million6 o f debt
service and arrears and reduced payments to Paris Club creditors from US$169 million to
US$46 million during2004-06.7

17.      Following the Paris Club agreement, the Government has managed to contain its
borrowings. Much o f the increased pipeline-related capital expenditure imports have been
financed by FDI. As a result, the external debt stock interms o f GDP declined to 39 percent
at the end o f 2004. Similarly, the debt service to exports ratio fell from 12 percent in 2003 to
8.5 percent in 2004.8 Despite these important improvements, Georgia's external liquidity
position and debt sustainability remain fragile and will require careful management for some
years to come. The prospect o f enhanced non-debt financing inflows as the Government's
privatization program progresses should be carefully factored into this process, including the
possible use o fprivatization proceeds to reduce the debt stock.

B.       MacroeconomicOutlook andDebtSustainability
18.      Growth and Inflation. Continued prudent macroeconomic policies and steady
implementation o f structural reform would provide a firm basis for sustained growth over the
next several years. Reform in the public sector, including the strengthening o f state
institutions, improved governance and anti-comption strategies, would enhance the
environment for the development o f the private sector. The spill-over effects o f the oil and
gas pipeline construction would remain a major contributing factor to Georgia's growth. Other
sources o f growth include food processing, tourism and transit trade activities. Volatility in
the agriculture sector i s likely to persist, along with the process o f labor-shedding by this
sector.     Consequently, more rapid progress with poverty alleviation will require an
acceleration o f growth innon-agriculture, non-pipeline sectors.

19.      GDP growth is projected at around 8.5 percent in20059 and by an average of about 5
percent during 2006-08 (Table l),            despite the heavy floods o f April 2005.             Inflationary
pressures have continued inthe second quarter o f 2005 with CPI growing at 8.9 percent inthe
12 months to May. Giventhe large planned increase in Government spending and substantial


6 This comprised arrears at May 31, 2004, and 100percent o f debt service falling due between June 1, 2004 and
December 2006 on loans contracted prior to November 1, 1999 (the cut-off date) o f which US$12.7 million was
ODA debts).
7 The rescheduling was structured on Houston terms. Official Development Loans (ODAs) will be repaid over 20
years, including 10 years' grace at concessional terms. Guaranteed commercial credits and 50 percent o f arrears
will be repaid over 20 years with 5 years' grace at interest rates to be set no higher than in previous bilateral
agreements. The remaining arrears will be repaid over three years starting December 2004.
* Exports of goods and non-factor services, including remittances.
  GDP growth is estimated at 7.3 percent inthe first quarter o f 2005.  I

inflows expected from the privatizations under way, inflationary pressures remain o f concern
for the rest o f the year, with CPI inflation projected at 7 percent by end- 2005 before declining
to an average o f4 percent inthe mediumterm.

20.             Fiscal Developments. In 2005, further measures are envisaged to enhance the legal
and institutional framework for tax and customs administration, as well as for public
expendituremanagement to clear the remaining expenditure arrears. The newly approved tax
code which became effective in January 2005 has simplified the tax system and i s expected to
broaden its base and minimize rent-seeking. Tax revenues are projected to be at 18 percent o f
GDP in 2005 and to increase by an additional 0.5 percent o f GDP each year during 2006-08.

                                                                                     6

The increase in the proceeds from privatization has allowed partial clearance o f earlier
expenditure arrears. However, set-backs in the anticipated privatization process, lower tax
collection in the last two months, newly identified expenditure arrears, and increases in
supplementary spending in areas such as infrastructure, pensions and health have slowed the
pace o f arrears clearance. With public investment planned to increase by an additional 3
percent o f GDP in 2005, the fiscal position i s expected to deteriorate sharply, turning the
surplus o f 2.3 percent of GDP in 2004 into a deficit o f 3.5 percent in 2005 (commitment
basis). The Government will needto exercise extreme caution inexpenditure planning and in
managingthe fiscal stance, giventhe existing highdebt and inflationary pressures.

21.            External Sector. The construction o f the BTC i s assumed to be completed in the
second half o f 2005 and the SCP by mid-2007. Thus, imports o f capital goods are expected to
remain at a high level through 2007 and to moderate rapidly thereafter. The current account
deficit would peak at about 12 percent o f GDP in 2005, then decline progressively to about 3
percent in the medium term. Non-pipeline imports are likely to continue to be dominated by
Georgia's energy needs for some time to come. In the near term, exports would remain
concentrated in scrap metal, raw materials and wine. Over time, Government efforts to
improve the business environment for private sector and enterprise development would help
promote export diversification. Inaddition, Georgia i s projected to receive transit revenues o f
around 1 percent o f GDP from the transport o f oil and gas via the BTC and SCP pipelines
starting from the second half o f 2005.

                                                                                    7

22.     Georgia's external financing requirements for 2005 are estimated at around US$950
million. O f this, US$730 million i s assumed to be financed through FDI and US$211 million
(including the IMF) through multilateral and bilateral support. IDA'S support in 2005 i s
assumed at US$90 million, US$20 million o f which would be from the PRSO. External
financing needs are projected at US$470 million annually during 2006-08, with FDIcovering
an average o f US$236 million as the construction o f the pipelines ends.              The residual
financing needs are assumed to be met by a mix o f public (56 percent) and private (44
percent) borrowings, including continued recourse to exceptional financing from the Bank and
the IMF (see Table 2).

23.     Given Georgia's projected external current account deficit and financing mix, the
stock o f external debt i s projected to increase to US$2.4 billion by 2008. Inrelative terms, the
debt would decline from 40 percent o f GDP in 2004 to about 33 percent in 2005, and further
to an average o f 30 percent during 2006-08. Debt service to exports i s projected to decline
progressively from 8.4 percent in 2004 to 5.0 percent by 2008. Provided the much stronger
revenue performance persists and public expenditures policies remain prudent and increase
their efficiency, the Government's financial position would improve rapidly, with the ratio o f
debt service payments to central government revenues falling from about 41 percent in 2004
to about 19 percent in 2008. The underlying debt service projections assume that Georgia
would succeed in its negotiations with non-Paris Club members to receive similar
rescheduling agreements to those granted by the Paris Club. To date, agreements have been
signed with Russia and Iran. Negotiations with the rest o f the non-Paris Club creditors are to
be concluded by end-2005.

24.     An updated debt sustainability analysis" (DSA) for Georgia i s presented in the new
Country Partnership Strategy. The analysis indicates that the debt profile and its pattern have
improved over the last two years owing to debt rescheduling as well as improved economic
performance. The analysis also indicates continued gradual improvement in debt indicators
provided macroeconomic stability i s maintained and economic reforms are systematically
implemented.        However, Georgia's debt patterns are vulnerable to shocks including
deterioration in the external current account deficit, the volume and terms o f future capital
inflows, and a negative export growth shock. Georgia's debt i s considered to be at moderate
risk o f debt distress. The results o f these simulations clearly point to the centrality o f the
effective implementation o f economic reforms and safeguarding macroeconomic stability to
ensure sustained improvement indebt level and composition.


                                   111.THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

A.      The Poverty Situation


25.     Following a similar path o f adjustment o f other transition economies, Georgia's
population has experienced a severe decline in welfare since independence. The transitional
output contraction in Georgia was one o f the most severe in the region-output            contraction


 loThe Debt Sustainability Analysis, completed in August 2005, was prepared by World Bank staff in close
collaboration with the IMF.

                                                    8

between 1989 and 1998 has been estimated at 74.6 percent."               While the economic recovery
has accelerated in the last few years, annual income per capita i s still some 50 percent below
the pre-independence level and the unemployment rate i s at about 15 percent. Similarly,
poverty levels have not improved despite recent rapid economic growth as major economic
restructuring, includingmajor reductions o f surpluslabor, i s underway.

26.     According to the State Department o f Statistics (SDS) estimates, the lowest incidence
o f both overall and extreme poverty was recorded in 1997. l2Since then, there has been
considerable variation from year to year and between urban and rural areas. Urban poverty
has tended to improve after peaking in 1999, owing to the effects o f the Russian financial
crisis, but i s still worse than in 1997. Rural poverty and extreme poverty have tended to
worsen in recent years.       For most o f the period, income and consumption inequality as
measured by the Gini coefficient have remained relatively high, but comparable with other
countries in the region, hovering, according to the SDS estimates, at around 0.35 for
consumption and 0.45 for income.

27.     The SDS poverty estimates indicate that families with unemployed members, rural
families with no land or small lots o f land and with few or no cattle, families with three or
more children, and single parent families with children face a particularly high poverty risk.
Thus, labor market status, asset ownership and household composition appear to be the key
determinants o fhouseholds' economic and social situations.

28.     The World Bank has produced two poverty reports for Georgia in recent years: a
Poverty Assessment (1999) based on end-1997 household survey data; and a Poverty Update
(2002) that covers the period up to year 2000.13 A Programmatic Poverty Assessment i s
currently ongoing. The main findings o f these studies tend to support those o f the SDS
analysis o f poverty. In particular, the most important correlates o f poverty were found to be
employment status and ownership o fproductive assets.

29.     The Bank analysis also finds there are wide regional differences in living standards.
The capital city o f Tbilisi fares better than other regions (rural and other urban areas), while
the highest overall poverty incidence i s observed in secondary Georgian cities. Populations in
small towns are almost twice as likely to be extremely poor, and 56 percent more likely to be
poor than populations in large towns.               The differences in poverty appear even more
pronounced looking across the ten regions in Georgia, with the lower quartile being the
poorest o f all.

Former Soviet Union. Europe and Central Asia Region. Washington, D.C.; and Fischer, Stanley and Sahay, R.,

l2Incidencerates of overall and extremepoverty are estimatedby the State Department of Statistics(SDS) based
on the Household Integrated Survey (introduced in the second half on 1996). In calculating the poverty
measurement indicators, the SDS follows to a large extentunchangedmethodology establishedin 1997. Over the
years various areas were identified for methodological improvements: including valuation of in-kind
consumption; adjustments for regional and seasonal variation in prices; poverty lines estimates, equivalence
scales and size economies estimates. These issues will be addressed within the ongoing Programmatic Poverty
Assessment for Georgia (FY05-07).
l3A poverty assessment based on end-1997 household survey data (Georgia Poverty and Income Distribution,
World Bank Report No. 19348-GE, May 27, 1999), and a poverty update that covers the period up to the year
2000 (Georgia Poverty Update, World Bank Report No. 22350-GE, January 10,2002).

30.      Consistent with the SDS, the Bank's poverty work finds growing poverty inthe period
between 1997 and 2000, due to decreased consumption and increased inequality in its
distribution. The depth and severity o f poverty increased, and the most socially vulnerable
were found to have become poorer and more deprived. Inview o f the fact that the strongest
determinants o f poverty risk in Georgia were economic, then it follows that macroeconomic
stability, faster and higher productivity growth, increased employment, effective social
protection and enhanced human capital are all important to address poverty and vulnerability
inGeorgia.     14



31.      It i s too early to assess the actual effects o f recent economic reforms and their impact
on poverty. Ifmacroeconomic stability is maintained and economic reforms are implemented,
the growth path, however, i s expected to gradually move towards an improved capacity for net
job creation, and hence sustained reductions in poverty. Reforms supported by the proposed
PRSO program aim at providing a solid foundation towards this end.15

B.       The Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy
32.       The previous Government prepared an Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Program (EDPRP) in July 2003 using a broad participatory process involving the
Government, civil society, and the donor community. (see Box 1). The EDPRP document
discusses factors that have led to poverty and was in which the deepening o f reforms and
 structural policies could contribute to reducing poverty in Georgia. The strategic framework of
the EDPRP targets two major objectives: (i) and sustainable economic development,
                                                         rapid
with a target of real GDP growth of 5-8 percent a year; and (ii)reduction inextreme poverty
                                                                              a
 from the current level o f 15 percent to 4-5 percent by 2015, and a reduction in overall poverty
 from 52 percent to 20-25 percent by 2015.

 33.      To meet these two objectives, the Government's reform program identified six main
 areas for action:

        Strengtheninggovernance;

        Improving macro fiscal performance;

        Improving the investment climate and enhancing productivity and employment growth,
        with a sectoral focus on energy, transport and communications, and tourism;

        Buildinghumancapital;

        Reducing the vulnerability o f the poor;


 14 Non-income indicators of poverty in Georgia, inherited from Soviet times, still compare favorably with those
 o f countries with a similar per capita income. The UNDP 2003 Human Development Report ranks Georgia 88"
 among 175 nations. However, Georgia faces a major challenge insustaining these relatively favorable indicators.
 Studies conducted by various international organizations (UNICEF, USAID, EC, etc.) indicate that matemal
 mortality, immunization rates, access to health, safe water and sanitation, and the quality o f social services have
 worsened incomparison with the pre-transition situation.

  o Protectingthe environment.


               Box 1. The Government's Participatory Framework for Policy Design

Georgia's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) approved in June, 2003
was developed in close consultation with all stakeholders, civil society included. After taking office
in January, 2004, the new Government o f Georgia fully embraced the key principles o f the EDPRP.
At the same time, the reform and development vision o f the new Government prompted the need to
reconsider the three-year action plan o f the original EDPRP. As the first step in this direction, the
EDPRP Progress Report was produced to take stock o f the first year achievements and provide
informed inputsto the formulation o fthe development strategy and the respective action plan.

The Progress Report was prepared by an intergovernmental working group and discussed with the
representative's from NGOs, the private sector, and the donor community. This process proved to be
instrumental in generating diverse and comprehensive contributions from all relevant sector ministries
as well as views from the civil society. The final Report was published on the web site o f the
Ministryo fEconomic Development.

Buildingon the findings of this Report, the Government has moved to a stage o f revising the EDPRP.
The process o f developing this new strategic document i s closely coordinated with the Government's
transition to a medium-term expenditure framework to ensure adequate financial support for the
policy priorities proposed by line ministries. The formal arrangements include (i)the development o f
respective policy papers by the individual ministries; (ii) reviews and discussions within the State
Commission established especially for this purpose and comprised o f representatives from all
ministries, members o f the Parliament, and several nongovernmental organizations; (iii)broader
public consultations by individual ministries once draft policy papers are endorsed by the
Commission; and (iv) compilation of these policy papers into a strategic document to be reviewed
internally by the Cabinet and presented for public deliberations. The process as described above i s
already half way through and public consultations on the draft strategic document are expected to be
completed by end-August, 2005. The Government aims to have the document finalized by end-
September, 2005 for input into the 2006 budget.



34.     The EDPRP, as the PRSP i s known in Georgia, provided a broad fi-amework for
poverty reduction but lacked the clear prioritizatiodsequencingneeded inthe face of a limited
resource envelope and Government capacity constraints. While the n e w Government
embraced the EDPRP as its poverty reduction strategy, it prepared the first EDPRP Annual
Progress Report inFebruary 2005 with a view to prioritizingthe new term policy agenda. The
Government i s continuing its efforts to refine its medium-term reform strategy, consolidating
various sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies in a single, coherent document.I6 This document
is expected to serve as a basis for the next round of EDPRP. An important aspect o f the
Government's current strategic thinking i s the introduction of a more results focused approach
to budget preparation inthe context of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).

35.     The EDPRP and the Annual Progress Report contain a credible poverty reduction
program, which correctly emphasizes the need to improve govemance and reduce corruption,


16This document is expected to be completedby end-2005.

as well as the continued involvement o f key stakeholders in the preparation and
implementation o f the EDPRP.17 A Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) together with the
EDPRP Annual Progress Report was sent to the Board on June 1,2005. There remains a need
for further prioritization, and for the sequencing o f poverty reduction strategies as well as the
strengthening o f government's capacity to implement the poverty reduction strategy more
effectively. To address these challenges as well as to ensure the consistency o f policy
reforms, the Government i s developing an overarching strategy in a Medium Term Action
Strategy building on and consolidating the policy reforms o f the EDPRP, the Individual
Partnership Action Plan for joining N A T O (PAP),the EU Neighborhood Policy Paper and
other policy documents. This document i s expected to serve as the basis for the next round o f
the EDPRP.


                       IV.BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

A.       Objectiveand Scope
36.      The objective o f the proposed PRSO i s to support further elaboration and
implementation o f the key elements o f the Government's poverty reduction strategy as
described in the 2003 EDPRP and the 2005 EDPRP Progress Report. For operational
purposes, the PRSO program i s built on four pillars: (i)strengthening public sector
accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)         improving electricity and gas sector services;
(iii)improvingthe environment for private sector development; and(iv) improving social
protection, education and health care services. These are areas in which the Bank has a
comparative advantage insupporting efforts to sustain the reform effort inGeorgia.

         1. Strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency. This
              pillar focuses on improvements in the public sector that cut across public
              expenditure management, fiduciary activities, and public administration. Specific
              policy actions under this component aim at: strengthening budgeting and
              expenditure management; increasing transparency and efficiency in the public
              procurement         and   financial     management         systems;    strengthening      public
              administration and intergovernmental               fiscal relations;    and enhancing the
              transparency and accountability o f the public sector. These improvements are also
              expected to contribute to reducing opportunities for corruption.

         2. Improving electricity and gas sector services. Measures under this pillar focus on
              remedyingthe severe energy sector situation. Lack o f dependable electricity and
              gas sector services i s significantly detrimental to businesses and to job generation,
              especially inthe rural areas, and has a heavy impact on the poorer segments o f the
              population. The Government has developed a medium-term strategy plan which
              outlines the reforms in both sectors. Specifically, reforms are aimed at addressing

Finance and other key ministries are centrally involved inimplementing and further developing the program; (iii)

 governance and reduce corruption; and (v) develop more specific, quantified outcome measures.

            the electricity sector debt, improving payment collections, and diversifylng supply
             sources inthe gas sector.

         3. Improving the environment for private sector development.                       This pillar
             recognizes that the development o f the private sector is critical to sustaining high
             growth and creating employment opportunities for the poor. Policy measures under
             this component focus on reducing the costs to business activity imposed by the
             public sector, including simplifying tax legislation, and streamlining o f the
             regulatory framework.

         4. Improving social protection, education, and health care services. This pillar
             focuses on improving the access, accountability, and affordability o f services inthe
             social sector and social protection for the vulnerable. The Government's reform
             program includes adopting a fiscally sustainable targeted assistance program,
             improving the efficiency and efficacy o f resources in education (by implementinga
             capitation financing model, the systematic testing and monitoring o f results, and
             strengthening quality-enhancing dimensions including educational materials and
             curricula), and adopting a revisedbasic benefits package inhealth.

 37.     In each of these areas, the Government, in collaboration with the Bank and key
 stakeholders, has identifiedthe needed policy decisions and the key actions. Capacity building
 needs have been identified and donor support i s being provided in a coordinated manner. The
 specific policymeasures to be supported bythe PRSO are discussed inSection V, below.

                    Box 2. Anti-Corruptionand GovernanceDimensionsof the PRSO Program

 The PRSO relies on two intertwined dimensions to support the Government's reform strategy to curb
 corruption and improve governance. One dimension focuses on measures to curb corruption at the
 sectoral level. The other focuses on reforms under the national strategy.           In the former, anti-
 corruption and governance measures supported by the PRSO are embedded in each o f the reform
 areas covered inthe program. These include:


 0   InPillar 1: Public expenditure management reforms will improve the budgetary process and the
     efficiency and transparency in the use o f public resources. This Pillar pays particular attention to
     improving the procurement and financial management aspects which in addition to improving
     efficiency and transparency inthe use o f resources will reduce the scope for corruption. Similarly
     reforms inpublic administration, particularly civil service reform, are aimed at curbing corruption
     on the demand side while improving public service delivery. Reforms in intergovernmental fiscal

1    relations will also strengthen these areas at the local level in addition to improving public service
     delivery.


 0   InPillar 2: The reforms are aimed at improving the financial viability and the service of the
     electricity and gas sectors. By improving financial discipline and the institutional framework, the
     reforms will also enhance the governance dimensions inthe sector.


 0   In Pillar 3: The reforms, particularly the modernization and simplification of the regulatory
 `   regime, will improve the environment for private sector development and will also reduce the
     scope for corruption on both the demand and the supply side.



                                                     13

    In Pillar 4: The reforms will improve social protection, education, and health care services.
    Important anti-corruption and governance dimensions are embedded in the reforms in each o f
    these areas. For example, in education, the adoption o f monitorable examinations will not only
    improve the quality o f outcomes in education but will also substantially reduce the corrupt
    practices o f the past that were related to grading and professional degrees.

A second dimension o f the PRSO i s support o f the Government's National Anti-Corruption Strategy
and its implementationin subsequent PRSOs. The strategy will provide a systematic approach to curb
corruption at the national level and hence it i s an essential complement o f anti-corruption and
governance reforms embedded at the sectoral level. The strategy includes such measures as
strengthening the control bodies in the three branches o f government, as well as establishing a strong
monitoring system for tracking progress in addressing corruption. This monitoring system will
include: the clear provision o f information to citizens about services; the introduction o f survey-based
monitoring; the strengthening o f feedback or "voice" mechanisms for citizens; and the publication o f
an annual report documenting progress inaddressing corruption.

In addition, the strong linkages and synergies between the PRSO and investment operations
substantially enhance implementation capacity in order to improve service delivery and to achieve the
desired results in anti-corruption and governance reform. For example, the reforms o f Pillar 1 o f the
PRSO will be supported by a Public Sector Reform Project currently under preparation. In energy,
there are two active projects: the Energy Transit Institution Building and the Electricity Market
Support Project.      Similarly, the PRSO reforms in education are closely linked to the ongoing
education project and the education APL planned for FY06. As discussed in the new Country
Partnership Strategy, other areas o f the PRSO program have similar linkages with investment
operations including health care, intergovernmental finances, and social protection.



38.      As described in the Letter o f Development Policy (see Annex 1) the growth and
poverty reduction strategy o f the Government focuses sharply on measures to curb corruption
and improve governance and public service delivery, while improving the policy framework
for private sector-led growth. In this context, the anti-corruption and governance strategy o f
PRSOprogramhas two intertwineddimensions (see Box 2).

39.      First, inaddition to measures to improve public service delivery inthe sectors covered
in the program, anti-corruption and governance measures are embedded in all the areas o f
reform supported by the PRSO program. Second, the program supports the implementation o f
the Government's National Anti-Corruption Strategy adopted under the first PRSO.                        In
addition, the new Country Partnership Strategy emphasizes the close links between the PRSO
and investment operations that serve to strengthenimplementation capacity inthe key areas o f
the program. This approach aims at optimizing the results on the ground by complementing
policy reform with the necessary investmentto build capacity.

B.       Phasingof the Reforms


40.      The initial phases o f the reform, directed towards implementing the new
Government's refom program were supported under the 2004 Reform Support Credit (RSC).
The RSC was designed to support the Government's first phase o f efforts to improve
governance and restart the economic reform process.                The RSC aimed at preparing the
groundwork for a policy framework which would be followed by the annual PRSOs (see Box

                                                     14

 3). Inview o f the varying degrees o f progress already achieved under the RSC, a number o f
 the measures taken under the first PRSO support strategy/policy formulation and action plans.
 The second and third PRSOs would shift focus progressively towards implementation. The
 latter operations are envisaged as concentrating more on broader public sector reforms
 (including public administration and inter-governmental finances) and private sector
 development as well as intensifying the reforms in the social sectors. These measures are
 built around the Government's development strategy and reform program as elaborated inthe
 attached Letter o f Development Policy (Annex 1).

 The Reform Support Credit on the amount o f SDR 16.6 million (equivalent to US$24 million) was approved in
 June 2004. The World Bank staffprepared the Implementation Completion Report of the RSC ofGeorgia (June,
 2005; Report No. 32781-GE).       The RSC supported actions to: (i)        improve govemanceianti-corruption; (ii)
 strengthen management o f public finances; and (iii)      address immediate issues in the energy sector. The RSC
 succeeded in providing momentum for a more systematic approach to the Government's reform program. The
 reform measures supportedby RSC included,

         Submitted to IDA a report on the Government's actions taken to date regarding anti-corruption,
         including the identification o f the mandates o f core agencies, their roles and strategies and identification
         o f overlaps and gaps.
         Designated an administrative agency with the responsibility o f oversight and implementation o f the civil

          consignment to travel inconvoy (except for vehicles that are unsecured).
          Submitted a time-bound action plan for electricity satisfactory to IDA and adopted a legislation to
          address the insolvency o f electricity utilities.
     0   Upgraded the information systems, through implementation o f the ASYCUDA system (except for
         Adjara) to harmonize procedures and reduce the scope o f personal interface between customs officials
          and traders, which sometimes results inillegal practices.
         Adopted a new Law on Structure, Functions and Responsibilities o f the Government providing for the
         reduction o f a number o f line ministries as well as the consolidation o f a large number o f previously
          semi-independent state departments within the respective ministries.
          Adopted amendments to the Administrative Violations Code to make procurement fraud punishable.




 41.      The specific policy actions and outcomes envisaged under the PRSO series are shown
 inthe Operations Policy Matrix, attached inAnnex 2. This Matrix, which has been prepared
 jointly with the Government and in consultation with the key donors, was reviewed and
 updated during the appraisal o f the operation. The Matrix includes a set o f outcome and
 monitoring indicators that will help to gauge reform progress. Table 3 summarizes prior
 actions for the Boardpresentation o fthe first PRSO and the proposed triggers for PRSO I1and

C.      Linkages to the Country Partnership Strategy and Other Bank Tasks


42.     Link to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).                '* The proposed PRSO operations
form the backbone o f the new CPS lending program (FY06-09). The new CPS i s being
discussed by the Board together with the proposed PRSO program. The following three
overarching objectives constitute the centerpiece of this CPS: (i)           enabling income-generating
and employment-generating growth; (ii)               human development and social protection; and (iii)
improving efficiency in public services.                 These represent the priorities identified in the
EDPRPand its Annual Progress Report.

43.     The proposed PRSO i s a cross-cutting program covering essential sectors, and i s hence
the central component o f the CPS. As discussed in the CPS, the strategy i s highly selective
and leverages the reforms supported by the PRSO and those financed by investments in
essential infrastructure and service delivery.                Therefore, the PRSO program serves as a
backbone to the new CPS, particularly in public sector reform, energy, and the social sectors
(health care, education, and social protection). As the PRSO reform program i s implemented,
it is expected that Georgia's growth path will gradually move towards an improved capacity
for netjob creation, and hence to a sustained reduction inpoverty.

44.     Link to AAA (see Table 4). The reforms proposed for PRSO support are based on
extensive Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) by the Bank, including a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003; a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in
2002; a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in 2003; an Integrated Trade
Development Study (2003); and an Assessment of Administrative Procedures for Doing
Business (2004).          Preliminary analytical work for the ongoing Programmatic Public
Expenditure Review and the Programmatic Poverty Assessment (FY05-07) has provided
additional analytical underpinnings for the PRSO.                    A Country Economic Memorandum,
which focuses on growth andjobs, i s planned for FY06.

45.     Link to Other Bank Operations (see Table 4). A Public Sector Management Reform
Project i s under preparation to assist the Government in addressing the capacity constraints o f
public sector agencies and to improve the management o f its human resources.                      In the
education sector, reforms support and strengthen the Government's program under the
Education Strengtheningand Realignment Project, emphasizing the need for accountability in
service delivery and providing information to enable the system to monitor educational
outcomes for the poorest.

46.     The PRSO does not cover all areas o f Bank assistance to the Government's reform
program (EDPRP).             Other Bank activities, as discussed in the CPS, complement the
Government's ongoing and planned reforms. For example, reforms in the energy sector are
being supported by the Electricity Market Support Project and its Supplemental Credit.
Similarly, the strengthening o f local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations i s
being supported by the Second Municipal Development and Decentralization Project. Bank

'* A Country Assistance Strategy for FY04-06was distributed to the Board inNovember 2003. However, inview
of the "Rose Revolution" and resulting political changes, it was withdrawn from the Board agenda to allow
revisionsto better reflect the assistance priorities of the new Government.

 operations also support other aspects o f the social sectors and complement the reform

D.       Collaborationwith the IMFandOther Donors
47.      The Government gives high priority to maintaining macroeconomic stability, which
i s central to the growth and poverty reduction programs. To that end, the Government agreed
with the IMF on a three-year PRGF program approved in June 2004. The IMF completed its
second review o f the PRGF program inJuly 2005 and its Board approved the disbursement o f
US$20.2 million. The PRGF program supports reforms that include measures to improve tax
administration, to strengthen banking supervision, and to liberalize foreign trade."                The key
economic issue discussed during the second review was how to deal with the macroeconomic
consequences o f sizable capital inflows including foreign direct investment flows and
privatization receipts. Given the recent upsurge in inflation, the anticipated widening o f the
extemal current account deficit and the uncertainty in the timing and magnitude o f
privatization proceeds, fiscal policy should be cautious/conservative, monetary policy tight,
and the exchange rate flexible.

48.      The PRSO program is being closely coordinated with the IMF PRGF (see Annex 3).
The division o f labor and the areas o f shared responsibilities are described in detail in the
IMF-World Bank Relations Annex. The teams from both institutions are working closely
together while on missions and are meeting periodically. The objective i s to ensure the
consistency o f the macroeconomic and structural policyreforms inthe two programs.

49.      The work on the PRSO is also beingclosely coordinated with the activities o fthe other
donors who are actively contributing to the financing o f the Government's program in
Georgia. These donors include: the European Commission (intergoverrimental fiscal relations,
extemal audit, administrative reform); USAID (budget/treasury management, governance,
anti-corruption, private sector development, energy, education); UNDP (administrative/civil
service reform, poverty monitoring); DFID (MTEF, health sector budget management); EBRD
(investment promotion, energy); the Netherlands; and KfW (energy). The PRSO work is also
beingcoordinated closely with the private sector (Georgian Business Confederation, Chamber
o f Commerce, Association o f Georgian Exporters, and others) and with NGOs (including the

Foundation).

E.       LessonsLearned


50.      The formulation o f the PRSO program will draw on the lessons learned from the IDA
support to the reform process in Georgia. Following Independence, the country undertook
initial reforms with some success in state enterprise privatization, trade liberalization and the
establishment o f a basic legal framework. Several Bank operations inthe 1990s supported this
reform process, including two structural adjustment credits. Over time, however, political and
governance issues emerged as overriding problems. The country suffered increasingly from
deterioration in governance, fragmentation o f power, dominance o f interest groups and
pervasive corruption.    As a result, progress in reform implementation was sporadic and
achievements were often undermined.

51.      The recent Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the RSC also highlightedthe
importance o f a committed government with a clearly defined and owned poverty reduction
strategy as the foundation for a successful medium term reform program. In addition, the
Government's institutional and implementation capacity, and a well-coordinated effort among
donors in terms o f both advice and TA activities, i s essential to the design and success o f the
PRSO program. The proposed operation also reflects the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) review (forthcoming) o f the RSC, which underscores the importance o f clear design o f
the PRSOs and the development o f monitorable and measurable indicators in establishing
impact and determining the effectiveness o f Bank assistance.

52.      Thus, the success o f a policy-based operation in Georgia depends basically on two
main factors. First, the operation needs to be well defined and focused on priority issues
where the medium-termstrategy i s well understood and accepted bythe Government. Second,
any reform program must be grounded in a realistic assessment o f the Government's
implementation capacity. These two factors call for a well-focused and sequenced program,
amply supported by well-coordinated donor technical assistance. The need to increase the
Government's implementation capacity and to leverage Bank resources through other donors
are critical elements inthe design o f the Bank's future assistanceprogram inGeorgia.

              V. THE PROPOSEDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION

A.       Pillar 1:StrengtheningPublicSector Accountability, Efficiency,and
Transparency


Current Situation and the Key Issues

53.      Public expenditure management has been identified by the Government as an area in
need o f reform. Reforms are needed to improve budgetary resource allocation and to establish
a stronger link between budgetary allocations and Government objectives. The Government
has made substantial progress in establishing the basic elements o f public expenditure



                                               21

management institutions inGeorgia.20 With support from the RSC, the Government prepared
an action plan for implementing reforms inthe Budget Systems Law (BSL). The Government
has followed this with an aggressive MTEF reform and an associated Ministry o f Finance
reform strategy. The reform approach aims to ensure the effective functioning o f the public
expenditure management system and the budget formulation process21in dealing with well-
known problems, including: (i) lack of strategic planning in the budget process, which
                                      the
constrains the implementation o f key reforms and limits links between expenditures and
national and sector objectives and policies; (ii)      weaknesses in budget execution resulting from
weak cash-flow management, which causes spending outturns to deviate markedly from the
budget plan; (iii) tax administration, which contributes to unstable tax policies and
                     weak
inadequate revenue mobilization; and, (iv) ineffective sector 'expenditures due to poor
budgetary allocation, which has resulted in inadequate spending in areas that would mostly
benefit the poor such as health, education and social protection.

54.     Enhancing public sector accountability and improving governance would require a
transparent    and efficient fiduciary framework             (public  procurement and financial
management). Inthe area o fpublic procurement the Government has undertaken initial steps
to enhance transparency and efficiency, following the recommendations o f the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and with the support from the RSC. A new State
Procurement Law (SPL) was approved on April 20, 2005, and comes into effect as o f January
1, 2006. The Government launched the State Procurement Agency (SPA) website which has
made some progress by providing broader dissemination o f information about procurement
practices by including forthcoming biddingopportunities, contract award announcements, and
a registry o f providers o f goods, works and services. Supported by the RSC, the Government
adopted amendments to the Administrative Violations Code to make procurement fraud
punishable, and the number o f procuring entities was reduced from 8,000 to 3,000. However,
the Government needs to continue with further reforms to the legislative framework focusing
on implementation regulations and standard bidding documents and on the development o f a
national training strategy. Also, the SPA which was established in March 2001, needs to be
further strengthenedto ensure its autonomous and independent functioning.

55.     Public JinanciaZ management has been an area o f considerable challenge in Georgia.
The Chamber o f Control (CoC) had a poor reputation under the previous Government and was
closed for a prolonged period after the Rose Revolution. It has since re-opened. Re-
establishment o f the Chamber o f Control (CoC) has been an important step in the control o f
fraud and corruption, particularly in the absence o f an effective internal audit mechanism.
However, organizational reform and capacity building are requiredto make the CoC function
as an external auditor using International Organization o f Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI) standards.

56.     At present, the CoC mandate is a mixture of internal and external auditing functions.
Georgia needs to develop a comprehensive system o f internal audit and controls which will


2o This includes a legal framework and procedures for budget management, a basic framework for inter-
governmental finance relations, and a Treasury system.
21 For details of the issues in public expenditure management, see World Bank, 2002, Georgia Public
Expenditure Review, ECSPE, Europe and Central Asia Region.


                                                      22

allow the CoC to adopt a more focused external audit mandate. Beyond external audits,
Georgia has also faced significant problems relating to extrabudgetary revenues and
expenditures, which are manifested in weak budget execution and in deviation between
formulated and executed budgets. To improve budget execution, the Government has made
some progress towards integrating all funds into the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and
developing a more reliable financial reporting approach. There are questions about future
reforms to business processes associated with the Treasury (accounting and cash management,
for example) and there i s a need for a more efficient financial reporting system to match the
MTEF initiative. There are also questions about how to ensure fiscal accountability inLegal
Entities o f Public Law (LEPLs), quasi-public entities that have been created with a view to
improving the service orientation inthe Government. The Government has taken first steps to
address these challenges by developing a draft accounting reform strategy and proposing new
legislation for LEPLs, and will seek to develop a registry and database o f LEPLs in the
coming years.

57.      Strengthening of intergovernmental fiscal relations should constitute part o f the
broader public expenditure management reform. Intergovernmental fiscal relations currently
suffer from: (i)a highly fragmented administrative structure and weak implementation
capacity; (ii)  an excessive vertical hierarchy o f command with allegiance to the center which
undermines accountability; (iii)unclear assignment o f functional responsibilities and
resources (particularly between the rayon and the self-government authorities), which i s still
made on the basis o f ad hoc negotiations; (iv) increasing disparities in spending and revenue
capacities without proper compensatory transfer mechanisms; (v) unstable rights to public
assets and lack o f access to capital markets; and (vi) lack of legislation on local self-
government budgets and on fiscal equalization.                  As a result, unfunded mandates have
proliferated and there i s no uniformity among the local government budgets. The local
budgets lack predictability, and their fiscal reporting system is faulty. This situation had a
negative impact on the fiscal autonomy, transparency and accountability o f local
governance.22

58.      Strengthening public administration is necessary for effectively implementing public
policies and improving service delivery. The Bank has already supported the Government in
initiating a reform o f the public administration through the RSC. Inline with its commitment
under the RSC, the Government amended the Civil Service Law to establish the Public
Service Council and the Public Service Bureau.                23However, progress since then has been
mixed and recently the Government has acknowledged that the decentralized approach to civil
service reform, in which each ministry follows its own path, has been less than effective.24
With the establishment of the Government Commission on Reform, the Government is taking


22In 2004, the Government established a State Commission for Effective Govemance and Territorial Reform,
which i s chaired by the President. The mandate o f the Commission i s to review the legislative basis required for
the consolidation o f local self-governments, propose a remapping the territorial-administrative structure,
formulate an intergovemmental fiscal relations strategy, and implement an effective local governance system.
23 Decrees were also issued to define the specific tasks and responsibilities o f these new structures. The
regulation for the Public Service Council called for the chairing o f the Council by the President, so that it could
effectively implement its mandate. Appointments have been made to the Council and for the position o f the
Head o f the Bureau.     Draft proposals are being developed to address the shortcomings o f civil servants'
compensation system.

the necessary steps to formulate a more cohesive and fundamental approach to reforms o f the
public sector. Inan iterative process involving the ministries, the Commission i s reviewing
functions, organization structures and public sector human resource management practices.
After discussion andapproval bythe Cabinet, this will form the foundation for a medium-term
action strategy. In the meantime, the Government will start with the development o f
instruments that will help implement such a strategy, such as the Personnel Management
Database and a functional review methodology.

59.    The Government has consistently emphasized that public sector accounfability and
anti-corruption are the focal points o f its reform agenda and has also conveyed to the public
and the international community its intent to establish efficient and effective governance
systems and processes.      In this regard, and with support from the RSC operation, the
Government prepared a report on its anti-corruption actions including the identification o f
mandates o f its core agencies, and their roles and strategies. Furthermore, a working group
was created that included representatives from the Anti-Corruption Policy Department
(ACPD) and members o f the civil society to initiate discussion with other departments for a
coordinated government strategy on anti-corruption.

60.     The Government has focused its anti-comption agenda on makinghigh-profile arrests
and prosecutions and promoting ministry-specific administrative reorganization, downsizing
and reform. This approach gives individual Ministers discretion about how to eradicate
corruption and reform the administration, locating responsibility for reform in the ministries.
The action orientation o f this approach is highly commended, with various ministries already
developing and implementing focused reforms intended to curb corruption and enhance
service provision. However, coordination o f these activities i s poor, progress i s not being
monitored, and there are concerns about reform sustainability. Given these concerns, it i s
unclear whether reforms are addressing major issues, including well documented problems
with corruption at the point o f service delivery, which burdens the poor and emerging
business. There i s a need to clarify, formalize and monitor anti-corruption and administrative
reform activities to enhance transparency and due process and to ensure confidence in the
governance system. Recent moves to tackle corruption in the traffic police are particularly
noteworthy in this regard, as are steps to provide amnesty for past corrupt activities. The
Government has prepared and adopted an Anti-corruption Strategy and i s currently preparing
operational guidelines for its implementation. The Government i s adopting a more systematic
approach which needs to focus more on prevention measures and mitigating opportunities for
corruption.

Government Reform Program

61.     Well functioning and efficient public institutions are essential to the effective use o f
public resources and the achievement o f poverty reduction objectives. The key medium-term
objective o f the Government program i s to establish strong, efficient, and accountable public
sector institutions that perform their functions in a transparent way. The EDPRP and the
Annual Progress Report have noted many weaknesses in Georgia's public sector management
and have identifiedthe priority areas for enhancing public sector accountability and efficiency.
The recent Bank work inthe PER, CPAR, and the CFAA have also confirmed those findings.



                                                24

62.     To enhance accountability, efficiency, and transparency in the public sector, the
Government program under the PRSO focuses on the following areas:

    (1-i)      Strengthening public budgeting and expenditure management
    (1-ii) Enhancingtransparency and efficiency inthe public procurement system
    (1-iii) Improvingthe transparency andeffectiveness o fpublic financial management
    (1-iv)     Strengthening local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations
    ((1-vi)
      1-VI     Strengthening public administration
               Enhancingpublic sector transparency and accountability.

63.     (1-i) To strengthenpublic budgeting and expenditure management, the Government
intends to deepen the measures undertaken thus far in the MTEF reform and to improve the
policy orientation o f the budgetpreparation process. Underthe first PRSO,

               The Government made satisfactory progress inimproving the policy content o f
               annual budget preparation (in the 2006 preparation process), including better
               linking o fthe new MTEFto the budget cycle


            0  The Government developed and started implementing an MTEF reform


            0  The Government initiated the implementation o f MTEF business processes in
               pilot ministries.

64.     To improve the policy content o f the annual budget preparation and to improve the
links to the new MTEF, the Government carried out the following:


            0  It incorporated pre-budget preparation planning information from pilot
               ministries (including Health and Education) into its Basic Data and Directions
               document (a pre-budget document) showing the policy focus o f these entities.


            0  It introduced budget ceilings formally into the budget process, through the
               budget instructions, which give users a defined envelope in which to develop
               their budget submissions,        requiring more     strategic  and disciplined
                consideration o frequests.


            0  It improved the structure o f the budget instructions, with an aim to improving
               the link between submissions and policy. (Budget users are now required to
                show requests for 2006-09 (matching budgetrequests with policytime-frames),
               to provide more textual information on their requests, and to continue
                developing a basic programmatic approach intheir requests.)

65.     Policy actions under subsequent PRSOs maintain the focus on improved roll-out o f the
MTEF and budget preparation. Specific policy actions under PRSO I1and PRSO 111relate to
continued development o f a policy orientation in budgets, an expansion o f the number o f
ministries developing strategic plans and incorporating objectives into the Basic Data and
Directions and the annual budget request, an improved policy orientation for budget ceilings,



                                               25

and strengthening o f budget circulars to entrench the multi-year orientation o f the strategic
focus.

66.     (1-ii) To enhance transparency and efficiency in thepublicprocurement system, the
PRSO program supports the implementation o f the Country Procurement Assessment Review
as agreed with the Government. For this purpose, duringthe first PRSO:


    0   The SPA has finalized its Annual Procurement Report for 2004 (as approved by the
        Supervisory Council) and posted it on the SPA website, making information available
        on procurement procedures in the sectors including, inter alia, indicators o f
        procurement efficiency and transparency, weaknesses in procurement processes,
        measures to improve weaknesses, and modalities for monitoring progress.


    0   The SPA has included procurement data and information on its website concerning
        advertisements o f forthcoming bidding opportunities, announcements regarding
        contract awards and decisions on administrative reviews pertaining to procurement-
        related disputes. An updated registry of providers o f goods, works and services i s
        complete and publicly available.


    0   The Government has amended the Law on State Procurement to extendits coverage to
        State-Owned Enterprises (SOES).~~

67.     These measures will be followed by others during the PRSO I1and PRSO I11to further
increase the transparency o f the procurement process. These include: the establishment o f
performance indicators; the preparation o f implementation regulations on confidential
procurement items; procedures for blacklisting companies and individuals found in violation,
fraud and corruption; web publications o f the blacklist and procurement audit findings; and
updates to the CPAR Action Plan.

68.     (1-iii) To improve transparency and effectiveness in public financial management,
the Government, with the support o f the PRSO program, has developed a three-pronged
strategy. First, the PRSO agenda will strengthen the role and fbnctionality o f the Chamber o f
Control (CoC), buildingon technical assistance from TACIS, GTZ and DFID, to establish the
CoC as a modem Supreme Audit Institution.26 During the program (particularly in PRSO I1
and 111), the CoC will finalize and begin implementingits reorganization plan, including the
identification o f performance indicators to measure progress. In line with this program, under
the FirstPRSO:

    0   The Chamber o f Control re-opened and resumed its auditing function, publishingall
        ccompletedaudit results for the first halfo f 2005 on its website.



*'The new draft law submitted to the Parliament included provisions on its application to SOEs, however, the
law does not specify that in order to bid on a contract, an SOE should be financially and legally autonomous,
should operate on a commercial basis, and should be independent of the procuring entity.
26The DfID i s also providing TA to support TACIS and GTZ recommendations that would be acceptable to the
Government and the donor community and which would attract donor support for the necessary activities.

                                                      26

69.      Second, the PRSO agenda will promote the Government's intent to further reform
Treasury operations and introduce intemational accounting standard^.^'                     This will initially
involve supporting requirements for monthly cash and commitment reporting through the
Treasury. During PRSO I1and PRSO 111, the Government will complete the implementation
o f the Treasury Single Account and expand the coverage o f the Treasury's budget execution
cash reporting systems and rules to a number o f local governments. Also, during the PRSO
program, the Government, in consultation with the IMF, intends to address the remaining
budget execution and financial reporting issues. The proposed Bank/DFID-financed Public
Sector Reform project will provide further resources to implementthe Treasury reform. Under
the first PRSO:

         The Treasury has producedmonthly central government cash and commitment reports
         as requiredby the Budget Systems Law.
     0   The Treasury has closed all zero-balance revenue transit accounts at the National Bank
         o f Georgia.

70.      Third, the Government will ensure that financial accountability mechanisms are
established in all public and quasi-public entities during the PRSO program. This will be
achieved by clarifying the status o f public and quasi-public entities (specifically, the criteria
according to which LEPLs may be distinguished from public entities and SOEs), developing a
register and database o f LEPLs to confirm their authenticity, and introducing financial
reporting requirements that incorporate LEPLs into the overall public financial management
framework. These steps will also be implementedinPRSO I1and PRSO 111.

71.      (1-iv) To strengthen local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations, the
Government program calls for the continuation o f the reform measures already initiated. The
Government has initiated reforms in intergovernmental fiscal relations by adopting a new Tax
Code, which, among other things, introduces changes inthe revenue assignments to rayon and
local self-governments, including the replacement o f all current local taxes for national
shared-taxes (transfers from the center): rayons are receiving a 100 percent share o f the
personal income tax and the corporate profit tax, while local self-governments are receiving a
100 percent share o f the property tax. Under the first PRSO, the State Commission
completed a consolidated analytical study to support the design o f its reformprogram, entitled
Strategy for Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The Government believes that this initial
step i s essential to start the process o f improving public service delivery in Georgia. Actions
under PRSO I1 and PRSO I11 will support a phased reform process to steadily improve
intergovernmental fiscal relations.

72.      (1-v) To strengthen public administration, the Government's program under the
PRSO includes the consolidation o f the reform measures implemented under the RSC. The
PRSO will primarily support the Government in developing a new governance program
(prepared by the Government Commission on State Reforms) and the instruments for


27Inrecent years, there hasbeenconsiderable progressinstrengtheningthe Treasury's systems. Commitment
control was significantly improved in2004 and has been fully applied to ministries and other central government
agencies. Since January 2005, the systemhas been expanded to cover current state special funds: the united
social security funds and the road fund. Also, the MOF has introduced a fully operative treasury single revenue
account (TSRA).

                                                      27

implementingthat program (including functional reviews and PMD). The PRSOprogram also
supports establishing a Personnel Management Database (PMD), which will provide the
Government with better knowledge of human resources staffing and the match between
humanresources and strategic objectives.28 Under the first PRSO:


    0    The Ministry o f Justice completed its functional review (with EU support) and
         provided an action plan for reorganization.

    0    The Government produced a report on public administratiodcivil service reforms
         undertaken inall ministries since January 200429which i s beingused as an input to the
         drafting o f a policy paper with options for the institutional restructuring o f
         Government entities and public services, and which clarifies reform implementation
         responsibilities and monitoring indicators.
73.      These actions will be further complemented under PRSO I1 and PRSO I11 with
identifying areas for a multi-year civil service reform program (completing the PMD), and for
the implementation o f reforms in key areas o f pay and incentive system. The Public Sector
Management Reform Project, under preparation, i s designed to help the Government address
civil service and public administration issues that are likely to arise under PRSO I1and PRSO
111.

74.      (1-vQTo enhance public sector transparency and accountability and to consolidate
the anti-corruption efforts being undertaken in individual ministries, the Government has
created a central entity responsible for coordinating and monitoring government-wide anti-
corruption activities. The Anti-Corruption Policy Department (ACPD) has prepared a list o f
all anti-corruption activities being pursued across the government.                        Subsequently, the
President has created an Anti-Conuption Working Group that includes the ACPD and other
government officials and civil society members. Duringthe first PRSO, the Government has
also taken the following steps:


     0   It has developed and adopted aNational Anti-Corruption Strategy.
         It has adopted a plan for broad-based anti-corruption monitoring through public
         official and user surveys (to be conducted inearly 2006).
         It has initiated baseline surveys for point o f service corruption, beginning with the
         education sector.
     0   It has re-organized and re-staffed the traffic police function (traditionally a very
         corrupt function).

75.      The Government will continue to strengthen the ACPD and to expand the monitoring
o f corruption under the PRSO program. A broad survey o f public officials and service users
will take place inPRSO I1based on a survey instrument agreed with the civil society. Schools
in Tbilisi are targeted for the initial monitoring actions under PRSO 11. The subsequent
PRSOs, Le. PRSO I1and PRSO 111, would expand this coverage. The ultimate goal o f the

'*Thisrequirement   is particularly important in Georgia, where there are many questions about staff capacity and
efficiency.

program i s to empower users and to motivate officials to improve their performance and
reduce corrupt activities. The program will enhance the transparency o f the Government's
performance in reducing corruption (across Government and in specific areas), stimulating
accountability for the results o f and incentives for effective and aggressive reform. The
technical assistance needs under the PRSO program will be provided through the Public
Sector Management Reform Project currently under preparation.

Outcome and Monitoring Indicators

76.      Under the first PRSO, the program has identified a set o f outcome and monitoring
indicators to gauge progress inthe reforms and their results. 30 These include,:

         Clear national expenditure priorities will be identified and allocations to national
         priorities defendedinthe budget.

         Lower deviations should exist between actual and budgeted expenditure (reflecting
         acceptable international levels).

         Fiscal forecasts should be prepared for at least three years on a rolling annual basis,
         with clear links between multi-year estimates and annual budget ceilings and
         explanations for any differences.

         Sector strategies should be prepared for an increasing number o f budget agencies,
         which are fully costed and are consistent with the cost indicators infiscal forecasts.

         All major investmentsshouldbe included inthe MTEF.

         Increased numbers of contracts above the threshold should be awarded on the basis o f
         open competition (exceeding 75 percent), with justification for the use o f "less
         competitive" methods inaccordance with clear regulatory requirements.

         Improved transparency should be achieved in the public procurement process
         demonstrated through the increased public availability o f keyprocurement information
         (including via website).

         There should be improvement in the scope, nature, legislative scrutiny and follow up
         o f extemal audits, with all central government entities audited using (primarily)
         compliance audits (which adhere to auditing standards), and with audit reports
         submitted to the legislature within eight months o f the end o f the period covered and
         with the formal response made inatimelymanner.

         All major public entities will submit fiscal reports including audited accounts to
         central governments at least annually, and the central government will consolidate
         overall fiscal risk issues into a report.


30Many of these relate to `A' or `B' measures on the indicators of Public Financial Management developed by
the multi-donor Public Expenditure and FinancialAccountability group (PEFA)

                                                    29

        Routine data collection or accounting systems will provide reliable information on
        resources received incash and inkind, and expenditures inLEPLs.

        A consolidated government statement will be prepared annually providing near-
        complete information on revenue, expenditure andbank account balances.

        State and local self-government budgets will show explicit transfers reflecting new
        legislation and formulas.

        Local self-government budgets (planned and executed) will be published inthe local/
        regional media with the uniform classification o f accounts in accordance with the
        Budget SystemLaw.

        Payroll and nominal roll data will cover all o f Government and will be directly linked,
        with monthly reconciliationand updates andreports on adjustments.

        All civil service employees receive salary payments on time in accordance with their
        employment contracts.

        An annual payroll audit report will be publishedand submittedto Parliament together
        with the annual CoC report, showing control weaknesses and the number o f ghost
        workers.

        There will have been a decline in the incidence o f bribery attempts by public officials
        across Government (measured against the 2003 and 2004 GORBI survey)

        The ACPD monitoring role will be strengthenedand an annual monitoring report will
        be published.

        Pillar 2: ImprovingElectricity and Gas Sector Services


The Current Situation and the Key Issues

77.     Georgian consumers do not receive electricity and natural gas at acceptable service
levels. In part due to non-payments, to energy theft, and possibly to remaining corruption in
the energy sector, the financial flows from consumers to the sector are inadequate to support
twenty-four hours' supply outside o f Tbilisi. Many years o f neglect o f maintenance and lack
o f investmentshave caused the infrastructure to crumble, resulting in excessive interruptions
inservice. Over the next five to seven years, investments on the order o fUS$350 million are
requiredinthe power sector. Inthe gas sector, the investmentrequirements are also massive,
with a short-term need for about US$40 million for the most essential first-phase repair o f the
gas transmission system.

78.     The Government has taken several steps to begin addressing the severe energy
situation: (i)in June 2004, legislation was passed that allows energy entities to seek


                                              30

 bankruptcy protection from creditors during an 18 months period while the insolvency issues
 are resolved31; (ii)   with support from KfW, the Government has developed a mechanism for
 debt resolution with the objective o f removing excessive debt from the power sector and to
 establishing the conditions for solvent operations going forward; (iii)        the energy regulatory
 commission (GNERC) revoked more than 20 small, counterproductive power distribution
 licenses during 2004; and (iv) an international management contract for the dominant power
 distribution utility outside Tbilisi, UEDC, was extended by two years to late fall 2006.
 UEDC's payment collections are gradually improving, and UEDC and the transmission
 company GSE took first steps towards improving their cost structures in2004. Nevertheless,
 payment for transmission services and domestic hydropower was only 20-25 percent o f
 invoiced costs during the winter 2004-05, as the available funds in the sector in large part
 were used to finance imports o f electricity and fuel for a thermal power plant. InJune 2004,
 new funds for the energy sector were under preparation by international financial institutions
 (IFIs)/donors at an aggregate o f US$61 million.           Since then, about US$12 million has
 materializedinprojects, and grants and credits worth US$lOO million are under preparation or
 negotiation, mostly from the MillenniumChallenge Corporation and KfW.

 The Government Reform Program

 79.      The Government recognizes that the solution to the difficult energy situation i s an
 improved performance by the sector entities, improved cash flows to the sector, and the
 provision o f more investment funds to reduce the risk o f systemic collapse (power and gas
 sectors). International contractors currently manage the Georgian power transmission system
 (GSE), a "wholesale electricity market" clearinghouse (GWEM), and the power distributor
 UEDC. The Government assists the sector entities' operations by means o f the state budget
. support, by the attraction o f funds to the sector from donors/IFIs, and by its campaign against
 corruption. Privatization proceeds will be channeled to the energy sector-in               the amended
 2005 state budget, 195 million GEL has been allocated as compared to 77 million GEL in
 2004. It appears that tariff increases will benecessary inparts o f the power system.

  80.     The Government sees the privatization o f several energy companies, particularly in
 power generation and distribution, as part o f the solution to the problems o f the energy sector,
  and has targeted privatization for the fall o f 2006. It i s also contemplating some restructuring
  o f the power sector with the aim o f attracting investors, and i s conducting a dialogue with the
 Bank and other donors/IFIs on the issues.

  81.     To improve electricity and gas services, the Government program under the first
  PRSO is concentrating on the following areas: (i)debt resolution process; (ii)payment
  collection; (iii)   energy sector action plan; (iv) asset reassignments; (v) public relations; (vi)
 the gas sector. The subsequent PRSOs would follow on the reform measures under the PRSO
  Iandwouldexpandthecoveragetotariffsandthepowersectorstructureandsystems.The
  Government has decided to base interaction between sector entities on bilateral contracts and
  to replace the current Georgian Wholesale Electricity Market (GWEM) with a balancing
 market and settlement functions.         This will require careful analysis and implementation.
 Further, the Government needs to ensure that the introduction o f a modern dispatch system for


  31State-owned power companies UEDC (distribution) and GSE (transmission) and other entities have obtained
  such legal protection.

                                                   31

the power sector progresses according to schedule (finalized by early 2008), since such a
system i s essential for the efficient technical operation and transparency o f transmission
system operations.

82.      ( 2 4 To deal with the energy sector, the Government has developed an action plan.
The Government plans to have a holistic approach to the issues in the energy sector, and a
medium-term action plan developed under the 2004 Reform Support Credit was a positive
step inthat direction. The Government program calls for further development o f this decision
tool by means o f an updated Medium-TermStrategic Action Plan for the energy sector. The
plan addresses issues o f sector policy; legislative measures and regulation; privatization; the
financing o f investments, energy supply and operations; the financial viability o f sector
entities; financial flows between state and sector (taxes versus. near term state budget
support); service targets and public communication. Although the principles behind gas and
electricity tariffs in Georgia are generally sound, international consultants currently under
mobilization will assist the energy regulatory commission (GNERC) in developing tariff
methodologies that are even better adapted to the Georgian circumstances, while at the same
timereflectingbest internationalpractices.

83.      (2-ii) To deal with the electricity sector debt the Government is adopting an overall
strategy.    Debt in the power sector amounts to over US$400 million, most o f which is
intrastate debt, but includes about US$lOO million in debt to the private sector.32 The debt
overhang i s unserviceable by the sector entities.              The Government's program calls for
adopting an overall strategy to deal with electricity sector debt and to implement the necessary
legal, institutional, and administrative measures to execute the strategy. KfW i s financing
technical assistance to address the sector debt problem. The basic approach has been chosen
and legislation to support the debt restructuring i s under preparation. In2006, clear progress
should be demonstrated inrestructuringthe debt.

84.      (2-iii) To deal with payment collections, the Government has decided to provide state
budget financing to municipal water companies and to ensure that such funds are used for
paying these companies' electricity bills. State budget support will be eliminated over time
while a financial rehabilitation plan for the water companies is developed and executed.
Water companies consume about 10 percent o f UEDC's power, while paying little for the
service. The state-owned distribution company, UEDC, managed by intemational contractors,
i s making progress in payment collections.           These collections reached 40 percent during
January-May 200533and under the first PRSO they averaged at least 50 percent in June-July
2005. The Government should facilitate further progress and ensure that collection targets for
PRSO I1and PRSO I11are met. These targets currently stand at 65 percent and 80 percent,
respectively. However, these targets should be reconsidered in the light o f the Government's
privatization plans. A successful privatization o f power distribution would require collections
and tariffs to be at levels that ensure that the company can meet its financial obligations.



32 At the beginning o f 2004, the state-owned power sector entities in generation, transmission, and distribution
carried a debt burdeno f about [GEL860 million].
33 Collections measured as the volume for which payments are collected as a percentage o f the volume received
byUEDC fromthe transmission company, net o ftechnical losses.


                                                     32

85.     (2-iv) Asset reassignments in thepower sector are essential. Transfer o f low voltage
non-transmission-system assets from GSE to distribution companies would bring the grid
structure in line with best international standards and would put the distribution companies in
charge o f decisions in the low voltage system that they are best equipped to make. Low
voltage assets are being transferred from GSE to UEDC. Further work in this area i s in
progress among GSE, UEDC, and the authorities. However, the initially envisaged transfer o f
ownership and control o f switchyards outside o f the hydropower stations from the power
stations to the transmission company GSE, which would have strengthened system control
and curbed illegitimate local electricity markets around the stations, has been suspended
owing to the privatization process and other developments that require further consideration.

86.     (2-v) To improve public relations, the Government's power sector entities published
on the internet technical and economic performance data for the entities. Further, the
Government realizes the importance o fbuildingan understanding o f the causes o f the difficult
energy situation and o f the remedies. While consumers are asked to pay for a service that is
below reasonable standards, it i s necessary that sector progress i s documented and
disseminated.

87.     (2-14 To better benefit from thepotential in the gas sector, the Government realizes
that the most pressingshort-term issue i s the state o f disrepair o f the north-south transmission
line for imports o f Russian gas to Georgia and transit to Armenia. The Government has
applied for financial support from the Millennium Challenge Corporation for a first-round
pipeline rehabilitation that may cost about US$40 million, in order to avoid major supply
interruptions and the eventual permanent stop in the Russian gas supplies during the coming
three to four years. The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) currently under construction from
Azerbaijan across Georgia to Turkey will have gas available to Georgia from the end o f 2006
at the earliest. The Government needs to decide on an organization model and a model for
wholesale gas supply that ensures that Georgia fully benefits from having two supply sources
(Russia and Azerbaijan), for which prices and supply flexibility will differ. More generally,
the Government would need to ensure that measures are in place in the gas sector that will
secure the long-term financial viability o f the sector.

Outcome and Monitoring indicators

88.     The outcome and monitoring indicators on this component include the following:

    a   A substantially improved service level in the power sector, as monitored through
        power distributors' statistics for supply, outage frequency, power quality, and through
        household surveys

    a   Financially viable power entities, as documented inaudited financial reports

    a   Increased competition and flexibility in gas supply options, as measured by Georgia's
        ability to benefit from cost differentials between two or more gas supply sources.

C.        Pillar 3: Improvingthe Environmentfor PrivateSectorDevelopment


The Current Situation and the Key Issues

89.       The development and promotion o f the private sector is a key element in fostering
growth and employment and in reducing poverty. The Government i s aware o f the high costs
o f doing business, and has expressed its commitment to improving the business environment
through reducing the costs for establishing and operating businesses, improving private sector
participation inpolicy making, and facilitating transport and trade.

90.       Problems      with public        administration and    governance       severely     affect   the
implementation o f administrative procedures and the subsequent delivery o f services to
businesses.        The problems include pervasive petty corruption, almost no significant
operational links between central and regional offices, low levels o f professionalism and skills
o f some civil servants, inappropriate working environments, low salaries, and few realistic
opportunities to enforce rules.

91.       Moreover, until recently there remained significant problems with registration,
licensing and permits associated with establishing and operating a business mainly owing to
arbitrariness in procedures and/or lack o f an enforcement mechanism. The development o f
businesses inthe regions i s further hampered simplybecause business licenses are issuedonly
inTbilisi. Tax and customs administration as well as inspectionsprocedures are often subject
to ambiguity and different interpretations o f rules and regulations, which results in a non-
transparent and unfair implementation o f tax and customs inspection and increase
opportunities for corruption and rent seeking.

92.       The severity o f the problems associated with complying with the administrative
procedures for doing business inGeorgia i s well captured by a recent IFC surveypresented in
Chart 1above.


34 The IFC survey does not include questions on procedures related to access to land, construction and utility
which tend to be particularly relevant to new businesses.

                                                       34

93.     In addition, indicators o f perceptions o f governance, derived from other sources
suggest the gravity o f the situation. According to the EBRD/World Bank Business
Environment Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), 2002, Georgia, compared with other
CIS countries, scored lower on political stability, regulatory quality, and rule o f law and

institutional changes and reform programs have been adopted in Georgia, they have been
poorly implementeddue to the lack o f strong political will and institution^.^^

The GovernmentReform Program

94.     To improve the investment climate and reduce the constraints on private sector
development, the PRSO supports the Government's reform program inthe following areas: (i)
simplifying tax legislation and reducing the tax burden on the economy; (ii)                  improving the
inspection process, permits and licensing requirements; (iii)facilitating customs border
processing; and (iv) improving standardization. The objectives are to identify and reduce the
cost o f establishing and operating businesses, cut down bureaucratic and non-transparent
requirements, and facilitate transport and trade. The Government i s aware o f the importance
o f an effective implementation mechanism, a monitoring system, and an on going dialogue
with all stakeholders including private sector in order to achieve the desired results. In this
context, the authorities will utilize the support o f FIAS, IFC PEP, EBRD, EU TACIS, and
USAID for this endeavor. Key actions underthe PRSO include the following:

95.      (3-0 To simplib tax legislation and reduce the tax burden on entrepreneurs and
individuals. The Government has adopted a new Tax Code which was approved inDecember
2004 and became effective in January 2005. The new tax legislation has simplifiedthe Tax
Code and substantially reduced the tax burden on firms and individuals by: reducing the
number of taxes from 21 to 7; broadening the base; lowering some rates37 to facilitate
compliance; and distributing the tax burden more equitably to encourage investment. The
Government has shown a commitment to fight corruption in tax and customs administration
and to ensure proper implementation o f the new legislation. To facilitate public access to the
latest information on the new legislation, the tax code i s published on the web site o f the
Parliament.       Supported by the subsequent PRSOs, the authorities envisage defining
mechanisms and parameters for assessing the implementation o f the new tax legislation,
conducting regular assessments and taking the necessary steps to further improve the tax
environment for the private sector.

96.      (3-ii) To enhance the inspection process and streamline cumbersome permits and
licensing requirements, some steps have been taken to improve inspections on businesses'
premises (for example, the introduction o f a court warrant system); however, there i s still a
problem with overlapping responsibilities and lack o f awareness o f the public about their
rights during inspection.


35 The analysis o f the BEEPS 2005 for Georgia is underway.
36 The Assessment o f Administrative Procedures for Doing Business 2006 is under way (forthcoming, fall o f
2005).
37 Specifically, the social tax was reduced from 33 to 20 percent, the income tax from 20 to 12 percent; and the
value added tax from 20 to 18 percent. The VAT rate reduction became effective inJuly 2005.

                                                        35

97.      To reduce burdensome regulations and to liberalize permit and licensing regimes the
Government, under the first PRSO, drafted a law on permit and licensing procedures which
was approved by the Parliament on June 24, 2005, cutting the number o f licenses from about
900 to 150, clarifying purpose for licenses, and sharply reducing the delay inthe processing o f
applications. Inaddition, several amendments to the law on entrepreneurship were adopted in
June 2005 which simplify the registration process for a new business and move it out o f the
courts. Inthe subsequent PRSOs, the Government will ensure the enforcement o f the law and
the supporting regulations for simplifying the system o f permission and licensing. The
Government will also stipulate inspections procedures and requirements at each agency by
articulating and publishingthe rights and obligations o f inspectors and entrepreneurs, and will
ensure that these are accessible to both inspectors and businesses. Over the long term, these
rights and obligations will ensure an adequate institutional capacity for implementing the
standardized business permit ,procedures, through monitoring o f performance standards,
training, or other options.

98.      (3-iii) Tofacilitate customs and border processing, the authorities should address the
mechanisms for valuing goods, the monopoly o f customs brokers, and the recognition o f
OECD/EU certifications all o f which has created problems for importers. Under the first
PRSO and with the assistance o f EU TACIS, the Government has drafted a new Customs
Code and will submit it for approval by the Cabinet o f Ministers following its review by the
EU advice and consultations with the private sector and civil society. In the subsequent
PRSOs, the authorities will enact the Customs Code, develop and adopt implementing
regulations in consultation with the private sector, and adopt and implement an Action Plan to
improve procedures which would reduce customs and border processing time for business.
This will be complemented in the long term by providing measures to ensure adequate
institutional capacity for the implementation o f customs regulations, through improved
customs procedures based on processing time measurement; and by coordinating the control
o f freight at the border.

99.      (3-iv) To improve standardization, and to facilitate access to non-CIS markets,
especially for food and ago-processed products, Georgia will make its regulations conform to
those of the WTO and during the PRSO period will introduce an internationally recognized
system of accreditation, quality management and assurance, standardization and technical
regulations. Businesses complain that: (i)       the number o f goods that are subject to mandatory
certification i s too large; (ii)Georgia continues to use old Soviet GOST standards and
certificates, which are considered obsolete by many companies; and (iii)                  information i s
lacking in relation to the standardization and certification process.38 Under the first PRSO,
the authorities with the assistance o f EU TACIS and USAID drafted the following legislation
which was approved by the Parliament inJune 2005:


         0   Law on Certification, which includes Accreditation and General Safety o f Goods.
             This law aims to create an effective infrastructure to evaluate the conformity o f
             Georgian services with standards and technical regulations, to define certification



38These problems were also identified as obstacles to export development in Georgia in the Trade Integrated
Study in2003.

                                                    36

           procedures, to provide the safety o f goods in the market and set the main
           administrative mechanisms to regulate the market.


       0   Law on Standardization, which aims to set the mandatory system o f
           standardization, and envisages the creation o f a national body that will elaborate
           and set standards inaccordance with modem procedures.


       0   Law on Metrology, which will set the incorporated system o f metrology which
           aims to be inconformity with the interstate and international legislation.

100.   In the subsequent PRSOs, the Government will enact the laws and develop the
required necessary secondary regulations to ensure that the proposed policies are properly
implemented. These measures will include the creation o f an appropriate legislative basis for
accreditation and conformity assessment and the creation o f a formal framework o f rules for
technical standards committees. These reforms will be complementedby: the establishment o f
two independentagencies: (i)   the National Agency for Standardization and Metrology, and (ii)
the National Accreditation Body, which will include representatives o f various stakeholders
and technical experts. Supported by the PRSO program, the Govemment will create technical
committees for the elaboration o f standards according to the WTO code for standardization;
and will begin the introduction o f an internationally accepted system o f laboratory
accreditation for quality control.

Outcome and Monitoring Indicators

101.   Under the PRSO program, the outcome and monitoring indicators o f the reform
component include the following:


    0  An increased share o fthe private sector inGDP

    0  Reduced costs and time for establishing and operating a business

    0  Reduced time and cost o f administrativeprocedures

    0  A new Customs Code that greatly reduces international transport costs and corruption,
       thereby enhancing competitiveness


D.     Pillar 4: Improving Social Protection, Education, and Health Care Services


The Current Situation and theKey Issues

102.   The social sectors in Georgia are confronted with a number o f structural, institutional,
policy and governance issues that need to be urgently addressed in order to improve their
performance and outcomes.




                                              37

103.     Social Protection           Social protection programs, consisting o f state pensions,39
various payments to vulnerable groups (poor elderly, disabled, orphans, etc.) and assistance to
internally displaced persons (IDPs), consume approximately 4.2 percent o f GDP. Most o f the
resources are spent on pensions (about 3.2 percent o f GDP), followed by assistance to IDPs40
(approximately 0.7 percent o f GDP) and cash assistance to the poor and vulnerable groups o f
the population (0.3 percent o f GDP). Even though social transfers are not sufficient to move
households out o f poverty, they play an important role in poverty alleviation (particularly
pensions as the largest program).              The new Government inherited significant arrears in
pensions and other social benefit payments. Since coming into power, it has succeeded in
paying the social transfers on time and clearing a significant portion o f the arrears (it i s
expected that all the arrears will have beencleared by end-2006. Moreover, the Government
doubled the pensions as o f January 1, 2005, thus fulfilling one o f its pre-election promises.
From the poverty alleviation prospective this was an important step, yet inreal terms pensions
are barely higher than in 1998. Furthermore they are still at least one fourth below the food
poverty line.

104.      SociaZ assistance programs: Social protection faces a range o f institutional, financial,
policy, and implementation issues.               Resources spent on social assistance programs are
insufficient to make a real difference to the extremely poor. Moreover, they are thinly spread
over too many fragmented programs, targeted mostly based on status (IDPs), merits (veterans
and other deservingcitizens) or a social category (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Hence, the
waste o f scarce resources, (Le., leakage to the non-poor) i s inevitable.                             Program
implementation i s weak: the staff are poorly trained and paid, the record-keeping practice i s
outdated, benefit delivery allows for leakage, and monitoring and evaluation barely exist.
Pensions: Inthe short to medium term major challenges facing the state pension system are:
(i)continuepayingpensionsontime,(ii)increasepensions toabout25-30percentofthe
     to                                               to
average wage (currently, the replacement rate is at about 20 percent), and (iii) improve           to
pension administration.           In the long run, Georgia faces a challenge of developing an
affordable, fiscally sustainable, diversified pension system that would protect the elderly
against poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. The first step in achieving that goal
i s the preparation and adoption o f a strategy for pension system development.

105.      Education Sector           While the Government i s undertaking an ambitious program o f
reform and i s making considerable progress in institutionalizing systemic changes. Equity in
access to quality education remains a problem. The new law on general education includes an
emphasis on the decentralized management o f schools; changes in financing, including a per
capita financing formula; and changes in curriculum, teaching methods and assessment
systems. However this program i s costly and public spending on education will need to
increase considerably and consistently to meet all o f the needed requests for financing. The
funding o f education from the central budget is estimated at 1.9 percent o f GDP at present.
While other funding i s available (including local expenditures representingthe bulk o f public
expenditures in general education), the gap between available and needed resources in


39 More than 20 percent o f the population (0.9 million) are pensioners. Most o f them receive flat rate pensions
(approximately 28 GEL per month on average); although some categories are eligible for privileged pensions.
The pensions are the largest social transfers program, consuming about 3.2 percent o f GDP.
40 The number o f IDPs i s approximately 226,500. The Ministry o f Refugees and Resettlement is in charge o f
registration o f IDPs. Support to IDPs is provided based on social needs, not status.

                                                        38

education is large. Inaddition, the bulk o f education expenditures go to pay teacher salaries,
leaving little funding for improving the school-learning environment. Under the Bank funded
Education Realignment and StrengtheningProject, a review o f teacher pay and conditions o f
service i s being undertaken. The Government has paid all teacher salary arrears. However
with a decliningpopulation, the size and structure o fthe teaching force and the rationalization
o f facilities have become urgent issues. With falling enrollments and over 800 small schools,
there are clear questions o f efficiency to be addressed.

 106.    As part o f the education reforms, which focus on the decentralizationof responsibility
for general education to the school level, the Government intends to implement a per capita
financing model weighted for poorer areas in the fall o f 2005. Although the principle has
been accepted, further work to operationalize the formula and to ensure that weighting are
appropriate still needs to be undertaken. The proposed use o f a voucher type system for not
only the state but also the private schools should be reconsidered while licensing regulations
for the private sector are not yet developed and there are insufficient funds to run the state
system. It is vital that there is equity in the provision o f education services to the poor
including minority groups. The state o f the education infrastructure is extremely poor, with
many schools lacking basic utilities and sanitary facilities. With decentralization to local level,
where budgets are inadequate to support decent education, standards for the poorest may fall
unless local resources are supplementedby central budget allocations.

 107.    A highly sophisticated assessment system is being put in place, which is aimed at
adopting both formative and summary evaluations at the school and,national level, and i s also
aimed at participation in international tests such as the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
However not all the pieces o f the Quality Assurance system envisaged by the Government are
inplace and a coherent approach to measuring and maintaining quality should be developed.
A universal university entrance exam, which measures aptitude as well as skills, has been run
for the first time, as an attempt to put in place transparent criteria for entrance to higher
education institutions.

 108.    At the higher education and vocational levels, the Government is also being proactive
inre-designingthe system. Initial steps to close a number of inefficient and even fraudulent
colleges have been taken. The Government has joined the Bologna process which will mean
that universities will needto modernize their management systems and ensure compatibility in
standards with other European universities.

 109.    The data available on the quality o fthe education system are poor. A statistical unit is
being set up in the MoES to coordinate data collection and analysis of the sector. There are
now several sources o f conflicting data, and partly due to this, it actually appears that Georgia
may not meet the basic Education for All criteria, although progress on the strategic
MillenniumDevelopment Goals is good. Inparticular data on the retention o f children to the
end o f primary school appear poor. The availability o f good quality data has now become a
crucial issue in measuring the success o f the education program and planning for its needs41.
With such a large number o f reforms underway, it is crucial that the success o f these changes

i s monitored, and that they are fully understood by the general population and the education
professionals.

110.     Health Sector. The health sector faces significant challenges. Health outcomes are
stagnant or worsening. Georgia i s one o f the few countries in the CIS in which important
MDGs in health (Le., early childhood mortality and maternal mortality) do not exhibit a
positive trend. Recent years have also witnessed an increase in a number o f communicable
and non-communicable diseases, leading in turn to increased morbidity and mortality rates.
The deterioration o f health outcomes appears to be the result o f both lifestyle and access to
health care services factors. Georgia has the lowest health service utilization in the Europe
and Central Asia Region, with less than 2 outpatient visits per capita and less than 5 inpatient
visits per 100people. Individuals do not use health care services mainly because o f the heavy
burden o f out-of-pocket payments. Becoming illincreases the probability o f becoming poor:
nearly 10 percent o f individuals fall below the poverty line after incurring hospitalization
expenditures. Poor people are particularly affected by high out-of-pocket payments as they
have to pay more for health care services more than rich people, not only inrelative terms (as
a percentage o ftheir income) but also inabsolute terms.

111. At the same time, public funds for the health sector are limited. Annual public
spendingon health is less than 1percent o f GDP (around US$10per capita). Under-financing
o f the health sector i s combined with inefficiencies in the management o f public resources.
The allocation o f public funding is based on historical budgets. All public hospitals and
primary health care facilities acquire contracts that provide them with public financing. There
i s a lack o f incentives for providers to improve their performance and to use their resources in
a more efficient and effective way under the current contractual arrangements. Other
problematic areas involve the excessive number o f health care providers, the under-financing
o f the free-of-charge services offered by the state and the use o f resources targeted to the poor
by non-poor individuals. The high number of health care providers at both the primary and
the hospital level spreads the budget thinly and leads to high fixed costs for health care
delivery. The scope o f services financed by the public sector resources, the Basic Benefit
Package (BBP), has expanded from 14 programs in 1995 to more than 22 programs at present,
while financing has not increased at the same level, which has ledto rationing and corruption.
Funds from the special program for the vulnerable and poor people have been usedto provide
free-of-charge services to high-income individuals.

Government Reform Program

112.     The Government's program for improving the delivery o f social services i s reflected in
the EDPRP. The PRSO together with the other Bank investment projects would support the
implementation o f the reform program inthe areas o f social protection, education, and health.
The PRSO will not support any specific program related to the IDPs, which are supported by
other donor activities.

113.     Social protection. The Government program under the PRSO focuses on two areas:
(i)the implementation of a targeted social assistance program aimed at bringing the
consumption o f the extremely poor households at least to the level o f the extreme poverty
line; and (ii)the development o f a sustainable solution for minimum protection against


                                                 40

poverty in old age. The Government has placed poverty alleviation as its immediate priority,
and intendsto introduce a number o fmeasures, which are aimed at raising the living standards
o f extremely poor household^.^^            To that end, the Government i s planning to introduce a
regular monthly cash benefit to extremely poor households in mid-2006. Eligibility will be
tested based on the household economic and social status (a proxy-means testing formula
combined with a field visit). Most o f the existing fragmented social assistance programs will
be consolidated into the targeted poverty benefit, providing for more efficient and effective
use o f scarce resources (additional resources to cover the extreme poverty gap are planned as
well). As far as pension system development is concerned, there is an ongoing discussion
within and outside of the Government on options for pensionreform in Georgia. The World
Bank i s finalizing a Note on Options for Pension Reform in Georgia; the Government expects
the Note to inform the debate and facilitate the strategic choices.

114.      (4-4 To implement a targeted social assistanceprogram, the Government program
under the PRSO calls for the completion o f the actions already started and advanced
significantly. These include: the development and approval o f a household social and
economic status assessment methodology; the finalization o f the institutional and
administrative steps required for the start o f the program implementation; and, the completion
o f the training o f the staff involved inthe program implementation. Inmore specific terms, to
complete this process, the Ministry o f Health, Labor and Social Affairs needs to follow
through with actions to develop and fine-tune the benefit targeting formula and to draft
various regulations and administrative acts. The Employment and Social Services Agency,
which i s going to be the administrative agency for the benefit, has started the initial data
collection and has prepared the public information campaign.43

115.      (4-ii) To develop a sustainable solution for minimum protection against poverty in
old age, a strategy for long-term pension reform will be prepared by the Government and
discussed by an inter-ministerial working group and later on with the public. In addition,
pensions will bepaid on time and all pension arrears will be cleared as scheduled.

116.      Education. The main objective o f the Government's reform program inthe education
sector i s to create a system that: develops the physical and mental abilities o f the younger
generation; ensures the availability and transparency o f general education; ensures the
efficient management o f the general education system; and supports inclusive education. To
achieve these goals, the Government program focuses on the areas o f education finance,
equityinaccessto quality education, andproper management o fthe teaching workforce.

117.      The MTEF exercise is expected to address issues related to budget planning and
education finance as well as the required links between sector strategies and policies, and
funding. Through the MTEF process, the Government intends to look at the consolidated
budget for the education sector rather thanjust the central budget, as local expenditures form
the bulk o f public expenditures on general education. The Government is preparing


42 The official poverty estimates based on the 2003 Household Survey show that about 15 percent o f the
population was extremely poor, while the overall poverty headcount was estimated at about 50 percent.
43The collection and computerization o f information on applicant households would result in the creation o f a
database on vulnerable families inGeorgia. The Government intends to update this data base regularly and use it
to target not only the cash poverty benefit, but also other social programs.

                                                         41

mechanisms to operationalize the new Law on General Education approved in April, 2005.
This law introduces a per capita mechanism for allocating funding to all general public
schools. The Government program also envisages developing new strategies for dealing with
the teaching workforce, including the elaboration o f a new remuneration scheme to provide
for incentives for skillfulteachers to move to the rural and to the neediest areas.

118.    (449 To improve the access to and the quality of general education, the
Government program, supported by PRSO, focuses on strengtheningpolicy and management
capacity including the development o f an information base for policymaking and the efficient
use o f human and physical resources. Inline with this objective under the first PRSO:

        The Ministry o f Education and Science has developed a model for a clear mechanism
        to operationalize and monitor the proposed per capita financing formula, specifying
        accountability relationships (and provisions for noncompliance to law) and financial
        reportingprocedures.


    0   The National Assessment and Examination Center has developed and runfourth grade
        assessments and a ninth grade exam and i s running the first universal university
        entrance examination in July 2005. Georgia i s also becoming involved in the TMMS
        and PISA international assessments. The next step is to formulate a quality assurance
        system that includes recommendations for classroom levels and, institutional and
        national level methods o fjudging quality The MoES will develop a Quality Assurance
        model for monitoring education progress at the school and national levels.


    0   The MoES has developed a data collection system inthe education statistics unit o f the
        Ministry on MDG indicators (enrollment, attendance, drop-out and basic education
        completion rates) across Georgia, at all territorial and administrative levels.

119.    These measures will be followed under the PRSO I1and PRSO I11by further actions
for implementing the model on per capita financing, putting in place a monitoring and
evaluation system, and utilizing and disseminating the results.

120.    Health.     The Government reform program, as envisaged in the MTEF 2006-08
framework, proposes significant changes in the areas o f planning, management and
administration o f the health sector, as well as the network o f primary and secondary health
care providers.    The G o v e k e n t i s planning to introduce new financing mechanisms for
primary and secondary care providers; to revise the content o f the Basic Benefit Package
(BBP); establish a family medicine faculty; to train physicians to become general practitioners
(GP); to introduce mechanisms for accreditation and licensing; rationalize its network o f
primary providers and refurbish selected facilities; and to reduce the number o f public
hospitals in the country and create a regional hospital network through the renovation o f
existing facilities andor the construction o fnew ones.

121.    The implementation o f these reforms is expected to require additional public funding
for the health sector. In support o f these plans, the Government under the PRSO intends to
articulate the proposed reforms in a short- and medium-term strategy on health. This strategy
i s currently being developed by the Health Policy Unit (HPU) o f the National Institute o f


                                                 42

Health (NM) in close cooperation with MOLHSA. The strategy will be used as a strategic
tool inprioritizing sector programs under given fiscal parameters and i s expected to contribute
to increased efficiency inthe use o fpublic funding inthe health sector.

122.    The Government is also planning to revise the publicly financed health program
(BBP) to protect families fi-om the impoverishing impact o f the cost o f illness.                    The
Government intends the BBP to be provided to the entire population and to be simple and
clear in the structure o f services and user charges.44 To help address the problem o f
corruption, notice boards will be displayed in public hospitals and polyclinics notifying
citizens about organizational budgets, service entitlements and user charges required.45The
Government has expressed its intentions to rehabilitate/construct strategic facilities inorder to
create a regional hospital network, while it understands that the financial viability o f such a
network will depend crucially on a parallel consolidation o f the rest o f the facilities. The
detailed process for the modernization o f the sector will be outlined in the revised
modernization strategy for the hospital sector.46 The PRSO will support the creation o f the
regional hospital network only if it i s accompanied by a downsizing o f the total number o f
hospital facilities inthe country.

123.    (4-iv) To improve health sector performance and to provide access to essential
quality health services, the Government under the first PRSO:


    0   Initiated development o f short- and medium-term health sector strategy.
    0   Initiated: (a) revision o f the minimum Basic Benefits Package (BBP) in order to meet
        the priority public health goals and provide financial protection to the population; and,
        (b) revision o f the hospital sector modernization strategy and implementation plan,
        including rehabilitation o f publicly owned strategic hospitals and rightsizing o f
        hospital capacity.

124.    These actions will be followed by others during the PRSO I1and PRSO 111, including:
adoption o f revisions to the BBP and the design and adoption o f a package o f additional
services for the poor; the adoption and measurable progress in the implementation o f the
revisedhospital sector modernization plan; and the development and adoption o f a policy on
the licensing, accreditation and certification o fproviders, personnel and medical schools.

Outcome and Monitoring Indicators

125.    The outcome and monitoring indicators o f this reform component include the
following:

    0   At least 60 percent of the target group (those identifiedas pre-social assistancepoor) is

                                 VI.OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.     Implementationand Monitoringof the Operation


126.   The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) will act as the main coordinator for managing the
overall implementation o f the PRSO. The MOF is also the coordinator o f the EDPRP. The
primary implementingline agencies will be: the Ministries o f Economic Development, Health
Education, Energy, Public Service Bureau, Anti-corruption Coordination Department, and the
Chamber o f Control.

127.    The proposed PRSO focuses on the implementation o f the Government reform agenda
as reflected in the EDPRP. As mentioned before, the triggers and monitoring indicators are
linked to realizing the EDPRP targets. Specific monitoring indicators will be based on the
system proposed for monitoring EDPRP. The monitoring o f the measures that will affect
poverty and the MDGs will be assessed through periodic follow up o f household surveys and
poverty monitoring as well as the EDPRP's Annual Progress Reports. Outcome and impact
indicators will be monitored through the official and direct survey data, sectoral studies and
analysis o f fiduciary performance.

128.    The monitoring o f the reform program will also be carried out through regular reviews
and inthe context o f the supervision o f this operation as well as the preparationo f subsequent
PRSOs. Progress inthe implementation o f policy measures will be further monitored through
other Bank financed projects, including those that complement actions supported under the
PRSO. The monitoring o f public sector reforms as well as public expenditures on social
sectors i s o f particular importance. Agreement has been reached with the Government to
produce periodic information inthese areas.



                                                44

B.       DisbursementandAuditing
129.     The proposed Operation is US$20 million equivalent o f which US$13.5 million is an
IDAcredit and US$6.5 million is anIDA grant. The Operationwill bereleased inone tranche
upon effectiveness. The IDA credit component o f the Operationwill be on IDA terms, with a
40 year maturity, including a 10 year grace period. The expected closing date o f the proposed
first PRSO i s January 31,2006.

130.     The proposed Operation will be disbursed in United States dollars into a designated
Deposit Account (DA) at the National Bank o f Georgia (NBG) that will have been opened by
the Ministry o f Finance o f Georgia (MOF) on terms and conditions satisfactory to the IDA.
Thereafter, the United States dollars in the DA will be sold promptly (within 30 days o f
disbursement) bythe MOF to the NI3G inreturnfor an equivalent GeorgianLari amount to be
deposited in an account o f the Government that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures,
e.g., the Treasury Single Account.         The M O F will be responsible for the Operation's
administration and for preparingthe withdrawal application, maintaining the DA as required
and arranging for its timely audit. The Operation will be subject to ratification by Parliament
before it becomes effective. The MOF, with the assistance o f the NBG, will maintain records
o f all transactions under the Operation in accordance with sound accounting practices. The
M O F will provide to the Bank a confirmation that the amount o f the Operation has been
credited to an account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures.

C.       FiduciaryArrangements


131.     Review of foreign exchange reserves management:

         i)TheIMFconductedasafeguardsassessmentoftheNBGinJanuary2002. The
             IMF was encouraged by the measures taken by the NBG in the areas o f financial
             reporting, internal audit, and cash management to strengthen procedures.
             Nonetheless, staff noted further room for improvement in these areas, as well as
             weaknesses in aspects o f the internal control environment o f the bank, particularly
             inthe foreign exchange management and accounting functions. Together, the IMF
             and NBG devisedand agreed upon a set o f measures to improve and strengthenthe
             NI3G's fiduciary arrangements. In 2005 the IMF was satisfied that the NBG had
             fully implemented all but three o f the measures agreed upon in2002 to strengthen
             the N B G s fiduciary arrangements. Inrespect o f the three measures that were not
             fully implemented:the first was partially implementedand the status o f the other
             two measureswas not monitoredbythe IMF.

         ii)The NBGreceived an unqualified audit opinion from its auditors, Deloitte &
             Touche, on its latest published financial statements being in respect o f the year
             endedDecember 31,2004.

132.     Public Financial Management System.          The findings and conclusions o f various
assessments o f the Georgian public financial management system have been incorporated
within and indeed are integral to the design o f the PRSO. These assessments include: the



                                                 45

World Bank's September 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)47, the
IMF's October 2003 Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes - Fiscal Transparency
Module4*; the World Bank's June 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)49;
and the World Bank's November 2003 Public Expenditure Review (PER)."                       The salient
public financial management issues from these assessments as well as issues arising since the
publication o f these assessmentshave been summarized, progress discussed and addressed as
appropriate elsewhere inthe Program Document and the Letter o f Development Policy.

133.   Additional fiduciary arrangements.             N o additional fiduciary arrangements are
proposed in view of: (i)   the satisfactory implementation to date by the NBG o f the measures
agreed upon bythe NBGwith the IMF in2002 to improve and strengthenthe NBG's fiduciary
arrangements; and (ii)   the satisfactory audit reports o f the NBG that do not indicate material
weaknesses. The MOF will, however, within three months o f the date o f disbursement by the
Bank o f the proceeds o f the Operation, provide to the Bank evidence that the proceeds o f the
Operation has been credited to an account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures
(including the date and namehumber o f the government's bank account inwhich the amount
has been deposited, and that it has been credited to an account o f the government available to
finance budgetedexpenditures, e.g., the Treasury Single Account).

D.     EnvironmentalAspects
134.   While this operation would not require an environmental assessment as it would not
have a direct impact on the environment, attention will be paid to the following two areas-
energy sector and SOE sector restructuring and privatization.                 In the course of the
implementation o f the first PRSO and the preparation o f the subsequent PRSOs, strategic
environmental assessments could be conducted as necessary.

135.   Energy Sector. Inthe Bank's PSIA o f September 25,2003, one o f the conclusions was
that electricity tariff increases in Tbilisi may not have caused a shift to dirtier fuel
consumption, as the increased use o f clean and inexpensive natural gas took place instead.
Outside o f Tbilisi, a substantial number o f households continue to burn wood, and the use o f
improved wood burning technologies could produce welfare gains. Overall, sector reform
would mostly have a positive environmental impact. Tariffs at cost level, and improved
metering systems and collections, would have a significant, dampening effect on consumption
and thus on greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impact o f rehabilitating existing
substations and power lines i s benign. With more private participation inthe energy sector in
the future, the Government should ensure that private investors meet adequate environmental
standards intheir operations and investments.

136.    The planned rehabilitation o f the north-south gas transit pipeline will reduce leakages
o f methane gas to the atmosphere and may be eligible for financial support from carbon
trading under the Clean Development Mechanism o f the Kyoto Protocol.                          Pipeline
rehabilitation work will, however, be undertaken in environmentally sensitive areas and the

Government should ensure that adequate environmental standards are met during the
rehabilitation work. The new Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline will transport its first
oil across Georgian territory in the fall o f 2005, and the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCP)
under construction will transit and deliver gas from late 2006 according to plans. The Bank
has provided funding for technical assistance and capacity building for the Government to
address the environmental issues o fthese two pipelineprojects.

137.    SOE Restructuring and Privatization.         In addition to the improvement of the
investment and business climate, the Government is considering the restructuring and
privatizing o fthe SOEs. The privatizationprocess has already begunwith the publication o f a
list o f approximately 300 o f the largest SOEs that are candidates for privatization. The
Government succeeded in privatizing a number o f large companies in the past year. For
enterprises that are potentially harmful for the environment, the authorities have undertaken
and included an environmental impact assessment as part o f the privatization process or
management contract.       Furthermore, the Government recognizes the need to design and
implement a privatization program that incorporates a number of basic and important
principals including: transparency and equal access to information; fair value; competitive
case-by-case privatization including the transfer o f residual state ownership; and sufficient
time line to allow for defensive restructuringwhich is needed for some o fthe enterprises prior
to their privatization.

E.      Poverty and Social Impact Assessment


138.    The PRSO i s designed to improve living standards in Georgia by: (i)strengthening
public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)  improving electricity and gas
sector services; (iii)improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv)
improving social protection, education, and health care services.           The two areas with
potentially the greatest immediate impact on living standards are reforms inthe power sector
and the social protection system. In order to assess their impact, as part o f the
implementation o f the first PRSO and the preparation o f subsequent PRSOs, a poverty and
social impact analysis (PSIA) will be carried out on these key aspects o f the reform agenda as
they are likely to have an immediate and quantifiable affect on the population, especially on
the lower income groups.

139.    In the energy sector, the PRSO supports Government initiatives to attain financial
viability for sector entities. Payment collections in power distribution outside o f Tbilisi-
especially among residential users-will       have to increase substantially, and some upward
tariff adjustments may be neededinfbture as well. These developments are necessary in order
to achieve a sustainable electricity service with a service level that i s adequate for economic
development and that improves living conditions in Georgia. A PSIA carried out by the Bank,
dated September 2003, concluded that households in Tbilisi had a power consumption level
close to basic needs and that demand was inelastic, thus suggestingthat tariff increases would
be associated with significant welfare losses. Underthis PRSO, as energyreforms are targeted
to areas outside o f Tbilisi, welfare losses are likely to occur among this population group in
the short term and possibly the medium term. At present, the Government plans to address the
poverty impact from tariff increases and enhanced collections as a part o f the broader poverty



                                                47

reduction strategy, including the adoption o f a targeted assistance program under PRSO 11,
rather than usingcross-subsidization to address the welfare losses o fthe poor.

140.     In order to understand the poverty and social impact o f energy reforms on the
population outside o f Tbilisi, a PSIA i s proposed which will try to answer three main
questions. First, have increased collections and/or tariff increases led to an increase in
poverty? Second, has the increased financial burden led to deeper poverty among those
residing below the overall and extreme poverty lines? And third, how have the electricity
reforms affected the access to and reliability o f electricity services for the population outside
o f Tbilisi? Inorder to carry out this analysis, potential sources o f information include targeted
surveys and the household budget surveyused for poverty analysis. This work i s plannedto be
undertaken inclose collaborationwith other development partners.

141.     The social protection system will undergo a major reform with the objective o f
reducing the incidence o f extreme poverty in Georgia. The Government will introduce a
targeted cash family poverty benefit in mid-2006. The benefit will target 17 percent o f
Georgian families (about 700,000 people) which i s based on the estimation o f extreme poverty
in 2004. Families found eligible for the benefit (based on an assessment of their social and
economic status) will receive regular monthly cash social assistance during a period o f one
year. The specific benefit amount will depend on a household's assessed income; the benefit
will top up the existing income to the extreme poverty benchmark.

142.     In order to assess the impact of the reform of the social protection system, two
activities will be undertaken. First, inorder to monitor the impact, the Government i s planning
an evaluation o f the program at the beginning o f 2007-a         year after the benefit has been
introduced. Second, as part o f the programmatic poverty assessment program (which will be
coterminous with the PRSO), the effectiveness o f the reforms will be assessed. The main
issues addressed under the PSIA on the social protection system will be the effectiveness and
efficiency o f the new cash transfer program. Specifically, answers will be needed as to
whether the coverage o f the extreme poor is high, whether leakage to the non-poor is at a
modest level, and whether the transfer amount i s adequate to raise households to the extreme
poverty line.

F.       Benefits,Risks andRiskMitigation


143.     This operation has several primary benefits. First and foremost, further progress with
the PRSO program supports cross-cutting anti-corruption efforts and improved governance
which would improve the investment climate as well as the access to and affordability o f key
social services for the poor. Strengthened public expenditure management and accountability
would greatly enhance the strategic allocation o f resources through the medium-term
expenditure framework and would contribute to fiscal sustainability. Improved electricity and
gas sector services would help mitigate one o f the key impediments to business and job
generation as well as contributing directly to improved living standards for the poor, notably
for those outside the capital. Simplification and clarification o f the rules and regulations
governing business activities would provide further stimulus to private sector activity, while
the reforms envisaged in key social programs would improve the quality and targeting o f
social services and social protection for the poor.

                                                 48

144.    The proposed operation faces several risks. The main risk is the Government's weak
implementation capacity, including policy coordination. This has been carefully factored into
the design o f this operation, notably, through a programmatic approach with proper
sequencing. The Government i s also taking direct initiatives to address its capacity
weaknesses. The Bank i s actively supporting these initiatives-for        example, through the
ongoing Structural Reform Support Credit and the proposed Public Sector Reform Project.
More generally, the PRSO program has a strong focus on areas in which donor technical
assistance i s ongoing or expected inthe near term. Inthe course o fpreparation, the task team
has consulted closely with other donors on the potential scope o f their participation incapacity
enhancement efforts. Current plans include joint analytical work, technical assistance and
leamindtraining activities. A joint M&E fkamework derived from the EDPRP i s also
envisaged to be adopted between the Government and donors.

145.    Georgia remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks (e.g., climate-related shocks to
agriculture and an unforeseen deterioration inthe external environment) because o f its limited
economic diversification and its relatively highexternal debt burden. This poses risks for both
macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. The macroeconomic situation is somewhat
uncertain inany event. On the fiscal side, the very strong revenueperformance o f the past year
may prove difficult to sustain, while the pace and proceeds from future privatization are
subject to some uncertainty. The recent rise in inflation i s also cause for concern given the
Government's plans for increased spendingon investment and social programs. World Bank
staff, in close collaboration with the IMF, i s and will continue to monitor closely
macroeconomic development and continue to coordinate closely their advice to the
authorities.

146.    Other risks include deterioration inthe security and/or political environment (e.g., due
to rekindled tensions in the regions o f Abkhazia and South Ossetia or resistance to reforms
from vested interests). The continued very high popular support enjoyed by the President and
the Government is important in this regard. The Government's systematic efforts to explain
the rationale o f its economic strategy, and the anticipated rapid improvements in governance
and living standards, will be important to maintaining this support. Timely and strong support
from the international community will be critical. Specific to the problem o f territorial
integrity, the recent return o f Adjara under the authority o f the central government is a very
welcome development. It i s hoped that continued international efforts will contribute to the
peacefulresolution o f the remaining territorial disputes.

                                            Georgia

Dear Mr. Wolfowitz,

1.      Since the peaceful "Rose Revolution" of November 2003, Georgia has made significant
progress in macroeconomic stability and in initiatingmajor structural reforms. Real GDP has
grown steadily; inflation has been at a single digit level; revenue collection has been increased
dramaticallyand substantial wages and pensions arrears accumulatedover the last several years
have been cleared; and the Government has cracked down on corruption decisively and has
restructured and streamlined the government apparatus significantly. The World BanWIMF
initiative to elaborate a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was welcomed by us as an
opportunity to formulate a medium-term development strategy. The initiative came at an
opportunemoment for Georgiato solidifythese achievementsand to ensurethat future growth is
sharedmorebroadlyto benefitthe entirepopulation.

2.      The PRSP, which we call the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(EDPRP), was prepared by the previous government in July 2003. It was consistent with
Georgia's policy objectives, and was based on a broad participatory process involving central
and local governments, civil society, the private sector and the donor community. The strategy
focused on reducingpoverty through sustainable and inclusive economic growth and involved
six pillars: (i)strengthening governance; (ii)improving macro fiscal performance; (iii)
improvingthe business environment; (iv) reducingthe vulnerability of the poor; (v) enhancing
development of human capital; and (vi) protecting the environment. The new Government
embraced the EDPRP as our poverty reduction strategy. At the same time, the Government
recognizedthat, whilethe EDPRPprovidedabroad framework for its poverty reductionstrategy,
it lacked the clear prioritization/sequencing needed in the face of a limited resource envelope.
With a view to providing further elaboration and updating of the diagnosidagenda and clearer
prioritizatiodsequencing,the Government preparedthe first EDPRPprogress report in Febmary
2005. The EDPRP process inspired the Govemment to begin compiling several strategic
documents that have been developed for different purposes in recent years into one overarching
strategy document calledthe Government's Medium-Term Action Strategy. Inthis respect, such
key papers as the EDPRP, the IndividualPartnershipAction Plan for joining NATO (IPAP), the
EUNeighborhood Policy Paper andother policydocumentsare beingcarefully analyzedand, on
the basis of these documents, State Objectives and Priority Directions are being outlined that
cover the political, social and economic spheres. This document is expected to serve as a basis
for the next round of the EDPRP and for the development of other policy documents.

3.     Despite an economic growth of more than 30 percent since 2000, total employment has
not risen and poverty has hovered at 52 percent. Taking into account the multidimensional
character of poverty and its level, especially in certain areas and among certain groups of the
population, we have reaffirmed our commitment to the reduction of poverty. To addressthese
challenges, the Government reform program is aimed at: (i)increasing income and employment
opportunitiesfor the poor as well as providingimprovedaccess to services such as educationand
health care; (ii)increasing the participation of the poor and strengthening their voice in
governing institutions; and (iii) enhancing social protection for the poor.          To increase
employment opportunities for the poor, we will focus on stimulating growth through the
promotionof private investments, continued structural reforms, the promotionof education, the
improvementofpublic healthcare, the mitigationof regional disparities, and the development of
the rural and urban areas. In order to bring public institutions closer to the poor and to
strengthen the voice of the poor, and also to hold public institutions accountable to the people,
we will continue with our institutional reforms. To enhance the security of the poor, we will
reformthe socialassistance andpensionsprograms.

4.     The EDPRP and its Progress Reports are based on a sound macroeconomic framework,
which is being supported by a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Fund (PRGF)
arrangement with the IMF, approved in June 2004. The program aims to achieve a strong real
GDP growth of 8.5 percent in 2005 while maintaining low inflation and ensuring fiscal
sustainabilitywith lower levels of external debt service payments. To sustain high GDP growth,
we intendto proceedrapidlywith structural reformsand improvedgovemance. Monetary policy
will be aimed at maintaining inflation within a target range of 7 percent for 2005, and
maintainingit at single digit levels thereafter. Fiscal policy will be cautious, with a continued
strengthening of revenue collection allowing simultaneously for increased spending in priority
areas while steadily reducingthe deficit. The overallfiscal deficit on a cash basis is expectedto
decline below 2 percent in 2007 from 5.5 percent in 2005. Gross international reserves are
envisagedto exceed two monthsof importsof goods and services by 2007. The externalcurrent
account is projectedto narrow down to 3.5 percent of GDP through 2007. However, additional
resources from the internationalcommunity will be neededto ensure that the external balance
remainsfully financed.

5.     We are seeking assistance from the IDA through a series of annual Poverty Reduction
Support Operations (PRSOs) to implement the EDPRP. Our consultation with the World Bank
team has led to the identification of four components, of which the following three directly
support income and employment opportunities for the poor: (i)strengthening public sector
accountability, efficiency and transparency; (ii)improving electricity and gas sector services;
(iii)improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social
protection, education and health care services. The first component, namely, strengthening
public sector accountability, efficiency and transparency, is aimed at improving public sector
service delivery and institutional arrangements and directly addresses Georgia's capacity
constraintsand institutionalweaknessesthat were madeapparentduringthe participatoryprocess
of preparing the EDPRP. The second component includes reforms aimed at addressing the
severe situation in the electricity and gas sectors, The reforms of third component are aimed at
improvingthe businessclimate to strengthenthe foundations of private sector-led growth. And
the reforms of the fourth component are aimed at improving our social safety net, supporting

development of human capital through reforms in education, and improving efficiency and
effectiveness of healthcare services.

Pillar 1: StrengtheningPublic Sector Accountability, EfficiencyandTransparency

StrengtheningPublic Budgetingand ExpenditureManagement

6.      The budget management and expenditure reforms supported by the PRSO program are
aimed at improvingthe policy content of budget preparation and achievinggreater transparency
and accountability in budget planningand expenditure management. Our action plan under the
PRSO program includes the preparation of: (i)the direction of budget expenditure; (ii)sector
expenditure plans and priority sector programs; (iii)expenditure plans for the strategic sectors
and the allocation of cross-cutting resources between the sectors; and (iv) an annual Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with a four-year horizon. We are requesting IDA
support for these reformsthrough the proposedPSRP incoordinationwith support from the U.K.
Departmentfor InternationalDevelopment(DFID) and other donors.

7.      Our new Budget Systems Law (BSL) (approved in 2003 and amended in 2004)
prescribesacomprehensive framework for budget management, placingthe Ministry of Finance
in charge of a new integrated budget preparation process. The Law defines two-stage budget
preparation processes.     First, the macroeconomic framework is decided on, including
determining key directions and sector ceilings. In a second stage, spending agencies present
their detailed budget requests within the proposedbudgetceilings. We are undertakingreforms
to improve both of these areas. The estimation of the resource envelope needs to be further
refined, while the spendingagenciesneedto submit their budget requests with greater timeliness
and within the proposed ceilings. We are actively working on these issues and have the
assistanceof a donor-fundedteam inthe Ministry ofFinance(MOF).

8.      We have prepared a 2004 budget execution report and submitted it to Parliament. The
report shows that total budget arrears accumulated by the previous govemment amounted to
GEL420 million. Sincewe took office we cleared about GEL 255 million in arrears in2004 and
we are committed to fully clearing the remaining arrears by the end o f 2006. The new
commitment control system prevents the appearance of new arrears. In addition, the Treasury
now producesmonthly cash and commitment reports and quarterly financial reports, as required
in the BSL. We also plan to develop a unified remuneration system for public institutions,
setting GEL 115as a minimumsalary.

9.      To further improve the budget preparation process, during the PRSO Iperiod we have
made significant progress in developing our budgetary process and anchoring it in a Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework. Efforts have been undertaken to improve the macroeconomic
forecasting model over the past six months. However, further improvements are needed to
strengthen the forecasting model. This is intended to introduce a medium-term perspective to
budget planning. The first MTEF covers the years 2006-2009, with the first year forming the
annual 2006 budget (to be approved by Parliament), and the following three years providing
indicativeestimates for the line ministries. The three pilot MTEF agencies, Education, Health,

and Agriculture, submitted their full Sector Strategy Expenditure Matrices (SSEMs).           In
addition, the Ministry ofForeignAffairs also submitted a hllSSEM.

10.      Within the framework of the MTEF the spending agencies would undertake an analysis
of key expenditure issues and priorities, and should be in a position to establish a better link
betweenthe budgetandthe EDPRPobjectives. The Basic Dataand Directions(BDD) document
for the budget of 2006-09, recently presented to the Cabinet, fully incorporates the MTEF
process. This providesa moredetailedassessment of our medium-term resourceenvelopeanda
detailed analysis of sector expenditure profiles. Ceilings for the 2006 budget and MTEF are
consistent with a sustainable resource envelope as specified in our macroeconomic framework.
Preparation of the annual budget now takes place in the framework of this document. MTEF
pilot ministries have established processes for identifying and costing new policy measures
(spending and savings). These expenditure plans are prioritized and include performance
indicators.' The 2006 budget to be passed by Parliament will be consistent with the MTEF,
reflecting the 2006 allocations and two outer-year forward estimates, and will have annexes
showingtextual descriptions of expenditure priorities and anticipated results of all budget users
andoverlaps betweenbudget allocations andnational policy objectives.

11.      The budget preparationprocesswill be hrther improvedin 2006. An improvedrevenue
forecasting component of the macroeconomic modelingframeworkwill be in place in February
2006, and all major spending ministries will submit budget requests to the MOF which are
consistent with their budget resourceceilingand the timetable in the BSL. The MTEF business
processes will be rolled out to a substantial group of non-pilot ministries. In this respect the
MOF will further implement its strategy for strengthening line ministry capacity for budget
planning and management.                 It will also initiate the development of a performance
reportinglmonitoringsystem for line agencies. In 2008 we expect that all ministrieswill submit
hllSSEMs.

Enhancing Transparencyand Efficienq in thePublicProcurementSystem

12.      Our objectivein the area of publicprocurement is to promote increasedtransparencyand
accountability in that system. Forthis purpose,we havetaken a number of steps to follow up on
the recommendations of the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). We have
reducedthe number of procuringentities from initial 8000 to 3000 and permanent procurement
units have beenestablished within each procuringentity. The AdministrativeCodeand Codeon
Administrative Violations have been amended to make procurement fraud a punishable crime.
We havealso preparedthe draft amendment,as part ofour accessionprocessto WTO, to become
a signatoryto the Government ProcurementAgreement.

13.      We have recently launched the State Procurement Agency (SPA) website and started
publishingtender announcements for procurements by the central state entities. We intend to
make more improvements to the website by including more comprehensive information about
biddingopportunities, announcements on contract awards and administrativereview decisions
pertainingto procurement-relateddisputes, andan updatedregistryof providers for goods, works
andservices.
' Technicalassistancehasbeen provided through various sector projectso fthe IDA and DFID.

 14.       Supported by PRSO I:(i) SPA has posted its 2004 Annual ProcurementReports on the
website to make available information on procurement procedures and will also monitor
procurement process improvements in the sectors through clearly established performance
 indicators; (ii)the SPA has included the procurement data and information on its website on
upcoming bidding opportunities, announcements regarding contract awards, and decisions on
administrative reviews pertainingto procurement-related disputes; (iii)we have amended the
Law on State Procurement to extend its coverage to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and to
streamline procedures, andpublishedimplementationregulations.

 15.      As partof PRSO11, the SPA will monitorprocurementprocessesinthe sectors and report
on key indicators through its website on these processes, activity and performance, as well as
remedial action proposed to address deficiencies. Government will also rationalizethe list of
confidentialprocurement items, and draft an act regulatingconfidentialprocurement. We will
establish fair and transparent administrative procedures for blacklisting companies and
individuals found to have engaged in procurement violation procedures and/or intent of fraud
and corruption, and strengthen the specialized unit within the SPA conducting administrative
reviews, During PRSO-111, SPA will continue publication of procurement processes, activity
.andperformance, as well as remedialaction proposedto addressdeficiencies. The procurement
blacklist and procurement audit findings will also be published and we will ensure that broader
anti-corruptioninitiatives include reportingand hotlinesfor procurementcomplaints andwhistle-
blowing. At the same time Public Procurement Improvement Measures will be updated and
priority actions ofthe forthcomingCPAR Update implementedas appropriate.

Improvingthe Transpareng andEffectiveness of Public Financial Management

 16.       Public financial management has faced significant problems associated with numerous
extra-budgetary funds which existed previously, We have made some progress towards
integrating these funds into the Treasury Single Account.                            Our reform program aims at
strengthening financial discipline, including LEPLs. A first step, under the PRSO 11, is to start
with the registrationof LEPLs as well. Furthermore, one of the most important institutions to
modernize in the control of fraud and corruption in Georgia is the Chamber of Control (COC),
particularly in the absence of an effective internalaudit capacity. A number of key changes in
legislation are required to elevate the mandate of the COC and its responsibilityto a Supreme
Audit Institution so that it can function as an external auditor according to International
Organization of Supreme Credit Institutions,(INTOSAI) standards. We will also develop a
comprehensive systemof internalaudit and controls. Interms of budget execution and financial
reporting, public sector accounting needs to be improvedto match the ongoing MTEF reforms
andthereportingon budget execution.

 17.      With the support of the PRSO program, we are implementing reforms aimed at
improving transparency in public financial management. We have prepared revisions to
legislationregarding thejudicial status of public and quasi-public entities, specificallydefining
the criteria for differentiating between public entities, SOEs, and LEPLs.                           At the time of the

* These  reform efforrs include detailingthe legalfinancialand performance reportingarrangements and accountabilities of all
entities.

PRSO 11, we will develop a registerof all LEPLs, includingdetails of the enabling legislationo f
each LEPL. The MOF will have published a consolidated cash-based financial report covering
the central government, the Tbilisi municipality and other large cities (as per the Treasury
expansionplan), basedon intemationally acceptedaccountingandreporting standards.

18.     At the same time, we have made considerable progress in strengtheningthe Treasury's
systems. We realize that Treasury reform and the introduction of international accounting
standards will require several years of sustained effort in establishing a Govemment Financial
Management System (GFMS).          We intend to address the remaining budget execution and
financial reportingissues in 2005, and we have expanded the coverage of the Treasury's budget
executioncashreportingsystems to Tbilisi municipality duringthe PRSO I.We will expand the
Treasury's coverage or adopt Treasury rules to four other large cities during the subsequent
PRSOs.

19.     To elevate the organization and the operations of the COC towards a modem Supreme
Audit Institution we havethe technical assistancesupport from TACIS and from GTZ and DFID.
During the PRSO Iperiod, the COC drafted a Strategy for Corporate Development and
Reorganization Implementation Plan (June 2005) and published its main findings and
recommendations. It has also publisheda completelist of finalized audits undertakenin the first
half of 2005 as well as the audit plan for the year. The strategy describes in detail how the
Chamber aims to achieve its objectives as independent government auditors with high quality
services, including overall direction, range of competences, organizational structure, goveming
law, human resources, information technology, and training. The Chamber is implementing
these reforms, which will be monitoredby progressand performanceindicators, as outlined in its
corporatestrategy which spans several years, includingthe PRSO I1period and beyond.

StrengtheningLocal Governanceand IntergovernamentalFiscal Relations

20.     We are committedto substantial improvementinpublic servicedelivery. Acknowledging
the weaknessesof the country's local self-governanceand the intergovemmentalfiscal relations
system, we have recently established a "State Commission for Effective Govemance and
Territorial Reform", which is chaired by the President. The mandate of the Commission is to
review the legislative basis required for consolidation of local self-governments, propose a re-
mapping of the territorial-administrative structure, formulate a fiscal decentralization strategy,
and implement an effective local govemance framework. With assistance from the Council of
Europe, we have under preparationan action plan for the period2005-07. The intended actions
will be implementedin phases, which includes: adoptionof basic laws (in line with the recently
ratified European Charter of Local Self-Govemment), and the preparation of concept papers.
These will facilitate the drafting of an overall decentralization strategy, and consultationfor its
adoption.

21.     We have also initiated the reform o f the intergovemmentalfiscal relation by adoptinga
new Tax Code, which, among other things, introduces changes in the revenue assignments to
rayon and local self-governments, including the replacement of all current local taxes for
national shared-taxes (transfers from the center). Rayons are receiving all o f the personal
incometax, while local self-govemmentsare receivingall propertytaxes. We will start with the

completion of a consolidated analytical study, done by the State Commission, to support the
designo fa strategy for IntergovernmentalFiscalRelations.

22.     We believethat this study is critical for starting the process of improving public service
delivery and local self-governance in Georgia. It will also work as a platform to launch the
envisagedpolicy measuresto be supportedby the PRSO Iandthe subsequentPRSOs, including:
(i)the design and adoption of a strategy for Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and a
implementation agenda; (ii)the adoption of a Law on Local Budgets; (iii)the adoption of
transparent intergovernmental fiscal relation system inthe budget preparation process, including
transfer mechanisms based new legal provisions and formula; (iv) the implementationat the
Ministry of Financeofa monitoringsystem for municipalbudgetingand financial reporting.

StrengtheningihePublicAdministration

23.     In our Letter of Development Policy for the Reform Support Credit, we committed to
improving public administration to enhance the capacity for designing and implementing
appropriate public policiesand deliveringadequate services to the population. Our objective is
to: establish a professional public sector; boost the morale of civil servants; eliminate
institutionalsources ofcorruption;andoptimizestaffsize in line with the new functions assigned
to each ministry. In our medium term agenda presented in that LDP we committed to: (i)
elaborate civil servicereform guidelines intoa morecomprehensivecivil servicereform strategy;
(ii) draftandadoptnewlegislationregulatingcivilservicetoaddressshortcomingsinthe
    revise,
current legislation; (iii)adopt a legislationregulatingethics and discipline for civil service staff
and a new pay and incentivesystem within an agreedfiscal framework; (iv) develop adata base
to implement a Personnel Management and InformationSystem (PMIS); and, (v) improve the
qualityofthe civil service by introducingregulationsfor competitive, merit-based recruitment.

24.     In line with these commitments, we have amended the Civil Service Law in order to
establish the Public Service Council (PSC) and the Public Service Bureau (PSB). Further
decrees were prepared to define the specific tasks and responsibilitiesof these new structures.
The regulation for the Council provides for the chairmanship of the Council by the President.
This would be essential for the Council to effectively implement its mandate. Progress in other
areas has been slower than originally envisioned in the LDP at the time of the Reform Support
Credit. However, some actions have taken place in the Ministry of Educationregarding a pilot
approach to civil service reform. Also, the Ministry of Justice with assistance of the EU Rapid
ReactionMechanism Projecthas completedthe functional reviewof the ministryand its staffing
assessment.

25.     We will continue with our original objectives and commitments under the Reform
Support Credit and with the support of the PRSO focus on developingand implementinga new
governance program, which the State Commission on Government Reforms intends to prepare.
A second dimension of the civil service reform program involves a connection to other key
reforms, notably in the budget process. We need informationabout staffingcost and quantity to
prepare a strategic budget in the context of the MTEF. We believe that this is particularly
important since there are many questionsregarding staff capacity, ghost workers, and the match
betweenhuman resourcesand strategic objectives. The PersonnelManagementDatabasewould

provide a central instrument for better managingour human resources within the context o f a
strategic and disciplinedbudget process.

26.        With support of the PRSOI,andthroughthe Public Service Bureau, we haveproduceda
report on public administration/civilservice reforms undertaken in all ministries since January
2004. Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice has now completed its functional review and is
developing an action plan for reorganization to be completed by end-August 2005. During
PRSO I1amediumterm implementationplanwill beadopted for administrativeandcivil service
reform, including mandate revision and service identification, pay and incentive systems,
delineation o fpolitical and non-politicalappointments, inductiontraining and subsequent career
development training.3 We will develop the concept and implementation modalities for a
PersonnelControl and InformationSystem. We will make substantial stepstowards improvinga
pay and incentive systems and introducingcareer development training. Furthermore, we will
identify areas for a multi-year civil service reform program and will help provide a more
balancedmembershipinthe PublicServiceCouncil.

EnhancingPublicSector TransparencyandAccountability

27.        Our past anti-corruption activities included the arrests and prosecution o f high-level
officials and the reorganization of some key safety and security entities.                             As initial steps to
enhance transparency and consolidationinthe anti-corruptionprocess, we created(as part ofthe
IDA Reform Support Credit in 2004) a sub-entity at the Office ofthe National Security Council
of Georgia responsible for monitoring and evaluating anti-corruption reforms and activities
withinthe country. The Anti-CorruptionPolicy Department(ACPD) was entrustedwith creating
the working group for the elaboration of aNational Anti-CorruptionStrategy of Georgia, which
includes civil society members. As a first step, the ACPD produced a list of all anti-corruption
activitiesacrossgovernment.

28.        In contrast to the past, we have adopted and are implementing a strong anti-money
laundering regulatory framework. In June 2003, the Government adopted the Anti-Money
Laundering Law which includes a counterterrorist financing article. Amendments to the
Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code have been submitted to Parliament including
introducingcriminalliability of legalpersons and requiringbankingand insurance institutionsto
conduct background checks on their prospective partners to ensure they have not engaged in
legalizing illicit funds. In 2003, the Financial Monitoring Service was created based on the
recommendations of the Council of Europe Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of
Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL) and became fully operational in January
2004. In2004, the National Money Laundering ProsecutionUnit Special Service on Prevention
of Legalization of Illicit Income was established under the Prosecutor General's Office of
Georgia.

29.        We are nowtaking asystematic approach to uprootingcorruption. On June 24,2005, the
President approved the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which introduces the following
comprehensivemeasuresfor the preventionand reductionof corruption: (i)civil service reform;

'Including   detailed description of the activities, responsibility for the activities, implementation schedule, costing of the
activities,progress indicatorsand monitoringmechanism,and identificationofTA required(available through PHRD Grant).

(ii) the strengthening of the principles of accountability and public disclosure, including the
facilitation of public feedback mechanisms; (iii)the strengthening of the rule of law; (iv) the
strengthening of the control bodies of all three branches of authority and monitoringby society;
(v) the facilitationof competitivebusinesssector development; and (vi) intemationalintegration.
The Decree assigns a period of two months to develop and adopt an Action Plan for Strategy
Implementation, which shall comprise all major state agencies (ministries, sub-departmental
agencies, regulating bodies, legal entities of public law functioning in the field of education).
We are requesting IDA support for these governance reforms through the PRSOs and a Public
Sector ReformProject(PSRP).

30.     We have been increasingly switching our anti-corruption agenda towards addressing
issues o f prevention, and mitigating opportunities for corruption in the public management
processes. Each ministry has been charged with pursuing anti-corruption activities that they
deem appropriate. This delegated approach to anticorruption places the responsibility on line
ministries and locates accountability for reform in the hands of individual ministers. The
approach also ties anticorruption initiatives closely to the goals of improved efficiency and
service delivery. While the ministries are taking steps to reform their processes, curb corrupt
activities and improve service delivery, we need to continue monitoring progress in these
initiatives to ensure that the delegated approach to these reforms does not fragment the anti-
corruptionagenda.

31.     Under the PRSO program, we are committing ourselves to creating the basis of an
effective monitoring system to track progress in curbing corruption and improving service
delivery. We are developing an accountability program, which has four components: (i)the
provision of informationto citizens about what services Government should provide and what
kinds of service charges can be requested; (ii)the introduction of survey-based monitoring of
service performance and informal payments at the point of service delivery; (iii)the
strengthening of particular mechanisms whereby citizens can "voice" their concems about
service delivery and/or corruptionin the specific service delivery areas; and (iv) the publication
(by the ACPD) of an annual reportshowingdata from the user surveys and detailsof complaints
registeredthroughthenewcomplaintmechanisms(as well as remedialactions taken).

32.     Our ultimate objectives are to have full transparency (at the point of service) of
organizational budgets, service entitlements and service fees required in key sectors (health,
education, licensing, and customs); to establish in-place mechanisms to monitor progress in
curbing corruption and enhancing service delivery in these areas; and to conduct surveys of
service performance and of corruption in health and education as well as in customs and
licensingandpublishthe results andthe complaints received.

33.     During the PRSO Iperiod, the Government reorganized the traffic police function,
visibly reducing corruption; established the ACPD, thereby enhancing the civic voice; and
issued, by Presidential decree, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy.        The Ministries of
Educationand Health are settingupnotice boards inall public hospitals, polyclinicsand schools
in Tbilisi informingcitizens about organizational budgets, service entitlementsand service fees
required; and the ACPD is working out proceduresfor the registrationof and systematic follow-
up on corruption-related complaints. Work is under way to carry out baseline surveys of
informalpaymentsat the point of service inthe educationsector.

34.     Building on these achievements, the Govemment will pursue further reforms under the
PRSOprogramover the next three years, seekingto enhancethe effectiveness of anti-corruption
efforts in the delivery of social services (health and education) and create a more favorable
businessclimate. The ultimategoal of the programis to empower usersandto motivate officials
to improve their performance and reduce corrupt activities. Reform steps include: building
capacity in the ACPD and monitoringpoint of service corruptionin key service areas (providing
informationto citizens on service commitments and valid points of service charges, introducing
survey-based monitoring and citizen voice mechanisms, and publishing annual reports on
complaintsandprogressin reducingpointofservicecorruption).

35.     Thus, under the PRSO 11, notice boards in public hospitals, polyclinics and schoolswill
be posted in ten moredistrictsand intwo selected licensingagencies(e.g., buildinglicenses, and
business licenses) and at all customs check-points providing informationon required procedures
and relatedcosts. The ACPD will haveimplementedproceduresfor registeringand followingup
on complaints in key corruptionareas and will havepublished an annual report on complaints in
key corruption areas. Baseline survey results will be published and formally shared with
Parliament showing the extent of point of service informalpayments inthe education and health
sectors. The ACPD in coordination with the respectivecivil society partners will also develop
mechanisms to monitor service performance and informal payments in customs and licensing,
andpointof servicesurveyso fcorruptionwill be extendedto these areas.

36.     Underthe PRSO 111, the provisionof informationwill expand further (notice boardswill
be posted in the remaining public agencies and schools) and monitoring will continue. At this
stage, the Government's performancein reducinginformal payments at the point of service will
be very transparent, enhancing accountability for the results and incentives for effective and
aggressivereform.

Pillar 11: Improving Electricity and Gas Sector Services

37.     The poor state of the energy sector and other infrastructurecontinues to have a broad
detrimental impact on the economy and on public welfare. Despite significant investment since
the mid-l990s, incompletereforms inthe energy sector have left much o f the country inthe dark
while the sector remains financiallyunviable and a continued drainon public finances. The lack
of reliable energy has been identified as one of the top obstacles for growth and employment
generation, especially in the regions outside the capital. High levels of debt and low rates of
collectionremainmajor impedimentsto sector sustainability.

38.     The Govemment has substantially increased financing for investment in the sector from
its own resources to complement sizeable donor finance. The focus i s on rehabilitation of
generationandtransmission and on meteringand improvedtariff collectionsystems. Significant
improvementsin systemreliability and collectionrateshavebeenachieved but further steps need
to be taken. Furthermore, the gas system is in severe disrepair and additional investment is
required.

39.     We have taken several steps to help remedy the situation, consistent with agreements
with IDA under the Reform Support Credit. In June 2004, legislationwas passed to provide
energy utilities that seek bankruptcy protection, with 18 months' shieldingfrom creditors while a
financial recoveryplan was developed. The Government has worked with consultants to define
mechanisms for debt resolutionto addressthe problemsof insolvency and legacy debt of several
energy utilities. The cost structures of the transmission company Georgian State Electrosystem
(GSE), and the distributioncompany UnitedEnergy DistributionCompany of Georgia(UEDC),
were significantlyimprovedduring2004, and we haveextendeda USAID-financedmanagement
contract for UEDC by two years untilNovember2006. Our major objectivefor the power sector
is to provide paying customers with 24 hours of power supply, and without further subsidies
from the state budget, startingfall of 2006. The relationshipsbetweenpower sector entities will
bebasedon bilateralcontracts, supportedby modemregulationadaptedto our situation.

40.     We have decided to eventually privatize the power sector assets except for the
transmission system, Enguriand Vardnili hydropower plants. We recognizethat privatizationis
only a part of the solutionofthe difficult energy situation in Georgia, andthat someof the sector
improvements that are urgently neededare the preconditionsfor a successful privatization. We
believe that the sector entities' performance needs further improvement, and that the cash flow
must be sufficientto allow these entities to pay all their bills, and stop accumulatingnew debt
unless itis serviceable.

41.     In this respect, we will adjust tariffs to full cost recovery levels by end-2007. A PPIAF-
funded tariff study is scheduled for completion by end-2005, and in early 2006 we will start to
implement recommendations of the tariff study for electricity and gas, amend as necessary
legislationandtariffmethodology, and adjust tariffs accordingly. At the same time we will have
a targeted social assistance program fully operational in June 2006, in order to mitigate the
impact ofthesereformsonthe poorest segmentsof society (see below).

42.    Giventhe investments needs ofthe sector, estimatedat about $350 million over the next
5-7 years, we will need to step up financial support to the sector. In 2005, we will use funds
From recent privatizationsto provide transfers From the state budget to the power sector at the
amount o fGEL 194.5 million as comparedto GEL 78.7 million in2004. In2006 transfersto the
sector will also be substantial, butwe areconsideringplowing back the privatizationproceedsto
the sector.

43.    With the support of the PRSO 1we have prepared a Medium-TermStrategic Action plan
which addressesissuesof the energy sector structure and policy, regulation, privatization,energy
supply, financing of investments, financial viability of sector entities, and financial flows
betweenstate and the sector. The Strategic Action Plansets atime bound sequence of concrete
steps to achievesustainable24 hours' serviceof electricity.

44.    Government has also adopted an overallstrategy to deal with electricity sector debt. The
Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Ministry of Energy has elaborated a plan for the
resolution of the energy sector debts. The Electricity Transmission RehabilitationProgram I1
(the agreements signed between the Ministry of finance and KfW) will concentrate on
elaborationof concrete suggestions andproposalson the restructuringof the energy sector debts.

These proposals will then be submitted to Governmental Commission on RestructuringDebts
that will be specially created by the Government o f Georgia in early fall. That Governmental
Commission on Restructuringthe Debts will comprise high level Government officials, mainly
the Ministersand Deputy Ministers. The list of Commissionmembers is not finalizedyet.

45.     Accordingto the Agreement reached on June 28, 2005 between the GoG and KfW, the
KfW-funded project "DRA" will prepare a due diligence in relation to existing debts, will
identify and make classification of all sector debts, will elaborate proposals on necessary
legislativechanges; proposals for write offs and so on, and submit them to the Governmental
Commission.      The Commission will make a decision and present the proposal to the
Government. By end-2005, a draft Law on Electricity Sector Debt Management will be
submittedto the Parliament.

46.     We havedeveloped a strategy and implementationplanthat enables the water companies
to pay their electricity bills. With the Government funding the UEDC is in the process of
meteringall its customers. The company is installingthe communal as well as individualmeters
to register consumption. All non-paying customers: budgetary organizations, industrial and
residential customers will be disconnected and will not get electricitysupply unlessthe payment
is effected.

47.      Also as part of PRSO I,low-voltage assets have been transferred from GSE to
distributioncompany UEDC. As UEDC obtains enhancedcontrol over its electricity flows, the
company will announce delivery schedules to the consumers in periods of irregular or limited
supply when service interruptions can be forecasted. The distribution company has started
publishing performance data on its website to allow electricity customers to better monitor
progressandproblemsinthe sector.

48.     The regional power distribution company UEDC has achieved a 50 percent collection
rate (GEL 5 million monthly cash collection) in June and July 2005 compared to 30 percent
(GEL 2.2 million monthly cash collection) during May-July 2004. UEDC collection rates are
targetedto surpass 70 percentby May2006, and 80 percentby 2007.

49.     In the gas sector, we have secured US$ 40 million from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation for a first-phase repair of the north-south gas pipeline that supplies Georgia and
Armenia with Russian gas. For further rehabilitationwork, we will pursue the possibilities of
carbon credit financing, namely the sale of greenhouse gas emission reduction rights under the
CleanDevelopmentMechanismofthe KyotoProtocol. With the support ofthe PRSO 11, we will
take measures to improve the efficiency and governance in the gas sector and will decide on an
organizational model for gas supply that ensures optimum utilization o f supply from various
sources(northand east) andsecure accessto gas storagefacilities.

Pillar 111: ImprovingEnvironment for Private Sector Development

50.     Developmentof the private sector is a key priority for Georgia, to generate employment
and reduce poverty. In this context, we have recently implemented a number of reforms to
improve the investment and business climate including the adoption of a new tax code, and

 improvement inthe governanceofpublicsector. With technical assistanceprovidedby IDA and
 other donors, we intend to continue with these reforms and complement them with several
 others.

 51.     To improve permits and licensing requirements, we adopted the new law aimed at
 liberalizingthe permit and licensingsystem and reducingtheir number to the minimum. With
 the support o f the subsequent PRSOs, we will complement these measures by others to develop
 and implement the reform strategy aimed at simplifyingthe system of permission and licensing
 includingthe inspection system, and articulate and publishdetailed rightsand responsibilitiesof
 businessesand inspectors in the inspection process and ensure that these are accessible to both
 inspectors and businesses. We will also implement the standardized business licensing and
 permit procedures through the institutionalcapacity building, training, or other options. Apart
 from that amendments to the law on entrepreneurship have been approved by Parliament,
 simplifyingregistrationprocessand movingit out o fcourts.

 52.     Customs and border processing also need improvement. We will, therefore, finalize the
 new Customs code, approve it by the Cabinet of Ministers, and develop implementing
 regulations in collaborationwith the private sector. In the next two years we will complement
'this by designing and implementing an action plan to improve Customs procedures based on
 processing time measurement and coordinating control of freight at the border. To improve
 standardization, and to facilitate access to non-CIS markets, especially for food and agro-
 processed products, we will conform Georgia's regulations to those o f the WTO, and will
 introduce an internationally recognized system of accreditation, quality management and
 assurance, standardizationandtechnical regulations.

 53.     Regarding reforms on agricultural land, we have developed new legislations for
 agriculturalland privatization. At presentout of approximately 1.2 million hectares of intensive
 (i.e. arable, perennials and moving) land 60 percent is in private ownership. Ownership in this
 land is highly fragmented (approximately 0.2 hectares average plot size) and do not assure
 efficiency and substantial investments. The new law considers privatization of additional
 approximately 0.46 million hectares (40 percent) of arable, perennial and mowing lands by the
 method avoiding fragmentation and promotingbigger holdings, that in turn would attract long
 term investments in primary production as well as in the processing industry, thus creating
 additionaljobs in ruralareas.

 54.     To improve standardization, and to facilitate access to non-CIS markets, we will
 introduce an internationally recognized system of standardization and technical regulations,
 accreditation, quality management and assurance.          We adopted the new laws on (i)
 standardization; (ii)integrity of measurements; and (iii) certification of goods and services. In
 the coming months, we will develop a separate Code on Food and Drug Administration and
 ensure its compliance with international best practice and EU. With support of the PRSO
 program we will also work on institutionalarrangements. Inthe nexttwo years, with the support
 of the subsequentPRSOsand the donor community, we will also develop and implement a time
 bound action plan to establish two agencies: (i)National Agency for Standardization and
 Metrology, and(ii)NationalAccreditationAgency; we will also draft and start implementingthe
 technical safety regulations. The action plan will be complemented by (i)elaboration of

standards according to the WTO code for standardization; and, (ii)by startingto introduce an
internationallyacceptedsystemof laboratory accreditation for qualitycontrol.

55.     As one of the important elements of the improvement of the business climate the
government is considering an opportunity to invite rating agencies to conduct first-time
sovereigncredit ratingfor Georgia. We are confidentthat this will facilitate further development
of banking,corporate andpublicsectors.

56.     In addition to improvement of investment and business climate, we are considering
restructuringand privatizingthe SOEs. Our initial efforts have focused on the introduction of
audits conducted by major accounting firms, based on IAS accounting rules, for the 10 largest
SOEs. The audits o f three firms (Georgian Railways, Poti Port, and MadneuliMiningCompany)
were conductedfor 2003 but havenotbeen finalizedyet for 2004, and we have also initiatedthe
audit of the remaining seven largest SOEs by international audit firms using International
Accounting Standards.        We have appointed new supervisory boards for Medneuli and
Electrokavshiri, and completed the audits of the 2003 accounts for Electrokavishiri, and the
AirportAuthority.

57.     The privatization process has already begun with the publication of a list of
approximately 300 of the largest SOEs that are candidates for privatization. We recognizesthe
need to design and implement a privatizationprogram that incorporates a number of basic and
important principals including: transparency and equal access to information; fair value;
competitive case-by-case privatization including the transfer of residual state ownership; and
sufficient time line to allow for defensive restructuring which is needed for some of the
enterprisesprior to their privatization.

58.     Key actionsthat needto be takento create such a frameworkwould include: (i)    designing
and announcingthe principles and procedures governingthe privatization process to ensure an
open and transparent process with transaction decisions based on both price, integrity and
financial capacity of buyers to meet all required social obligations and adhere to appropriate
environmental requirements; (ii)engaging a privatization policy advisor to assist in both the
development of principles and procedures as well as their implementation; (iii)defining and
clarifyingthe rolesand responsibilitiesofthe President,Cabinet, Ministersandother government
units involved in the privatizationprocesstogether with levelof approval requiredfor each type
of privatization method likely to be used; and (iv) introducing clear mechanisms governing
coordination andcommunicationbetweenrelevantunits of government with interestseffectedby
privatizationprocess.

Pillar IV: ImprovingSocialProtection, Education, and Health Care Services

SocialProtection

59.     Our objective is to provide adequate poverty alleviation to the neediest population of
Georgia. We have taken important measures that resulted in timely payment of pensions and
other social transfers. We will have cleared the arrears in the pension system by end-2006. In
addition, as of January 2005, keeping the pre-electionpromises, we have doubled the pensions.
In the medium term, within the overall availability of resources, we will continuethe efforts to

strengthen the targeting of social assistance benefitsto the extreme poor. To that end we intend
to consolidate various cash social assistanceprograms intoa single, targeted cash family poverty
benefit. The benefit will be targeted at the extreme poor and is expected to alleviate poverty
more effectively than the existing programs. The task of developing and implementing the
benefit isentrusted to the Ministry ofLabor, Healthand SocialAffairs.

60.     To start payingthe benefitto our target population, the extreme poor households, we will
complete the following major actions at the end of 2005: (i) development o f the targeting
formula; (ii)development and issuance of documents, including an operating manual for the
benefit administration; (iii)establishment of the Employment and Social ServicesAgency that is
the administrationagency for benefit; (iv) the recruitment and trainingof the Agency's staff; and
(v) computerization of the applicants and beneficiaries data bases at the district level, including
software development.      The collection and computerization of information on applicant
householdswouldresult increation of adata- baseon vulnerable families inGeorgia. We intend
to update this data-baseregularly and use it to target not only the cash poverty benefit, but also
other social programs. It is plannedto introducethe newscheme inJune 2006.

61.     Once we start the payment of the targeted poverty benefit in cash, we will closely
monitor and evaluate its performance. We will use the monitoring and evaluation findings to
improve both the targeting mechanism and the benefit's administration arrangements. In
parallel, we will analyze reform options in order to introduce an optimal system that would
provideprotectionagainst poverty inoldage, as well as offers opportunities for voluntary private
contractualsavings.

Education

62.    Education System Reform:       We have taken significant steps to re-shape our education
system and to address its key issues as identified in the EDPRP through new legislation at
general and higher education levels. At the school level, we have developed a per capita
financing model to ensure improved use of education financing and to reward quality at the
school level Not only has the responsibilityfor financingand management,but also for quality,
been decentralized to schools through new school levelmanagement structures, such as school
Boards. Special importance is being attached to monitoring both the quality and financial
accountability of the decentralized school system. A new system of school reporting (school
self-assessment through school report cards), for example, will link indicators of school
improvementto the nationallevel indicatorsof educational progress. Full implementationofthis
program will take time to develop, but the financing formula will be put into operation in
September 2005 while full administrative details await final decisions on the structure of local
government. We are also focusingon strengthening policy and managementcapacity, including
the use of data collected by a newly created MoES Statistical Unit for policy making and the
efficientuseof humanandphysicalresources.

63.    Next Steps in Operationalizing the Reform Strategy: The World Bank funded Education
Strengtheningand RealignmentProjecthas supported boththese excitingpolicy changes as well
as changes inthe areas ofqualitycontrol andassessment, curriculumandteacher training. At the
upper levels, the first unified university examination to ensure improved transparency in the
administration of examinations is underway. We will pay increased attention to developing the

concept of a broad Quality Assurance system to monitor educational quality across the span of
general and higher education through examinations, national and international assessments as
well as school level assessments and institutionaland staff accreditationprocedures. Movingto
these new approaches will take place gradually while the system also consolidates the changes
already made to ensure their successful implementation. We will also pay more attention to
improving expenditure efficiencies given the budgetary constraints and heavy capital costs for
infrastructureand salaries. The Government has supported and intends to continue supporting
the ongoing education reforms through increasing the education budget so that new systemic
reforms will become sustainable. These program changes are beingconsolidated into a costed
education strategy consistent with the MTEF and allow maximization of available donor and
government financeto support longterm educationsector reformsand monitorable outcomes.

Health Care

64.     Health Care Reform: Georgia initiatedhealth sector reforms in 1995 aimed at improving
access to quality basic healthcare services for the population. Nonetheless, severe funding
constraints resulted in the deterioration of the public health infrastructure, and limited
availability of essential drugs and consumables. The healthcare system remained highly
fragmented and focused on specialized care. For some groups, particularly the poor, rural, and
high mountain populations, access to quality primary health care remains a severe problem.
Health care financing problems include inadequate allocationof public outlays, inefficiency in
allocationand the distributionof public finances for healthcareand high informalout-of-pocket
payments. We are at risk of not achieving some ofthe MDGs, particularlythose relatedto early
childhood and maternal mortality. There is a rapid increase in HIV/AIDS incidence and we are
workingwith the internationalcommunity to combat the disease.

65.     Since the Rose revolutionwe have focused on addressingthe shortcomings in the health
sector andare planningto increasepublic fundingto thissector. To tacklethe most urgent issues
affecting the sector we are in the midst of reviewing and revising the essential package of
services which should be funded fully by the public sector. First, with support of the PRSO
program, we plan to increasepublicfinding to the health sector startingfrom year 2007 and the
2007-2008 MTEF will adequately reflect this increase. Second, we will develop shorr and
medium term strategy to address the priority issuesaffectingthe sector. We have established a
special commission, represented by key ministry departments and Health Policy Unit (HPU).
The commissionis actively working to prioritizestrategicdirectionsof the reforms to adequately
reflect these strategies and actions in the MTEF document, and is developing implementation
planandmonitoringtools.

66.     Third, we will improve the allocative and technical eflciency of the resources by
adopting a basic benefitpackage(BBP) and better targetingof poor segments of population. In
order to ensure that preventive and essential healthcare services are adequately financed,
expenditures on health care will primarily be allocated to preventive services, primary health
careandcatastrophiccare. Startingfrom year 2006 fundingofthe preventiveand primary health
care will increase from 5 GEL (2005) to 6.75 Gel per capita. We plan to provide essential
package of basic services to the entire population, while seeking additional public hnds to
design complementary package of services targeted towards extremely poor layers of society.

Moreover, to tackle the widespread informal payments in the sector, we will attempt to improve
public awarenesson the eligible free of charge services as well as on the services, which require
official co-payments and or should be paid by the patient. Specialemphasis will be givento the
redesignofthe purchasingand paymentmechanisms.

67.     Fourth, improving the effectiveness and eflciency of the health care delively system is
essential, The Georgian healthcare system is highly fragmented, focuses on hospital-based
specialized care and is inefficient inthe way public resources are allocated. Inthe absence of an
adequate primary health care system, basic services are being provided in specialized hospitals
and polyclinics. The emergency ambulance service fails to adequately address population's
healthcare needs. Our objective is to shift the orientation of the healthcare system towards
preventive and primary health care and realign the rest of the system to support primary care.
Our medium term priority is to: (i)provide PHC facility rehabilitation, equipping and retraining
of staff, particularly in the most remote areas of the country, (ii)revise the existing hospital
master plan and prepare a hospital modernization and implementationplan; and (iii)prepare a
human resource policy and plan for longer term adjustment of human resources needs.
Accordingly, we will give priority to the creation of a strong regional hospital network, which
would remain under the public domain and provide publicly financed health services, while the
rest of the hospitalswill be gradually decentralized. Fifth, we believethat the establishment of a
system of licensing, accreditation and certification of hospitals,physicians and medical schools
is required to achieve our objectives in the health sector. New regulation regarding licensing,
accreditation and certification is currently under development.

Conclusion

68.     We recognize that over the coming years the challenge facing the Government will be to
translate early gains into lasting institutionalchange. In addition, our reform efforts focus on
making further progress in fiscal consolidationand combating corruption, the difficult work of
creating functioning administrativesystems, building a professional civil service, enhancingthe
business climate, and improving social services. These are critical to improving growth
prospects and reducing pervasive poverty. We have started taking on the challenge with the
effective implementation of the reformagendaunder the first PRSO. We are fully committed to
continuing and deepening implementation of the reform agenda under the PRSO program. At
the end ofthe periodof the PRSO program, we are confidentthat the Georgianeconomy will be
firmly placedona sustainablegrowthandpoverty reductionpath.

1.      The government's PRSP; Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(EDPRP), was presentedto the Boards o f IDA and the IMF inOctober and November 2003.
An interim lending and economic sector work program for FY04 and FY05 was presented to
the IDA Board inthe context o f the Reform Support Credit (RSC) program document inJune
2004. A Joint Staff Assessment together with the Progress Report on the EDPRP was sent to
the Boards o f IDA and IMF in June 2005. The IMF completed the second review under the
PRGF arrangement in June 2005. A proposed PRSO, the first in a series o f three single
tranche annual Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs) is under preparation by IDA
which, along with a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY06-09 are expected to be
discussedby the BoardinSeptember 2005.

2.      The Fund has taken the lead in assisting Georgia in improving macroeconomic
stability and pursuing fiscal reforms. The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy
dialogue on structural issues, focusing on: (i) strengthening public expenditure management;
(ii) improvingperformance o f the public sector; (iii) reducing corruption; (iv) deepening and
diversifying sources of growth; (v) protecting the environment; and (vi) reducing poverty.
Georgia is one o f the largest IDA borrower inthe CIS, with borrowing of US$783 million for
38 operations. A range of instruments has been used to conduct the dialogue, including
Structural Adjustment Credits. The most recent Adjustment Credit was the Reform Support
Credit (RSC) which was approved inJune 2004. The RSC supported urgent improvements in
the areas o f (i)governance/ anti-comption; (ii) finance management; and (iii)
                                                  public                                   energy
sector bottlenecks. To deepenthe assistanceinitiatedwith the RSC over the mediumterm, the
first Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) i s under preparation. The proposedPRSO
would support the objectives and the policies o f the Government EDPRP by: (i)         enhancing
public sector accountability and efficiency; (ii)improving electricity and gas sector services;
(iii) improving the environment for private sector development; and (v) improvinghealth and
education and alleviating poverty and vulnerability. Other support has come in the form o f
project support and Analytical and Advisory Assistance across a broad spectrum: education,
health, social protection, energy, roads, water and sanitation, agriculture, agricultural research
and extension, irrigation and drainage, forestry, environment, biodiversity, enterprise
development, municipal development, judicial reform, and cultural heritage. A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was prepared in 2002, and a Trade Study in 2003. The PER will
be followed by a series o f annual programmatic PERs, the first o f which i s under preparation.
A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was prepared in 2002 and a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in 2003. A series o f annual programmatic
PovertyAssessmentswill beprepared.

3.      Georgia became a shareholder and a member o f IFC in 1995. Since then, IFC has
invested about $125 million in 20 projects with 9 clients inthe financial, power, oil and gas,
and manufacturing sectors. Inthe financial sector, IFC has provided equity, long-term credit
lines, subordinated debt, and interest rate/currency swaps to TBC Bank. IFC i s a founding
shareholder of the Microfinance Bank o f Georgia (now Procredit Bank). In the housing
                                        -
                                               78

finance sector, IFC provided credit lines to the Bank o f Georgia and TBC Bank for mortgage
lending to residences and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Most recently, IFC has
provided a credit line to TBC Leasing to support the rapid growth o f their portfolio o f SME
clients; this project grows out o f two year's of technical assistance to the Government and
private sector to support the growth o f the leasing sector. Inoil transit, IFC has provided
equity and credit to local and intemational companies, including investments by British
Petroleum and other sponsors inthe constructiono fthe Baku-Supsa EarlyOilPipeline andthe
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. Other investment projects have been inelectricity distribution
(AES-Telasi), mineral water (GGMW), and glass bottle production (Ksani Glass Factory).
IFC has also provided donor-supported technical assistance to strengthen its client banks,
introduce new financial products (including leasing and housing finance), support public-
private partnerships in the energy sector, and to improve the business climate and corporate
govemance practices. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), ajoint facility o f IFC
and the World Bank, camed out an Assessment o f Administrative Procedures for Doing
Business in2003. FIAS finalized an advisory project inJuly 2004 to assist the Government in
its efforts to remove administrative obstacles to investment to improve the business
environment for private businesses, and the Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) did an
extensive study o f the barriers to SMEs, finalized in early 2005. PEP and FIAS are currently
holding joint consultations with the Government to identify concrete steps to be taken for
improvements to the business environment.

4.      Table 1 summarizes the division o f responsibilities between the two institutions. In a
number o f areas-for       example, the social sectors, rural development, environment,
infrastructure, and judicial reform-the    Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there is no
related conditionality inthe IMF-supported program. The Bank i s also leadingthe dialogue on
private sector development and energy, and Bank analysis serves as inputs into the Fund
program. In other areas-the       financial sector, public expenditure management, and civil
service reform-both    institutions have worked together. Finally, inareas like monetary policy
anddomestic customs revenue, the IMFtakes the lead.

Areas inwhich the World Bankleadsand thereis no directIMFinvolvement

5.      Inthe social sectors, IDA updates Georgia's Poverty Assessment based on quarterly
household data. IDA'Sfocus has been to improve execution o f budgetary expenditures for
health, education and poverty benefits and to raise the efficiency in the use o f scarce public
resources. Through the Social Investment Fundcredits, IDA is focusing inparticular on areas
with highpoverty levels to provide basic infrastructure to the poorest communities. IDA is
also supporting a dialogue with the government on social protection reform (safety nets,
pensions, poverty benefits, labor market institutions and policies).

6.      In education, the Adaptable Program Credit addresses a broad spectrum o f
educational reform issues, aimed at improving learning outcomes o f primary and secondary
students through curriculum reform, development o f a national assessment and examination
system, training o f teachers, provision o f learning materials, and development o f capacity to
make better use o f physical, financial, and human resources. It also tackles key financing
issues through the introduction o f a per capita based formula for financing basic education.

                                                79

While the investment needs o f school buildings are substantially higher than i s currently
affordable, the Social InvestmentFund projects continue to assist in financing urgent repairs
to school facilities in many communities.          The proposed PRSO would support the
Government's efforts ininstitutionalizingsystemic changes initiatedwith its education reform
strategy.

7.      Inhealth, IDA credits support the government inimproving health care financing,
exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a new system o f primary health care, and
improving the focus o f publicly-funded services to the poor and on priority public health
interventions. SAC 111and the SRS Credit have supported hospital restructuring. Inaddition,
IDA will be engaged in policy work in health sector reform in the context of the Medium-
TermExpenditure Framework (MTEF) andthe proposedPRSO.

8.      Ininfrastructure,support is beingprovidedthrough the Secondary andLocal Roads
Project, the Municipal Development and Decentralization Project and the Social Investment
Fund Project. These projects provide financing at the community level for critical
infrastructure needs, primarily for school and health facility heating and repair, small
hydropower schemes to provide electricity, drinking water and sanitation rehabilitation, as
well as transportation infrastructure rehabilitation. F C supported the privatization o f Tbilisi
electricity distribution through an investment in AES-Telasi, and IFC Advisory Services
advised the Government onthe managementcontract for UEDC.

9.      In rural development, IDA credits have supported development of private sector
farming and agro-processing improvements, agricultural credit, irrigation and drainage, and
agricultural research. IDA credits have also been supporting creation o f localinstitutions, such
as rural credit unions and water users associations. A Rural Development Project was
approved on May 17, 2005 with the objective to develop the productivity and profitability o f
the private agriculture sector with the aim to increase incomes and employment and reduce
povertyinrural areas..

10.     A Judicial Reform Project has provided funds for development of new court
administration and case management procedures, rehabilitation and construction o f
courthouses, a computerized network system, assistance for judicial training, and an extensive
public information and education outreach effort to inform citizens o f their rights and
communicate the government's reform efforts.

Areas inwhich the World Bankleads andits analysisserves as inputintothe IMF
program

11.     The Bank hasbeen leading the dialogue on structural reforms, especially through SAC
III,RSC,andtheupcomingproposedPRSO.Institutionbuildingandtechnicalassistancehave
been supported through the Structural Reform Support Project. The Bank also leads in the
areas o t

a)      Private Sector Development. SAC IIIand the RSC supported improvements in the
        environment for private sector development, focusing on: (i)simpler and more
        transparent licensing; (ii)strengthening credit enforcement; (iii)more transparent
        government procurement; and (iv) reduced cost o f entry for businesses. The proposed

                                               80

       PRSO would focus on improving investment climate and reducing constraints to
       private sector development in Georgia. IDA has also been supporting private sector
       participation in other areas, such as energy, urban services and agriculture. The IMF
       has worked with the authorities to initiate audits o f the 2002 accounts o f three major
       state-owned enterprises.

b)     Energy.The energy system is inpoor condition, with unreliable supply, massivenon-
       payment and unsustainable debts. IDA has been working with other donors, including
       the Fund, to introduce more private management and ownership, and to implement a
       series of short-term action plans and longer-term steps to improve the overall
       functioning o f the sector. IDA has also provided additional funding to the power sector
       in 2004. The Fund has been focusing on reducing quasi-fiscal losses in the sector,
       especially through improved bill collections, while the pursuit o f tariff policies at cost-
       recovery levels would be facilitated by a Bank-assisted review o f the tariff policy
       methodology. The RSC supported the Government inpreparation o f the energy sector
       strategic Action Plan for 2004-05, and the proposed PRSO would assist the
       Government in developing a medium term Strategic Action Plan for the Energy
       Sector.

c)     Public Sector Management. The proposed PRSO would support, inter alia,
       administrative and civil service reform, improvements in public expenditure
       management and strengthening financial accountability. The proposed Public Sector
       Management Reform Project would provide technical assistance and capacity building
       inthe first three areas. The Fundisproviding technical assistance insupport o ftax and
       customs administration reform.

d)     MunicipalFinance: The Municipal Development and DecentralizationProject I1has
       been assisting the government to review the current intergovernmental fiscal relation,
       and to suggest an equalization transfer system to compensate for horizontal fiscal
       disparities across local governments.

Areas of shared responsibility

12.    The Bank and the Fund have been working jointly in the following main areas
(supported by the Bank's RSC, SAC III,SRS, and the proposed PRSOs, several investment
operations, and the Fund's PRGF-further    assistance is anticipatedfrom IDA'SPRSO):

a)     Poverty Reduction Strategy. Both institutions have been working closely with the
       government to suppoi? the development o f the PRSP, through seminars and
       workshops, direct staff input, and donor coordination. A JSA on the progress with
       implementationo fthe Government's EDPRP was issued inJune 2005.

b)     Budget Planning and Execution. The annual programmatic Public Expenditure
       Reviews and the proposed PRSO will provide the underpinnings for systemic changes
       inexpenditure management, development o fanMTEF, andimprovements infinancial
       accountability. The Fund i s focusing on treasury reform within the Ministry o f
       Finance.
