Operation\n            (PRSO) Project for Georgia, the first in a series of three\n            proposed PRSOs, is intended to support the Government of\n            Georgia with the implementation o f reforms and policy\n            priorities of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction\n            Program (EDPRP, or the PRSP as it i s known in Georgia). The\n            PRSO will support the objectives and the policies of the\n            EDPRP by: a) strengthening public sector accountability,\n            efficiency, and transparency; b) improving electricity and\n            gas sector services; c) improving the environment for\n            private sector development; and d) improving social\n            protection, education and health care services. The success\n            of this policy operation in Georgia depends basically on two\n            main factors. First, the operation needs to well defined and\n            focused on priority issues where the medium term strategy is\n            well understood and accepted by the government. Second, any\n            reform program must be grounded in a realistic assessment of\n            the government's implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "2005-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
