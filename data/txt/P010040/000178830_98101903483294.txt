services include, among others, site investigations, topographic surveys,
schedules of construction work and cost; estimates.
ii.       The project roads are as fol:lows:
Lahore-Sheikhupura.-Lyallpur  --   83 miles
Sheikhupura-Sargodha-K'nusnab  -- 109 miles
iil      The engineering services would be carried out over a perioa of
about 15 months. The estimated total cost, including contingencies, is
about US$ 1l 7 million.  It is proposed that -DA should finance 600% of the
total cost or approximately US$ 1.0 million equivalent; this would cover
the foreign exchange component of the project, estimated at 42%, and a
portion of the local cost. The Communications and Works Department of the
West Pakistan Government would be the executing authority.
ivn       Traffic over the full length on the Lahore-Sheikhupura-Lyallpur
road on completion of its construction is expected to exceed 1,000 vehic:Les
per day, while that on the Sheikhupura-Sargodha-Khushab road is anticipat:ec
to vary betwaeen 500-l,OOO according to sections.  On the basis of presently
estimated savings to road users it appears that the expected rate of return
on the construction of these projects should be well in excess of 12%.
v.        The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$ 1.0 million equivalent. The proposed term of the Credit is 10 years
including a two-year period of grace. It is contemplated that in the event
that either IDA or the Bank should subsequently assist in the financing of
the twgo project roadis, the engineering credit would be refunded from the
proceeds of such subDsequent credit or loan.



APPRAISAL OF A
HIGHWAY ENGINEERrIG PROJECT
WEST PAKISTAN
1. BACKGROUND
l.1       The Government of Pakistan has requested a credit from the
International Development Association to help finance the costs of engineer-
i.ng for a project in West Pakistan involving the construct-on of two newT
highways, cne between Lahore, Sheikhunur-a and Lrallnur and the other
betaween Sheikhupura, Sargodha and Khushab (see map). An IDA mission
consisting of Mr, V. W. Hoag (Econom.ist) and Mrr H. Young (Engineer) first
examined the possibilities of the project in Deceinber 196h4 The purpose of
their visit was to review a feasibili-tr study of the proect prepared bv a
firm of UOS. consultants engaged by the Government of West Pakistan. After
further work on the preparation of the project by t   Comurtios and
Yorks Department, subsequent visits were made by Mr. Kaden (Engineer) in
julyl/A4ugust 1961 and in June 1966,  As El consequence of hese visits it is
row proposed that IDA assist in the financing of the detailed engineering
G: '' thes^ +VV roals through an engineer-rig crei t          Tmour.lgt T,JS Lc. m

Lahore-Lvralipur Road
1.2       Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan, is a city of over one millior
people. Lyalipur, with a population of half a million people, is becoming
a major industrial center. Existing road communications between the two
cities are below standard and involve high vehicle operating costs.
1i3       At present, two roads connect these cities.  The older3 or south
road which is 87 miles long, follows the alignment of a historical trade
route that was first surfaced as a single-lane road during the early 19301s.
Because of a shortage of funds at that time and the small volume of motorized
traffic, the extremely bad alignment of this road was not improved.  By the
e:arly 1950's the rapid groi^th of Lyallpur had generated sufficient traffic
t:o justify the construction of a new two-lane road from Sheikhupura, some
20 niles west of Lahore, to Lyallpur. I'his second route was also built to
Low standards. It passed through waterlogged and flooded areas, but again
shortage of funds prevented any serious attempt to overcome these conditions,
With the steady increase in the volume of traffic and the use of heavier
and faster vehicles its physical condition has deteriorated,



1I4       Faced with ther need for a modern, all-weathpr link between Lahore
and Lyallpur, the Government of West Pakistan (GOW?) invited the U.S.
consulting firm. of Louis Be-er  Inc , t;o car--r olit a feasibility study d rd
preliminary engineering. After investigation, the consultants rejected
the possibility of upgrad;ng et+her of' the existing roads and orom sed a
new alignment, located between the two existing routes, primarily on the
grounds; o4 its shorter distance. At the request of the Association, hon ev;er
the GOWP and its general consultants (Howard, Needles and Tamendorf - U.S.)
wno are beig f.ilanced -under LuA Creditu rl4-P.A  U1JU A  at±  c
of the alignment proposed and of other alternatives.
1.5       This review led to a modified alignment, with a 4-lane highway f'or
a distance of' !8 miles between Lahore anid Sheikhupura and two lanes for the
remaining distance tc Lyallpur. The estimated construction cost of this
highway- (83 idles) is about US$ 20 mill:ion equivalent.  This would be abo;:.
15% less than the solution originally proposed, taking into account the fect
that the first section of 18 miles woul(d be common to the Lahore-Sheikhupt1ra-
Sargodha-Khushab road (described below). This cost estimate prepared by
the GOWIP and its general consultants, oni thle basis of the original study,
has been reviewed by the Association an(d founid satisfactory. The costs are
high mainly because i) high embankments are necessary in the whTaterlogged
terrain through which the road passes; ii)  a large number of structures 's
required to cross the numerous main canals and their distributaries in tit(
area; and iii) little use can be made of the existing road which, in large
part, will be left to bullock and other animal-drawn cart traffic.
Lahore--Sheikhupura-Setrgodha-Khushab Road1
1.6       This road, which extends to Bannu, an important town on the wesl
of the Indus River, is located in the area of the historic trade routes
between Afghcanistan and the Indian subcontinent,  As mentioned, the first
section of this road - from Lahore to Sheikhupura (18 miles) - would also
be a part of the new road between Lahore and Lyallpur. From Sheikhupura a
new highway would go to Sargodha, a town with a population of some l50,00(
people and the largest agricultural market in the area. The present road
connection between Sheikhupura and Sargodha is partly one-lane, without
suitabLe river crossings, and does not *provide adequate facilities for eco-
nomical all-aeather transport.  The route proposed would be about 21 mileS
shorter than the diversion via Chiniot, which has to be used at times.,
1.7       Beyond Sarpodha the existing road to Khushab, a regional market
with a population of about 25;ooo; is in better condition. The growing
traffic from the northern and western areas of Pakistan to the Lyallpur/
Lahore area;. however; requires that the neW hi,ghway be extended to Khusha'^
where -the main roads from the west and the north join.
1.8       Two main bridges, one crossing the Chenab River and the other the
JheluTmi River, are required on this route.  These will be designed by the
relevant Department of the GOWP, which is already performing the same sertv'ice2
satisfactorily for similar types of bridges under Credit 51h-PAK, Foll-oing



present practice, the Denartment's design will be reviewed later by con-
sultants.
19       On the basis of the feasibility study and preliminary engineering
prepar-e by TIouis Berger, the constructiLon of the SheJkhunura-Sargodha-
Khushab road (109 miles, including the bridges across the Chenab and the
Jheluin River) would cost about US$ 26 mLllion,
Economnic_Jusificatic:n
1.10      Or.e 4ri.JL1p4  benef.t of  he project is an expected i
the quantity and quality of agricultural production.  Output of perishables,
in particular, is expected to gro-w because or the rapidly r.sing Cemand n.
the many large urban markets in the Punjab area. Another expected benefil
is a reduction in total distribution costs by lhe earlier release of funds.
tied up in the transit and warehousing of agricultural and manufactured
goods eldU a -reduction in transport costs. This is anticipated bo lea' to
a fall in production costs thereby increasing the purchasing power of exists.
ing cotnsumers and bringing potential consuiers into the market. The project
will aLso aid the competitive position of Pakistan exports originating fron
the areas served. The savings to road users, assuming no traffic growth
after the first year of opening of the roads, discounted over their econcm1?a
life, are presently estimated to produce economic returns well in excess of:
12% and justify proceeding to final engineering at this time.
1.11      The design standards envisaged for the roads are appropriate to
the traffic volumes expected.  Terminal-to-terminal traffic on the Lahore-
Lyallpur road, for example, is forecast to be about 1,000 vehicles per day
in the year after the_ opening of the road. Higher volumes are expected on
intermediate sections because of shorter distarne traffic, and on the first
18-mile section between Lahore and Sheikhupura, which is coimmon to both
project roads, because of traffic between Lahore, Sargodha and the west.
On the Sheikhupura-Sargodha-Khushab road traffic, at its opening, is expected
to vary between 500-1,000 vehicles per day according to sections, Over the
past decade, vehicle registrations in the area have been increasing at an
average rate of about 11% p.a., with sales of motor fuel averaging 18% p.a.
The consultants forecast a long-term traffic growth rate averaging about 8%
p.a. on the project roads. Although this may be a little high, traffic
growth at even half this rate would raise the expected economic returns allo'Te
15%t
ll2      While the present unusually high proportion of commercial vehicles
(60-80%), according to section) can be expected to decline, it is anticipated
that such vehicles mill continue to form a substantial part of future tr2f2i.
The project roads are not directly competitive with existing rail lines :.n
the area, which are circuitous branch lines.  Inland water transport is
negligible and can be ignored.

Government Administration
1.13      The highway network of West F'akistan is at present administered
by the Department of Communications and Works. General consultants,
engaged under Credit 54-PAK. are assisting the Government to reorganize
and improve this Department. They have already formulated several re-
commendations, includine the separation of highway ooerations (including
bridges) from other activities; the centralization of the planning, design,
and sunervision of construction of major highway orolects in the head office:
the organization of traffic counts and origin and destination surveys; and
imnroved administratiPve arrangements for contractor's working conditions.
The Government is gradually taking measures to implement some of these
recom,endatins; others mayr st11 remnin a ce-onditions for a later cons-
truction credit if they have not been satisfactorily implemented by that i;imn,
20  TIM ENGINEERINGLPRJa.SE CT
2.1.      The project consists of consultants' services to complete the
detailed engineering (including the preparatio    f designs, cos  estimates
and bidding documents) for construction of the Lahore-Sheikhupura-Lyallpur
and Sheikhupura-Sargodha_Khlushab roads; the design, preparation of biddir-
documents and cost estimates by the GOTP's Communications and Works Depart-
,merit of two mai, bridges crossing the Cheenab and Jhelum rivers, and the
review of these designs, documents and estimates by consultants. The projject
is expecteU to take about i5 months.
2.2       On the Associationis advice the GOWP has entered into draft
contractual arrangements with two foreign consulting firms and their res-
pective Pakistani associates: Sir William Halcrow and Partners ('UJK,) in
association with Incorporated Consulting Engineers for services on the
Lahore-Sheikhupura-Lyallpur road and with Pacific Consultants (Japan) in
association with Zafar and Associates for the Sheikhupura.Sargodha-Khusha'b
road. The consultants are fully respornsible for the execution of the cont-ract.
The draft contracts and the priced proposals of the consultants have been
reviewed and found satisfactory to the Association. On the granting of an
IDA Credit the GOWP would sign the contracts with the consultants so that
work could begin immediately thereafter. The GOWP has not yet decided which
consulting firm will be responsible for reviewing the design of the two
bridges, but since the bridges are on the road Sheikhupura-Sargodha-Khushab
it has indicated that it will give first consideration to the firm selected
to provide the engineering services on this road.
2.3       The services to be provided by the consultants and the tasks t,-
be undertaken by the GOWSP during the period prior to issuing invitations to
bicd for construction are as followis:

(i)  Site investigations, hydraulic aspects of the
waterways, soils, etc.;
(ii)  topographic surveys;
(iii)  detailed design of the foundations, the bridge
structures and the river training works;
(iv) specifications,bills of quantities and all other
bidding documents; and
(v)  cost estimates and schedules of construction work;



(vi)  initiation of the acquisition of such land and
access thereto as is required for the orderly and
economic execution of the construction work; and
(vii-)  prequalification of contractors with the assistance
of the consultants (b) below.
b)  By Consultants:
(i)   Review of structural computations, designs, cost
estimates, with appropriate recommendations, and
the preparation of bidding documents.
2.!4      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 1,660,000
-qi_-alent. Th's cost- exc-lutdes t4-axes b*ut 4inic 1ludes UQ"$y 63.,000 e q uiv n- n +n

the consultants referred to in para. 2,.2 above and partly on the GOSP's
estimate on the basis of simlilaar work in connection with Credit h- PAKN tI e
contingencies provision is acceptable. The foreign exchange component of'
the- proJectU,, on the basis of the priced proposals, is estimated to be h2%.
Figures for similar recent engineering work in Pakistan have varied betweern
1407o-6o%. The proposed Credit of US$ L,O million equivalent would represent
approximately 60% of' the project's cost' and would be applied to the payment
in full of tnhe foreign exchange costs and to a portion of the local currency
costs. The GOWP would finance the reii=ining 40% of the total cost.
2 5       The executing authority for the project would be the Communicat;ions
and Works Department, assisted by the general consultants.
2.6       Under the West Pakistan Tolls on Roads and Bridges Ordinance, 1962,
the GOWP has the power to levy tolls on the use of any public road or
bridge.  So far the use of tolls has been restricted to specific brIdges, but
it has decided that on the Karachi-Hyderabad road, which is being built uinder
Credit; 54-PlK, tolls will be collected. It has informed the Association thei;
it int;ends that the roads in this project will also be designated as tol'L
facilities. Provision has been made in the cost estimates for the small
additional amount of design work that this entails, The economic return is
unlikely to be greatly affected by the collection of reasonable tolls
because of the great distance and other savings offered by the project roads
as compared with alternative routes.
2.7       The GOWP has given an assurance that during the design and
enginesering phase of this project it would initiate proceedings to acquire
and obtain entry to such land as is necessary to ensure that the ultimate
construction works -bake place in a timely and economical manner.
2,8       The use of an engineering credit in this case will enable any
subsequent loan or credit for construction of the roads to be based on
detaiLed engineerina and more accurate cost estimates. The cost estimates
will also be able to reflect the experience gained in contracting for the



-7-
Karachi-Hyderabad road which is to be the first major highway with modern
design standards, being built in West Pakistan by foreign contractors.  A
review of the economirc justification- ot he basis of t.he detailed cost
estimates will be possible and is provided for in the project. While the
engineering is being prepared work on acqu1ring right-of-1^7ay will nroceed
Thus, should a loan or credit be made subsequently for the construction work,
disburemen'tS could be .made with, a m,.nhmu of Aela-y
2.9       Apporaisal Jor such, a construction loan or a credit for the two
highways could take place as soon as the detailed cost estimates and the
re vise  econom.4c JustifiLcation Lhave been prepared. Or,J 4th,e basis-

3. RECOMMNDATION
3.l       The proposed project, which provides for the preparation of
designs, cost estimates and other engineering services for the subsequent
construction of two ;new major highways and bridges in 'West Pakistan has
been well investigated and planned. A satisfactory economic justification
for tne works can be expected.
3.2       The GOwP has given assurances that it will engage the services
of consultants, acceptable to the Association and on terms satisfactory to
the Association, who will be responsible for the provision of the engineering
services provided for in the project.
3.3       The GOWP has also given assurances that it will immediately take
all necessary steps to acquire and obtain entry on to such land as is
necessary for the orderly and economical execution of the construction works.
3.4       It has also given an assurance that it will provide on a timely
basis all such local funds as are required for the satisfactory execution of
the project, which is anticipated to take 15 months.
3.c;      The project forms a suitable basis for an Engineering Credit of
US$ 1.0 million equivalent. The proposed term of the Credit is 10 years
including a two-year period of grace.
