The Bank\n            performance varied from marginally unsatisfactory, to\n            marginally satisfactory, and, the lack of Government\n            commitment to privatization, resulted in an unsatisfactory\n            Borrower performance. Lessons address first, the problems on\n            the line of credit, and technical assistance (TA)\n            components. Fixing the business environment, in parallel\n            with offering a line of credit, requires reforms in the\n            financial sector, in tandem with improved legal, and\n            judiciary framework, particularly dispute resolution\n            mechanisms, and collateral systems; but mostly, the\n            instrumental potential of a credit line should have been\n            used to influence policy reforms in those areas, in addition\n            to identifying financial inter-mediation early on, and\n            assessing the relevance of the credit line. The provision of\n            TA should be ensured by policy dialogue, and government\n            commitment, in synergy between the credit, and all TA\n            components. Second, on the sector reform, and privatization\n            components, rather than confront parliamentary deadlock, the\n            project could have experienced with community based\n            infrastructure programs, which do not require parliamentary\n            approval; and, explicit project objectives, where\n            privatization is but a mean, would have benefited\n            infrastructure reform."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
