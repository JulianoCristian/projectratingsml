Please refer to the above captioned Project Agreement as amended.
We are pleased to advise you that as a result of your request dated August 20,

applications and requests for Sub-loans.
Consequently, paragraph 3 (c) of Section I of Schedule 1 is amended by replacing 
the date "June 30, 1997" by the date "December 31, 1997".
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
this letter in the spaces provided below.  This amendment letter shall be executed in 
two counterparts, each of which shall be an original.  Upon your confirmation, please 
return one fully executed original to us.
The provisions of this amendment letter will become effective as of the date of 
this letter once the Association has received one fully executed original of this 
amendment letter.
Because of his interest in the matter, a copy of this amendment letter is being 
sent to the Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Haiti.
