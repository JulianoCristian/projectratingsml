Re:
Haiti: Cr. No. 2071-HA
(Industrial Restructuring and Development Project)
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency,
We refer to the above-mentioned Development Credit Agreement between the 
Republic of Haiti (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (IDA), 
dated February 2, 1990, as amended (the Agreement), and your letter dated May 24, 1999 
requesting an amendment to the Agreement to allow additional categories of expenses to 
cover operational expenses, such as purchase of office supplies and equipment and 
travel an supervision costs, as well as costs related to the training and education of 
the CMEP’s, other officials of the Borrower, and public enterprises. 
We are pleased to advise you that, pursuant to the discussions between staff of 
the Borrower and IDA, and your May 24 letter, IDA agrees to further amend the 
Agreement as follows:
Schedule 1:
(a)
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is deleted and 
replaced in its entirety by the table set forth in the Attachment to this 
Letter-Amendment.
(b)
Paragraph 2 is renumbered paragraph 3, and a new paragraph 2 is added to 
read as follows:
“2.
For the purpose of this Schedule, the term “Operating Expenses” 
means all 
other expenses incurred on account of Project implementation, 
management and monitoring, 
including office supplies and materials, 
communications expenses, travel and supervision 
costs, salaries of 
incremental support staff but excluding salaries of officials of the 
Borrower’s civil service.” 
Kindly confirm your agreement, on behalf of the Borrower, with the terms of the 
Letter Amendment and its Attachment, by signing and dating the counterpart of this 
Letter in the spaces provided below. Upon receipt by IDA of a fully countersigned 
counterpart of this Letter Agreement, the above amendment will be deemed retroactively 
effective as of December 10, 1997.
Very truly yours,
