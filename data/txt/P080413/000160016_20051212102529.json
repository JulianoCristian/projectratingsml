The\n            Program objectives and its subsequent phases will contribute\n            to the reduction of HIV infections, and mitigate the\n            socio-economic impact of the epidemic in the Great Lakes\n            Region, by developing regional collaboration, and\n            implementing interventions that can add value to the efforts\n            of each individual country. This project will thus establish\n            HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation\n            programs for mobile, and vulnerable groups such as refugees,\n            transport sector workers, and highly affected/infected\n            populations within the region states, and, enhance prospects\n            for coordinated approaches addressing HIV/AIDS prevention,\n            care, treatment and mitigation among the States. Project\n            components are as follows. The first component, support to\n            refugees, and displaced persons will provide services to a\n            limited number of such populations, and could include the\n            full range of prevention, care, treatment and mitigation,\n            namely through provision of services and goods (very little\n            civil works, primarily rehabilitation is envisioned).\n            Component 2 - Support to HIV/AIDS related networks concerns\n            transport networking, and will focus on a) long-haul workers\n            and those communities and groups associated with them, and,\n            b) on two principal transmission corridors, namely\n            Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma, and,\n            Dar es Salaam-Dodoma-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma. This\n            component will provide important reinforcement of national,\n            and under-funded regional advocacy efforts to reduce the\n            stigma of those infected and affected; and, engage in the\n            sharing and testing of people living with HIV/AIDS, through\n            support practices by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),\n            and the private sector for this vulnerable population.\n            Component 3 - support to Regional health-sector\n            collaboration will be provided for a) an inventory of\n            effective interventions and information sharing, b) review\n            of protocols, materials and training opportunities for\n            prevention and treatment, c) information exchange on\n            refugee, displaced, or returnee concerning HIV/AIDS\n            health-related programs, d) transport sector HIV/AIDS\n            strategy coordination and piloting of targeted transport\n            packages along two main regional roads, and. e) information\n            exchange on drug policies and procurement. Finally,\n            Component 4 - Management, capacity strengthening, monitoring\n            and evaluation, and reporting, covers three activities: 1)\n            administration and management; 2) capacity strengthening and\n            Policy discussion/technical support; and, 3) monitoring and\n            evaluation, and reporting activities."}, "docdt": "2005-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
