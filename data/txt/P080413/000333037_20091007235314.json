ON HIV/AIDS AND REFUGEES", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "In the Great Lakes Region of Africa\n            (GLR), populations frequently move within borders and across\n            the borders of the six countries - Democratic Republic of\n            the Congo (DRC), Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and\n            Kenya, as a result of civil conflict, as well as trade and\n            ethnic ties. Such mobility, particularly as a result of\n            conflict-related displacement, can act as a source of HIV\n            infection to host populations and can create situations in\n            which these populations are extremely vulnerable to HIV\n            infection. According to the World Bank draft guidelines for\n            social assessment of HIV/AIDS projects, a major analytical\n            and operational tool for development interventions\n            associated with HIV/AIDS prevention, care, support, and\n            mitigation, poverty and gender issues are at the heart of\n            the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This implies that social, cultural\n            and economic factors are likely to play a significant role\n            in the spread of HIV/AIDS. Further, as a result of this\n            mobility and the vulnerability of these populations to HIV\n            transmission and infection, special initiatives are needed\n            to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in the GLR. This requires a\n            collaborative effort between the six countries that\n            constitute the GLR if the spread of HIV/AIDS is to be\n            controlled. Therefore, such initiatives must be based on a\n            thorough understanding of factors influencing HIV/AIDS\n            transmission within these populations, and between these\n            populations and others. Social and gender assessment of\n            HIV/AIDS in refugee and Internally Displaced Populations\n            (IDPs) in the three selected GLR countries, Tanzania,\n            Uganda, and the DRC; was designed to investigate these\n            social, economic, cultural, and behavioral factors that\n            influence the transmission of HIV. This assessment will\n            provide information to the recently formalized Great Lakes\n            Initiative on AIDS (GLIA) as well as national stakeholders\n            that will guide the development of the appropriate HIV/AIDS\n            initiatives in the region. The overarching objective of this\n            study was to: (i) improve the understanding of the social,\n            gender and economic patterns of interaction within the\n            refugees and IDP; and (ii) advance policy-makers and program\n            managers knowledge of how HIV/AIDS affects these populations\n            and the host communities."}, "docdt": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
