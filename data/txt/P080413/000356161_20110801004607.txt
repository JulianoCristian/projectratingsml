1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The context at appraisal was characterized as follows: (i) a difficult socio-
economic regional situation stemming from conflicts, genocides, and natural disasters
which fueled vulnerability and massive displacement of populations; (ii) a dire
epidemiological situation which called for urgent action with the Great Lakes sub-region
estimated to have a high HIV burden; and (iii) emerging experience with regional
approaches that were viewed as adding value to national level investments.

2.        As noted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) the cumulative number of
refugees and displaced persons was estimated by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) at over 6.5 million. The Great Lakes countries were estimated to
have over 6 million people living with HIV/AIDS out of 25 million in Sub-Saharan
Africa (UNAIDS, 2004). HIV adult (15-49) infection rates in the GLIA member
countries ranged from about 4.0 to close to 9.0 percent.1 Four of the countries in the
region (Kenya, DR Congo, Tanzania and Uganda) were amongst the nine highest
tuberculosis (TB) burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa with up to 75 percent of TB
patients in some countries co-infected.

3.        In light of high levels of mobility and vulnerability the proposed regional
approach was critical to providing complementary support to ongoing country initiatives
to address the HIV epidemic. The Great Lakes Initiative on HIV/AIDS (GLIA),
established in 1998, was piloting a number of promising cross-border interventions in the
transport sector, and supporting cross fertilization of experiences among member states.
There was a consensus among the countries that they needed to go beyond these modest
efforts to create the critical mass of regional programs and policies that could accelerate
their collective effort to stem the pandemic. Recognizing the potential mutual benefit of
harmonizing policies and programs, member states came together to broaden GLIA’s
institutional mandate and strengthen its capacity to effectively coordinate HIV/AIDS
interventions in the context of the Bank-funded GLIA Support Project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.       The development objectives of the project were to facilitate: (i) establishment
of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation programs for mobile and
vulnerable groups such as refugees, transport sector workers, and highly affected/infected
populations in each of the GLIA member states; and (ii) enhancement of prospects for
coordinated approaches addressing HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment and mitigation
among the GLIA member states.

 HIV adult infection rates were estimated as follows: Burundi (6.0%); DRC (4.2%); Kenya (6.7%);
Rwanda (5.1%); Tanzania (8.8%); and Uganda (4.1%), December 2003 data provided in 2004, UNAIDS.

                                              9
5.       The key performance indicators for the GLIA supported areas were set out in
the PAD as follows: (i) a reduction in HIV prevalence in the refugee and surrounding
populations; (ii) a reduction in the number of infected infants born to HIV infected
mothers; (iii) an increase in the number of youth (aged 15-24) reporting condom use
during sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner (adapted UNGASS indicator), 2 (iv)
improved gender sensitivity in the target population; and (v) an increase in the number of
youth respondents (aged 15-24) who correctly identify ways of preventing HIV
transmission and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission or prevention
(adapted UNGASS indicator).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.        The primary beneficiaries of the project were: (i) vulnerable groups, including
refugees, returnees, internally displaced people (IDP), residents of the surrounding
communities, including youth (15-24); (ii) mobile groups, such as long distance transport
workers as well as the groups and communities with whom they interact; and (iii) people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and their network organizations.

1.5 Original Components

7.       Component l: HIV/AIDS support to refugees, affected areas surrounding the
refugee communities, internally displaced people, returnees (US$8.0 million). This
component aimed to provide services to a limited number of targeted populations, and
would include the full range of prevention, care, treatment and mitigation. Program
content would be determined by what is learned from refugee programs and by the need
to ensure synergies with national programs. UNHCR would be responsible for scaling up
HIV activities in refugee camps (US$5 million), and the national AIDS Commissions
would coordinate activities in the surrounding communities (US$3.0 million) with each
country selecting two priority catchment areas.

8.       Component 2: Support to HIV/AIDS related networks (US$3.0 million). The
second component aimed to enhance “AIDS Competence” of long-haul transportation
workers and PLWHA by developing: (i) management capacity of the networks and lead
member organizations in planning, financial management, resource mobilization, and
M&E; and (ii) HIV/AIDS learning capacity and transfer of knowledge between network
members. Transport networking would focus on two principal transmission corridors: (i)
Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma, and (ii) Dar es Salaam-
Dodoma-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma, covering both the truckers and the
communities and groups with whom they interact. Sub-regional networking of PLWHA
groups would: (i) provide important reinforcement of national and under-funded regional

advocacy efforts; and (ii) engage in the sharing good practices. Intermediary institutions
would provide management training, and support AIDS competence activities, including
piloting knowledge rooms along the transport corridors.

9.        Component 3: Support to Regional health-sector collaboration (US$3.0
million). The regional health sector component provided support for five key activities:
(i) an inventory of effective interventions and sharing of information, (ii) review of
protocols, materials, and training opportunities for prevention and treatment, (iii)
information exchange on refugee, IDP, returnee HIV/AIDS health-related programs, (iv)
transport sector HIV/AIDS strategy coordination and piloting of targeted transport
packages along two main regional corridors, and (v) information exchange on drug
policies and procurement.

10.       Component 4: Management, capacity strengthening, monitoring and
evaluation, and reporting (US$6.0 million). This component covered three activities
aimed at strengthening GLIA’s capacities: (i) administration and management, including
support for core professional staff, a fiduciary management agent, GLIA country focal
points, and operating expenses; (ii) capacity strengthening and policy/technical support,
including fiduciary, management, and advocacy training; and policy discussion,
development, and technical support for other cross-cutting issues (e.g. gender sensitive
HIV/AIDS services for mobile population programs); and (iii) monitoring and
evaluation, and reporting.

1.6 Revised Components

11.      The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.       While the December 2008 Mid-Term Review (MTR) joint assessment
recommended a restructuring to formalize proposed changes to the results framework,
this was not done for various reasons (e.g. inability of task team to process the
restructuring quickly, difficulties in reaching consensus expeditiously among six
countries, insufficient Bank management support). The restructuring would have
consisted of two critical changes: (i) dropping prevalence and social/gender outcome
indicators; (ii) refining other outcome indicators and intermediate indicators to better
reflect the PDOs. Even though the results framework was not formally restructured,
GLIA stakeholders and the Bank team were tracking and reporting on several new
indicators. The ICR team noted that not restructuring the project was a missed
opportunity to take into account early lessons, and recalibrate the results framework. The
MTR recommendation to extend the time frame for implementation was taken into
account with a 21-month extension (i.e. from March 2009 to December 2010).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.       Preparation: The project was prepared by a strong Bank team in close
collaboration with the GLIA member states and several key partners, including UNHCR
and UNAIDS (United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS). The task team successfully
addressed various challenges during the preparation phase and facilitated a process of
developing a common vision and a joint regional agenda among six countries which was
well appreciated by all parties. The task team conducted an assessment of regional
institutions early in the preparation process and selected the GLIA Secretariat based on
its unique mandate and ongoing collaboration with UNAIDS targeting vulnerable groups.
Management support was strong as evidenced by the level of resources provided, and by
the quality of the technical advice. As noted during the August 2004 Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) there was recognition of the substantial progress made by
the task team in a difficult work and political environment where several of the member
states did not have diplomatic relations. The panel provided appropriate advice on
technical, operational, and safeguards issues. It endorsed the proposed AIDS competence
methodology as an innovative tool of potential use to the targeted transport and PLWHA
networks. Both the panel and management correctly identified the institutional
arrangements as a key issue, and recommended that the GLIA Secretariat be reinforced,
and key fiduciary functions be initially outsourced.

14.       The readiness of project activities was discussed and the task team provided
assurances that work plans and detailed budgets had been developed with GLIA country
representatives for each of the components. The task team pointed out that UNHCR
worked closely with member states during project preparation, and provided support in
drafting the work plans for refugee sites. Activities supported by UNHCR got off the
ground quickly but that did not appear to be the case for other components, suggesting
different levels of readiness.

15.      Design: The project objectives and activities were in line with the Country
Assistance Strategies (CAS) of the six GLIA member countries. 3 The rationale for a
regional project was well presented in terms of tackling cross border issues which were
not adequately addressed by national programs. Risks and mitigation measures were
generally well identified. For example, the risks that the fiduciary environment was not
tested and there was insufficient capacity were well mitigated by retaining a Fiduciary
Management Agency (FMA) for the first year. Use of specialized agencies, such as
UNHCR and its sub-contractors, which were well placed to address the needs of
refugees, proved effective in reaching underserved groups, and mitigating the risk that the
GLIA Secretariat would have difficulties carrying out the full range of responsibilities.



3
  All six CAS identified HIV prevention and control as key strategic priorities, and most identified regional
integration as a means for controlling the spread of communicable diseases.


                                                    12
16.        A Social and Gender Assessment (recognized as best practice by the Bank’s
gender group), was conducted in the DRC, Tanzania and Uganda, and informed the
design of the project in a number of key areas, including the emphasis placed on
empowerment of mobile populations to address the family’s basic needs and minimize
transactional sex which is a key factor in HIV transmission; and the strategy of targeting
both refugees and the surrounding communities correctly aimed to promote equity in
service provision, foster solidarity, and minimize the risk of strained relations. The use
of Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS) at inception and completion was best practice,
generating important information about the key drivers of the HIV epidemic, and
facilitating an assessment of progress on key performance indicators. With the exception
of the BSS other Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) activities were not contracted out.

17.      The task team drew key lessons from the successful Abidjan/Lagos HIV/AIDS
Transport Corridor which inspired the institutional arrangements for the GLIA Support
Project. While a new organization was established for the Abidjan/Lagos operation in the
case of GLIA the Secretariat existed since the late 90s. Moreover, the institution
benefited from strong support from the Government of Rwanda which was providing
accommodations to host the Secretariat, and was willing to request a PPF on behalf of the
other member states and run the risk of having to repay back the funds in case the project
did not get off the ground. While the choice of the GLIA Secretariat as the institutional
home for the project appears sensible, an explicit capacity building phase should have
been identified and simpler flow of fund mechanism and Results Framework could have
been adapted. On balance, given the unique and bold nature of the operation the design
was reasonable.

18.        Quality at Entry: The quality at entry could have been stronger, to facilitate a
more rapid start up. Despite having a US$0.6 million Project Preparation Facility to
facilitate recruitment of the FMA and preparation of detailed operational manuals and
work plans readiness to jump start the project activities was tenuous, as reflected in the 1-
year delay in effectiveness due to difficulties and delays in meeting the conditions of
effectiveness, setting up project accounts, and selecting intermediary agencies. 4

2.2 Implementation

19.       Three main factors slowed down implementation: (i) inadequate management
capacity of the GLIA Secretariat in relation to its revamped mandate; (ii) cumbersome
flow of funds mechanisms, which resulted in protracted delays in channeling funds to
beneficiary organizations; and (iii) weak M&E capacity which rendered difficult the


4
   The conditions of effectiveness included: signature of Headquarters Agreement relating to GLIA
privileges and immunities; adoption of the Operations Manual by the Council of Ministers; appointment of
five GLIA Secretariat staff; selection of Financial Management Agent; establishment of procurement and
financial management system; and development of terms of reference for an independent auditor.




                                                  13
monitoring of project activities, validation of the data, and assessment of impact. Even
though the GLIA Secretariat was not a new structure it was assigned substantial new
roles and responsibilities. The Secretariat needed to recruit core staff, set up fiduciary
systems, and sub-contract the financial management functions. Its governance structure
had some limitations, including weak accountability relationships (e.g. difficulties of the
Secretariat to use its authority over member states to facilitate the systematic introduction
of harmonized protocols), and a policy of recruiting staff based on nationality and not
merit. The Secretariat encountered problems recruiting and retaining staff, which
hindered performance.

20.       The flow of funds mechanism was complex with: (i) centralized process of
channeling funds to countries; and (ii) cumbersome procedures at national level in some
countries which contributed to lengthy delays (i.e. Kenya and Tanzania did not receive
funds until 2008 as they had difficulties providing timely financial reports). Moreover,
there were delays in providing country contributions (e.g. DR Congo) to the GLIA
Secretariat. The M&E shortcomings continued to plague the implementation phase.

21.        As a result of these various issues, the project was first rated at risk one year
after effectiveness, rebounded by the December 2008 MTR, but several key ratings (e.g.
PDO) deteriorated by project completion in December 2010, as shown in Annex 4. The
Bank should have moved swiftly to restructure the project and extend the closing date
immediately following the MTR. Performance was picking up, 50 percent of the funds
were still available, and hence there was time to recalibrate the PDO, performance
indicators, and implementation arrangements. A restructuring could have made it easier
to monitor progress and assess impact. There was insufficient leadership from the Bank
in guiding the restructuring process which required extensive consultations and consensus
building among the six GLIA member states. A December 2009 Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) review of the project identified many of the same issues raised in the ICR
but was particularly critical of Bank management for providing insufficient support, and
of the task team for creating a new institution, and targeting the wrong population.5

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

22.      The design of the project’s M&E system had major shortcomings as recognized
by the MTR, implementation was weak, and there was limited evidence of data
utilization. The major issues can be summarized as follows:




5
  The ICR mission disagreed with the QAG panel that the project targeted the “wrong population”. This
conclusion stems from a rapid epidemiological assessment which found that fishermen, long distance truck
drivers, military, and female sex workers were at increased risk of HIV transmission and were relatively
neglected. The focus on refugees seemed sensible as these groups were not the responsibility of any
individual country. The project did target long distance truck drivers and their clients (female sex workers),
and other groups (military, prisoners) were clearly the responsibility of national governments.


                                                     14
       Inappropriate outcome indicators which were qualitative in nature (e.g. increase
        in social and gender conditions) or could not be easily attributable to the project
        (i.e. reduction in HIV prevalence rates).
       Incomplete baseline data for performance indicators with two important
        exceptions ---condom use and correct HIV knowledge. In addition, the
        Development Grant Agreement (DGA) included only a subset of the PAD
        performance indicators and there were minor discrepancies between the two
        documents.
       Partial behavioral data which limits the evidence for assessing impact. While
        use of Behavioral Surveillance Surveys for tracking changes in knowledge and
        behavior is one of the single most innovative aspects of this operation and makes
        the GLIA project unique among the MAP operations, coverage was incomplete. 6
       Limited capacity at national and regional levels, with GLIA country focal points
        not devoting sufficient time to validating data, and the Secretariat having
        difficulties establishing an effective regional M&E system. In spite of the Bank’s
        efforts to assist the Secretariat and the countries to introduce procedures for
        quality assurance there was generally limited progress with only a couple of data
        audits and spot checks performed.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23.    Environmental issues were adequately addressed, including appropriate disposal
of waste in refugee camps. Participating countries had ongoing HIV/AIDS Projects, as
part of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (MAP), which required
preparation of Waste Management Plans that governed all national activities, including
those funded under the GLIA project. Gender issues received adequate attention during
supervision missions.

24.      Fiduciary issues were generally well handled by the GLIA Secretariat. The
institution maintained sound financial management systems, ensured key personnel
(including an internal auditor) were in place, and produced timely interim financial and
audit reports in compliance with the provisions of the DGA. In spite of some initial
challenges with the FMA (e.g. perceived high cost, insufficient capacity building) the
Secretariat ensured a smooth transition to building in house capacity with the Bank
fiduciary team providing support from the Country Office in Rwanda where the GLIA
Secretariat was based. As in the case of other MAP operations, the major financial issues
which impeded implementation were delays by governments in submitting financial
reports, and in providing government counterpart contributions to the GLIA Secretariat.
At the time the last ISR was finalized there were significant amounts of unaccounted


6
  Baseline BSS surveys were conducted in Kenya and Rwanda (2004), Tanzania (2005), and Uganda
(2006) with the follow up surveys carried out in 2010. Across the seven sites, close to 7,300 participants
were sampled at baseline and slightly more than 6,000 at follow up. Surveys were not conducted in Burundi
and DRC due to difficult country conditions and the end of project survey was not carried out in Rwanda
due to disagreements on modalities for conducting the survey between UNHCR and the Government of
Rwanda.

                                                   15
funds which were reflected in an MU rating. By project completion the GLIA Secretariat
and the member states made a concerted effort to address this issue with all funds
accounted for, with roughly US$0.6 million remaining unspent and to be returned to the
World Bank. Furthermore, the Secretariat’s perseverance paid off by project completion
with all arrears cleaned up, demonstrating strong ownership of member states. As a
result of these various factors, the overall FM rating for the project is rated as marginally
satisfactory.

25.     On procurement the ICR mission found that the mix of methods and the
management of procurement were well done. The bulk of the procurement was through
UN agencies (roughly 48 percent), the second most important method was individual
consultants (about 37 percent), which included salaries for the GLIA Secretariat,
followed by the competitive recruitment of firms through Quality and Cost Based
Selection, QCBS, (about 13 percent). Use of direct contracting was less than 1 percent,
which is reasonable given that this procurement method is less competitive and should be
used only on an exceptional basis. Based on the assessment conducted the procurement
aspects are rated as satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

26.       A formal request for a follow up operation and a detailed concept note for a
second phase were submitted to the World Bank by the chair of the GLIA Council of
Ministers (CM) on March 16, 2010, reflecting continued strong commitment and
ownership. The Bank suggested that the GLIA Secretariat submit a proposal to the
Global Fund which was done during Rounds 8 and 10 but rejected. 7

27.        The Bank’s response not to proceed with a follow up operation must be
understood in the rapidly evolving regional and global context. The GLIA member states
are progressively moving towards broader health systems strengthening, focusing on
consolidation of national HIV/AIDS efforts, and increasingly relying on financing from
other partners (e.g. Global Fund, United States). There has been substantial progress in
containing the HIV epidemic in the GLIA member states. The political and economic
context in East Africa has evolved substantially since project inception with the
overriding priority shifting towards strengthening the East African Community (EAC).
The global economic downturn has made selectivity increasingly important for both
Ministries of Finance and the World Bank. Currently, efforts are underway to ensure that
activities initiated under the project are incorporated into national HIV/AIDS Strategic
Plans and/or transferred to other agencies and institutions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



7
  The main reasons for the rejection stemmed from concerns over potential duplication with the NACs and
the excessive focus on technical support rather than service delivery.

                                                  16
28.     The development objectives of the project (i.e. to establish HIV/AIDS programs
for mobile and vulnerable groups and to enhance prospects for coordinated HIV/AIDS
programs) were highly relevant to country and regional priorities at project preparation
even though the second objective lacked specificity. The objectives remain broadly
consistent with the CAS and Poverty Reduction Strategies. Some mobile and vulnerable
populations, particularly refugees, clearly require special attention as hosting
governments may not have the incentives and financial resources to address their needs.
The provision of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention, care and treatment and
empowerment related activities responded to a clear unmet need in a timely and efficient
manner operating through strong, specialized agencies, including UNHCR and some 12
seasoned sub-contracting agencies with a strong regional (e.g. Africa Humanitarian
Action) or international (e.g. GTZ, International Red Cross) track record serving refugee
groups.

29.      While the project was designed like other MAPs with a broad range of eligible
interventions, in practice, many of the interventions funded (e.g. HIV testing, PMTCT,
ART, early pregnancy and gender based violence prevention) are considered good value
for money, high impact activities. Targeting both the refugee groups and the surrounding
communities proved to be a good strategy for fostering solidarity and facilitating equity
in service provision. Similarly, standardizing service provision across the main transport
corridors for long distance truck drivers and their clients remains highly relevant and
efforts are underway to consolidate these investments and ensure continuity. Finally,
exchange of information, epidemiological data, and good practices are critical to
strengthening coordination at the regional level with discussions underway with the EAC
on an appropriate way forward. 8 Even though the HIV adult infection rates have been
revised downwards in most countries (as discussed below) the estimated overall burden
of disease remains high with roughly 4.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the
sub-region (2007).       On balance, the relevance of the objectives, design, and
implementation was strong and hence is rated as substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

30.      The achievements of the project are presented for each Project Development
Objective (PDO), providing evidence for: (i) establishment of HIV/AIDS prevention,
care, treatment, and mitigation programs; and (ii) enhancement of prospects for
coordinated HIV/AIDS approaches. The project results are presented schematically in a
Results Chain in Annex 2 to better illustrate the links between the activities funded and
the outcomes attained. With respect to the first PDO, the analysis covers a discussion of
access, utilization, and knowledge and sexual practices, disaggregated by target group (i.e.
refugees, surrounding communities) for the three countries with two BSS rounds. To

  During a recent regional meeting of health practitioners from the EAC member countries the GLIA
Secretariat team initiated discussions with the EAC health desk on transferring knowledge and expertise
and ensuring that the harmonized protocols will be effectively used.


                                                  17
address the influx of new refugees, the BSS authors conducted a sensitivity analysis and
found that the results presented below were robust. 9

31.      The BSS found consistent declines in risky sexual behaviors, whether multiple,
non-regular, or transactional as well as an increase in abstinence among youths and
condom use with non-regular partners. The counterfactual (i.e. what would have
happened in the absence of the project) cannot be easily established nor can these
improvements be attributed to a single project. Nevertheless, to the extent that there
were virtually no HIV services in refugee camps prior to the project, and only limited
services in the underserved, surrounding communities, it is clear the GLIA Support
Project made a contribution towards the outcomes presented below. The latest rounds of
Demographic and Health Surveys in the GLIA member states found similar patterns of
improvements in self-reported sexual behavior, so the trends cited below appear credible.
10
   Interviews with beneficiaries suggest that most of the HIV related interventions would
not have taken place without the GLIA Support Project (see Annex 5).

32.     There have been substantial improvements in both HIV knowledge levels and
condom use among youth at GLIA supported sites. As seen from the figures below,
knowledge of HIV/AIDS among 15-24 year olds (project outcome indicator) has nearly
doubled in Tanzania, and Kenya (surrounding communities), and improved slightly in
Uganda. Condom use among 15-24 year olds with non-regular partner (project outcome
indicator) also increased at most sites, reaching 18-34 percent in Uganda, 35-39 percent
in Tanzania, and over 47 percent in Kenya (surrounding community). In addition, the
surveys found large increases in HIV testing during the past 12 months across all sites.
                  Percent of men and women aged 15-24 with comprehensive                                                                     Condom use at last sex with a non-regular partner

  To adjust for demographic changes a sample comparable to baseline was recruited for Tanzania. This
was not feasible for Kenya and Uganda. A sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted (excluding new
arrivals) which found that the direction of change, if not the absolute levels, for most indicators was
comparable for older residents and new arrivals.

  Looking back and moving forward: Report on GLIA context, the results achieved by the GLIA Support
Project to date, and the arrangements that need to be put in place in 2009 and 2010 to improving results
monitoring for the GSP, 21 October 2009.

                                                                                                                      18
33.     The surveys also found an increase in abstinence and a notable reduction in high
risk sexual activity at virtually all sites supported by the GLIA Support Project. Even
though these indicators were not part of the project results framework, they provide
additional evidence of reduction in risky sexual behavior. The proportion of never
married 15-24 year olds who never had sex remained virtually unchanged in Uganda,
increased by over 8 percent in Kenya (surrounding community), and rose by over 20
percent at all sites in Tanzania. The patterns of multiple sexual partners were consistent
across sites with males reporting higher levels of sexual activity than their female
counterparts, and all respondents reporting fewer sexual partners in the past year with
reductions ranging from 39-58 percent in Uganda, 38-68 percent in Tanzania, and 42
percent in Kenya (surrounding community).

34.      Key findings from the BSS are generally encouraging with respect to gender
related outcomes and broadly consistent with service statistics. 11 The surveys found a
reduction in transactional sex at all sites and a systematic drop in forced sex.12 Service
statistics tracked a 1.5 fold increase in the number of sexual and gender based violence
cases, which key stakeholders noted reflects an improvement in reporting as women
overcame their fears and reported abuses with greater frequency. At the same time, the
increase in the percentage who received appropriate medical attention increased 2.5
times, reflecting improved access to urgently required services. Against these generally
positive trends, the BSS found mixed trends in accepting attitudes towards PLWHA.
Inside the refugee camps attitudes towards PLWHA remained unchanged in Uganda and
improved slightly in Tanzania. In the surrounding communities there was a dramatic
three-fold improvement in Uganda but steep drops in both Kenya and Tanzania (48-60
percent), highlighting remaining challenges to fighting stigma and discrimination.

35.     These broad trends are encouraging and consistent with the types of HIV
programs which were established under the project. Access to a comprehensive package
of prevention, care, and treatment services was virtually universal at all sites supported
under the project (Annex 2). Notable results included: 5.2 million condoms distributed to
the GLIA funded target groups; 1.8 million persons reached through Information
Education Communications/ Behavioral Communications Change programs; roughly
14,500 trained peer educators disseminating messages to their counterparts at youth
centers constructed under the project; about 139,000 persons over 15 years of age
benefited from VCT programs; roughly 65,000 pregnant women attending antenatal
clinics received their HIV test results; close to 1,800 benefited from PMTCT programs;
and an estimated 10,200 placed on ART. In addition, the project funded a wide range of
activities to: (i) reduce gender based violence, (ii) mitigate sexual and economic

   The ICR team assessed progress on gender related outcomes (which were broadly worded in the PAD) in
terms of what could be inferred from key associated outcome indicators, in accordance with the OPCS
Implementation Completion and Results Report Guidelines (November 10, 2010 update).

12
   Drops in transactional sex ranged from 14-63 percent in Tanzania, 27-51 percent in Uganda, and 25
percent in Kenya (surrounding communities); and for forced sex among 15-49 year old females from an
initial range of 1.5-9.2 percent to .2-2 percent by project completion.

vulnerability through income generating activities; (iii) improve conditions of vulnerable
groups through provision of home based care for over 21,000 individuals, and school
supplies and basic support for roughly 33,600 orphans and vulnerable children.

36.     Notable progress has also been made in strengthening two key networks-- long
distance truckers, and people living with HIV/AIDS-- and facilitating knowledge sharing
among member states. In spite of the difficult conditions in some member states the
GLIA project attained important results, even in fragile (e.g. Burundi, DRC) or post
conflict (Rwanda) states. Given the vaguely worded nature of the second PDO and the
related outcome indicators the ICR team focused more on results indicators and on
feedback from beneficiaries. What is clear is that 14 networks of civil society
organizations, across the six countries were systematically trained in two important areas
where key gaps existed: (i) fiduciary, planning, and managerial skills of networks of civil
society organizations; and (ii) AIDS competence and self assessment to enhance
awareness and promote empowerment. All civil society networks and member
organizations of long distance truck drivers and people living with HIV/AIDS conducted
annual AIDS self assessments, adopted strategies, and implemented annual action plans
to boost their capacities. There were about a dozen regional events among network
organizations and health professionals to exchange information and good practices, and
support the harmonization of six protocols.

37.     While it is not easy to assess the quality or impact of the training it is important to
note that feedback from key stakeholders was generally very positive. Representatives of
the targeted networks interviewed noted appreciation with the empowering aspects of
planning and implementing their own activities, and the learning opportunities at the
regional level. Views of beneficiaries were consistently positive, noting that the project
allowed them to come up with their own creative solutions (e.g. Family Day Initiative in
Rwanda; Moon Light VCT in Kenya), and jointly design income generating activities.
According to beneficiaries and partners interviewed, national HIV/AIDS related health
sector information exchange, and harmonization of protocols resulted (or will result) in
better services for mobile populations.

38.     Use of a systematic approach across the six countries resulted in the
establishment of 21 Wellness Centers along the main corridors, which responded to an
important gap in service provision for long distance truck drivers and sex workers as
well as neighboring communities. It is noteworthy that all the GLIA member states
succeeded in establishing these centers. In the absence of regional funding it is unlikely
that the fragile states would have attained the same results. The roadside Wellness
Centers were able to adapt services and hours of operation to the needs of these mobile
and vulnerable groups, operate out of modest containers, generate support from local
councils and governments, and establish referral mechanisms to neighboring health
centers to improve access to STI and HIV diagnostic and treatment services. Based on
reports from the GLIA focal points at project completion virtually all the Wellness
Centers were operational but as most were completed towards the end of the project their
level of functionality varied, as detailed in Annex 2.



                                              20
39.     On the basis of the solid evidence presented above, particularly for the
measurable PDO, the ICR team considered the overall effectiveness substantial.
However, as data on key outcomes is only available for three countries, the results cannot
be readily extended to the other member countries. Consequently, the overall
effectiveness is rated Modest.

3.3 Efficiency

40.       As was the case for other MAP operations no formal economic or financial
efficiency analysis was conducted at appraisal. Efficiency is discussed primarily in
qualitative terms. Important efficiency gains were made by:
     Working with strong, experienced institutions with good absorptive capacities,
        such as UNHCR (which managed about 27 percent of the total funds) and its sub-
        contractors; these institutions had a good knowledge of the refugee population;
        strong capacities on the ground, which allowed them to hit the ground running
        quickly and efficiently; unit cost analyses of the number of beneficiaries reached
        are complicated by the fact that UNHCR pooled IDA resources with other sources
        of funding; important investments in physical infrastructure (e.g. health facilities;
        maternity wards; feeding centers; laboratories, youth centers) in the refugee
        camps were made by UNHCR which in some cases served both the camp
        populations and neighboring communities, maximizing the returns on these
        investments. In total, UNHCR successfully constructed/renovated 10 health
        facilities, 14 youth centers, and trained over 6,000 health personnel, serving a
        population of roughly .4 million refugees (and part of the 1.2 million in the
        surrounding communities) with a full range of evidence-based interventions.
        These activities were delivered on time and within budget.
     Standardizing approaches and sharing good practices at the regional level rather
        than operating on a country by country basis; considering the resources made
        available for this purpose, the process was quite efficient in having a regionally
        coordinated effort to harmonize approaches; examples include design,
        development and establishment of Wellness Centers which used low cost
        infrastructure (i.e. containers which cost about 20K on average) to serve mobile
        groups, allowing truckers to get the same care and treatment in every country
        during their long haul trips; organization of standardized training; harmonization
        of protocols to ensure the provision of standardized care; and sharing good
        practices and experiences to promote innovative approaches.
     Scaling up key interventions at an accelerated pace. In spite of the delayed start
        up and delays in disbursements, following the MTR the results attained were
        impressive, such as full coverage with static VCT centers, a seven-fold increase in
        the number of condom outlets established, and roughly 1.8 million persons
        reached through IEC/BCC programs.
     Maximizing resources devoted to service delivery. The bulk of the project
        resources (i.e. over 72 percent) were devoted to the provision of services or
        strengthening of institutional capacities with the GLIA Secretariat absorbing
        roughly 16 percent of the total and the balance used for the GLIA governance
        structures, M&E, and various consultancies and preparatory activities.

                                             21
41.      On the basis of the evidence presented above efficiency is rated as Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

42.        The achievements of the GLIA Support Project must be viewed in light of the
difficult socio-political context in which the operation was executed, its ambitious goals
in light of modest institutional capacities, and its relatively meager resources (US$20
million) for a regional project covering six countries. Taking into consideration these
various aspects, results on the ground are relatively strong both in terms of expanded
access to a full range of HIV/AIDS services for the targeted populations (particularly the
refugees and the surrounding communities), and enhanced capacity of civil society
organizations and the GLIA Secretariat.           Moreover, substantial investments in
infrastructure and human resources have been made and will be left behind for the
refugee camps, surrounding communities, and two main road corridors in East Africa.
One of the most important contributions of the project was the production of Behavioral
Surveillance Surveys which provide a stronger basis for planning future investments.
While difficult to quantify, the project played a catalytic role in supporting innovative
approaches and cross country sharing of experiences and good practices. On the basis of
the substantial relevance, modest effectiveness and efficiency, the overall project
outcome is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

43.     The project effectively addressed economic and sexual vulnerability of refugees
and mobile populations, using HIV programs as an entry point. Vulnerable groups
benefitted from income generating activities which provided them with a source of
livelihood. For PLWHA who were on antiretroviral therapy, the income generating
activities were critical to addressing their nutritional needs. Income generating activities
also necessitated establishment of support groups and associations which promoted
solidarity and contributed to building social capital in some communities that were
ravaged by conflicts. Beneficiaries of these activities included orphans and vulnerable
children, women who engaged in sex work, and PLWHA.

44.     Numerous promising schemes have been initiated under the GLIA Support
Project. The scope and scale of many of these activities was limited because of the level
of funding but the demonstration effect was critical with important lessons for future
investments. In Burundi, the East African Food Restaurant was set up by the spouses’
                                                     22
association of truck drivers; located adjacent to a Wellness Center the association has a
booming business serving long distance truckers arriving in Bujumbura. In the Kigoma
district of Tanzania, two centers have been established for youth, women, and members
of HIV/AIDS clubs to develop income generating activities and promote HIV counseling
and condom use. The National Council of Churches in Kenya integrated HIV activities
into reproductive health services and combined them with income generating activities
(e.g. hairdressing, small restaurants) for vulnerable groups. Similar interventions were
funded in the refugee camps and surrounding communities in Uganda with a broad range
of preventive and mitigation activities, including vocational training for vulnerable
children. Rwanda rolled out a broad range of income generating activities (e.g.
mushroom production, hair salons, tailoring associations, kitchen gardens, rabbit and
chicken raising, soap making) both for the refugee camps (Gihembe, Kiziba, Nyabiheke)
and surrounding communities (Gicumbi, Karongi, Gatsibo), which reflects the close
integration of GLIA activities within the national HIV/AIDS program.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

45. Institutional strengthening has been an implicit goal of this regional project, both
in terms of the GLIA Secretariat and the targeted civil society networks. The GLIA
Secretariat was founded in the late 90s and formally established through the GLIA
Convention (July 27, 2004), signed by representatives of the six countries. The
Convention spelled out the roles and responsibilities of the organization, its governance
structures, and the financial arrangements. 13 The Secretariat was given an ambitious
mandate in relation to its initial capacity. Institutional strengthening efforts had mixed
results. In the area of financial management and fiduciary matters, including internal
audit functions, the Secretariat performed well, ensuring a smooth transition from a FMA
to performing these functions in house. The fact that there were no governance problems
reflects good management practices. With respect to procurement, the Secretariat also
put in place adequate capacity and conducted procurement with few difficulties.

46.     On technical and operational issues, the Secretariat managed to coordinate the
project activities reasonably well in spite of several impediments (e.g. difficulties
recruiting and retaining staff; limited authority over national agencies). The Secretariat’s
performance on M&E was particularly weak, not succeeding to put in place a reliable
system for monitoring project activities or establishing capacity at the country level.
Only towards the end of the project the agency established the Partnership Consultative
Group, which could have provided the platform for effective partner coordination and
additional resource mobilization beyond the contributions from the member states. In
spite of these shortcomings and its continued dependence on member state contributions
and IDA, the GLIA Secretariat played an important role and continues to represent the


13
   The key governance structures included: GLIA Council of Ministers, the policy making body consisting
of Ministers in charge of HIV/AIDS which met annually to approve annual program and budget; Executive
Committee consisting of executive secretaries of the NACs which provided oversight and technical
guidance; Partnership Consultative Group which is the advisory body to the Ministers; and GLIA Focal
Points who were responsible for ensuring coordination between NACs and the Secretariat.

institutional memory of this regional initiative. Discussions are underway with the East
African Community health desk to determine the best ways to ensure continuity of key
activities, particularly in terms of protocol harmonization. Civil society organizations
supported under the project were able to build their management and fiduciary capacities
as well as their AIDS competency, and many will be in a position to submit requests to
other partners and to better manage their resources. The ICR team was unable to make
an assessment of the 14 strengthened networks but feedback was overwhelmingly
positive, and the fiduciary training in particular was unique and filled a key gap.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

47.      Several unintended positive outcomes are worth noting. First, the project brought
together officials from countries which had tense diplomatic and political relations. They
rallied together in the fight against a major public health threat and succeeded in
establishing a regional initiative endorsed by the parliaments of six countries, showing
how collaboration around HIV/AIDS contributed to broader engagement and improved
understanding among the GLIA member states, as noted by numerous stakeholders
(Annex 5). One Congolese stakeholder echoed the views of others, noting: "We
overcome challenges at the political level and crossed new frontiers, the GLIA brought us
into new territory, and enabled us to overcome political barriers, and enabled people to
come together and reflect on a health problem that is currently engulfing our region”.
Second, some of the project activities (e.g. income generating activities, AIDS
competence training) contributed to promoting collaboration between refugees and
surrounding communities, building trust, and strengthening social capital in impoverished
communities. Stakeholders interviewed noted that one of the positive spillover effects of
the AIDS competence training was that it “allowed individuals of different tribal
affiliations to work together”, thus contributing to reconciliation efforts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

48.      Contextual Risks. There are a number of contextual or external risks which may
affect the development outcomes. First, there is a global shift towards broader health
systems strengthening rather than disease specific ones with the bulk of the global
financing targeted for national (and not regional) programs. Second, the sense of urgency
about addressing HIV/AIDS has diminished and there is a risk that complacency will set
in; this is in part due to progress in containing the epidemic in the region during the past
five years, and to more reliable recent estimates which show lower levels of HIV
infection in most countries. 14 Third, there is a move towards greater selectivity as


14
   HIV adult infection rates for the period of the 2005-2007 were revised downwards for Burundi (3.0%);
Rwanda (3.0%); DR Congo (1.3%); and Tanzania (6.4%), while Kenya (7.1%) and Uganda (6.4%) were
revised upwards; data are from the last round of Demographic and Health Surveys or other national surveys.


                                                   24
donors grapple with the global economic downturn. Finally, the emergence in recent
years of numerous regional institutions and the increasing attention being given by
member countries to economic, and trade issues through regional economic blocks, may
dilute the attention of Ministries of Finance to single theme initiatives.

49.      Internal Risks. Project or institutional specific risks can be summarized as
           follows:
                 Unpredictable financing: The Secretariat’s inability to diversify funding
         sources places the institution in a precarious financial situation. To preserve the
         institutional memory and consolidate accomplishments the GLIA Secretariat has
         adopted a two-pronged approach: (i) conducting discussions with the EAC to
         determine the prospects for continuity of key activities which appears like a
         sensible strategy as it will preserve the institutional memory and continue to raise
         the profile of these issues in high-level policy and ministerial forums;15 and (ii)
         exploring possibility of member states maintaining their financial contributions.
         In spite of difficulties encountered, the Secretariat is viewed by many
         stakeholders as having built capacities that need to be preserved and GLIA’s
         2008-2012 Strategic Plan provides a sound basis for moving forward.
                 Lack of continuity: The capacity of countries to sustain the levels of
         activities supported under the project hinges on their: (i) ability to integrate
         activities into the national HIV/AIDS Strategic Plans and/or transfer them to other
         donors; all countries are committed to taking over these activities and some
         countries are reasonably confident that they can do this but others may struggle; 16
         (ii) interest and financial capacities of localities or associations to assume the
         running costs of the Wellness Centers, as many were completed immediately prior
         to project completion; 17 and (iii) ability of UNHCR to identify other sources of
         funding for the HIV/AIDS activities.

50.        The overall risk to development outcome is rated as significant.



15
   A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the EAC and GLIA was signed in February 2010 to
promote collaboration and this could serve as the basis for ensuring sustainability of a number of key
activities, either by having GLIA serve as a key sub-recipient of EAC funds or transferring the activities to
the EAC with special provision for DRC which is not a member of the EAC.

16
   Rwanda has a Global Fund grant which generously funds its HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan; in Kenya there is
strong ownership of the GLIA activities and a commitment to their continuity, and a possibility that some
of the network activities can be picked up through the grant mechanism under the Bank-funded TOWA
Project); Burundi and DRC may struggle as MAP operations are closing and other agencies do not
necessarily fund the same types of activities or provide comparable levels of financing.

17
   Innovative solutions are being identified to consolidate these investments, such as establishing
partnerships with the private sector to support their operational costs, as is taking place in Uganda with the
association of long distance truck drivers which has assumed management of some facilities; using income
generating activities to sustain the centers, and working closely with district and health authorities to ensure
effective coordination, such as is taking place in Tanzania.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

51.     The project was generally well designed and responded in a timely fashion to a
key public health problem. It was prepared with the support of several partners and
benefited from strong managerial support, as evidenced by the budget (608K) provided
which was slightly above the average (531K) for a group of similar regional projects.
The task team should be commended for a bold vision, and for bringing six countries
together to agree on a common set of activities, which is not an easy task. In spite of a
concerted effort to ensure readiness, there were lengthy delays in effectiveness and
disbursements as capacities needed to be put in place. As was the case for similar
projects, the results framework provided only a broad framework with baseline data and
targets not always available, and with several loosely worded outcome indicators. Bank
performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

52.     There was good continuity in task management with one field-based task team
leader from inception to completion. Missions were generally well staffed, and there was
good use of field based staff. Specialists were added as needed in the areas of
pharmaceuticals, health, M&E, social development and gender. Continuity of sector
specialists (particularly on health) could have been stronger. Oversight of fiduciary
aspects was particularly strong with good attention to safeguards policies and periodic
attention to gender issues. Advice was generally timely and appropriate and by and large
well appreciated by the clients, based on feedback received during the ICR mission. The
task team identified implementation problems in a timely manner but the response was
strongest on the FM and procurement issues. Governance and anti-corruption issues
were well handled during supervision. The task team made a concerted effort to address
the QAG recommendations, including providing additional support on M&E, ensuring
that the second round of BSS was completed, and engaging national authorities to
mainstream priority activities into national programs.

53.     The MTR was well planned with a clear issues paper and a comprehensive Aide
Memoire which laid out the main issues and way forward. In spite of a concerted effort
the task team did not succeed in restructuring the operation. The Bank did not provide
the leadership and sustained support which was needed to rectify the weaknesses in the
results framework and to recalibrate the development objectives, and outcomes. The
Bank also missed an opportunity to include the GLIA project in the generic restructuring
of all MAP operations to remove reference to reduction in HIV prevalence rates. The
supervision budget (540K) slipped below a regional average (614K) for the same group
of regional projects. The candor, realism, and consistency in Implementation Status
Report (ISR) ratings were mixed. In some cases, supervision ratings tend to be more
optimistic than warranted by the detailed component-specific description in the aide

                                           26
memoires, and in other cases ratings may have been too negative. As noted by the QAG
panel, management attention should have been stronger. Management feedback on ISRs
was not systematic, particularly for the Regional Integration Department which
commented only on the last few ISRs.

54.    In spite of a generally good supervision record, there were a number of key lapses
which have resulted in a rating of moderately unsatisfactory for the quality of
supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

55.     Based on the moderately satisfactory quality at entry and the moderately
unsatisfactory quality of supervision, overall Bank performance is rates as moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

56.      Member states demonstrated strong commitment to GLIA’s mission and
objectives and managed to overcome political differences to reach a consensus on a
regional HIV agenda. The GLIA Council of Ministers met regularly to guide the
institution and resolve key issues. While governments did not always provide funds on a
timely basis to the GLIA Secretariat, in part due to the precarious financial and political
conditions, by project completion all arrears were cleaned up. The delayed start up and
difficulties in some countries in channeling funds expeditiously to implementing entities
resulted in some activities finalized only towards project completion. Nevertheless, by
project completion only US$0.6 million remained unspent and had to be returned to the
World Bank.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

57.    Given the complexities and challenges of providing oversight over six countries
and the need to build capacity, the GLIA Secretariat performed as well as could have
been expected under these circumstances. No major problems of misprocurement or
mismanagement were found by the audits. During the first year of implementation, a
FMA was hired to help build GLIA capacity and to test the newly designed management
tools. Internal controls were put in place by recruitment of an internal auditor and by
adherence to the GLIA convention and regulations in the operations manual. There were
some inevitable communication issues between the Anglophone and Francophone
countries with some stakeholders noting that the Secretariat could have managed certain
processes (e.g. staff recruitment) in a more transparent manner. There were also concerns
over the practice of ensuring geographical representation at the Secretariat that did not
always result in the selection of the best candidates. Finally, the GLIA Secretariat had an
important responsibility with respect to monitoring and evaluation of project activities
that was not adequately performed.

                                            27
58.      The performance of other key agencies was generally strong. The performance of
the UNHCR with respect to component one was solid even though this might have led to
weakened country ownership. It sub-contracted organizations with a long standing track
record in working with refugees, and carried out activities on a timely basis, and with
reasonably good results. UNHCR worked closely with local and district health
authorities but the coordination with the NACs (which were mandated to carry out
activities in surrounding communities) could have been stronger in some cases to
facilitate resolution of key issues. For example, UNHCR’s disagreement with the
Government of Rwanda about the modalities for conducting the 2010 BSS were not
resolved in a satisfactory manner, which implied that the end of project BSS was not
conducted. Use of the adapted BSS gold standard survey is considered best practice in
terms of monitoring trends in behavior among the targeted groups but there was limited
evidence of effective use of the data. While the co-mingling of Bank funds minimized
transaction costs for UNHCR, it limited the Secretariat’s capacity to monitor and report
on results. The performance of the FMA was satisfactory on balance. The performance
of the two intermediary agencies used for capacity building was generally good, even
though some stakeholders argued that they had a limited role in determining the work of
these agencies, and the training activities limited direct financial support to the networks.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

59.   Based on the performance of the member states, GLIA Secretariat, and key
implementing agencies the Borrower’s performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

60.    Key lessons learned are summarized below, broken down into generic lessons on
regional health investments, and those specifically related to Bank-funded operations.

Regional Health Investments
    Regional investments can add value to national investments and maximize
      impact, especially for mobile and vulnerable groups who tend to be neglected.
      The main beneficiaries of this regional project---refugees and long distance
      truckers--- as well as the communities and individuals they interact with (e.g.
      commercial sex workers) were clearly the appropriate groups to target. Individual
      countries are faced with enormous challenges in addressing the rapidly evolving
      needs of refugees camped on their national territories, and may not have the
      incentives and resources to address their needs.
    Addressing both the needs of mobile and vulnerable groups and surrounding
      communities in an integrated manner avoids creation of distortions. Refugee
      camps can serve as poles of development for the provision of health and related
      social services. The GLIA Support Project demonstrated how a regional project
      can raise the bar in terms of access to services for groups in remote border areas
      which were lagging behind.
    Ensuring activities funded are well integrated into health district plans early on
      to promote synergies and to facilitate continuity. In countries where the GLIA

                                             28
       activities were well integrated into health district or local government plans from
       the outset, this enhanced the chances of sustainability at project completion.
      Working with existing regional institutions and beefing up their capacity
       through an initial capacity building phase. The Bank can play a critical role in
       supporting regional institutions, particularly as funding from the Global Fund and
       bilateral donors is focused primarily on country programs.
      Developing a strong Monitoring and Evaluation framework and a clear Results
       Chain. Four key lessons are noteworthy:
            Establishing and institutionalizing a robust M&E system from the onset
               improves the documentation process, provides solid basis for review of
               progress, and motivates project stakeholders to achieve the set targets.
            Conducting Behavioral Surveillance Surveys enhances understanding of
               the key drivers of the HIV epidemic and provides a sounder basis for
               planning future investments. 18
            Ensuring that data generated from the BSS are effectively used to inform
               the design of interventions. The end of project BSS underscored the need
               for stepping up HIV prevention activities among residents who frequently
               visit surrounding communities, and among boys and young men to reduce
               early sexual debut and casual sex, and among adult men to reduce multiple
               partnerships.
            Conducting surveys more frequently, particularly given the rapid
               demographic changes in most refugee camps and the evolving needs of
               new arrivals. Surveys that generate “just in time information” would be
               particularly useful to both implementers and policymakers. Funding
               permitting, it would also be useful to include modules for assessing HIV
               infection levels.

World Bank Task Teams and Management
   Ensuring realism and specificity in project design. Given the inherently complex
      nature of regional projects it is critical to ensure simplicity in design (i.e.
      sequence and phase in activities, adopt simple flow of fund mechanisms, focus on
      a few activities, a limited geographical area). A related lesson is the need to
      improve readiness through: (a) stronger preparation up front; (b) reliance on
      established institutions which can hit the ground running quickly and efficiently;
      and (c) explicit capacity building initial phase. Finally, making the experimental
      nature of an operation explicit from the outset (as was done for the Treatment
      Acceleration Project) is helpful and reinforces the need for learning in order to
      scale up in a subsequent phase.



18
   Prior to conducting the BSS in the GLIA member states there was a broad based view that sexual
behavior among highly mobile and displaced groups was associated with higher risks; the survey results
showed that the situation was much more complex and that these groups did not always have the highest
risk levels. The end of project BSS found that refugees had lower levels of risky sex than surrounding
communities in Kenya and Uganda but not in Tanzania.


                                                   29
    Adopting a proactive approach to restructuring projects to enhance chances of
     success. Bank teams with the support of management, and in collaboration with
     clients, need to be assertive about restructuring operations. The time and effort
     required to restructure a regional operation and the perceived low benefits may
     serve as a disincentive to task teams. Management needs to provide strong
     support and guidance, and to create an environment which rewards task teams that
     successfully restructure operations.
    Including an Interim Review. Task teams should consider including an Interim
     Review at 18 months to take stock of progress and identify remedial actions early
     rather than wait until a Mid-Term Review.
    Leveraging field-based staff and maximizing links to national-level investments;
     working through field-based staff maximizes ownership, ensures clear links to
     other Bank-funded national health investments, and promotes efficiencies and
     economies in project preparation and supervision.
    Planning for sustainability early in the project cycle, given that regional
     projects often involve multiple institutions and countries. The project team, in
     collaboration with the clients, needs to design an exit strategy early in the project
     cycle. Assisting beneficiary networks or other local groups to take over
     management of facilities supported by the project should be given priority and
     agreed upon during the Mid-Term Review.
    Staying the course. When embarking on challenging operations the World Bank
     needs to “stay the course” which was one of the main recommendations of the
     MAP Interim Review, recognizing the time, effort, and resources needed to
     undertake a regional project.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

I.     Introduction

1.       This annex presents the status of the main outcome indicators, and analyzes the
outputs by component. The results are also presented schematically in the Results Chain
below as it provides a sounder framework for understanding the links between activities
and results. The Results Chain takes into account key activities or outputs (Level IV),
intermediate outcomes such as availability and access (Level III and II), and coverage
outcomes, including knowledge levels and condom utilization (Level I). Virtually all the
indicators in the Results Chain are derived from the Results Framework, the Behavioral
Surveillance Surveys, or the GLIA service statistics. Level 0 refers to impacts that are
usually beyond the influence of a specific project, such as changes in HIV prevalence
rates. This annex presents systematically the outcome and output indicators included in
the Project Appraisal Document and the DGA. To better understand and interpret the
data, it is important to point out the following caveats, weaknesses and issues.

2.     First, there were no baseline data for the majority of the performance indicators
and targets set in the PAD. The baseline Behavior Surveillance Survey (BSS) were
conducted in only 4 out 6 GLIA countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda). There
were no BSS conducted in Burundi or DRC because of the difficult country conditions
and in the case of Rwanda no end of project BSS was conducted due to disagreements
between UNHCR and the government on the modalities for conducting the survey.

3.      Second, data from the BSS need to be interpreted with caution given their self
reported nature, and the dynamic changes in the population composition (e.g. for
example, the Kakuma camp in Kenya accommodated predominantly refugees from South
Sudan at the beginning of the project while by completion most refugees were from
Somalia). Sensitivity analyses conducted on the BSS data from Kenya and Uganda found
that the direction of change was similar for older residents and new arrivals. Finally, it
should be noted that no BSS included truck drivers, which were an important target
group.

4.      Third, the PAD had too many indicators to report on. A maximum of 2 to 3
project outcome indicators and one or two intermediate results indicators for each of the 4
project components would have been enough. Some indicators (e.g. outcome indicator on
decreasing HIV prevalence in intervention areas) were unrealistic and difficult to
measure, given the scope and duration of the GLIA Project. Baseline data and targets for
some of the outcome indicators were qualitative in nature and difficult to monitor.

5.      Fourth, at the MTR a project restructuring of the results framework was proposed
but the restructuring could not take place. Nonetheless, countries continued to report on
some of the new indicators in the proposed results framework following the MTR.

6.      Fifth, the roles and responsibilities of GLIA country focal points were not clearly
defined. In some cases these focal points had other responsibilities in the NACs which
diluted their responsibilities towards the GLIA Project, as they were unable to spend
sufficient time to review data quality in reports of implementing agencies.

7.      The Development Grant Agreement (DGA) included a subset of the results
indicators which were in the PAD. The DGA stated clearly in Schedule 6 that
“recognizing that further indicators are set out on in the Results Framework of the
Project, the recipient shall implement the Project in accordance with the performance
indicators set forth in the DGA.” So, even though from a legal point of view the client
was only accountable for the DGA performance indicators (*), the ICR team chose to
analyze and report on the entire set of indicators in the PAD.

8.      Finally, it should be noted that while broad health and social support activities
conducted in refugee camps under the leadership of UNHCR are funded from many
funding sources, HIV interventions were not part of the core package prior to GLIA
project or were provided on a very small scale. The GLIA Support Project helped to
scale up HIV interventions, contributing to the observed trends in outcomes discussed
below.

II.    Outcome indicators

9.      According to the PAD, data on six outcome indicators were to be collected at the
start and end of the project. For two outcome indicators (measured in four countries
through the BSS) there were baseline data available against which achievements were
measured at the end of the project. There was no baseline or targets set for the remaining
four outcome indicators. The outcomes discussed below can, in part, be attributed to the
results achieved on outputs, as shown under the section below.

Outcome indicator #1: Reduction in HIV prevalence in the refugee populations and
surrounding communities identified by GLIA.

10.     This indicator was part of the core indicators that were commonly used by the
international community (UNGASS) at the time the GLIA Support Project was being
prepared. It became subsequently clear that a project like GLIA, with limited resources
and activities reaching a relatively small number of people, could not achieve a reduction
in HIV prevalence rates (i.e. a Level 0 Outcome Indicator). The MTR team recognized
this and no data were collected for this indicator. As noted earlier, overall trends in the
GLIA countries are generally encouraging with a decline in the number of new infections
in at least three countries (i.e. Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania), reflecting the stepped up HIV
efforts funded by numerous partners.

                                                                   Graph 1

Outcome indicator #2: Increase in the number of youth (aged 15-24) in the target
populations reporting condom use during sexual intercourse with a non-regular sexual
partner.

11.    The data below show that there has been significant increase in condom use
between baseline and end of project in the 3 GLIA countries where BSS data are
available. The wide availability of condoms accompanied by aggressive campaigns from
youth peer educators to promote condom use combined with the uninterrupted supply of

                                                                      35
condom supplies contributed to the results achieved. The data on condom distribution and
availability in refugee camps and surrounding communities are presented below under
the section on results.

                                       Graph 2:




Outcome indicator #3: Increase in the number of respondents 15-24 years of age
within the target population who both correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual
transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission or
prevention.

12.     Graph 3 below shows the trend in comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV
transmission and prevention among 15-24 years. The data suggest that there have been
overall increases in knowledge of HIV/AIDS in both refugee camps and in surrounding
communities served by the GLIA Project over the period of the project. Part of the
decline in the Kakuma refugee camp reflects the change in the refugee population rather
than a true decline in comprehensive level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS.

13.    The two extreme values in comprehensive knowledge relative to baseline ranged
from a low of 18.3 percent in the Kenya hosting community at baseline to 59.4 percent in
the Tanzania hosting community at project completion. In contrast to the increase in HIV
knowledge, accepting attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS remained virtually
unchanged in one site, declined at three sites, and improved at two locations (Graph 4),
highlighting remaining challenges to fighting stigma and discrimination in some
countries. Further analysis would be needed to better understand the underlying factors
behind these mixed trends and develop appropriate responses.

Outcome indicator #4: Increase in the social and gender conditions within targeted
populations in refugee sites and surrounding populations.

14.     It is difficult to measure such a broadly worded outcome indicator. Achievement
of this indicator may be measured by a combination of indicators such as the number (or
percent) of pregnant women placed on ARVs, number of income generating activities
benefiting women and orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs), drop in sexual and
gender-based violence, and the decline in transactional sex with expanded access to
alternative sources of livelihood. The project has supported various activities which may
have contributed to the trends discussed below.

15.     The number of reported sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) cases in the
GLIA-funded target population increased from 1,196 at the MTR to 1, 772 by end of
project. Although seemingly an unfavorable outcome, this may also be interpreted asa
positive development as more women were able to overcome fears and come out to report
abuses. In parallel the number of sexual and gender-based violence cases that received

                                           37
appropriate medical support (according to guidelines) also increased during this period
(from 418 at the midterm review to 952 at end of project), reflecting improved access to
medical care. Data from the two repeat BSS show positive trends on several social and
gender indicators. For example, forced sex towards women decreased at six sites, with
one of the highest declines in the surrounding communities in Kenya.

                                        Graph 5:




16.   Progress was also made on abstinence among never married 15-24 year olds
which increased at four sites, remaining virtually unchanged in the Uganda refugee
camps and hosting community (Graph 6).

                                        Graph 6:




17.     The BSS also found declines in multiple sexual partnerships (Graph 7). The
decrease was highest in the Tanzania refugee camp and hosting community. There has
been a relative decrease in transactional sex at all the sites between baseline and end of
project (Graph 8).

Outcome indicator #5: Networks have been strengthened and there is improved
management and AIDS learning capacities of networks and member organizations

18.    This is a qualitative indicator for which there was no baseline data or targets. The
ICR mission found positive views among beneficiaries with the training received on
planning, financial management, and networking. In terms of learning capacity of
networks, progress has been made through training members of the networks in each
GLIA country.

19.    In total, the number of facilitators that have been trained in the AIDS self
assessment process was 21 in Tanzania, 21 in Kenya and 4 in Uganda. On the managerial
capacity building side, the number of trainers that have been trained was 6 in DRC, 15 in
                                            39
Kenya, 18 in Rwanda, 10 in Tanzania and 6 in Uganda. Rwanda mobilized another 20
persons who received training in managerial capacity prior to GLIA.

Outcome indicator #6: Increased knowledge transfer between GLIA countries and
uptake of health services by mobile populations

20.     This is another qualitative indicator for which there is no baseline or target data.
Increased knowledge transfer occurred through various regional workshops and study
visits between GLIA member countries where good practices were exchanged. It is
during one of these visits, for example, that Burundi learned about the existence of an
association of spouses of truck drivers in Rwanda which led to the establishment of a
similar association in Burundi (Association de Femmes des Chauffeurs et Conducteurs
Agrees au Burundi, AFCHACABU). Another example is the VCT Moonlighting where
commercial sex workers and truck drivers benefited from HIV awareness activities and
free testing. Kenya copied this experience after an exchange visit with their counterparts
in Uganda.

21.     Network knowledge was increased by facilitating discussions among network
members through an AIDS competence course and Self Assessment and Learning
Transfer (SALT) strategy. In total, 36 SALT visits were facilitated for the targeted
networks. Although late in the project cycle, 21 Wellness Centers were established by
project completion with support from the project across the 6 participating countries
along 2 main transport corridors. While many of these centers provided primarily
recreational activities and HIV awareness support for network members, in some cases
they also provided VCT and other health services. At most sites individuals were
referred to nearby health centers, some of which were constructed under the GLIA
project.

III.   Results indicators

22.      Contrary to the outcome indicators, baseline data and targets were set for all
results indicators which consisted of a combination of process and output indicators. The
baseline data were set to 0 for all indicators to reflect the general lack of availability of
these services at project inception. The targets for results indicators have been set in
terms of the projected number of refugee sites and surrounding communities to be
supported by the GLIA Support Project. The targets for all results indicators for
component 1 for each of the two communities (refugees and surrounding populations)
were set at 9, or a percentage of that number. Table 1 below show the size of the refugee
camps and surrounding areas and, the implementing agencies in the refugee camps. In
total, the population of the GLIA targeted areas in the six countries was close to 1.6
million.

     Component 1: HIV/AIDS support to refugees, affected areas surrounding the refugee
     communities, internally displaced people, returnees.

     23.      GLIA support boosted VCT, PMTCT, STI, SBGV, post test clubs, and outreach
     activities, training, and funded renovation/equipment of health, nutrition, and youth
     centers. As a result, over 20 upgraded/rehabilitated/constructed health centers could offer
     a broader range of services, including curative and preventive services, reproductive
     health, HIV counseling and testing, HIV/AIDS comprehensive care, and home-based
     care. Additional activities included income generating activities (IGAs), support to
     orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), youth centers, nutritional support, behavior
     change communication (BCC), and condom distribution. UNHCR was responsible for
     activities in the refugee camps, as stipulated in a Memorandum of Understanding and
     management contract between the GLIA Secretariat and UNHCR, and in turn
     subcontracted specialized NGOs to implement the activities. With respect to the host

                                                    41

indicators for component 1 were fully achieved with improved access to a full range of
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment services. However, these figures do not capture
the quality, utilization or coverage of these services.

24.     The availability of programs for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, and
mitigation of social impacts in refugee camps, and surrounding areas and returnees/IDPs,
targeting underserved populations in the Great Lakes region improved substantially. In
part due to the GLIA Support Project, by project completion refugee populations have
been integrated for the first time into some national ART scale up programs of hosting
governments. In the area of prevention, notable accomplishments included: an expansion
in the production of IEC materials (i.e. that rose from 1,125,473 at the MTR to 1,783,399
by project completion) and a major boost in the number of people reached with
HIV/AIDS messages.

25.     The number of outlets for condom distribution increased as well from 43 at MTR
to 307 by the end of the project, and the number of condoms distributed increased from
3,407,441 at MTR to 5,241,773 at the end of the project, which contributed to the
reported improvements in condom utilization among youth presented above. Youth
centers have been constructed in each refugee camp and in surrounding communities and
are used for recreational and HIV prevention activities, such as drama groups for post
HIV test clubs and HIV awareness raising. In addition, HIV positive or negative
youth/adults have formed clubs to raise awareness and fight stigma and discrimination
which remain problems as seen from the variable improvements in attitudes towards
PLWHA. At each refugee site and surrounding community, there were training sessions
for youth peer groups (in- and out-of-school) and drama groups (formed by peer groups).

26.     There was 100 percent coverage of sites with static VCT centers. Reproductive
health/FP services have improved through training of midwives, rehabilitation of
maternity wards, and provision of commodities for safe delivery. Sexual and gender-
based violence survivors were provided with a comprehensive HIV prevention package,
consisting in STI, VCT, and counseling and post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) services
which contributed to the reported improvements discussed above in the number of sexual
and gender-based violence cases that received appropriate medical support.

27.      In the area of care and treatment, all refugee sites had at least one ART center
which was used by both refugees and host community populations. Access to treatment
for STIs, OIs, and TB has been scaled up and was virtually universal with these services
reaching increasing numbers of people.             All sites (refugees and surrounding
communities) were equipped to provide home-based care. The number of PLWHAs
receiving home based care increased gradually over time with the expansion in outreach
activities supported under the project (Table 3).

28.    In the area of impact mitigation, support has been provided to OVCs by supplying
school materials, uniforms and vocational training (e.g., tailoring, masonry, driving, and
gardening. Support has also been provided to PLWHA through the provision of grants for
IGAs (e.g. piggery, bee keeping, clothes dying, tailoring, and retail shops).

29.    The expanded access to these services has contributed to the improved outcomes
of the GLIA Support Project (e.g. improvements in HIV/AIDS knowledge levels,
increases in condom use, reduction in high risk sex). Additional highlights of component

Burundi

30.     In Burundi, GLIA funds supported comprehensive HIV activities in Bwagiriza,
Gasorwe and Musasa refugee camps and the surrounding communities. The bulk of the
interventions focused on behavior change communications, promotion of condom use,
voluntary HIV counseling and testing, and PMTCT services. The number of persons
reached through the IEC/BCC program was 79,823 at MTR and 192,217 by the end of
the project. There were only 2 active peer educators by the MTR and this number
skyrocketed to 210 by the end of the project. Given that the entire target population of
the refugee camps and surrounding communities consisted of roughly 201,000
inhabitants this suggests that these interventions reached a considerable share of the
target population. Burundi reported 12 SGBV cases at the MTR and 37 at the end of the
project. Around 733 pregnant women at MTR and 1, 156 at the end of the project

                                                  44
accessed HIV counseling and testing services, of which 9 (1 at MTR and 8 at the end)
HIV positive patients in advanced stage of the disease were put on antiretroviral therapy.

DR Congo

31.    Concerted efforts were made to provide support to the returnees at the Libenge
camp. About 25 health care workers underwent 3-day training on HIV capacity building,
coordination, planning, and monitoring and evaluation. In addition, an HIV focal person,
a nurse supervisor, a logistics specialist/accountant, and a driver were recruited which
considerably boosted the camp’s human resource capacity.

32.     To support HIV prevention activities for 37,778 returnees, 1,500 IEC HIV
prevention materials and 3,457 (leaflets, posters, video tapes, rolls banners and T-shirts)
were procured and distributed by the MTR and by the end of project, respectively. The
number of persons reached with IEC/BCC program was 39, 854 at the MTR and 62,895
by the end of the project, suggesting that some people were exposed to multiple activities.
There were a total of 11 active peer educators working with the returnees. The number of
SGBV cases reported by the returnees was the lowest among GLIA countries with 9
cumulative cases reported by MTR and 18 by the end of the project.

33.     Nevirapine tablets and boxes of Nevirapine syrup were procured and distributed
in government health facilities to support PMTCT services with 1, 761 women attending
prenatal care clinics benefiting from HIV counseling and testing services and receiving
their test results. Of those tested, 20 were HIV positive and were given a complete course
of ARV prophylaxis, per the national guidelines.

Rwanda

34.     GLIA funds were used to provide PMTCT services in refugee camps and
surrounding communities (9,195 cumulative number of pregnant women were tested and
received their result by the end of the project, of which 268 tested positive with 185
receiving a complete course of ARV prophylaxis to reduce the risk of PMTCT). Income
generating activities start up kits were given to 5,978 OVCs in the refugee camps and
numerous other income generating activities were scaled up in the surrounding
communities in line with the government’s policy of supporting vulnerable groups such
as PLWHA to find an alternative form of livelihood. The GLIA Support Project
supported a wide range of income generating activities (e.g. mushroom production, hair
salons, tailoring associations, kitchen gardens, rabbit and chicken raising, soap making)
both for the refugee camps (Gihembe, Kiziba, Nyabiheke) and surrounding communities
(Gicumbi, Karongi, Gatsibo), which reflects the close integration of GLIA activities
within the national HIV/AIDS program.

Component 2: Support to HIV/AIDS related networks

35.    GLIA targeted efforts around two principal transport corridors: (i) Mombasa-
Nairobi-Kampala- Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma; and (ii) Dar-es-Salam-Dodoma-

                                            45
Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma. In collaboration with member states, the GLIA
Secretariat conducted an inventory of health services along the main road axes and
selected sites strategically by prioritizing hot spots for disease transmission in proximity
to truck stops. In total, 21 Wellness Centers were established at these sites (Table 4).

36.     Health services (prevention, care, and treatment) for truckers and the
communities the groups (commercial sex workers) they interact with were gradually
expanded. The district health teams were the main providers of these services. In some
centers (e.g. Mlolongo Wellness Center in Kenya) a full range of health services were
provided while in others (e.g. Kigali based Magerwa Wellness Center) only recreational
and educational services were delivered. Training of counselors on HIV pre-test, post-
test counseling and psychosocial support to transport workers took place. Member states
also conducted planning meetings to inform national partners about HIV/AIDS services
targeted to long-haul transport workers and to foster improved coordination across
countries. Stakeholders from member states worked together to design the Wellness
Centers and facilitate access of long-distance truck drivers to health services along the
two main corridors.

a/ End of project status as reported by GLIA Focal Points

37.      Two           intermediary
institutions provided management
training for trainers-of-trainers
from the networks supported under
the project (i.e. long distance
truckers, PLWHA) in techniques
of organizational self-assessment,
and management. As a result of
this support, existing networks
were strengthened and new ones
                                     Source: www.aidscompetence.org
promoted by: (i) developing their
management capacity in the area
of planning, financial management, resource mobilization and M&E; and (ii) promoting

                                                            46
networking and developing HIV/AIDS learning capacity. The learning approach was
based on BP/UNITAR methodology known as the “AIDS Competence Program”,
developed by British Petroleum Company and UNITAR. Both direct beneficiaries and
other partners interviewed during the ICR mission noted that truck drivers’ networks and
associations of PLWHAs increased their capacities at individual and organizational level
to plan and implement HIV projects and manage resources.

38.     As table 5 shows, all targets set forth in the DGA for component 2 were achieved
or in some cases exceeded. By establishing roadside Wellness Centers and linking them
to selected health facilities along the major traffic corridors, GLIA made it possible to
provide HIV prevention, care and treatment to an otherwise underserved populations
group of long distance truck drivers and the groups they interact with (i.e. commercial
sex workers). In some cases (e.g. Uganda) the establishment of Wellness Center led local
communities to lobby for the creation of health facilities at nearby locations. Most of the
Wellness Centers were established towards the end of the project and network members
did not have enough time to implement all planned activities, hence they are now
operating with various degrees of functionality.

Component 3: Support to Regional health sector collaboration

39.    The GLIA Secretariat and member states have achieved tangible results in terms
of harmonizing HIV approaches and programs. This was one of the first major initiatives
to bring together NACs and Ministries of Health at the regional level, enhancing
collaboration and cooperation. According to the beneficiaries and partners interviewed
during the ICR mission, national HIV/AIDS related health-sector information exchange,
and harmonization of protocols resulted (or will result) in better services for mobile
population (e.g. long distance truck drivers).

40.    GLIA also facilitated the exchange of country experiences and good practices
between the NACs and implementers (MOH, PLWHA and transport networks), in
collaboration with other partners (WHO, EAC, IOM). Two regional workshops with
NACs and UNHCR on HIV/AIDS service delivery for refugees and the surrounding
communities were organized as well as two sub-regional workshops for the comparative
analysis and harmonization of 6 HIV service delivery protocols at sub-regional level.

41.    It is also important to mention GLIA’s contribution to having NACs reorient their
HIV/AIDS programs in line with their epidemiological profile, by focusing on high risk
groups, and integrating these activities into national HIV/AIDS Strategic Plans. The
2008-2012 GLIA HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan focused attention on these high risk groups
based on the work conducted under the project as well as the rapid epidemiological
review conducted with support of the World Bank. As noted below, the targets were
achieved, and to some extent exceeded (Table 6).

Component 4: Management, capacity strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and
reporting

42.     The GLIA Secretariat took over from the FMA in August 2007 following one
year of technical assistance. Financial management and reporting tools (including
internal auditing tools) were developed and in-country training sessions were conducted
to improve transparency and efficiency in the management of GLIA funds. GLIA
internal audits were conducted to verify the status of financial management systems put
in place by the member states.

43.     The GLIA M&E system was meant to function symbiotically with the six national
HIV M&E systems, to avoid duplicative efforts. The GLIA M&E Focal Points (based at
the NACs) were meant to be the key interface between the GLIA Secretariat and the
NACs, feeding information to the Secretariat, disseminating data to inform planning of
future HIV activities, and ensuring that all routine GLIA data were of good quality. An
assessment of the quality of reported routine GLIA data indicated that data quality was
weak, as the data quality assurance processes were not institutionalized or implemented
as planned in the GLIA M&E Implementation Manual. Only a couple of data audits/spot
checks were conducted, and the audit did not ‘trace and verify’ the reported data against
source documents at the GLIA implementation sites. Moreover, reporting was not done
on a quarterly basis as planned. Finally, the existence of multiple M&E frameworks
reflects the overall weaknesses which persisted throughout the project.

44.    Notwithstanding these shortcomings on M&E, the project has allowed member
countries to operationalize their organizational structures while at the same time
involving the countries in implementing activities at the grass root levels, and targeting
vulnerable groups which were otherwise left out from national HIV prevention activities.
Furthermore, the GLIA Secretariat, with support from GAMET completed an HIV
epidemiological and response analysis for the 6 countries. Based on this analysis, GLIA
formulated its 2008-2012 Strategic Plan that included priority activities to be scaled up
for mobile and at-risk populations.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     No specific economic analysis was carried out as part of the project preparation
for the GLIA Support Project or the ICR mission. The economic rationale for the
proposed project was based on the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa
Region (Report No.20727-AFR) which included a cost-benefit analysis of HIV/AIDS
interventions and an assessment of the overall impact of HIV/AIDS on the economy.

2.      The main findings of the assessment were as follows: (i) HIV/AIDS has negative
effects on productivity, domestic savings and overall economic growth; (ii) HIV/AIDS
increases health costs and runs the risk of crowding out other key public health programs,
such as immunization, maternal and child health, malaria and parasitic diseases; (iii) care
and treatment of AIDS patients imposes high costs on families and reduces their earning
power; and (iv) family coping strategies may result in children abandoning school
prematurely to look after relatives or families cutting other health or social expenditures
to unacceptable levels.

                         Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

        While no formal Beneficiary Survey was conducted views and attitudes of GLIA
stakeholders and beneficiaries were often solicited and documented, using the Most
Significant Change methodology, whereby individuals or groups were asked how the
project activities impacted their lives. While these individual stories are anecdotal in
nature a few stories are presented below as they give an overall sense of how
beneficiaries and stakeholders viewed the project and how they benefited from the
activities supported by the GLIA Support Project.

      Empowering truck-drivers to obtain HIV testing. During a SALT visit to Katma
       it was discovered that truck drivers were willing to have an HIV test but they
       were not available at times which were convenient to them. As noted by one
       truck driver, “The health center where tests are available is only four 4 kms away,
       but it is only open from 8:00 a.m to 17:00 p.m, while we never get to Katma
       (Uganda) before 19:00 p.m.” Soon after the community group with the health
       center came up with a solution of establishing mobile teams to serve truck drivers
       in the evenings. A team from the health center now comes every Thursday night
       to Katma with tests kits. [Story told by M. MUGENI Ouma Naphtal, from the
       Uganda Truck Drivers Network].

      Coming out on HIV/AIDS--two visits and a small revolution. While visiting
       Kibaigwa, an area known to have high infection rates, a GLIA team asked locals
       if they knew anyone living with AIDS. They all answered they did not. But
       when GLIA facilitators living with AIDS gave their testimony, people opened up.
       A mother of two children, who works in a NGO dealing with AIDS, said that she
       was HIV positive. After the meeting, truck-drivers introduced the team to some
       sex workers in a nearby restaurant. During a second visit, the team found out that
       these people had created a group of people living with HIV: 70 people had openly
       declared their status and had joined. One sex worker said: “when you came, last
       time, the way you listened and talked to us stimulated us. You made us believe
       that we can defeat the virus and stop spreading it”.

      Involving local communities and actors. Local communities, National AIDS
       Commissions, and individuals started taking the issue of HIV in their own hands.
       In Tanzania, before establishing the Wellness Centers, the steering committee
       held a meeting with the NAC. The result was that NAC sponsored visits to 3 sites
       and connected the steering committee to the district government which discussed
       the location of the centers. Local government allocated plots for the centers. By
       involving local authorities the “response is sustainable”, reported one stakeholder.
       In Kenya, the NAC brought together different actors to mobilize resources to
       launch Wellness Centers. The local governments donated land, a transport
       company provided containers and the NAC coordinated the set up. Kenyan truck
       drivers invited Ministry of Health officials to commemorate their colleague who
       died of AIDS. The long term problem of lack of treatment for STIs, and lack of

                                            55
    access to ART and VCT services was presented to them and mobile services were
    subsequently established. In North-East Uganda, SALT visits stimulated some
    300 sex workers to launch an association to stop the spread of HIV in their
    community, after doing their self-assessment.

   Promoting regional collaboration. The MSC methodology was also applied to
    determine view of stakeholders on the extent to which collaboration around
    HIV/AIDS was a vehicle for broader engagement and increased understanding
    between countries. In the words of some stakeholders, policymakers "did
    everything in their power so that the GLIA would go ahead, even overcoming
    political differences. The technical experts broke through these political barriers
    to really advance the initiative. Another stakeholder said, “When the parliaments,
    the Cabinets, all ratified the convention in six months, we were shocked! ….For
    me it was like a transformation… Because even getting three countries to work
    together at the highest political level, at the Ministerial level, would have been
    difficult two or three years ago, even impossible. So when they all ratified the
    convention, people were saying, “this is a real success, this is a major step
    forward.” One Bank stakeholder emphasized the strong commitment of the
    GLIA ministers who scrutinized the GLIA Convention carefully and who “wanted
    to make sure this would be a success… they clearly took ownership at every step
    of the process, which takes time, but which is also crucial for such an initiative”.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1.      This GLIA Completion Summary Report includes: (i) an assessment of the
project objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes, (ii) assessment of the
borrower`s performance and lessons learned, (iii) performance of the World Bank as well
as other partners who were involved in the design and implementation of the GLIA
operation, (iv) description of the proposed arrangements for sustaining the achievements
of the Project.

Assessment of the operation’s objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes

2.      The development objectives of the Project were and remain relevant. The
regional aspects of the project are unique. The design was consistent with the objectives.
The GLIA Support Project was an exciting experience and at the same time challenging.
The Project was the first major regional activity of the GLIA Secretariat, therefore it
helped the institution to pursue its mandate, and add value to national investments.
However, for some project components (2 &3), the design did not take into account
sufficiently the variable national and capacities and procedures.

3.      Regarding implementation, GLIA developed a generic Operations Manual which
specified clearly the implementation modalities. In spite of having clear procedures and
guidelines a number of implementation problems emerged, notably difficulties in
ensuring timely transfer of funds, and difficulties in addressing the rapidly changing
needs of refugees and returnees. In terms of timeliness of disbursements, problems
emerged due to the lengthy and cumbersome procedures for fund transfers, and the
different funding cycles in each country. As a result of the problems in the initial years,
implementation was concentrated in the final years following the Mid-Term Review with
some activities completed only towards the end.

4.     With respect to the Monitoring & Evaluation System, the Project faced serious
shortcomings. Lack of ownership of the M&E system was one of the key impediments;
moreover the duration of the Project was too short to develop and sustain broad based
ownership by all the NACs.

5.      Regarding operational experience, the GLIA Secretariat gained considerable
experience with the Bank-funded Project. It added value to GLIA as an organization.
GLIA gained operational experience in project design, proposal development, capacity
strengthening, financial management, M&E, advocacy, research, coordination and
oversight of regional and national projects. The Project was viewed as a pilot operation
that would lead to a follow up WBSP2 operation.

6.    The outcome of the operation against its objectives is generally satisfactory.
GLIA has initiated key activities that are regional in nature and considered high-value in


                                            58
the HIV/AIDS response. Though achievements are registered, impact could not be
measured due to the nature and length of the project.

Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned.

7.      The performance of the borrower was generally satisfactory. GLIA’s institutional
arrangements were well designed. Tremendous results have been attained despite the
weaknesses noted above. GLIA as an organization was, however, too dependent on the
WB financing. Nevertheless, the ownership and commitment of countries to implement
the project were demonstrated by:
         i) Issuing letters of commitment to participate in a regional programme.
        ii) Signing/ratifying the Convention establishing GLIA.
        iii) Setting up governance structures, and recruiting staff for the GSP
        Coordination.
        iii) Participating actively in the GLIA governance structures (i.e. Council of
        Ministers, Executive Committee).
        (iv) Meeting the financial contributions to the GLIA Secretariat with all Member
        States releasing their financial contributions by project completion.

Lessons Learned

8.     Regarding lessons learned, delivery of services on a regional level was
challenging, especially in the following areas: (i) establishment of effective regional
mechanisms of coordination, (ii) effective use of the harmonized HIV/AIDS related
protocols, (iii) operationalization of a regional network of Long Distance Truck Drivers,
(iv) sustained collaboration between various actors (NACs, Secretariat, World Bank,
MOH, Intermediary Agencies, other implementing agencies).

9.       The prospects for sustainability are challenged by the regional political context
(i.e. articulation with the EAC, with 5 out of the 6 GLIA member states represented in the
EAC), the collaboration with other regional projects, and linkages with national
programmes.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank and other partners during the
preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of
their relationships

10.   The Bank played a key role during the Project design, preparation, and
implementation. Its performance was satisfactory.

11.    During Project preparation: The WB discussions with GLIA countries started in
2002 at a very critical time for the organization due to lack of resources to run a
programme related to its mandate, five years after the creation of GLIA. The Bank
provided well appreciated support to comply with the conditions of effectiveness.



                                           59
12.     Regarding the Project Implementation: The WB also provided technical support
to GLIA during the implementation phase through regular supervision missions;
participated in the GLIA statutory meetings (COM, EC); provided quality assurance;
supported the process of mobilizing additional resources; provided continuous support on
procurement procedures; and assisted with Monitoring & Evaluation.

13.    The UNAIDS played a key role of facilitation during the preparation phase and
provided technical support during design and implementation by organizing meetings,
developing key project documents, and participating in supervision missions, mainly on
M&E aspects.

14.    The UNHCR signed a MOU with the Council of Ministers and Management
Contract with the GLIA Secretariat. UNHCR implemented project activities through
strong NGOs which functioned as sub implementers. The performance of sub
implementers was satisfactory despite some delays in carrying out the UNHCR activities.

15.    Project Results Framework The M&E framework was weak, not only in terms of
baseline, targets, and PDO data but also the support provided to GLIA to adjust the
framework and implement it. GLIA was also not capacitated to handle professionally the
M&E framework. The lesson to draw is that there was a joint responsibility on this very
important component of the project.

Proposed arrangements for sustaining achievements of the Project:

16.    To ensure the sustainability of the Project achievements, the following actions are
being considered:
     NACs to take over some project activities, particularly those in the surrounding
       communities and in some countries (e.g. Rwanda) in refugee camps as well.
     GLIA Secretariat to provide support for proposal development.
     Member states to continue paying their membership fees and the Rwandan
       government to continue providing office space for the Secretariat.
     NAC Focal Point concept to be realigned to the current national and regional
       context.
     GLIA Secretariat to be empowered/supported to play coordination and convening
       roles.
     NACs to use sub-implementers for projects so they can provide oversight
       functions.
     GLIA to be affiliated to a solid regional entity (i.e. EAC).

Comments on ICR

17.  Detailed comments were received from several National AIDS Commissions as
summarized below.

18.     The National AIDS Commission of Rwanda emphasized: (i) GLIA’s uniqueness
as an institution in the sub region with a strong mandate to fight HIV/AIDS; (ii) GLIA’s

                                           60
outstanding experience gained from the implementation of the Bank-funded project; (iii)
pilot nature of the 5-year project which yielded impressive results; (iv) positive impact of
project which is highly visible among beneficiaries, especially in terms of mitigation
measures which addressed the underlying vulnerability of those affected by HIV/AIDS;
(v) GLIA’s ability to bring together PLWHA and long distance truckers who typically
would not have interacted; (vi) need to consolidate achievements of civil society groups,
such as the long distance truck drivers and the drivers’ wives associations; (vii) need for
broader consultation with the Council of Ministers and the Executive Committee at
project completion to assist GLIA to develop an exit strategy, including mobilizing
additional resources; and (viii) importance of mobilizing additional resources from the
Bank in order to leverage other sources of funding.

19.     The Tanzanian National AIDS Commission underscored two issues related to
sustainability which are part of the lessons learned highlighted in this report: (i) early and
sustained involvement of a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. central government, local
government authorities, civil society groups) improved monitoring, increased ownership
of the GLIA activities, and enhanced prospects for sustainability; and (ii) strong linkages
between the GLIA-funded activities and local health services, including use of local staff
in implementing the project activities, has led to the inclusion of these activities into local
health plans and budgets, hence promoting sustainability.

20.     The Ugandan National AIDS Commission underscored five key points: (i) a
considerable amount of time was allocated to intermediary agencies under component
two, leaving the networks insufficient time and resources to implement their activities;
(ii) GLIA’s survival relies heavily on donor funding given modest country contributions,
which places the institution in a precarious situation; (iii) EAC health desk has agreed to
have GLIA as one of its implementing partners to ensure continuity of the Bank-funded
activities, particularly with respect to harmonization of protocols and operations of the
Wellness Centers; (iv) key planned activities were not implemented that could have
helped to better measure and discuss the performance of the project, including the Most
Significant Change methodology, and a project completion workshop to take stock of
achievements; and (v) monitoring and evaluation was lacking and the structures and
procedures for M&E were not effectively utilized.
