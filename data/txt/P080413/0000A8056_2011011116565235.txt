                         As of December 1, 2010, i.e. one month prior to the project closing, the Monitoring and Evaluation System could not provide data on key outcome indicators. During November 2010
                         mission it was agreed that the results of the ongoing Behavior and Serological Surveillance (BSS) surveys and data collection and analysis at country level would be used to to
                         assess the extent to which the project achieved the project development objectives.
