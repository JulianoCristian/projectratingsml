A.2. Project Objectives

The development objectives of the project are to facilitate:

·   Establishment of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation programs for
    mobile and vulnerable groups such as refugees, transport sector workers, and highly
    affected/infected populations in each of the GLIA member countries, and
·   Enhancement of prospects for coordinated approaches addressing HIV/AIDS
    prevention, care and treatment among the GLIA member countries.

The key performance indicators measuring effectiveness of project interventions (in those areas where
GLIA directly intervenes), will be: (a) a reduction in HIV prevalence in the refugee and surrounding
populations; (b) a reduction in the number of infected infants born to HIV infected mothers; (c) an increase
in the number of youth (aged 15-24) reporting condom use during sexual intercourse with a non-regular
partner (adapted UNGASS indicator); (d) improved gender sensitivity in the target population; and (e) an
increase in the number of youth respondents (aged 15-24) who correctly identify ways of preventing HIV
transmission and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmissions or prevention (adapted
UNGASS indicator).

    ·    Concerted action by UNAIDS partners, including the World Bank, other donors in support of a
         regional initiative, national and regional ownership and accountability.
    ·    NEPAD objectives that relate to HIV/AIDS and regional institutions increasing taking on
         responsibility for coordinated efforts.
    ·    Addressing Great Lakes problems of transient populations and policy coordination through:
         (a) Regionally owned institutional capacity to coordinate a multi-sectoral
         HIV/AIDS response;

        (b) Improving the situation of vulnerable and often underserved vulnerable
        groups; and
        (c) Confidence building among the GLIA countries in working together for
        mutual benefit in addressing a common enemy, namely the HIV virus.




A.3. Project Description

The proposed IDA Grant of $20.0 million would finance a four-year program. The direct
beneficiaries are a) refugees, IDPs, returnees, and surrounding area communities at
selected sites (in every GLIA country), and b) transport and PLWA association members.
Indirect beneficiaries are those in the Region who gain from better health policies,
programs and service delivery as a result of cross-fertilization. The four components are
as follows;


Component l: HIV/AIDS support to refugees, affected areas surrounding the refugee
communities, internally displaced people, returnees (US$8.0 million).

Refugee sites and adjacent affected areas represent underserved Great Lakes populations;
and returnees constitute another potential target population. This component will provide
services to a limited number of such populations, and could include the full range of
prevention, care, treatment and mitigation, principally through provision of services and
goods (very little civil works, primarily rehabilitation, is envisioned). "Transportability"
of what is learned or done for refugees, and "integration" of GLIA-financed activities
with the national program will determine program content. Activities will be closely
monitored and evaluated using linked behavioral and biological surveillance surveys and
sentinel sites so that if successful GLIA countries and donors will support replication.
Over the four year period a) UNHCR sites (principally refugee camps are estimated at
US$5.0 million, and b) surrounding areas, IDPs, and returnees are estimated at US$3.0
million.

UNHCR, which has HIV/AIDS programs underway and will be scaling up existing
programs or supporting portions of new GLIA areas, will be responsible for refugee sites;
regarding affected surrounding areas these will be administered by the national AIDS
Commissions/Secretariats (NAC/NAS) within the national HIV/AIDS-MAP framework
(unless the GLIA country and UNHCR agree it should take on additional tasks in affected
areas); returnees will be the shared responsibility of UNHCR and the NAC/NAS; while
responsibility for IDPs will be decided upon on a case-by-case basis. A Memorandum of
Understanding between GLIA and UNHCR will be presented to the Council of Ministers
at its next session. A Management Contract between GLIA and the UNHCR will set the
terms and conditions for financing UNHCR activities. This Management Contract has
been drafted and will be submitted to IDA for no-objection. Site selection was agreed on
during project preparation and programs designed using a standardized instrument for

situational analysis and development of HIV/AIDS program action plans. For the first
project year a maximum of two such sites/catchment areas were chosen in each GLIA
country and work plans were prepared in August 2004. Additional sites can be added in
subsequent years using the same methodology, and will be included in annual workplans
submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval. The approved sites that satisfactorily
implement first year plans will be continued. Such annual plans will be submitted to the
World Bank for no-objection on a consolidated basis.

Component 2: Support to HIV/AIDS related Networks (US$3.0 million). The transport
sector and PLWA are two high priority regional groups which have been the subject of
exchanges among GLIA countries, conferences, and informal linkages. In the case of
transport, GLIA has conducted pilot programs ("Safari Safis" program in 2001-2002).
Transport networking would focus on a) long-haul workers and those communities and
groups associated with them, and b) on two principal transmission corridors, namely (i)
Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma, and (ii) Dar es Salaam-
Dodoma-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma.            Subregional PLWHA network support
would provide important reinforcement of national and under-funded regional advocacy
efforts to reduce stigma of those infected and affected, engage in the sharing and testing
of PLWHA support practices by NGOs, CBOs, and the private sector for this vulnerable
population. Regional conferences       have created a "regional consciousness" among
PLWAs that they are not alone, and many cross-country contacts. These need to be
consolidated and strengthened.
The approach in both instances will be based on a BP/UNITAR methodology ("AIDS
Competence"). Existing networks will be strengthened and new ones promoted by a)
developing the management capacity of the networks and selected lead member
organizations in planning, financial management, resource mobilization and M&E via
the training-of trainers, b) developing HIV/AIDS learning capacity and transfer of
knowledge between network members. An intermediary institution(s) will be contracted
to: a) provide management training to network trainers-of-trainees, b) train national
facilitators in techniques of organization self-assessment, knowledge capturing and
knowledge sharing, c) assist in piloting knowledge rooms along the transport corridors,
and d) M&E. Based on agreed criteria, GLIA countries have gone through the process of
identifying those organizations which should be included in the networking pool.

Component 3:       Support to Regional health-sector collaboration (US$3.0 million).
National HIV/AIDS related health-sector information exchange, through which policies
and approaches can be discussed, and in future coordinated by and for key health-sector
stakeholders, will result in better use of scarce human and financial resources. Five
areas of such concentration have been identified: (i) an inventory of effective
interventions and sharing of information, (ii) review of protocols, materials and training
opportunities for prevention and treatment, (iii) information exchange on refugee, IDP,
returnee HIV/AIDS health-related programs, (iv) transport sector HIV/AIDS strategy
coordination and piloting of targeted transport packages along two main regional roads
(at sites identified for the network component intervention), (v) information exchange on
drug policies and procurement.

Component 4:            GLIA/MAP management, capacity strengthening, monitoring and
evaluation, and reporting (US$6.0 million).                          GLIA          will require institutional
strengthening so that it can coordinate resources made available from all sources, and
coordinate regional HIV/AIDS approaches. This component covers three activities: (a)
administration and management including support for the core professional staff, the
fiduciary management agent, allocations to GLIA Country Focal Points, and operating
expenses for GLIA operations, (b) capacity strengthening and policy discussion/technical
support, including fiduciary, management and advocacy training of those involved in
GLIA which is not addressed under Components 1-3 (such as regional training of GLIA
Country Focal Points and national teams), and policy discussion/development/technical
support for other cross-cutting issues (such as gender considerations in HIV/AIDS mobile
population programs) and
(c) monitoring and evaluation, and reporting, covering those aspects not financed under
Components 1-3.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Potential safeguard issues under the proposed project relate to (i) unsafe
medical waste management which - if left unattended - would contribute to water,
soil and air pollution as well as to an increase in exposure to HIV/AIDS among
health care workers, municipal staff dealing with waste management, and
scavengers at open dump sites; and (ii) the possible construction/rehabilitation of
facilities which would contribute to a loss of vegetation, soil erosion, soil and
water pollution.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.
Future project activities will not have long-term and/or indirect impacts.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
The discussion of alternatives was found to be irrelevant given that this project
will complement ongoing national HIV/AIDS activities.

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The participating GLIA countries have prepared an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and a Policy Framework for Compensation
(PFC) which will be applied to future GLIA activities.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders will include refugees, displaced persons, returnees, and
persons living with HIV/AIDS. They will benefit from project support for an
improvement in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation approaches
in widely scattered areas in virtually all GLIA countries. To ensure that the
environmental and social aspects of the project activities are addressed during
implementation, a consultant visited representatives of government ministries,
environmental management agencies, National Aid Commissions, UNHCHR,
UNAIDS to discuss appropriate measures to address these aspects. The
outcome of these discussions are reflected in the ESMF and the PFC referred to
above. Both documents have been approved by the respective agencies in the
GLIA countries and have been disclosed to the public in-country on September
28, 2004. The ESMF and the PFC have been approved by the Bank and
disclosed at the Bank's Infoshop on October 4, 2004.
