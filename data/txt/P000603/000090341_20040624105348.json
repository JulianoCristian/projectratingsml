{"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was unlikely, the institutional development impact was\n            modest, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate\n            that community cost participation is very important,\n            especially in countries where the Government cannot provide\n            the population with proper social services. More details on\n            the costs of the proposed activities have to be included in\n            the project planning in order to ensure that the financial\n            resources allocated correspond to the targeted results.\n            Where the Bank decides to support country programs, it is\n            important to (i) validate the analytical work supporting the\n            national program and (ii) ensure that the national\n            capacities to implement it are potentially available. In a\n            LICUS country, Vocational Training is problematic. Setting\n            up a demand-driven vocational training system in an\n            unstructured economy is not easy and requires prior\n            appropriate knowledge and an analysis of the market labor\n            force and the private sector. Addressing quality issues\n            requires prior national consensus on standards in curricula\n            and the evaluation system. In a changing institutional\n            context with weak national capacity, it is advisable that\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) have capacity to support\n            the Ministry in project monitoring and evaluation. By\n            decentralizing project management/implementation, the\n            project avoided interference with its implementation. Where\n            project management/implementation is decentralized and the\n            national capacity is low, close attention should be paid to\n            the coordination and communication between the PMU and its\n            decentralized units. Particularly, comprehensive procedures\n            and responsibilities on reporting should be set up from the beginning."}, "docdt": "2004-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
