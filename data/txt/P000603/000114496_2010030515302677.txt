Excellency:
We refer to the Interim Fund Development Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") for 
the above-referenced Project, dated October 24, 1997, between the Islamic Federal 
Republic of the Comoros (the "Borrower") and the International Development Association 
as Administrator of the interim trust fund established with funds contributed by 
certain members of International Development Association pursuant to Resolution No. 
IDA 184 of the Board of Governors of International Development Association (the 
"Association").  
Further to the discussions held with representatives of the Borrower, we are 
pleased to inform you that the Association proposes to hereby amend the Agreement as 
follows:
1.
Paragraph (j) of Section 1.02 of the Agreement is deleted and, accordingly, 
paragraphs (k), (l), (m), (n), (o) and (p) are renumbered paragraphs (j), (k), (l), 
(m), (n) and (o), respectively.
2.
Section 3.05 of the Agreement is deleted.
3.
Paragraph (d) of Section 7.01 of the Agreement is deleted and, accordingly, 
paragraph (e) is renumbered paragraph (d).
4.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended to read as 
set forth in Annex 1 to this letter.
5.
Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended by adding the following paragraph reading 
as follows:
"5.
It is understood that the percentages in the table in paragraph 1 of 
this Schedule have been calculated on the basis of the provisions in the 
Borrower’s Arrêté No. 00-133/MFBP dated June 9, 2000,  which exempt the goods, 
equipment, supplies, operating costs, works and services to be financed under 
the 
Credit from taxes and customs duties levied by the Borrower.  If any 
change 
is made to said Arrêté which has the effect of levying taxes or customs 
duties on 
such goods, equipment, supplies, operating costs, works or services, 
the 
percentages referred to above shall be decreased in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 5.08 of the General Conditions."
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing, on behalf of the Borrower, by 
countersigning and dating the form of confirmation on the two original copies of this 
letter provided and returning one original, as countersigned, to us.  Upon receipt by 
the Association of the copy of this letter countersigned by you, this amendment shall
