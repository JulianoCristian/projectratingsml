PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             The People's Republic of China
Beneficiaries:        Guizhou Phosphate Company (GPC);
Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
Loan Amount:          US$62.7 million equivalent
Terms of Loan:        20-year repayment, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
On-lending Terms:     The Government will on-lend the loan proceeds to GPC at
an on-lending rate equal to 1051 of the IBiD variable
rate, with a repayment period of 20 years, including 5
years of grace. The commitment charge and foreign
exchange risks will be passed on to GPC.
Project
Objectives:         The Project will assist China in achieving its priority
for the fertilizer sector under the Seventh and Eighth
Five-Year Plans (1986-95), which is to reduce the
nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by expanding the
production capacity for phosphate fertilizers, particu-
larly high-grade products such as triple superphosphate
(TSP) and monoaumonium phosphate (MAP), based on
domestic phosphate resources. More specifically the
Project will help GOC: (a) devise appropriate
strategies for developing an efficient phosphate
industry, including an optimal investment program to
meet phosphate needs in the least-cost manner;
(b) implf'ment the first major mine development of the
investment program; and (c) strengthen MCI's capability
to plan the development of the chemical eubsectors,
includin- phosphates. Considerable progress has already
been made with objectives (a) and (c) during Project
preparation through the Phosphate Subsector Study (the
Study), which was carried out jointly by the Bank and
MCI and which resulted in a phosphate subsector
investment progran to the year 2000. The major invest-
ment to be implemented under the Project will provide a
demonstration model for the development of domestic
phosphate 1eposits using modern mining and beneficiation
technologies. The Project will increase China's local
supply of phosphate rock by about 251.

Description:        The Project has two components:  (a) Wengfu mine
development - start-up of an open pit mine at Wengfu in
Guizhou with a capacity of 2.5 million tons per year
(Mtpy) run of mine (ROM) rock and construction of a
modern beneficiation plant to produce phosphate concen-
trate at the mine site and an associated slurry pipeline;
and (b) technical assistance - consultancy services for
Project management and mine workshop maintenance, and
provision of financial and technical assistance for the
computer-based sector investment optimization model,
developed under the Study by the Bank with CPI's assist-
ance with the data, to be installed, maintained and
further developed at MCI to strengthen its subsector
planning capability.
Project Risk:         Virtually no commercial risks are foreseen because
markets for Project output are assured. The entire
output of phosphate concentrate from the Wengfu mine
will be supplied to several downstream high-grade
fertilizer plants currently under construction and
another fertilizer plant to be established at the mine
site. The main technical risks lie in the coordination
of the implementation and commissioning of the mine and
the associated fertilizer plants. In the past, poor
coordination in implementing mine and fertilizer
investments, executed by separate entities under
separate budgets, haa been a common cause of under-
utilization of new mines in China, resulting in a
significant loss of economic benefits. This risk is
mitigated by involving internationally experienced
consultants in the technical assistance component; they
will help MCI and GPC with Project implementation and
staff training. The Government has assured the timely
completion of all downstream plants, including the
Wengfu TSP plant to be established at the project mine
site. The Government will coordinate all construction
work and report semi-annually on the progress of all
downstream plants. This risk will be further reduced
because a new 800,OGO tpy TSP plant to be established at
Wengfu, which would consume about 60X of the Project
output, will be implemented by the Project company.
This plant will be constructed and ready for operation
in accordance with the scope and timeframe agreed with
the Bank. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government and GPC to the same effect.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government uf the People's Republic of China (the Covernment,
cOC) has requested a Bank loan of US$62.7 million equivalent to finance a
phosphate development project (the Project). The Project embodies an
evolution in the Bank's fertilizer operations in China, geared toward
broadening the impact of Bank support on the development and efficiencj of the
entire fertilizer sector. The Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving
Project (Loan 2541-CHA, FY85), the first Bank fertilizer operation, supports
the rehabilitation of four large-size and one medium-size nitrogenous
fertilizer plants. The subsequent Furtilizer Rationalization Project (Loan
2838-CHA, FY87) aims at demonstrating alternatives for improving production
efficiency at medium-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants, which currently
produce low-grade fertilizers, by converting products from five such plants
into high-grade fertilizers. It also aims to strengthen sector-wide
institutional efficiency by introducing improved management systems at the
enterprise level.
1.2       This Project, which would be the third Bank-supported operation in
the fertilizer sector in China, broade;: the Bank's involvement beyond the
nitrogenous fertilizer subsector. Through the Phosphate Sector Study carried
out during Project preparation, a subsectoral approach to Bank assistance was
initiated, with the Bank providing financial and technical support to the
Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) for the design of subsector-wide
strategies.. That effort resulted in the preparation of an optimal investment
program that would allow China to meet its rapidly growing demand for
phosphate fertilizers in the least-cost manner.
1.3       Based on the above framework and consistent with the overall
development strategies worked out under the Study, the Project will support:
(a) development of a modern phosphate mine in Guizhou Province, which will
supply processed phosphate concentrate to six high-grade phosphate fertilizer
plants--five under construction and one currently in the design stage
(para. 6.5); and (b) provision of technical and training assistance to MCI for
the installation, maintenance and further development of the computer-based
investment optimization model developed jointly by the Bank and MCI.
1.4       The Project was initially identified in 1985, and was appraised by
Messrs. K. Song, K. Constant, H. Hendriks, D. Lil-oonwala and B. Stone in
December 1987. The earlier Phosphate Subsector Study was carried out under
Mr. W. Sheldrick's leadership during 1986-87.
1.5       The Project appraised by the Bank's project team also included the
development of two additional phosphate mines and two high-grade fertilizer
(respectively, MAP and TSP) plants at the mine sites in Hubei Province.
However, at the request of the Government, these investments will now be
processed separately. GOC wishes to delay the loan processing for these
investments as it has still to complete its own internal reviews. These
investments will now therefore be implemented on a different schedule.
Considering the urgency of developing the Guizhou mine in time for the
commissioning of downstream fertilizer plants currently under construction, it



- 2 -
is important that this investment adhere to the original timetable. A
separate project consisting of the Hubei investments is expected to be
prepared for Bank consideration in late 1988.
1.6       This report recomm.ends a Bank loan of US$62.7 million equivalent,
which would cover 28.32 of the total financing required and 84.61 of the total
foreign exchange financing required (equivalent to 100l of the foreign
component of the installed cost).



II. AN OVERVIEW OF CHINESE INDUSTRY
A. General Industry Background
2.1       Industry is China's largest productive sector accounting for nearly
47Z of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employing 17% of the total labor
force. About 94,000 state enterprises generate 74% of total industrial
output, the remainder being produced by about 368,000 non-state enterprises,
mainly urban and rural collectives. While state enterprises produce mainly
important raw materials, capital goods and strategic commodities such as
fertilizers, as well as light industrial and coasumer goods, most of non-state
enterprises are involved in the production of downstream consumer products.
Gross industrial output amounted to Y 1,119 billion (US$323 billion) in
1986. The chemical industry, the main products of which are fertilizers,
petrochemicals-and pharmaceuticals, accounted for 102 of the total industrial
output.
2.2       Gross value of industrial production has grown rapidly at a rate of
over 11% in real terms per year during the period 1980-86, in large part
reflecting the high rate of capital accumulation in industry. Until the late
1970s when the Government began to view external trade as an important element
of economic development, Chinese industry was oriented mainly toward the
domestic market. Since then, Chinese manufactured exports have grown steadily
from around US$8 billion equivalent to over US$20 billion in 1986, although
the share of exports in industrial output remains low (6.2%).
2.3       China's industrial development has been constrained by outdated
production technologies, poorly coordinated economic planning, and a distorted
structure of industrial prices. The industry structure is biased to basic,
heavy industries with all their attendant disadvantages in terms of
flexibility for change, lumpiness in investment needs, centralized management
structure with little incentive for innovation, severe distribution
constraints, low output prices, and major needs for plant rehabilitation and
modernization. About 801 of industrial fixed assets are of pre-1960
vintage. The consumption of raw materials and etnergy in factories amounts to
85% of manufacturing production costs. Although this high rate is partly due
to the relatively low cost of labor, it also reflects inefficient use of
inputs in the production process. Incentives for more efficient input use
have been impeded by low prices of energy and basic intermediates.  In
addition, past excessive focus on physical output and quantitative targets,
compounded with inadequate links with markets, often led enterprises to
neglect improvements in product quality and range.
B. The Government Objectives and Strategy for Induistrial Development
2.4       Since 1979, the Chinese Government has shifted the focus of
industrial levelopment towards light industry and introduced incentives and
market forces as a means of improving economic efficiency under on-going
economic reforms. The development strategy has emphasized modernization of
existing equipment, development of more efficient light industry and of
manufactured exports, and material and energy conservation in industry. Price
reforms, which have been perceived by the Government as one of the most

important elements of the on-going economic reforms, are aimed at reducing
price distortions gradually to enhance allocative economic efficiency,
particularly by allowing market forces to play an increasing role in price
determination. Since the start of economic reforms, the prices of major
industrial inputs, including energy, have been raised significantly to that
effect. Reforms adopted in 1984 aim at decentralizing economic decision-
making towards provinces and enterprises, and greater use of market signals to
provide production incentives. State enterprise reforms, include inter alia
the introduction of the contract management responsibility system, uniform
profit tax rates (55X) and wage incentives, have provided greater autonomy and
more appropriate incentives for enterprise management. However, significant
distortions in relative prices still remain, and the objective of replacing
tie traditionally "soft" enterprise budget constraint has yet to be
achieved. The reforms are being implemented at a different pace amfng regions
and subsectors. Because of the nature and structure of the fertilizer sector,
the process of decentralization has already progressed to a greater degree
than in some other industrial sectors.
C. Bank Support for Industry
2.5       The Bank Group's industrial lending operati3ns in China began in
December 1982 with the approval of a loan of US$70.6 mqillion to finance the
First China Investment Bank Project (Loan/Credit 2226/1313-CHA, FY83). Three
additional loans/credits of US$575 million to CIB (Loan/Credit 2434/1491-CHA
in FY84; Loan/Credit 2659/1594-CHA in FY86; and Loan/Credit 2783/1763-CHA in
FY87) have been approved subsequently. Of the total amount lent to this
institution of US$645.6 million, US$294 million was disbursed and outstanding
as at January 1, 1988. The main purpose of the CIB operations has been to
develop CIB as the premier financial intermediary providing term financing for
small- and medium-scale industry. CIB operations to date have supported a
wide range of subsectors, including: textile, light industry, electronics,
food processing, pharmaceuticals, packaging materials, machinery and spare
parts, building materials, chemicals and metallurgical, and other, in a number
of provinces, but principally in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Beijing,
i          Hubei, Liaoning, Anhui and Zhejiang.  The wide range of subsectors and the
well-dispersed geographical pattern have allowed CIB and its principal
branches to develop strong institutional ties to small- and medium-scale
industry in the country. Disbursements of the CIB loans and credits are,
apart from some delays in the first operation, ahead of schedule. While CIB's
manpower and systems require further strengthening, the- basis of a sound
development bank in China, particularly with regard to its leading branches
has been established.
2.6       Besides the four CIB operations, Bank Group involverent in the
industrial sector comprises: (a) two fertilizer loans, totaling US$194.6
million (para. 1.1); (b) a loan of US$100 million for the Shanghai Machine
Tool Project (Loan 2784-CHA, FY87), involving rehabilitation and modernization
of the machine tool sector in Shanghai; (c) a regional development project for
Gansu Province (Loan 2812-CHA, and Credit 1793-CIiA, FY87), including an
industrial development component of US$20 million, to be used for
diversification and modernization of the predominantly rural industrial base
in the province. Physical implementation of the two fertilizer projects is



- 5 -
proceeding on sched'zle. A Planning Support and Special Studies Project, which
includes components for supporting long-term planning activities in selected
subsectors, including petrochemicals, was approved in June 1987. None of the
above projects has to date reached completion.
2.7       The Bank's overall objectives in support of China's industrial
development are to assist the Government in: (a) improving the policy frame-
work for the industrial sector as a whole; (b) building sound institutions and
practices for financial intermediation, subsector planning, project approval
and implementation; (c) promoting and implementing technology upgrading, plant
restructuring and rehabilitation and energy and material conservation in
selected sectors at the national and provincial levels; and (d) carrying out
the needed reforms in the financial system.
2.8       Specific plans include further support for both CIB and other finan-
cial intermediaries, in the context of overall sector reform now underway,
assistance to selected major subsectors at the national and provincial levels,
namely, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and machine tools, and the development of
broad-based industrial lending operations at the provincial Level, involving
restructuring of major subsectors in the context of overall provincial
development strategies. The increasing devolution of planning and implementa-
tion responsibility to the provinces his the potential for a significant
impact on industrial development provided that the provincial authorities can
effectively formulate and carry out their new role. The anticipated series of
provincial operations is designed to help selected provinces articulate and
implement their new responsibilities. Operations are also planned in rural
industry initially through support for the Government's SPARK program, which
provides technical and financial support to selected rural enterprises, many
of which are outside the state sector.
III. THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A. Agricultural Background
3.1       The agriculture sector in China employs some 190 million farm
families and accounts for about 34% of the country's GDP. Despite having a
shortage of cultivatable land-of China's 960 million hectares (ha), only 10%
is cultivated, compared with 75% in India--China has achieved self-sufficiency
in its basic food requirements. That accomplishment is all the more
remarkable given that China has 22% of the world's population but only 8% of
its cultivated area. The reason for this success is intensive cultivation
practices, with relatively heavy inputs of labor, chemical and organic
fertilizers, and water per unit of land. Foodgrains occupy about 70X of the
total cultivated area. Cotton is the most important industrial crop.
3.2       The agricultural sector has performed exceptionally well since 1979,
when the Government introduced a new agricultural incentive program, the
"production responsibility system (PRS)." Reflecting these initiatives, the
gross value of agricultural production increased by 10% p.a. over the period
1980-86, compared to an average of 3% p.a. in the preceding 20 years. Major
changes that have taken place under the PRS include: (a) an increasing role



- 6 -
for farm households as the fundamental units of agricultural production and
management; (b) replacement of mandatory procurement quota with voluntary
contracts, which gives farmers more flexibility in determining what to grow
and where to sell; (c) price increases for major farm products; and (d) the
introduction of flexible prices within a certain range for deliveries of
certain products by collectives and individual producers in excess of
contracted targets.
B. Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
3.3       While China is the third largest user of chemical fertilizers and
the largest consumer of nitrogen in the world, the level of fertilizer use in
1985--167 kg of nutrients per hectare of cultivated land--was still only about
a third of that in neighboring countries such as Japan and Korea (see
Annex 3.1 for a comparison with other countries). The implication is that the
potential for increased fertilizer use is large. Sine expansion of the
cultivated area is not feasible, increasing and more .lanced fertilizer use
will remain central to China's strategy for increased agricultural output.
3.4       At present, there is an imbalance in the use of nitrogen (N),
phosphate (P 05) and potash (K 0) fertilizers. China's low application of
phosphate ana potash (para. 3.Z) reduces the synergistic benefits that could
derive from the relatively high level of nitrogen application. This imbalance
is a major constraint on increased application of nitrogenous fertilizers.
When compared with the application rates in the other countries given in
Annex 3.1, the low level of application of phosphate and potash fertilizers is
evident in China. According to results from surveys by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery (MAAF) during 1981-83, soil through-
out 73.4% of the cultivated area was deficient in phosphate, 39.8% being
seriously so.
C. Fertilizer Demand and Supply
3.5       Consumption, production and imports of chemical fertilizers from
1974 to 1986 are summarized, together with the projections for 1990 and 1995,
in Table 3.A (greater detail can be found in Annex 3.2).

tion.

MAAF; production data-MCI, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); and trade data--General
Administration of Customs end FAO.
3.6          Fertilizer Demand.   Consumption of all  fertilizers  increased from
4.2 million tons per year of nutrients (tpyn) in 1975 to 19.3 million tpyn in
1986, an average annual growth rate of 14.1Z. Growth in nitrogen consumption,
which increased at an average annual rate of 14.1% during 1972-81, has slowed
in recent years, mainly because the level of nitrogen application is
relatively high, especially compared to the use of phosphate and potash
fertilizers, whose supplies are limited. Consumption of the latter showed
average growth rates of, respectively, 11.0% and 37.9X - during 1972-86, in
line with the Government's continued emphasis on their increased application
to improve the overall nutrient balance.
3.7          China also has a long history of using organic fertilizer.   This
will continue to be a valuable source of nutrients and will complement further
increases in the use of chemical fertilizer. Total nutrients supplied by
organic fertilizers in 1986 are estimated at about 15 million tons.
1/    Potash consumption has  shown a very high rate of growth from a negligible
base in the early 1970s, but is still very low.



3.8       Based on its agricultural targets, the Government has projected that
the demand for chemical fertilizer will reach 27.9 million tpyn in 1995, with
implied average annual growth rates of about 2.0% for N, 6.9% for P205 and 13.2%
for K20. According to MAAF, the desirable long-term target for the ratio of
these nutrients is 100:50:20, compared with a current one of 100:33:8. GOC
plans to achieve the target by 1995 by rapidly expanding the consumption of
phosphate and potash fertilizers. However, it may be difficult to meet these
needs owing to domestic raw material constraints for potash and limited financial
resources for investment and imports.
3.9       Fertilizer Supply.  China, with about 1,900 operating fertilizer
plants of varying types and sizes, is the world's third largest producer of
chemical fertilizers after the USSR and the US. Chemical fertilizer
production increased from 3.7 million tpyn in 1972, peaking in 1984 at 14.6
million tpyn, before falling to 13.2 million tpyn in 1985. In 1986, it
reached 14.0 million tpyn. During the 1972-86 period, phosphate fertilizer
production showed a modest average growth rate of 4.6%, while nitrogenous
fertilizer production increased at a much faster rate of 11.8% p.a. For
potash the figure was 8.5Z.
3.10      The decline in domestic production of both nitrogenous and phosphate
fertilizers in 1985 was attributable mainly to the Government's decision to
close some 200 small inefficient plants producing low quality, low nutrient
fertilizers, such as ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), single superphosphate (SSP)
and calcium magnesium phosphate (CMP). The Government took this step in
response to diminishing demand for these fertilizers. Despite the aggressive
build-up of capacity for high-grade fertilizers in recent years, a significant
portion of the fertilizer production in China is, however, still low grade:
in 1985, only 30Z of nitrogen production and 2X of phosphate production
involved high-grade products such as urea (46Z N), MAP (52% P205) and TSP (46%
P205).
3.11      China plans to continue expanding the production capacity for
chemical fertilizer, particularly high-grade phosphate fertilizer, during the
Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plan periods (1986-95). It also intends to
rationalize existing low-grade fertilizer production facilities, by converting
their products to high-grade fertilizers.  New large- and medium-scale
fertilizer plants to be completed during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period -
are expected to increase China's high-grade fertilizer production capacity by
approximately 1.2 Mtpy of N, 0.6 Mtpy of P205, and 0.1 Mtpy of K20. Projects
under the Eighth Five-Year Plan, which is currently being formulated, are
expected to include further expansion in capacity for chemical fertilizers of
2/   Two 1,740 tpd urea plants, three 800 tpd DAP plants, a 400 tpd DAP plant,
a 2,970 tpd nitrophosphate plant, a 500 tpd nitrophosphate plant, an
1,800 tpd NPK plant, a 500 tpd NPK plant, and a 200,000 tpy potassiumr
chloride plant.



2.0 Mtpy of N and 1.9 Mtpy of P205.31 During 1986-95, all medium-size plants
currently producing low-grade fertilizer will be converted to high-grade
production.
3.12      Fertilizer Demand and Supply Balance.  Despite the impressive build-
up in production capacity during the last decade, and continued expeditious
expansion of capacity planned under the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans,
China will need to continue importing fertilizers to meet expected domestic
demand. In 1986, about 17% of China's apparent total consumption (domestic
production plus net imports) of chemical fertilizers was met by imports (12%
for nitrogen, 24% for phosphate and 96% for potash), at a value of over US$1.1
billion p.a., making China the world's largest net importer of fertilizers.
As Table 3.A shows, the overall fertilizer deficit is projected to increase
from 3.4 million tons of nutrients in 1985 to 8.0 million tons in 1990 and
9.9 million tons in 1995. The foreign exchange situation permitting, this
deficit will be met by imports.
D. Structure of the Fertilizer Industry
3.13      Production.  Except for 15 large-size urea plants (about 280,000 tpy
of ammonia each), most of China's approximately 1,900 fertilizer plants (about
1,200 producing nitrogenous and 700 phosphate nutrients) are using outdated
technology and do not conform to current international production norms. This
reflects the fact that most of China's fertilizer plants were built using
indigenous design, technology and equipment, a reflection of a policy in the
early phases of the industry's development of relying on local technology and
available raw materials to the extent possible. Because of the outdated
technology at the majority of these plants, the level of energy consumption
for fertilizer production has been high.
3.14      This approach was modified in the early 1970s, and during that
decade and the early 1980s, China built 15 large nitrogenous fertilizer plants
using imported technology and equipment. Almost all plants currently under
construction are based on internationally proven imported technologies.
3.15      Feedstock.  China uses a variety of locally available feedstocks for
fertilizer production. The large-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants use
natural gas, naphtha and fuel oil as feedstocks for ammonia production, while
the small- and medium-size plants mainly use coal. The small-size phosphatic
fertilizer plants use low-grade phosphate rock to produce SSP and-CMP. The
large- and medium-size high-grade phosphatic fertilizer plants under
construction or consideration will be based on both domestic phosphate rock
and imported phosphoric acid.
3/ Ten high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants with a capacity of 240,000-
480,000 tpy DAP or 400,000-800,000 tpy TSP, and five large-size urea
plants.



10 -
E.  Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
3.16      Fertilizer Allocation.  In May 1985, the Government changed its
approach to fertilizer allocation significantly by introducing a new contract
system for the procurement of farm output (see para. 3.2).  In the past, it
essentially allocated fertilizer according to a state allocation plan in
exchange for agricultural products acquired through the state procurement
system.  The current contract system gives both farmers and the Government
more flexibiiity in allocating fertilizer by reducing the quantities covered
by the state allocation plan.  Fertilizer producers are thus able to sell an
increasing portion of their production outside the state plan, sometimes
directly to farmers and across provincial boundaries. However, the state
procurement system still accounts for about 60% of total fertilizer
consumption and over 90% of the high-grade fertilizers, including urea and
DAP.
3.17      Fertilizer Marketing.  About 90% of chemical fertilizer is marketed
through the Agricultural Means of Production Corporation (AMPC), a state-owned
company under the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). AMPC handles all fertilizer
under the state allocation quota as well as a significant portion of the
above-quota production. Producers sell the balance directly to farmers. AMPC
procures fertilizer from the domestic plants and China Chemical Export and
Import Corporation (SINOCHEM), an agency under the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade, that is responsible for all imports of chemical
fertilizers. AMPC has some 2,500 offices at the national (accounting for
about 20% of AMPC's total purchases), provincial (28%), and county (52%)
levels. The county-level offices sell fertilizers to farmers through: (a)
about 64,000 retail cooperative shops (about 50% of AMPC's total sales); (b)
some 110,000 retail shops (32%); and (c) direct sales (18%).
3.18      Fertilizer Transportation.  So far, the transportation system has
been able to move the large and growing quantity of fertilizer, about 94
million product tons in 1986. Its transport has been given priority to ensure
timely availability to farmers. Fertilizer is moved, mainly in bagged form,
from plants and ports directly to a network of county-level AMPC warehouses
located close to the consuming areas. While high-grade fertilizers such as
urea and DAP are hauled long distances by rail, low-grade fertilizer such as
ABC and SSP from small plants generally located near the consuming areas is
transported mainly by road. About one-third of the total fertilizer
distributed in China moves by rail. River transportation also plays an
important role.
3.19      Fertilizer Storage.  Fertilizer storage capacity has not been
adequate in recent years to meet the peak storage requirements, given the rise
in consumption. The AMPC operates storage facilities for fertilizers at
various levels. Total capacity at these facilities is equivalent to three
months of national fertilizer consumption. AMPC warehouses at the national,
provincial and county levels account for half the total storage capacity; the
rest are located in the countryside at AMPC's retail shops. To reduce the
storage burden and its carrying costs, AMPC is currently encouraging farmers
to buy fertilizers during the off-season by offering rebates. The shortage of
warehousing capacity at periods of peak storage demand will be alleviated

gradually as high-grade fertilizers displace the low-grade ones, since the
former have a lesser volume.
F. Fertilizer Pricing and Prices
3.20      Trends under the Price Reforms.  GOC has embarked on a major effort
to reform the irrational system of prices, which currently prevails in the
country (para. 2.4). While the pace of the reform will, given the Government
concern on macroeconomic management and the obvious sensitivities involved,
inevitably vary from sector to sector and any time, its overall direction has
been clearly set. These ongoing economic reforms have involved expansion of
the role of market forces in fertilizer production and allocation. In the
past, the Government administered fertilizer prices strictly, as it did those
of other essential commodities. The current strategy assigns a greater role
to market forces in fertilizer pricing and allocation so as to improve the
efficiency of production and application. As a result, a two-tier pricing
system has emerged. The State Pricing Bureau (SPB) and local (province, city
and county) bureaus set the prices for the production subject to the state
plan quotas at both the ex-factory and farm-gate levels. Market-influenced
prices negotiated within the limits of guideline retail prices set by state
and loWal pricing authorities prevail for production outside the state plan
quota.-   Fertilizer producers market these products directly.
3.21      At present, about 40Z of total consumption is sold at negotiated
prices, although the percentage varies significantly across products and
localities and with the financial situation of individual manufacturers. In
general, high-grade fertilizers are subject to stricter state allocation.
Over 90Z of these products, including urea and DAP, are currently being sold
at controlled prices under the state allocation plan.
3.22      The Government views the two-tier pricing system as an intermediate
step in the evolution of sectoral pricing policy, given its well-recognized
limitations, including: (a) discrimination across producers and consumers;
(b) administrative complexity; and (c) distortions and time lags in the
adjustment of the prices of inputs and outputs. Nevertheless, it expects to
use this transitional syst-m until it introduces a broader price reform
package. The reason is in part the close interrelationship between fertilizer
and the agricultural sector and the potential for disruption if the allocation
and pricing arrangements for fertilizers were to be liberalized in
isolation.
3.23      The Government's strategy is to continue gradually reducing its
administrative control of fertilizer pricing in parallel with the gradual
dismantling of annual production planning and allocation, so that the economy
can "grow out of the plan." Guidelines for future policy reforms are being
4/   At present, a ceiling for negotiated prices of all high-grade
fertilizers, such as urea and MAP, exists at the retail level. This
ceiling is currently set by the SPB, but in the future will be set by
provincial authorities following guidelines to be given by the SPB.



- 12 -
developed by an inter-agency working group that is carrying out a comprehen-
sive review of the fertilizer pricing and allocation policies according to a
scope of work discussed with the Bank. Through these reforms, GOC is
committed to remove irrationalities that exist in price relationships between
inputs, fertilizers and agricultural products. The group is headed by the
Director of the Department for Heavy Industry and Communication and comprises
representatives from related Government agencies, including the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), MCI, MOC, MAAF and China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC).
3.24      Fertilizer Prices.  The ex-factory prices of major high-grade
fertilizers and ABC, the delivered prices of the main inputs, and farmers'
prices for major grains, together with comparable international border prices
in January 1988, are shown in Annex 3.3.  Presently, the controlled ex-factory
prices of urea and DAP are below the border prices, while their negotiated
prices are close to the economic prices. In January 1988, the controlled urea
price-Y 410 (US$l10)/ton--represented about 73% of the CIF import price of
US$151/ton, while the ceiling for the negotiated price was set at 94% of the
economic value. For DAP, the figures are, for plan output, Y 598 (US$161)/
ton, or 84% of the import parity price of US$192, and for the negotiated
price, Y 700 (US$188), or 98%. At present, there is no local production of
TSP and MAP, and controlled ex-factory prices have therefore not been
established. The ceilings for negotiated prices for future TSP and MAP
production are expected to be set in line with that for DAP. The Government
provi4es subsidies to make up the difference between the import and sale
prices for imported fertilizers. Actual negotiated ex-factory prices have
usually been equal or close to the ceiling; these prices have frequently
exceeded the. ceiling, with approval from the pricing authorities, at least
during the peak season.
3.25      An average distribution margin of about Y 100 (US$27/ton of product)
is added to the ex-factory price at the farm-gate level to cover AMPC's
transport and storage costs.
3.26      Prices of Fertilizers Relative to Agricultural Products.  The price
structure of agricultural products is similar to that of fertilizers.
Agricultural products traded by the state procurement system are subject to
controlled prices. While some exceptions exist, these are generally below
border prices, while the market-influenced negotiated prices more closely
approximate the border prices. For example, as of Janaary 1988, the
controlled price of rice was Y 632 (US$167)/ton, about 79Z of its export value
of US$212/ton, whereas its negotiated price was Y 840 (US$226)/ton (Annex
3.2). The controlled price of wheat was Y 328 (US$119)/ton, about 79Z of the
CIF import price of US$150, the negotiated price, Y 500 (US$161)/ton.
3.27      Prices of Fertilizer Inputs and Phosphate Concentrate.  The price
structure of major inputs into fertilizer production is also similar to that
of fertilizers. However, country-wide uniform controlled prices for these
inputs do not exist, and the controlled prices applied to individual suppliers
are set by each supplier's respective supervisory pricing authority at the
central, provincial and county levels. These prices, while varying to a large
extent depending on the quality of product and the location and geological
condition of supply sources, are on the whole far below their border prices.



- 13 -
The controlled price of natural gas under the state allocation quota is around
55-65Z of its fuel oil equivalent value based on border prices. The
controlled price of coal is 50-60X of its export value. The average ex-mine
controlled price of domestic phosphate rock, the quality of which is usually
too low to be tradeable in the international market, is about 50% of the
imr,.vt parity price based on nutrient contents. Negotiated prices above the
quota are generally higher than the controlled prices by 15-25X; although in
sorm' cases they have, subject to approval by the pricing authorities,
approached border prices.
3.28      During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government
that GPC will be allowed to market its entire output (fertilizers from the
downstream Wengfu TSP plant, which will be established at the project mine
site, and phosphate concentrate to be sold to other downstream fertilizer
plants) outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices.
C. Government Strategy in the Fertilizer Sector
3.29      In view of its importance to agriculture, the fertilizer sector has
been, and will continue to be, a sector of high priority for the allocation of
investment resources. The Government reiterated this priority in a statement
published by the State Council in September 1987.
3.30      The Government's main objectives in the fertilizer sector are to:
(a) achieve the desirable nutrient balance of 100(N): 50 (P205): 20 (K20) by
the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) by rapidly expanding the
production capacity for phosphate fertilizers, based on domestic phosphate
rock and the development of domestic potash resources; and (b) move toward
self-sufficiency in fertilizers during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
Other priorities include the rationalization of low-grade fertilizer facili-
ties through technical renovation, energy-saving measures and improvement in
product quality, and greater efficiency in enterprise operations through
improvements in management efficiency.
3.31      The Government's strategy for sectoral investment during the Seventh
Five-Year Plan envisages: (a) bringing on-line the new fertilizer production
capacity currently under construction (see para. 3.11); (b) converting medium-
size low-grade fertilizer plants to high-grade fertilizer production;
(c) intensifying the exploitation and development of domestic phosphate
resources, including seven large new phosphate mines and the expansion of
pyrites mining capacity; and (d) rationalization of many small-size low-grade
fertilizer plants, including their conversion to high-grade operations using
adaptive technologies. At present, the Government does not contemplate any
investments in new small-size SSP or ABC plants.
3.32      During the Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000), Government
strategy will focus on further expansion of phosphate fertilizer production
capacity, with State resources going mainly for phosphate fertilizer. The
Government will not initiate any new nitrogenous fertilizer projects; these
will be implemented by the provincial authorities as necessary. This strategy
is considered appropriate, given the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use and
China's endowment of phosphate rock.

IV. THE PHOSPHATE SUBSECTOR
A. World Phosphate Market Background
4.1       Consumption.  World phosphate fertilizer consumption grew steadily
in the 1970s and early 1980s except in 1985/86 when a decline of 2.6% from the
previous year's consumption was registered. According to statistics published
by FAO, world consumption of phosphate fertilizers rose from 19.8 million tons
of P20 to 34.3 million tons during 1969/70 to 1984/35 at an annual average
rate of 3.5%. The decline in 1985/86 reflects the reduced application of
fertilizers in several countries exporting agricultural products due to the
record-low prices of grains and agricultural products in the international
market. In 1986/87, world phosphate consumption has rebounded to 33.9 million
tons of P205 largely due to a rapid consumption increase in developing
countries. Wc-ld phosphate consumption is projected by the Bank's Economic
Analysis and Projections Department to increase at an annual average rate of
2.7% between 1985 and the year 2000. In 1985/86, major consuming countries of
phosphate fertilizers were USSR (23.0X of the world consumption), U.S.
(11.5%), China (8.5%), India (5.7%), France (4.5%), and Brazil (3.9%).
4.2       Production.  World production of phosphate fertilizers also grew
steadily from 20.6 million tons of P205 in 1969/70 to a peak of 37.2 million
tons in 1984/85. In response to the trends in demand for phosphate ferti-
lizers, world phosphate production decreased to 34.6 million tons in 1986/87,
and rebounded in 1986/87. In 1985/86, major producing countries of phosphate
fertilizers were U.S. (23.0Z of world production), USSR (22.6%), China (5.3%),
India (4.2%), Brazil (3.7%), and France (3.0%). According to supply projec-
tions by the FAO/UNIDO/World Bank Fertilizer Group in May 1987, world
phosphate fertilizer supply potential, which is derived from world nominal
capacity in operation and under construction and country specific operation
rates, was estimated at 36.8 million tons of P205 in 1986/87, and was expected
to reach 41.8 million tons by 1991/92, representing an annual average growth
rate of 2.4%. Major increase in capacity is expected to take place in
developing countries, particularlv in Morroco, Tunisia, Jordan, China and
Egypt. The recent world-wide trend is to locate new production facilities
near mine sites.
4.3       International Trade and Market Prices.  The international phosphate
market is competitive, with two main exporting regions of North America and
Northern Africa and all other regions importing. Phosphate fertilizer prices
in the world market, which fell sharply during the 1980-83 world-wide
recession and reached the record-low level in 1986, increased recently as
world demand for phosphate fertilizers, particularly in developing countries,
recovered. While the world market prices of phosphate fertilizers are not
expected to increase significantly in the short run given the forecast
movement in the agricultural market and the industry's investment behavior,
the recovery of these prices is expected to be gradual and steady throughout
the 1990s. Fertilizer production facilities to be established under the
Project are expected to come on stream in early 1993.



- 15 -
B. The Phosphate Industry
4.4       Although domestic production and the use of phosphate fertilizers
has increased steadily over the last two decades, development of the industry
in China has been less spectacular than that of the nitrogen industry. The
main constraint has been technical difficulties in processing Cninese rock,
which has a high magnesium content, into concentrates suitable for the
production of high-grade fertilizers. Production of phosphate fertilizer has
therefore been limited to low-grade products such as SSP and CMP at small
provincial phosphate fertilizer plants. Accordingly, there was little
planning and coordination of the development of the phosphate fertilizer
industry at the State level. However, several years ago the Government
shifted the priority in the fertilizer sector from nitrogenous to phosphate
fertilizers, in order to correct the significant imbalance in fertilizer use.
4.5       Domestic Phosphate Fertilizer Production.  Recent trends in the
production of phosphate fertilizers are summarized in Table 4.A below (further
details are given in Annex 4.1). As of the end of 1987, almost all phosphate
fertilizer production was low-grade, with SSP comprising more than 70X and CMP
most of the balance. Domestic production of other phosphate fertilizers has
been insignificant--in 1985, ammonium phosphate production was only 7,000 tons
of P,O5, while the total capacity of phosphoric acid plants was only about
50,000 tpy of PRO,.  About 400,000 tons of ground phosphate rock were also
being applied directly.

- 16 -
4.6       There are about 700 phosphate fertilizer plants in China, scattered
in almost every province (see Annex 4.2). The average output capacity is
15,000-30,000 tpy, except for a few SSP plants that have capacities of more
than 100,000 tpy. Most of the production in each province is currently
consumed within its boundaries (Annex 4.3).
C. Supply of Raw Materials
4.7       The two main materials required for producing high-grade phosphate
fertilizers are phosphate rock and sulfuric acid.
4.8       Phosphate Rock.  China is well endowed with more than 3 billion tons
of phosphate rock (see Annex 4.4). The physical nature of the rock is similar
across deposits, usually hard and with a high magnesium oxide (MgO) content
varying from about 2.5-6.0Z. Until recently, when a new process for benefi-
ciating these rocks was developed in China, domestic rocks were not suitable
for the production of high-grade phosphate fertilizers. Now, however, the
Covernment is planning several new large undertakings to exploit the major
deposits of rock, particularly in Guizhou, Hubei and Yunnan Provinces. The
Project will support one such effort. Recent exploration also indicates large
rock resources in Sichuan Province.
4.9       Relative to the large size of the phosphate rock reserves, the
current level of production is small, for the reasons given above. Average
annual production of phosphate rock between 1983-85 amounted to only 11
million tons of run of mine (ROM) rock, mainly in five provinces, as shown in
Table 4.B. In 1985, most of this rock was used as ROM rock; only about 5X was
beneficiated before use.

Source: MCI
4.10      Because the phosphate fertilizer plants are small and scattered
throughout the country, phosphate rock is transported widely over China.
Yunnan Province, for example, sends rock to 24 provinces, Guizhou to 18 and
Hubei to 19. The major importing provinces are, however, Hubei, Liaoning,
Jiangsu, Shandong and Guangxi. China imports a small quantity of rock
(varying between 0.2 to 0.3 Mtpy from year to year) for some plants near the
coast. It also exports a small amount of phosphate rock under counter-trading
arrangements with other developing countries.



- 17 -
4.11      Sulfuric Acid.  China's sulfuric acid consumption in 1986 was about
8.5 million tons, of which about 5.0 million tons went for phosphate ferti-
lizer production. China meets almost the entire demand for sulfuric acid
domestically.  About 1.2 million tons of acid comes from smelter gas, and
almost ell the remainder from pyrites; only a small amount comes from elemen-
tal sulfur.
4.12      The major deposits and mines of pyrites are located in Guangdong,
Shanxi, Anhui, Li.aoning, Hunan and Sichuan Provinces (Annex 4.5). The major
producers of. smelter acid are in Liaoning, Gansu and Hunan. China has
discovered sulfur deposits in Shandong Province, but attempts to exploit them
have not been successful. Little sulfur is recovered from the oil and gas
industry as most gas deposits are sweet.
4.13      The shortage of sulfur could become a constraint on development of
the phosphate industry unless new deposits of pyrites or sources of by-product
sulfuric acid (e.g. phosphogypsum) are developed. GOC is aware of this
possibility and is establishing a pilot plant in Yunnan to develop a process
to recover sulfur from phosphogypsum.
D. The Phosphate Subsector Study
4.14      As mentioned earlier (para. 1.2), during Project preparation MCI and
the World Bank carried out a joint Phosphate Subsector Study (the Study) to
help the Government identify appropriate strategies for the development of an
efficient domestic phosphate fertilizer industry. The main objective of the
Study was to prepare an optimal investment program up to the year 2000 that
would allow China to meet its rapidly growing demand for phosphate fertilizers
in the most economic manner, given specified market requirements and transport
constraints.
4.15      The Phosphate Model.  As part of the Study, the Bank designed a
computer-based mathematical programming model to facilitate review of the
options, using data provided by MCI (see Annex 4.6 for the details). The
model covers optimization of investment at the national level as well as at
each plant in terms of location, scale of operations, and levels of production
in the context of the constraints associated with the transport of raw
materials, intermediates and final products. Selection of optimal strategies
was based on a comparison of different options and scenarios. The model
enabled the Government to review in a consistent and integrated manner the
major issues involved in developing the fertilizer industry, such as:
(a) domestic fertilizer production versus imports; (b) optimal mode of
transport of raw materials and finished products; (c) the location of new
fertilizer production facilities; (d) the relative economics of producing
different types of phosphate fertilizers; and (e) priorities in developing the
different phosphate rock deposits. This model will be installed at MCI's
Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) under the Project, and continuously updated
to provide advice to planning and project implementing authorities on relevant
subsector strategies (para. 6.9).
4.16      The results of work with the model provided strong economic justifi-
cation for development of China's domestic phosphate fertilizer industry,



- 18 -
based on domestic raw materials. The analysis suggested that production of
high-grade phosphate fertilizers such as TSP, DAP and MAP near the rock
sources in Yunnan, Guizhou and Hubei Provinces can be more economic than
reliance on imports. Construction of small DAP plants that use adaptive
technology and local raw materials will also help China meet its phosphate
needs.
E. Investment Program for the Phosphate Subsector
4.17      To meet its agricultural production targets by the year 2000 with
balanced use of the three main fertilizer nutrients, China will have to
increase its phosphate consumption to about 9.1 million tons of P205 from its
current level of 4.5 million tons. If most of the presently known economic
deposits are fully developed by that time, China could increase domestic
production from the 1986 level of 2.3 million tons of P205 to 9.0 million
tons. This development would necessitate an increase in phosphate rock
production from about 11 to 35 million tpy of rock and in sulfuric acid from
about 8 to more than 20 million tons. Total related investment costs for the
production facilities are estimated at about US$8-10 billion in 1988 prices,
exclusive of considerable investment required to upgrade the infrastructure
needed to transport raw materials to the processing units and to distribute
the final products to the marketplace.
4.18      During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, five new large phosphate rock
mines and many small local mines are to be developed (the Wengfu mine in
Cuizhou, one mine in Yunnan, and three mines in Hubei). Output at the large
pyrites mines in Guangdong, Neimonggol, Hunan and Anhui will be increased
substantially to meet the demand for sulfuric acid. These local raw materials
will feed the new high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants to be implemented
during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plan periods. Three DAP plants will
be implemented based on imported phosphoric acid. About 50 small SSP plants
will be revamped to produce DAP using adaptive technology, a move that will
allow them to ucilize relatively low-grade phosphate rock. During the Eighth
and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000), the Government intends to fully exploit
the domestic phosphate resources to produce a total of 35 Mtpy of phosphate
rock (30% P205 basis) and 9.0 Mtpy of phosphate fertilizers (100 P205) by the
year 2000. Details on specific investments in the phosphate subsector up to
the year 2000, preliminarily prepared on the above basis, are given in
Annex 4.7.
F. Bank Role and Project Justification
4.19      In support of the Government's efforts to implement its strategies
in the fertilizer sector (paras. 3.29-3.32), the Bank's main role is to
provide technical and financial assistance in: (a) strengthening GOC's
capability for investment planning based on modern planning techniques, in
order to optimize investments in the sector, especially those for phosphate
and potash fertilizer; (b) assessing specific projects using suitable method-
ologies, including the selection of appropriate technologies; (c) building new
fertilizer production capacity, as well as renovating existing facilities,
particularly for phosphate and potash fertilizers; (d) enterprise-level
restructuring and upgrading the efficiency of fertilizer distribution so as to



- 19 -
reduce fertilizer losses during distribution; and (e) improving the managerial
efficiency of sector companies through the introduction of modern enterprise-
level management systems.
4.20      The two previous Bank-supported fertilizer projects supported
China's priority objective during the early part of the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1986-90), which has been given to improving the technical and managerial
efficiency of existing fertilizer plants. Most of the existing large- and
medium-size fertilizer plants, including the large ones built based on inter-
nationally proven technologies in the 1970s, do not use up-to-date technolo-
gies and require major investments to improve energy and production efficien-
cies. The first project (Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project,
Loan 2541-CHA, FY85) which is expected to be completed in the latter half of
1988, provides financial assistance for improvements in efficiency at one
medium-size and four large nitrogenous fertilizer plants. The second project
(Fertilizer Rationalization Project, Loan 2838-CHA, FY87), being supported by
t~-e Bank provides financial assistance both to upgrade the operations of five
medium-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants, including conversion of their
products to hiah-grade ones, and to introduce modern enterprise-level manage-
ment systems in tie fertilizer industry overall. Implementation of these
projects iE proce-ding well and on schedule.  An IDA-financed technical credit
was also provides to support project preparation, including tests of the
phosphate rock and feasibility studies for the Project.
4.21      The Project supports China's priority in the fertilizer sector
during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans (1986-95), which is to reduce
the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by rapidly expanding the production
capacity for high-grade phosphate products. At the same time, the process of
project preparation has provided an opportunity to introduce modern subsector
planning techniques and methodologies to the phosphate industry and to help
GOC articulate an optimal strategy for the development of the subsector. The
implementation and further development of this strategy will be supported
under the Project. By involving MCI in the joint phosphate sabsector study,
its subsector planning capability has been strengthened. The experience and
methodologies learned from the Study can also be applied to other subsectors,
an aspect in which the Chinese Government has already expressed an interest.
This Project also supports the development of a modern phosphate mine, the
first such mine development in China in terms of size and configuration. This
effort will help China gain the experience necessary for implementing other
similar investments, which have already been identified in the Study. The
technical assistance component is designed to ensure successful transfer of
subsector planning technologies from the Bank to GOC.

V. PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
5.1       The Phosphate Development Project involves:  (a) Guizhou Phosphate
Company (GPC), Guizhou Province, which will implement the Wengfu mine develop-
ment component (paras. 6.3-6.6); and (b) MCI, which will coordinate Project
execution and implement the technical assistance component (paras. 6.7-
6.9).   The operational, managerial and organizational aspects of these
institutions are reviewed in this chapter, while the financial aspects are
reviewed in Chapter IX.
A. General Institutional Background
5.2       Chinese chemical fertilizer companies and phosphate mines are state-
owned, but operate as financially and administratively independent entities.
They are registered with their respective supervisory authorities--provincial,
city or county governments to provide them with the status of legal enti-
ties.  In the past, the administrative, production, marketing and financial
operations of these companies were under the direct supervision of the super-
visory authorities. However, their autonomy in business decisions has been
expanding, and is expected to continue doing so, under the ongoing economic
reforms. Particularly, large-size companies already enjoy wide autonomy in
almost all aspects of operations. GPC is a new comppy which was legally
established to carry out the Wengfu mine component. " GPC's charter, which
has been registered with the Guizhou provincial authority, describes the scope
of its activities, responsibilities and authority in the conduct of business.
5.3       Organization and Management.  The organization and management
practices of Chinese state-owned industrial enterprises reveal strong simila-
rities. Their organization is basically flat--there are numerous unit work-
shops and departments with their own management layers, all at the same
organizational level. A general manager, appointed by the supervisory govern-
ment, heads each company. Under the general manager are the second-layer
managers, who share functional responsibilities related to procurement and
sales, administration, production, maintenance and construction. A chief
engineer, also second-layer, is charged with all technical matters, including
development and renovation. A chief accountant has a similar position in the
area of financial matters.
5.4       This structure has not promoted contemporary standards of organiza-
tional and managerial efficiency, such as adequate scope of control, func-
tional distribution of responsibilities among line managers, and adequate
managerial and financial autonomy. The Government (SPC, MCI and the local
Governments) has been setting annual production targets, allocating inputs,
distributing output and allocating funds from budgets. Some managers, parti-
cularly those responsible for production, have been overloaded with supervi-
*           sory responsibilities.  Horizontal coordination among various departments and
5/   GPC currently does not have production operations.



- 21 -
workshops is not satisfactory. Because of insufficient autonomy, good manage-
ment information and cost management systems do not exist.
5.5       Recent Management Reforms.  Under the recent economic reforms,
Chinese fertilizer companies have received increasing management autonomy.
One result, however, is that there is now a two-tier planning and management
system. The state plan mandates a basic minimum level of activity, but beyond
that level each company is free to operate in response to market forces under
its own flexible plan. Companies can make their own decisions regarding
production levels, procurement of raw materials, sales of products above the
quota, and utilization of funds generated by those sales, within the context
of the flexible plan. Although state planning for the fertilizer sector is
expected to continue in the near future, the scope for flexible planning and
management is to expand further, providing still greater autonomy to manage-
ment.
5.6       MCI recognizes the strong need to restructure the organization and
management of the chemical fertilizer (including phosphate mining) companies
so that they can effectively carry out their mandates for organizational
change. One means is through the introduction of modern enterprise-level
management systems for information and costs, as well as investment and
financial planning. MCI, with Bank assistance under the Fertilizer
Rationalization Project (Loan 2838-CHA, FY87), is currently sponsoring a
management efficiency study, using internationally experienced consultants.
The aim is to raise managerial efficiency in fertilizer companies in the
context of the changing business environment. This study, which is expected
to be completed by the end of 1989, will also provide practical
recommendations on the introduction of suitable modern systems.  MCI plans to
introduce these systems gradually in the entire chemical industry following
successful introduction of them at several companies on a pilot basis.
B. The Guizhou Phosphate Company (GPC)
5.7       Background.  GPC, located in Wengan County, about 160 km northeast
of Guiyang, the capital city of Guizhou Province, was founded in 1984 to
exploit the phosphate deposits in the Wengfu area. The company has completed
exploration work.
5.8       Organization and Management.  GPC has the basic organizational
structure described above (para. 5.3). It is headed by a general manager, to
whom four second-layer managers report (the director of the mine, the chief
engineer, and the managers of the construction and finance departments).
Several third-layer managers have also been appointed. Most managerial
personnel have relevant experience in phosphate mining from their involvement
in Guizhou's Kaiyang phosphate mine and through the recent exploration,
project preparation and construction activities for this Project. Neverthe-
less, considerable reinforcement of GPC's management capabilities needs to
take place during Project implementation. Annex 5.1 shows GPC's existing
organizational structure as well as the one currently envisaged after Project
completion.



- 22 -
5.9       Staffing and Training. CPC staff presently number 90, of whom 20
are second- and third-layer managers, 68 are engineers holding college degrees
or higher, and 22 are administrative staff and workers. The ratio of upper to
lower level staff is relatively high, because GPC is still being set up.
After project completion, GPC's total staff is expected to be about 1,000, of
whom 110 will be managers. The implication is that GPC will need to recruit
additional skilled personnel from other mines.
5.10      Given the requirement of staff experienced in implementing and
operating such a complex Project, consultancy services will be required for
smooth Project implementation. Further, recruitment and training of qualified
staff will be essential to the success of the Project. During loan negotia-
tions, an assurance was obtained that GPC will prepare, and furnish to the
Bank for comment by June 30, 1989, a comprehensive program to strengthen
management, recruit qualified staff, and provide training, and thereafter will
carry out the agreed program. GPC will obtain assistance from internationally
experienced consultants and local design institutes in preparing the program.
C. The Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
5.11      Background.  The Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) has overall
supervisory responsibility at the national Government level for the chemical
fertilizer sector, including phosphate mining, as well as for a number of
refineries, rubber plants and several other chemical industries. MCI prepares
the five-year plans for those subsectors, works out annual production targets,
coordinates the supply of raw materials and sales of output, and monitors the
activities of the chemical industry at the provincial and county levels in
coordination with Chemical Industry Bureaus of local governments.
5.12      Organization and Management.  MCI is headed by a minister, assisted
by four deputy ministers who are responsible, respectively, for: (a) finance
and foreign affairs; (b) production; (c) construction projects; and (d) educa-
tion and research. MCI maintains a task force known as the "World Bank
Project Implementation Coordination Group" to coordinate with the Bank. It is
headed by the deputy minister for finance and foreign affairs. The World Bank
Loan Office, an executive arm of the group headed by a director-level
official, maintains project coordination groups for Bank-supported projects,
including this Project.
5.13      MCI's Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) is the department-level
research and advisory unit of MCI. Established in 1978, CPI provides assis-
tance in: (a) drafting subsectoral, regional and enterprise development plans
and strategies; (b) advising MCI on strategies for technology development and
technology selection for new processes and products; and (c) assessing feasi-
bility studies for major investments.  CPI currently has 250 staff, including
47 administrative support staff personnel who are assigned to its eight line
divisions; it also has a computer center. CPI worked closely with the Bank on
the joint Phosphate Subsector Study, including preparing most of the major
data inputs for the model. Three CPI staff members have already received
intensive training on the fundamentals of the model from Bank staff to iacili-
tate future operational transfer of the model.

VI. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
6.1       The specific objectives of the Project are to: (a) help China
establish appropriate strategies for developing an efficient phosphate indus-
try, including development of an optimal investment program to meet the future
demand for phosphate fertilizers; (b) provide financial and technical assis-
tance in implementing the first major mine development of the investment
program, which would provide a model for future such investments; and
(c) strengthen MCI's capability for subsectoral planning through transferring
the expertise the Bank obtained in the joint-Phosphate Subsector Study.
6.2       Considerable progress with respect to objectives (a) and (c) has
already been achieved as a result of the Phosphate Subsector Study undertaken
during Project preparation (paras. 1.2 and 4.14).  To achieve the remaining
objectives, the Project comprises two components: (a) Wengfu phosphate mine
development component; and (b) technical assistance component.
B.  Wengfu Phosphate Mine Development Component
6.3       This component, to be carried out by GPC, involves establishment
of: (a) an open-pit mine to produce 2.5 Mtpy of ROM rock; (b) a beneficiation
plant to process the rock into 1.9 million tpy of high-grade phosphate concen-
trate (34Z P205); and (c) related on-site and off-site infrastructure, includ-
ing a slurry pipeline (see Annex 6.1 for details). Of the phosphate deposits
in China, the Wengfu area offers the best conditions for large-scale mining of
phosphate rock with a high P20, content. In addition to the large proven
reserves and good quality of phosphate rock, the site benefits from the fact
that a major railway line runs 45 km from the proposed mine. The phosphate
rock concentrate would be pumped as slurry to a railway loading site, where it
would be dewatered and loaded. This low-cost slurry pipeline technology,
currently being used successfully by several modern mines in other countries,
will be introduced into China for the first time.
6.4       This Project component was prepared and designed by the Chinese
Chemical Mines Research and Design Institute (CMRDI), which has considerable
experience in designing large mines and industrial projects, with technical
guidance from Jacobs Engineering, a US company, on the overall layout of the
project, and from Pipeline Engineering Systems, a West German/US company, on
the design and engineering of the slurry pipeline; technical guidance services
from these companies were covered by the IDA-financed Technical Cooperation
Credits (Credit 1412-CHA, FY84, and Credit 1664-CHA, FY86).
6.5       About 40Z of the concentrate produced at Wengfu would be used to
feed several high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants currently under
construction outside Guizhou Province including: (a) a 120,000 tpy DAP plant
in Tonglin, Anhui Province; (b) a 70,000 tpy nitrophosphate plant in Jinan,
Shandong Province; (c) a 90,000 tpy nitrophosphate plant in Kaifeng, Henan
Province; (d) a 480,000 tpy DAP plant in Guixi, Jiangxi Province; and (e) a
240,000 tpy DAP plant in Dongting, Hunan Province. The balance would be
converted on-site into TSP at a new 800,000 tpy TSP plant, to be constructed
as a separate project.



- 24 -
6.6       To ensure implementation of all these plants in time for completion
of the Wengfu mine, MCI will coordinate all construction and will assure
timely completion of the new TSP plant at Wengfu. During loan negotiations,
an assurance was obtained from the Government that it will rieport semi-
annually on the progress of all plants and will ensure that GPC completes the
Wengfu TSP plant by January 31, 1994.  A separate assurance was obtained from
GPC that the Wengfu TSP plant will be constructed and ready for operation in
accordance with scope and timeframe agreed with the Bank (see Annex 6.2).
C. Technical Assistance Component
6.7       The technical assistance component, to be carried out by MCI, has
two elements: (a) services of internationally experienced consultants for
MCI's Project coordination team, to support Project implementation and main-
tenance of mine equipment; and (b) provision of financial and technical
support to MCI for the acquisition of computer hardware and software at CPI to
strengthen MCI's subsector planning capability. This component is summarized
below (see Annex 6.3).
6.8       Consultant Services for Project Implementation and Maintenance of
Mine Equipment. The Project involves risks associated with the coordinated
implementation and commissioning of the mine and downstream high-grade
phosphate fertilizer plants. In the recent past, new mines and beneficiation
plants in Hubei Province have remained idle or underutilized, mainly due to
delays in the completion of downstream fertilizer plants. To mitigate these
technical risks, the technical assistance subcomponent will provide
internationally experienced consultants for MCI's project coordination team,
who will help the team and the Project company with: (a) selection and
procurement of approptiate technologies and equipment; (b) timely
identification and resolution of problems with Project implementation,
particularly in coordinating mine development with the construction of
downstream fertilizer. plants; (c) training of Project management team staff;
(d) preparation of staff recruitment and training programs; and
(e) implementation of a preventive mine workshop maintenance system. The
scope of their work was discussed during project preparation, and the terms of
reference were finalized during loan negotiations (see Project File No. 3).
6.9       Financial and Technical Support to Strengthen MCI's Subsector
Planning Capability. As noted, the Phosphate Subsector Study resulted in the
development of a subsector investment programming model. To strengthen MCI's
subsector planning capability, this model will be installed, maintained and
further developed at CPI. Under this subcomponent CPI will: (a) acquire
computer hardware with adequate capacity; (b) install the model at CPI; and
(c) provide local and overseas training of selected MCI staff. Similar work
with models is expected to be done for other subsectors in the future. The
outline of CPI's program is given in Annex 6.4.

VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
A. Engineering Arrangements
7.1       CMRDI, the local design institute that prepared the feasibility
study for Wengfu, will carry out the detailed engineering for the mine, bene-
ficiation plant and infrastructure. It has extensive experience in the
design, engineering, construction and start-up of comparable mines and benefi-
ciation plants.
7.2       During project preparation, CMRDI received substantive assistance
from internationally experienced engineering firms on the overall layoit of
the mine, the beneficiation plant, and infrastructure as well as on the lesign
and engineering of the slurry pipeline for which it does not have any
experience and capability (para. 6.4). The internationally experienced firm
which will design the slurry pipeline will use technologies that are
commercially proven and acceptable in terms of investment, efficiency, safety
and environment aspects, and will provide design guarantees. Its additional
services will include assistance in the procurement of critical equipment to
ensure efficient selection and adequate quality control during manufacturing
and prior to shipment.
B. Project Management
7.3       The arrangements for overall Project coordination are similar to
those under the two ongoing Bank-financed fertilizer projects, where they have
proven satisfactory. MCI will have primary responsibility for supervising
Project implementation and for coordinating the construction work with raw
materials supply and downstream plants. The Project coordination group set up
within MCI (Annex 7.1) will regularly review progress on Project implementa-
tion and procurement and coordinate efforts to remove any constraints. The
coordination group will also maintain liaison with CPC and the Bank,
submitting to the latter quarterly financial and technical progress reports.
During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government that the
group will be maintained during Project implementation.
7.4       CPC has already set up its own Project management team (Annex 7.2),
charged with implementing its respective component. The key staff responsible
for specific aspects of Project implementation have been appointed. Because
GPC is a new company with no direct experience in managing construction
projects its Project management team will receive substantial support from
CMRDI that has experience in large mine and chemical projects in China.
Internationally experienced consultants to be hired by MCI under the technical
assistance component will also provide assistance (see para 6.8). During
negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the GPC that it will maintain its
project management team during Project implementation.
C. Implementation Schedule
7.5       Implementation of the Project is expected to take 54 months from the
date of loan approval. Construction work for the mine and the beneficiation
plant is expected to be complete by December 1992. The mine will be finished



- 26 -
before the beneficiation plant so that raw rock can build up the necessary
stocks for beneficiation operation. The overall Project is scheduled for
completion by June 30, 1993. The Project implementation schedule, along with
key milestones for project implementation, is shown in Annex 7.3. In light of
experience with previous Bank-financed fertilizer projects, the Project
schedule is reasonable.
D. Training
7.6       Substantial training is required for GPC to ensure successful
implementation. GPC has already recruited a nucleus of experienced technical
and managerial staff. However, their skills and experience still do not
conform to what is required to ensure smooth start-up and operations.
7.7       MCI and GPC are well aware of the need for training.  GPC will
prepare a comprehensive recruitment and training program, with assistance from
internationally experienced consultants and local design institutes, and will
implement it (para. 5.10). The training program will include early assignment
of managers and key technical staff during Project implementation to their
positions prior to start-up so that they can learn from the consultants,
licensors and engineering firms. The program also allows for overseas train-
ing in new technologies for open-pit mining and beneficiation. On-the-job
training in the operation of a modern mine will be provided at existing
Chinese modern open-pit (mostly coal and iron ore) mines. Over the next two
years, CMRDI will focus on training for key technical staff and company
trainers.
E. Environmental Aspects
7.8       The mine and the beneficiation plant under the Project will be
designed and constructed to meet locally and internationally acceptable
environmental standards. The internationally experienced consultants involved
in Project preparation have paid particular attention to appropriate measures
to ensure the least environmental impact, with a specific focus on the
selection of appropriate sites and configurations of the open-pit mine and the
beneficiation plaLt. For example, mining operations will be concentrated in
one large open pit; beneficiation tailing ponds will be designed to avoid any
ground water pollution; and water treatment plants will be installed to
process all liquid effluent from the beneficiation plant and the slurry
pipeline prior to discharge into public waters. The expected environmental
standards to be applied to the Project, which are consistent with local
statutory standards and Bank guidelines, are given in Annex 7.4.
7.9       Assurances were obtained from GPC that it will build and operate the
Project mine and plant with due regard to safety and ecological and environ-
mental factors and will comply with environmental standards satisfactory to
the Bank.

VIII.  CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN, PROCURENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Capital Cost Estimates
8.1       The total financing required for the Project, including interest
during construction (IDC) and incremental working capital, is estimated at
US$221.8 million equivalent, of which US$74.1 million, or 33.4X, is in foreign
exchange. The estimate includes all off-site facilities necessary for the
Project, such as water and power supply, facilities for transport, storage and
handling of raw materials and products, and social infrastructure. The
capital cost estimates (detailed in Annex 8.1) are summarized in Table 8.A.

8.2       The base cost estimates, expressed in January 1988 prices, were
derived from estimates prepared by the Project entities and MCI in collabora-
tion with the domestic design institutes, after checking with internationally
experienced engineering firms. Physical contingencies are calculated at 1O0
of the base cost estimates. In calculating the base cost and phystical contin-
gencies, the prevailing ezchange rate of Y 3.72 to US$1 was used. Price
escalation for foreign costs was calculated on the basis of anticipated annual
international price movements of 3.0Z for 1988-90 and 4.02 thereafter. Price
escalation for costs expressed in local currency was calculated based on pro-
jected annual local inflation rates of 8.02 for 1988, 7.O for 1989 and 6.52
thereafter. Equipment and materials imported for the Project are exempt from
import duties. The local companies will pay sales tax on locally procured
equipment and materials.
B. Financing Plan
8.3       The proposed Bank loan of US$62.7 million will meet 84.6Z of the
total foreign exchange and 28.32 of the total financing required. The remain-
ing financing will be met mainly by local lending institutions (71.52), and
GOC's own funds (0.22). The proposed financing plan for the Project is sum-
marized in Table 8.B.

8.4       IBRD Loan Financing.  The proposed Bank loan will be made available
to GOC at the Bank's standard rate of interest for 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, with a commitment charge of 0.75%. The total amount of the loan
will be on-lent by GOC to GPC at an on-lending rate equal to 1052 of the Bank
variable loan rate, with a commitment charge of 0.75X and a repayment period
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The foreign exchange risk will be
passed on to the company. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government that a subsidiary loan agreement would be signed by GOC and CPC
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank as a condition of loan
effectiveness.
8.5       Local Financing. GOC, through the Peeple's Construction Bank of
China (PCBCs, will provide GPC with a construction loan of Y 649.9 million
(US$154.4 million equivalent) to cover the local financing requirements for
fixed assets at its prevailing rate for similar investments (currently 3.6Z
p.a.), with a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period equal to the
construction period. A portion of loan will be used to cover IDC on the
proposed Bank loan. Interest payments on this loan will be deferred during
the construction period and repaid in installments after completion of the
Project. Foreign exchange requirements of US$400,000 equivalent to cover the
CPI program to be carried out by MCI as part of the technical assistance
component would be met from the proceeds of the Second Technical Cooperation
Credit (Credit No. 166-CHA, FY86). The remaining local financing needs,
including incremental working capital, will be met entirely by short term
loans from local banks. During negotiations, confirmation was obtained from
the Government on all necessary arrangements for the provision of local funds
to finance the Project.

is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. International engineering and tech-
nical assistance services will be selected according to Bank guidelines for
the use of consultants.
8.8       Specialized items with only a limited number of suppliers, such as
special pumps for the slurry pipeline will be procured through limited inter-
national bidding (LIB). Items for LIB, are expected not to exceed US$8.0 mil-
lion in aggregate. All qualified bidders would be invited under LIB.
8.9       Orders for small or miscellaneous items with an estiimated value of
up to US$200,000 each will be procured through international shopping from at
least three qualified and eligible suppliers, up to an aggregate amount of
US$3.0 million.



- 31 -
8.10      No procurement through direct contracting is envisaged.  Packages
with an estimated value of US$1.0 million or more, expected to number about 7,
would be subject to prior Bank review; packages below US$1.0 million each
would be subject to post-review by the Bank. Contracts with consultants will
be subject to Bank approval prior to signature. International procurement
will be giecuted by the China National Chemical Construction Corporation
(CNCCC),-1 in cooperation with MCI's Project coordination group. To avoid
delays in Project execution, the Bank loan will retroactively finance up to
US$0.5 million of eligible expenditures for down payments for engineering
contracts and technical services, and international travel incurred between
February 5, 1988 and the date of loan signing.
8.11      Procurement Arrangements for Local Financing.  Local procurement
will be carried out by the respective operating companies with assistance from
the design institutes. Since SPC identifies the Project as a key national
project, the supply of local construction materials, plant and equipment is
regulated by an allocation system administered by central and provincial
Government agencies. Applications for annual requirements have to be made in
advance to SPC and the State Materials Supply Bureau. However, under recent
provisions, buyers and suppliers of equipment have some scope for negotiation
as to the type of equipment, delivery and price.
8.12      Most of the civil works, erection, a major part of the engineering
work, and some equipment and materials will be procured locally. Contracts
for civil works and erection will be awarded through assignment to specialized
construction bureaus or companies under negotiated contracts that specify unit
costs, terms of payment and incentives/penalties for early/late completion/
delivery. The capacity and capabilities of local contractors proposed for the
Project are satisfactory for timely and efficient execution of the proposed
work.

The proposed Bank loan will cover: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for
directly imported goods, 1002 of local expenditures (ex-factory) for domesti-
cally manufactured goods, and 752 of local expenditures for items procured
locally; (b) 1OO2 of the expenditures for licenses, engineering and technical
services for procurement and training; (c) 100% of the cost for overseas
training; and (d) 1002 of the cost for technical services for Project Manage-
ment. To facilitate the disbursement of funds, a special account will be
established in US dollars at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, with an
authorized allocation of US$5.0 million. Disbursement will be against full
documentation except for training, overseas travel and contracts valued at
less than US$200,000 equivalent each, which would be against statements of
expenditure. Documentation of statements of expenditure will be maintained by
MCI's Project coordination group, to be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to be made available for review by the
Bank during Project supervision.
8.14      The Project completion date would be June 30, 1993; the closing date
is expected to be December 31, 1993. An estimated disbursement schedule for
the Project, which has been prepared based on Bank experience with previous
comparable projects in China, and is generally in line with the Bank's
recommended standard disbursement profile for industrial projects in Asia
Region, is given in Annex 8.2.

IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Management Practices in China
9.1       Financial Autonomy.  In the past, the Government made all major
financial decisions, including approval of new investments. Enterprises
remitted almost all internally generated funds to the Government, and funds
for new investments were, in turn, provided as grants through budget alloca-
tions. Recent reforms have resulted in greater financial autonomy and
accountability for the managers of individual enterprises. Major changes
include: (a) enterprises can retain lOOZ of their depreciation allowances;
(b) enterprises can retain an increasing portion of their profits (this
provision varies across companies and provinces); (c) new funding require-
ments, including those for investments, are to be met out of a company's
internally retained funds or interest-bearing loans (long-term capital con-
struction loans for fixed investments and short-term borrowing for working
capital); and (d) enterprises may utilize an increasing portion of internally
retained funds without prior Government approval. Given the increasing
financial autonomy and accountability of companies, there is a growing need
and opportunity for these enterprises to engage in longer term financial
planning and to improve on the traditional c.acentration on one-year financial
targets.
9.2       Financing of New Projects.  The recent economic reforms have also
changed dramatically the Government's policy on financing new investments. In
the past, all new investments were, as noted, financed through budget alloca-
tions in the form of grants. Recently, the Government introduced the concept
of interest-bearing loans as an incentive to industrial enterprises to econo-
mize on the use of funds. While this was, in principle, a positive step, it
has been carried out to the point that new government-financed investments for
state-owned enterprises must now be financed entirely through debt. As a
result, newly formed companies are entirely debt-based, a financial structure
that conflicts with the basic norm for prudent financial management and
accountability. In particular, many companies have been facing cash flow
difficulties during the initial years of operations because of their excessive
debt service burden, and they have had to enter into negotiations with respect
to financing and bail-outs on a case-by-case basis. While, given China's
structure of state ownership, the companies' existence has not been
threatened, this situation undermines the autonomy of the enterprises and
conflicts with the basic thrust of China's economic reform, which is designed
to place greater responsibility on enterprise management.
9.3       The Government recognizes the need to allow for equity-type funding
and is currently moving toward the creation of instruments for such financ-
ing. In this context, the Government has announced its intention to create
large-scale sectoral investment corporations and joint stock companies.
However, it will take time for the new instruments of financing to develop
sufficiently to allow for large-scale equity financing.
9.4       Financial Accounting and Audits.  The Chinese accounting system is
governed by several regulations issued by central and local governments.



- 34 -
Special features of the system include: (a) maintenance of two separate
accounts--one for production operations, the other for construction projects--
that are not consolidated; (b) the inclusion of interest charges in the
production costs, so that operating income reflects the company's financial
structure; and (c) the matching of funding sources with specific types of
assets--fixed assets with fixed funds, current assets with current funds, and
special assets with special funds.2./The financial statements of Chinese enter-
prises are subject to external audits by the State Audit Administration (SAA),
which was established in 1983 to ensure efficient and prudent financial
management by enterprises. The Bank has been supporting the Government's
efforts to improve its audit capability through training under a Technical
Cooperation Credit (Cr. 1412-CHA).
B. Financial Performance and Projections
9.5       As a new entity, GPC does not have historical financial records.
The financial projections for the company were carried out in current yuan
terms, based on relatively conservative assumptions on key parameters such as
output rates, input consumption and output prices. It's output price is
assumed to be lower by 30-40% than projected CIF import prices despite the
fact that this price is, as the price reform process deepens, expected to
progressively move towards import parity (para. 3.24 above). The real prices
of inputs and outputs (i.e., after allowing for inflation) were assumed to
remain unchanged at their January 1988 levels over the life of the Project.
Detailed projected financial data, prepared, after several adjustments for the
Chinese accounting system, in accordance with conventional accounting concepts
based upon international accounting standards, are given in Annexes 9.2-9.4.
The salient features che projected future finances of the company are shown in
Table 9.A.
7/  Strict application of earmarking, or non-fungibility, is gradually being
relaxed, as enterprises retain increasing portions of their internally
generated funds as special funds.

9.6         Financial Projections.   While CPC is expected to show negative
profits in 1993, the first year of operation, it is anticipated to achieve
satisfactory profits thereafter. Its net profit margins on sales revenue will
remain at relatively high levels-over 30X--once its operation reaches full
capacity.  GPC's first-year losses are mainly a result of low capacity
utilization, a normal experience for new mines and fertilizer plants, and
partly a consequence of the Government's current investment financing policies
which are based entirely on debts (para. 9.2). With the build-up of capacity,



- 36 -
GPC's net profit is expected to increase from a negative Y 62.5 million in
1993 to a positive Y 29.1 million in 1994, Y 97.7 million in 1995, and Y 124.2
million in 1996.
9.7       In the first year of start-up, GPC will face cash flow difficulties
unless additional external funds are provided. Again, in part the reason is
the current Government practice of entirely debt-based funding for new invest-
ments. However, CPC will generate sufficient cash internally from the third
year onward to service its debts and to make the necessary investments in
maintenance and replacements. Because of the Government's current funding
policy, new companies such as GPC, which do not have significant capital base,
will have high financial leverage until they accumulate retained earnings from
operations. Given this background, the Government intends to take an action
to allow GPC to achieve sound financial positions rapidly in the event that it
changes the funding policy, and a specific financial covenant has been
designed to ensure that GPC will be able to cope with potential cash flow
difficulties during the start-up years (para. 9.9).
C. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
9.8       The cost and revenue streams for the incremental financial rate of
return (FRR), expressed in January 1988 yuans, are presented in Annex 9.5.
The estimated base case FRR (before taxes) is: 12.4X. The FRR is lower than
the economic rate of return (ERR), mainly because the financial prices for
fertilizers are below their economic value. The results of sensitivity tests
are shown in Table 9.B.
Table 9.B: SENSITIVITY TEST ON FINANCIAL RATES OF RETURN (BEFORE TAX)
FRR (%)
Base case                                                     12.4
Capital cost up 20%                                           10.3
Capital cost down 20%                                         15.0
Sales revenue up 20X                                          15.8
Sales revenue down 20%                                         8.1
Variable cost up 20%                                           11.6
Variable cost down 20%                                         13.1
2-year delay in completion                                    10.2
The FRR for the Project is sensitive to changes in, in descending order, sales
revenue, which is a function of the unit price of output and sales volume,
capital cost, and input prices. Given that adverse changes in the variables
by a margin of 20%, particularly for the price of phosphate concentrate, are
not likely, satisfactory levels of FRR over 10-12% are likely to be realized.



- 37 -
D. Financial Covenants
9.9       During negotiations, agreement was reached that GPC will:
(a) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 and not incur any
long-term debt unless their projected internal cash retention for each fiscal
year during the term of the debt will exceed 1.2 times their projected debt
service requirements in that year; (b) maintain a long-term debt/equity ratio
of 75:25 or better; and (c) maintain a current ratio of 1.2 or better, once
such covenanted ratios are reached. Because of the current Government
financing practice with respect to new investments (para. 9.2), GPC will not
be able to achieve these covenanted ratios in the initial years of operations,
particularly the debt/equity ratio, until it builds up capacity utilization
and retained earnings. The timeframe for achieving these ratios is as
follows: 1995 for the debt service coverage ratio; 1997 for the long-term
debt to equity ratio; and 1996 for the current ratio. Therefore, an
additional assurance has been obtained from the Government that it will cover
GPC's cash flow deficits during the initial three years of operations,
provided such deficits are not the result of inefficient management and
operation. Efficiency criteria were agreed at negotiations. Moreover, if the
Government adopts an alternative funding policy to allow for equity-type
funding (para. 9.3), it plans to allow GPC to convert a portion of local loans
to its own funds so that it can achieve a long-term debt/equity ratio of 75:25
or better. An assurance was obtained from GPC that it will prepare and
furnish to. the Bank for review, by October 31 of each year from 1989 to 1997,
its rolling five-year financial plans, including production, marketing and
investment plans, in the form of projected financial statements. Such plans
will be supported by. (a) a detailed analysis of production cost trends;
(b) analysis of operational and financial budget variances for the current
fiscal year; and (c) financing arrangements for the investments proposed over
the five-year period.
E. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
9.10      An assurance has been obtained that GPC will have its annual
financial statements and project accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. It will also submit the audit report for both the
production and capital construction accounts to the Bank within six months
after the close of each fiscal year. Based on Project progress and the
financial reports submitted by GPC, MCI will provide the Bank a quarterly
sulmmary of its Project progress and procurement status, and a semi-annual
summary of its financial statements, within 45 days after the end of each
period. An assurance has also been obtained that the Government will have
MCI's Project accounts for the technical assistance component, and the
accounts for the Special Account, audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. It will submit the audit report to the Bank within six months
after the end of each fiscal year. Within six months after the closing date
for the Project, GPC and MCI will prepare and provide to the Bank a completion
report for their respective components of the Project, to cover Project
implementation, initial operation, actual Project costs and projected costs
and benefits.



- 38 -
X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
10.1      Calculation of the economic rates of return (ERR) was made only for
the investment component because the benefits from the technical assistance
component, though significant, are not quantifiable. The key assumptions in
the economic analysis of the Project are detailed in Annex 10.1.
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
10.2      Economic Benefits.  The quantifiable economic benefits of the
Project, expressed in 1988 US dollars, come mainly from phosphate concentrates
to be produced from the mine to be developed. The economic price of phosphate
concentrate was derived from its projected international price by adding
unloading, port handling, bagging and mixing charges, and inland freight from
ports to the plant sites.
10.3      Economic Costs.  The economic value of tradeable inputs was based on
their estimated international market prices. Non-tradeable inputs were
converted to their economic value by applying their respective specific
conversion factors.
B. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.4      The base-case ERR in constant terms is 26.01 for the Wengfu
component. (The streams of economic costs and benefits for the ERR
calculations are given in Annex 10.2.) The results of the sensitivity and
switching-value analyses are summarized in Table 1O.A.

Variable cost                           +541.7
/a   A 12S discount rate is used.
The results of sensitivity tests indicate that the ERR for the Project is
sensitive to changes in, in descending order, sales benefits, which are
closely related to the international border prices of phosphate rocks and
production volume, project capital costs, and variable costs. Even under the
assumption of a 20Z reduction in sales benefits, the Project would obtain a
satisfactory ERR of 21.51. The switching-value analysis of the major
variables indicates that the Project would remain economically viable under
various conceivable advyerse conditions, and confirms that the prices of
phosphate concentrate 8 are the most critical variable determining the
economic viability of the Project.
C. Other Benefits
10.5      Once full operating capacity is reached, the Project will lead to
net import substitution of 1.8 Mtpy of phosphate concentrate that will result
in gross foreign exchange savings of about US$124 million equivalent p.a. in
1988 prices. After netting out the annual service of the foreign debt (both
principal repayment and interest payments), the net annual foreign exchange
8/  The international prices of phosphate concentrate are closely related to
those of phosphate fertilizers.



- 40 -
savings, as of 1997, are estimated at about US$112 million equivalent (see
Annex 10.3 for details).
D. Project Risks
10.6      Virtually no commercial risks are foreseen because markets for GPC's
output are already assured. The entire output of phosphate concentrate from
the Wengfu mine will be supplied to several downstream high-grade fertilizer
plants currently under construction outside Guizhou Province and another
fertilizer plant to be established at the project mine s-te. The main
technical risks lie in the coordination of the implementation and
coumissioning of the mine and the associated fertilizer plants. In the past,
poor coordination in implementing mine and fertilizer investments, executed by
separate entities under separate budgets, has been a common cause of
underutilization of new mines in China, resulting in a significant loss of
economic benefits. This risk is mitigated by involving internationally
experienced consultants in the technical assistance component, who will help
MCI and GPC with Project implementation and staff training. The Government
will coordinate construction of all downstream plants and report semi-annually
on the progress of their implementation (para. 6.6).
10.7      This risk will be further reduced because a new 800,000 tpy TSP
plant to be established at Wengfu, which would consume about 40X of the
Project output, will be implemented by GPC itself. Although it will not be
implemented as a part of the Project, the Bank's project team has been
involved in its preparatory work, including the carrying out of feasibility
studies. The preparatory work is proceeding well. GPC has provided an
assurance that the Wengfu TSP plant will be constructed and ready for
operation in accordance with the scope and timeframe for the implementation
agreed with the Bank, and a separate assurance has been obtained from the
Government to the same effect (para. 6.6).
XI. AGREEMENTS REACHFD DURING LOAN NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
11.1      During negotiations, confirmation was obtained from the Government
that:
(a) all necessary arrangements for the provision of local funds will be
made to finance the local costs of the Project (para. 8.5); and
(b) if the Government adopts an alternative policy to allow for equity-
type funding for new investments of state-owned enterprises, it
plans to allow GPC to convert a portion of local loans to the
company's own funds so that GPC can achieve a long-term debt/equity
ratio of 75:25 or better (para. 9.9).
11.2      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
will:
(a) allow GPC to market its entire output outside the state allocation
plan at negotiated prices (para. 3.28);

(b) provide semi-annually a progress report on the construction of the
downstream phosphate fertilizer plants that will consume the Wengfu
phosphate concentrate (para. 6.6);
(c) ensure the completion of the Wengfu TSP plant by January 31, 1994
(para. 6.6);
(d) maintain MCI's Project coordination group during Project implementa-
tion (para. 7.3);
(e) on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to GPC under a subsidiary loan
agreement that will specify terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank, including an on-lending rate equal to 105X of the Bank
variable loan rate, with a commitment charge of 0.75Z p.a. and
repayment over 20 years, including 5 years of grace (para. 8.4);
(f) cover any cash flow deficits of GPC during the initial three years
of operations, provided such deficits are not the result of
inefficient management and operation (para. 9.9); and
(g) meet the auditing and reporting requirements (para. 9.10).
11.3      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GPC that it will:
(a) prepare and furnish to the Bank for comments by June 30, 1989, a
comprehensive program to strengthen management, recruit qualified
staff and provide training, and thereafter carry out the agreed
program (para. 5.10);
(b) have the Wengfu TSP plant constructed and ready for operations in
accordance with scope and timeframe agreed to with the Bank
(para. 6.6);
(c) maintain its Project management team during Project implementation
(para. 7.4);
(d) build and operate the Project mine and plant with due regard to
safety, ecological and environmental factors and in accordance with
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.9);
(e) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 once that
ratio is reached, but no later than December 31, 1995. It will not
incur any long-term debt unless its projected internal cash
retention for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be
incurred will exceed 1.2 times its projected debt service
reqjirements in that year (para. 9.9);
(f) maintain a long-term debt to equity ratio of 75:25 or better once
that ratio is achieved, but no later than December 31, 1997
(para. 9.9);



- 42 -
(g)  maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2 once such a ratio is
achieved, but no later than December 31, 1996 (para. 9.9);
(h) prepare and furnish to the Bank for review, by October 31 of each
year from 1989 to 1997, its rolling five-year financial plans, to
cover production, marketing and investment plans, to be presented in
the form of projected financial statements (para. 9.9); and
(i) comply with the auditing and reporting requirements (para. 9.10).
11.4      Conditions for loan effectiveness are:
(a) signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
GPC under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 8.4);
and
(b) approval of the loan agreement by China's State Council.
11.5      Subject to the above assurances and arrangements, the Project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$62.7 million equivalent to the People's
Rept,lic of China at the Bank's standard variable rate for 20 years, including
5 years if grace.

PHOSPEATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
An Outline of the Phosphate Subsector
Investment Optimization Model
A. The Transport Model
1.        Objective.  The objective is to optimize the transport of raw
materials, intermediates and final products in meeting the demand for phos-
phate fertilizers.
2.        A Mathematical Programming Formulation.  To find the "cheapest"
route between sets of origins and sets of destinations, a linear-programming
model was developed, with four major networks--rail, river, ocean and road-
representing the transport system.
3.        Results.  The cheapest mode of transportation is derived from simul-
taneous determination of the location size, timing and process of future fer-
tilizer plants and importing ports, and distribution patterns.
S. The Industry Model
4.        Objective.  The objective is to assess alternative locations, sizes,
products and distribution patterns associated with investment projects in the
subsector.
5.        A Mathematical Programming Model Formulation.  A mixed-integer
programming model was designed to minimize the total costs of investments,
production, transportation, and imports such that:
(a)  demand for P 05 is satisfied in each province through small-scale
production (for SSP, DAP and CMP), production in the modern sector
or imports;
(b)  mine and plant production at each location is limited by existing
capacity but can be expanded by new investments;
(c)  phosphate rock and pyrites production in each region is limited by
available domestic reserves;
(d)  policies limit the percentage of P205 demand in each province that
can be satisfied by ce,caln products; and
(e)  transport out of certain regions is severely constrained.
6.        Results.  The desired result is a national optimization giving at
each location:

(a) the production levels of raw materials, intermediates and final fer,
tilizer products and the processes employed;
(b) the scale of the mines and production plants;
(c) the investments in the sector under economies of scale;
(d) the shipment patterns of raw materials to plants, of intermediate
materials between plants, and of final products to markets;
(e) the domestic purchase of raw materials, intermediates, labor and
miscellaneous inputs;
(f) the export of products to export regions; and
(g) the import of intermediates to plants and final products to markets.

PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Analysis
A. General
1.        The financial projections were carried out in current yuan using
projected domestic inflation rates for local inputs and outputs and interna-
tional inflation rates for imported inputs as follows: annual domestic
inflation rates--8.OZ for 1988, 7.0% for 1989, and 6.5% thereafter; and annual
international inflation rates--3.0Z for 1988-90, and 4.0% thereafter. The key
assumptions for financial projections were based on the actual annual perform-
ance of companies under Chinese regulations. To provide an overall view of
the companies' financial performance in accordance with conventional account-
ing concepts based on international accounting standards, the following
acjustments were made to the Chinese accounting system: (a) the two sets of
financial statements-production operations and capital construction were
consolidated; (b) the accounts in the income statements and balance sheets
were reclassified as necessary in accordance with conventional concepts; and
(c) the sources and applications of funds statements that do not exist under
the current Chinese accounting system were prepared. For financial rate of
return (FRR) calculations, cost and benefit streams in constant yuan were
used. The capacity utilization is assumed at 50% of the design capacity (1.85
million tpy of phosphate concentrate) in the first year of operation, 65% in
the second year, 90% in the third year and 95% thereafter. A summary of
production costs per ton of product at full capacity is given in Table 1 of
this Annex.
B. Income Statements
2.        Sales Revenue.  Sales prices are assumed to be maintained at levels
indicated by MCI and SPB as the expected sales prices for project output--
Y 115/ton for phosphate concentrate. Net sales revenue were calculatea after
deducting the product tax.  During Project implementation, GPC will not pay
the product taxes under special arrangements; product tax rate for phosphate
concentrate is currently 5%.
3.        Variable Production Costs.  Annual consumption of i-nputs was
obtained frum the estimated material balance and estimated production levels
after the commissioning on the mine and the beneficiation plant with and
without the Project.  The materials balance is given in Project File
Ref. No. 2.
4.        Depreciation.  Fixed assets were depreciated using the straight-line
method at rates agreed on between GPC and its supervisory authorities as
follows:  over 20 years for equipment and over 30 years for civils.  In
addition, a mining maintenance fee of Y 7/ton of ore is charged.



ANNEX 9.1

5.        Maintenance Costs.  In the Chinese accounting system, maintenance
costs are divided into two categories--annual overhaul and other. Provisions
for annual overhaul are provided as a percentage of the original acquisition
value of the fixed assets and are managed separately within the special fund
account. Other maintenance costs were covered as operating expenses. The
rate of provision for annual overhaul is 6X.
6.        Interest Expenses.  Interest on foreign exchange-denominated loans
were converted into local currency usini projected foreign exchange rates,
assumed to be adjusted to preserve the relative currency values between the
two currencies.
7.        Taxes.  Taxable income is derived from net profits after deducting
the amortization of long-term loans, and is taxed at a uniform rate of 55%.
CPC will not pay income and adjustment taxes on profits during Project
implementation and the repayment period of the Bank loan.
C. Balance Sheets
8.        Fixed Assets.  Fixed assets are shown at historical costs.
9.        Equity* The following two items are considered as "equity," given
their equity nature": (a) enterprise fixed funds allocated from internally
generated funds; and (b) net special funds (special fund assets minus special
loans) retained by enterprises.
D. Funds Flow Statements
10.       Depreciation Fund.  The current Covernment policy allows companies
to retain 100X of the fund.
11.       Expenditures from Special Funds.  Provisions for annual overhaul
were used to cover annual overhaul expenses. Annually, 15% of the retained
depreciation fund and profits are paid to the Energy Conservation Fund. GPC
will be exempt from this contribution during Project implementation. A
portion of internally generated funds (in the special fund account) is used
for: (a) production technology development; (b) improvement of workers'
living condition; (c) cash bonuses; and (d) new product test fund. The
balance is accumulated within the company as reserve funds.

Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return (ERRs) were calculated on an
incremental basis. Prices were expressed in constant January 1988 US
dollars. The economic life of the plant was assumed to be 20 years.
The following conversion factors, which were provided by Bank economic
work, were applied to the financial prices of nontradeable goods and
services to derive their economic prices:
Nontradeable items                  Conversion factor
Unskilled labor                            0.25
Technical labor                            4.00
Managerial/administrative labor            1.00
Electricity                                1.50
Local machinery                            1.34
Construction                               1.08
B. Capital Cost
2.        The economic capital cost expressed in January 1988 prices was
obtained from the financial base capital cost after: (a) deducting the
duties and taxes on equipment and other items; (b) deducting the costs
of those spare parts that are to be included in the operating costs; and
(c) applying conversion factors to nontradeable goods and services for
economic valuation.
C. Working Capital
3.        Incremental economic working capital requirements were derived
by comparing goods and services employed in production with and without
the Project.
D. Economic Benefits
4.        Economic benefits of the Project come mainly from the production of
phosphate concentrate. The economic prices of phosphate corcentrate were
derived from its latest projected international prices, taking into account
marine freight from the origin of export to China ports, unloading and port
handling charges, and inland rail freight to plant sites. Marine freight,
estimated from the latest statistics, was assumed to change in line with



ANNEX 10.1
- 77 -                          Page 2 of 3
international energy costs.  The projections of the economic prices for
phosphate concentrate are given in Table 1 of this Annex. The import parity
price of phosphate concentrate is based on the imported price from Morroco,
adjusted for marine transport costs.
5.        Savings in transportation costs are attributed mainly to the reduc-
tion of transportation volume because of the higher nutrient content of MAP
and TSP. Potential savings in terms of transportation distances were not
considered because of difficulties in measuring them.
E. Operating Costs
6.        Tradeable Raw Materials.  The economic cost of exportable inputs was
derived by adding to the netback prices, from exports at the production sites,
the inland transportation costs between the production and the plant sites.
The netback value of inputs at the production sites wa;. calculated by deduct-
ing inland freight between the sites and exporting ports from the FOB export
prices. The economic cost of importable inputs was based on their projected
international prices plus marine freight from the origin of export to ports in
China, plus inland freight to the plant sites. The economic values of diesel
oil, the only major tradeable input during the operation stage, are also given
in Table ' of this Annex. Since China is an importer of diesel oil, the
economic value of diesel oil was derived from the import price from Singapore
.plus transportation costs to the plant sites after adjusting for ocean losses
and insurance.
7.        Other Nontradeable Items.  The economic value of nontradeable inputs
was based on their long-term marginal production costs plus inland transporta-
tion costs adjusted by specific conversion factors. The economic costs of
locally purchased chemicals, and bagging materials, were derived from their
financial costs by applying specific conversion factors.
8.        Fixed Costs.  The economic costs of various fixed cost items,
including labor, maintenance and general selling and administrative costs,
were based on financial costs adjusted by specific conversion factors.
