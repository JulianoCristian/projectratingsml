In order to accomplish this goal the\n            project has two components. First, the project will finance\n            the startup of an open pit mine at Wengfu in Guizou with a\n            capacity of 2.5 million tons per year, and the construction\n            of a modern beneficiation plant, and associated slurry\n            pipeline to produce phosphate concentrate at the mine site.\n            The second component will be consultant services for project\n            managment and mine workshop maintenance, and provision of\n            financial and technical assistance for the computer based,\n            sector investment optimization model, to be installed,\n            maintained and further developed to strengthen the subsector\n            planning capacity."}, "docdt": "1988-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
