MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China for US$62.7 million equivalent to help
finance a Phosphate Development Project. The proposed loan would have a
repayment term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate. The Government would on-lend the proceeds to
Guizhou Phosphate Company (GPC) at an interest rate equal to 105% of the Bank
variable loan rate, with a repayment period of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace. The commitment charges and foreign exchange risk would be borne by
GPC.
2.        Background.  China is the world's third largest producer and
consumer of chemical fertilizers. Despite the impressive build-up of produc-
tion capacity during the last decade, China remains a large importer of
chemical fertilizer due to the rapid growth of fertilizer consumption. With
limited arable land available for agricultural production, China's priority in
agriculture has been placed on maximizing crop production per unit of land by
increasing fertilizer use for agriculture. Apart from the general shortage of
fertilizer, a major constraint to increasing agricultural productivity is the
shortage in the supply of phosphate (P205) and potash (K 0) fertilizers,
resulting in an imbalance in fertilizer nutrient use. TRe current nutrient
ratio of 100 (N):33 (P205):8 (K 0) in China compares unfavorably with the
agronomically desirable ratio of 100:50:20. This nutrient imbalance reduces
the benefits of the current relatively high level of nitrogen application.
Over 701 of the cultivated area is deficient in phosphate, about 40X seriously
so.
3.        Production of phosphate fertilizers in China has been low as
compared with the large potential demand, and limited to low-grade products
such as single superphosphate (SSP) produced by small phosphate fertilizer
plants, scattered in almost every province. This was due to technical
difficulties in processing the Chinese phosphate rock, which is available in
abundant supply, into concentrate suitable for the production of high-grade
fertilizers. In recent years, however, the development of a new process for
beneficiating domestic rocks to produce high-grade fertilizers has enabled
China to look to the establishment of an efficient local phosphate industry.
4.        In the past, fertilizer allocation and prices were strictly adminis-
tered by the Government. In recent years, a two-tier market system has
emerged as a result of the ongoing reforms which have involved expansion of
the role of market forces in fertilizer production and allocation. Under the
current two-tier system, all fertilizer plants sell their output at controlled
prices for production under the state plan quota and negotiated (market-
influenced) prices for that above quota. At present, about 40% of the
country's total consumption of all fertilizers, and about 10X of high-grade



-2-
fertilizers, are sold outside the state allocation plan at negotiated
prices. Phosphate concentrate, the main input for the production of high-
grade phosphate fertilizers, is priced and allocated under the same two-tier
mechanism. The Government's current strategy is to continue gradually
reducing its administrative control of fertilizer pricing, in parallel with a
gradual dismantling of annual production planning and allocation. Guidelines
for future policy reforms are being developed by an inter-agency working group
formed within the Government, which is reviewing fertilizer pricing and
allocation policies according to a scope of work discussed with the Bank.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Project would help China
realize its priority in the fertilizer sector during the Seventh and Eighth
Five-Year Plans (1986-95), which is to reduce the nutrient imbalance by
rapidly expanding production capacity of high-grade phosphate fertilizers,
based on economically exploitable domestic phosphate resources. The Project
would expand Bank operations beyond the nitrogenous fertilizer subsector,
which has been the focus of the two previous fertilizer operations in the
sector. During project preparation, the Bank has already made a significant
contribution to the arciculation of the Government's phosphate subsector
development strategy and the strengthening of MCI's subsector planning capabi-
lity by carrying out a joint Phosphate Subsector Study. The study, now
completed, has helped the Government identify priority investments, including
optimal location and product mix, to the year 2000. The Chinese authorities
have expressed interest in further Bank assistance in conducting follow-up
work emanating from the study and in carrying out similar studies in other
subsectors.
6.        The development of a modern phosphate mine and a large-scale
beneficiation plant to be implemented under the Project would be the first
such operation in China in terms of size and configuration and would help
China to gain experience necessary for the implementation of further
investments already identified in the study. Bank involvement during project
preparation has already contributed to optimizing the configuration of mine
and beneficiation plant. The technical assistance to be provided under the
Project would strengthen China's project management capabilities, particularly
in establishing large-scale phosphate mines and downstream fertilizer plants
in a coordinated manner.
7.        Project Objectives.  Specific objectives of the Project are:  (a) to
help establish proper strategies for developing an efficient phosphate indus-
try, including an optimal investment program to meet future demand for
phosphate fertilizers; (b) to provide financial and technical assistance in
implementing the first major investment of the program, thus providing a model
for future investments in development of modern phosphate mines and beneficia-
tion plants; and (c) to strengthen MCI's capabilities .- subsector planning.
As mentioned earlier, considerable progress has already been made with
objectives (a) and (c) through the joint Phosphate Subsector Study.
8.        Project Description.  The Project would consist of two components:
(a) the Wengfu mine development component--developing an open pit mine at
Wengfu in Guizhou Province with a capacity of 2.5 million tons per year (Mtpy)
run-of-mine (ROM) ore, and constructing a modern beneficiation plant at the



-3-
mine site and an associated slurry pipeline; and (b) the technical assistance
component--provision of consultant services in support of project management
and mine workshop maintenance, and installation of the phosphate subsqector
investment optimization model at MCI and training of MCI staff. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Shedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China
are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7142-CHA dated May 23, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
9.      . Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following major
actions: (a) to allow the project company (GPC) to market its entire output
outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices; (b) to ensure the
completion of the Wengfu TSP plant by early 1994; and (c) to cover GPC's cash
flow deficits during the initial three years of start-up, provided such
deficits are not the result of inefficient management and operation. In
addition, if the Government adopts a new funding policy to allow for equity-
type funding for new investments of state-owned enterprises, it plans to allow
GPC to convert a portion of local loans to the companies' own funds so that
GPC can achieve a long-term debt/equity ratio of 75:25 or better. GPC will:
(a) prepare and furnish to the Bank for comments by June 30, 1989 comprehen-
sive programs for management strengthening, and staff recruitment and
training, and thereafter carry out the agreed programs; (b) maintain its
project management team during Project implementation; (c) build and operate
the project mine and beneficiation plant with due regard to safety, ecological
and environmental factors and in accordance with environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank; (d) construct and commission the Wengfu TSP plant in
accordance with scope and timeframe agreed with the Bank; (e) maintain debt
service coverage ratios of at least 1.2 once that ratio is reached;
(f) maintain long-term debt to equity ratios of 75:25 or better once that
ratio is achieved; (g) maintain current ratios of at least 1.2 once that ratio
is achieved; and (h) prepare five-year rolling financial plans for each yeir
from 1989 to 1997. Conditions of loan effectiveness are: (a) signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and GPC on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) approval of the loan agreement by
China's State Council.
10.       Benefits.  The quantifiable benefits of the Project derive from
phosphate concentrates for high-grade fertilizer production to be produced
from the Wengfu mine. The ERR for the Project is estimated at 26x. The
economic benefits from the Phosphate Subsector Study and the related technical
assistance subcomponent, albeit unquantifiable, will be sector-wide and
significant. Indirectly, the Project will generate significant economic
benefits in agriculture by reducing the nutrient imbalance and thus increasing
the synergism of fertilizer application.
11.       Risk.  The main technical risks relate to the need for coordinated
implementation and commissioning of the Project mine and several downstream
fertilizer plants currently under construction outside Guizhou Province and
another fertilizer plant to be established at the project mine site. In the
past, the lack of proper coordination in implementing mine and fertilizer
investments, executed by separate entities under separate budgets, has been a



-4-
common cause of underutilization of new mines, resulting in a significant lose
of economic benefits. This risk will be mitigated by involving inter-
nationally experienced consultants in the technical assistance component} they
will help MCI and GPC with Project implementation and staff training. The
Government has assured the timely completion of all downstream fertilizer
plants, including the Wengfu TSP plant to be established at the project mine
site. The Government will coordinate construction of all downstream fertili-
zer plants and report semi-annually on the progress of their implementation.
This risk will be further reduced because the new 800,000 tpy TSP plant to be
established at Wengfu, which would consume more than 60 of the Project
output, will be implemented by the Project company. This plant will be
constructed and ready for operation in accordance with the scope and timeframe
agreed with the Bank. Rigorous development and implementation of detailed
staff recruitment and training programs, with assistance from internationally
experienced consultants and local design institutes, would also help reduce
the risk.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

/a As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the de(lar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.

Bank/IDA financial prc,-cts in execution, which is updated twice yearly and
circulated to the Exee.itive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
