Re:
Loan No. 3735 RO (Industrial Development Project (IDP))
Amendment to Loan Agreement
Excellency:
1.
We refer to the Loan Agreement (the Agreement) between us for the 
above-mentioned Project dated March 21, 1995, and to our discussions concerning a 
proposed amendment to the same.  Based on such discussions, we hereby agree that:
(a)  
in Section 2.02, the expression “December 31, 1999” is replaced by the 
expression  “December 31, 2000”. Consequently, it is understood that, for purposes of 
the last sentence of Schedule 2 to the Agreement, the expected completion date is June 
30, 2000.
(b)    in Section 4(c) of the Attachment to the Annex to Schedule 5 to the 
Agreement, the expression “May 31, 1999” is replaced by the expression “May 31, 2000”.
2.
We also refer to your letter dated August 9, 1999, requesting cancellation of 
$55,000,000 million equivalent from the undisbursed amount of the loan. We are pleased 
to inform you that we have cancelled this amount from the loan as of August 10, 1999, 
the date we received the request. A revised amortization schedule reflecting the 
cancellation will be sent to you shortly. Attached as an annex to this letter, is a 
revised allocation of the Loan amount set forth in Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 
Loan Agreement.
3.
In view of the reduced need for the funds on deposit in the Special Account, the 
Authorized allocation set forth in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement 
is hereby reduced from USD 17.5 million to USD 13.0 million.
Please confirm the agreement of Romania with the foregoing by having an 
authorized representative sign, date and return to us the enclosed copy of this 
letter.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR  
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
