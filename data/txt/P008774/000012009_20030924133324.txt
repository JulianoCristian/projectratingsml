  OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopment effectivenessthrough excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The OperationsEvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activities of the World Bankfor two
purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is
producingthe expected results,and second, to help develop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough
the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As partof this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperations.Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those that are
innovative,large,or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate
important lessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
studies.
     A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewedby the responsible Bank departmentand amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of ExecutiveDirectors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the OED RatingSystem
     The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
     Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
current developmentpriorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustmentoperations.
      Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnsfitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignmentof the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate,which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intendedand unintended effects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operationof the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibilityto ensure
quality of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Private Sector
Adjustment Loan(PSAL) for US$300million, andthe IndustrialDevelopmentProject
(IDP), inthe amount o f US$175 million. The PPAR i s based on the President's Report
for the PSAL and the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for the IDP, legal documents, the
project files, related economic and sector work, as well as interviews with Bank staff and
Romanian officials, other donors, andthe Implementation Completion Reports for the
two projects, prepared inOctober, 2000 for the PSAL and inJune, 2001 for the IDP.

        The IDP was approvedby the Board inthe amount o fUS$175 million inMay,
1994 (later reducedto US$120 million), and closed inDecember, 2001, two years later
than plannedafter disbursingUS$96.9 million.

        The PSALwas approvedby the BoardinJune, 1999, and disbursed its first
tranche o fUS$lSO million upon effectiveness, inAugust, 1999. The second tranche o f
an equal amount disbursedafter completion o f specified reforms shortly before the
project closed as plannedinJune, 2000.

        An OED missionvisited Romania inDecember, 2002, to discuss the two projects
with Romanian officials, donors, ResidentMission staff, andother stakeholders. Their
cooperation and assistance i s gratefully acknowledged.

        Following standard OED procedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and comments, but none were
received.

Summary

         The RomaniaIndustrial Development Project (IDP was approvedinMay, 1994,
andclosed inDecember, 2001), and the Private Sector AdjustmentLoan(PSAL was
approved inJune, 1999, and closed inJune, 2000).

         The main objectives o f the Industrial Development Project (IDP) were to promote
private sector growth, particularly by advancing enterprise privatization and
restructuring; and to facilitate transformation o f credit markets and introduce safe and
sound banking practices. This was to be done mainlyby the use o f two credit lines,
together with technical assistance. Prior to 1999,progress on structuralreforms hadbeen
limited, and a Financial andEnterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (1995-98) had achieved
only limitedsuccess.

         The PPAR finds that the design o fthe IDP was not well-suitedto the achievement
o f its objectives. The project envisioned transforming credit markets bybolstering the
capacity o fparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) using a "learning by doing"
approach as they utilized the credit lines, along with a relatively small TA program. This
approach was insufficient to deal with a sector still dominatedby structures andpractices
from the time o f centralplanning. Quality at Entrywas unsatisfactory, considering that
the IDP was undertaken inanunstable macroeconomic environment. Disbursemento f
the project's two credit lines was much slower than envisioned, and byproject close 79
percent o f fundingintended for investment finance and 18 percent o f funds to support
exports hadbeen disbursed. More than two-thirds o f investment lendingunder the IDP
was made by three state-owned banks, which had largeportfolios o f non-performing
loans. Overall, non-performing loans comprised 46 percent o f all lending under the IDP.
Credit to the private sector declined duringthe implementationo f the IDP, and Romania
remains lower by this measure than most other transition economies.

         The objectives ofthe Private Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL) were to support
reforms inthe enterprise, financial, and social sectors, as well as to improve the
environment for private business. The PSAL was intendedto accelerate privatization-
especially o fmediumand large-sized firms-restructure       state-owned banks to facilitate
their privatization or liquidation, and mitigate the employment impact o fprivatization.
ThePSALwas largely successful at puttinginto place a framework for privatization o f
many of the country's largest loss-making firms, and thereby reducingthe fiscal burden
o fthe enterprise sector. Many o f the sales occurred within a year after the project closed.
The country's fiscal deficit declined from 5.5 percent of GDP in 1997 to 2.8 percent o f
GDP in2002. The project also established a framework for the resolution o fproblem
banks (e.g., sale, restructuring,liquidation), andmade major progress inprivatizing large
state-owned banks. Bank supervision and accounting and auditingstandards were also
strengthened. Inthe social sector, the impact o f the structural changes was mitigated by
the provision of unemploymentand severance benefits as well as other assistance to laid-
offworkers. Progress was made inlaying a foundation for an improvedbusiness
environment. A law on collateral was passed and a registry established that facilitated its
use insecured transactions; tax reform, as well as accounting and audit reform, were

implemented, and an Action Planto improve the business environment-based              on FIAS
recommendations-is       beingimplemented.

         The PPARrates the outcome o fthe IDP, and Bank andBorrower performance, as
unsatisfactory. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact (IDI) i s rated as negligible.
Sustainability i s rated as likely, compared to unlikely inthe ES, based mainly on the more
favorable macroeconomic performance o f the last three years, the accelerated
privatizationthat has occurred subsequent to project completion, andthe prospect of EU
accession, which serves as a powerful incentive to maintain and extendreform.

         The PPARrates the outcome ofthe PSAL, andBank andBorrower Performance,
as satisfactory. ID1i s rated as substantial. Sustainability i s rated as highly likely.

         Keyfindings and lessons for the IDP included: Financial sector operations should
beundertakenonly ina conducive macroeconomic environment; for aproject whose goal
i s to advance structural transformation o f the enterprise sector, a more suitable instrument
mighthavebeenan adjustmentoperation; the size o fthe line ofcredit was too large given
the risks anduncertainties o fthe macro andbusiness environment. For the PSAL,
lessons included: Timing and government commitment are critical to the success o f an
ambitious reform program; ready access to technical assistance was key to project
achievement.

1. Introduction

BACKGROUND

1.1        Romania was ruledby Communists for more than four decades untilthe
December, 1989, revolution. The governments that followed were cautious intheir
approach to structural reforms, and consequently by 1999 much o fthe legacy o f central
planning remained. Many loss-making enterprises-both                               inthe enterprise andfinancial
sectors-remained             instate hands,andtheirbudgetaryandquasi-fiscalburdenwas large
(see Table 1.1). Elections inlate 1996 brought reformers to the fore, with a mandate to
liberalize the economy, privatize state-owned banks and enterprises, andput the country
into a position where it could be considered as a candidate for entry into the European
Union (EU).

1.2       However, privatizationprogress remained slow. An earlier Bank project which
aimed to spur reforms inthese areas, the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment
Loan (FESAL) achieved only limited success. While the FESAL achieved success in
deregulation of foreign exchange, prices, andtrade, it was less successful inprivatization
o fbanks and industrial enterprises, which remained largely state-owned. An OED
PerformanceAudit Report rated outcome as moderately unsatisfactoryand Bank and
Borrower performance as unsatisfactory. Government commitment was lacking, and
financial discipline inthe enterprise sector was underminedby the accumulation o f
arrears, provision o f loans to weak enterprises androllover o f loans to such firms, and an
insufficient environment o f the "rule o f law" which made it difficult for banks to collect
on loans through the legal system.

1.3       Duringthe same periodthe business environment(BE) was unfriendlyto private
business. Businessmen reported that the application o f laws andregulations was
unpredictable, the labor code was inflexible, and obtaining a permit was cumbersome.
Private firms sometimes faced competition from businesses that benefited from state-
guaranteed borrowing.

1.4       Macroeconomic Environment-Immediately                               following the revolution, output fell,
but recovery started in 1993 and growth continued until 1996 (Table 1.1). However, this
growth was accompanied by large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, highand variable
inflation, and a large current account deficit. There were subsidies to favored enterprises,
andaccumulation o f arrears bymany firms to banks, utilities, and social funds. This
reached a peak inthe first half of 1996 when the 150 largest State-owned Enterprises
(SOEs) posted losses twice as highas the entire year 1995. In1997, inflation reached
over 150percent, and output from 1997 to 1999 contracted by nearly 13 percent. At one
point in 1997, the government's foreign exchange reserves reached a perilously low level
(US$700 million) and it was feared that the country might default on its foreign debt
obligations. The country was out o f compliance with its InternationalMonetary Fund
(IMF) Stand-by Arrangements for mucho ftheperiod from 1994to 1998, andwas able to

February, 2001. The loan for U S 2 8 0 million was approvedby the Board inJanuary 1996, however, US$lOO million remained
undisbursed, and the project closed in April 1998,4 months later than envisioned.

draw only SDR214.5 million out o f SDR622 million, or 34.5 percent, o f the amount
approved duringthat time.

 1.5         Since 1997, macroeconomic performance has gradually improved, despite a
banking sector crisis in 1999. Inflation has gradually fallen to 34.5 percent in2001, and
an estimated 19.8 percent in2002.2 Real GDP growth turnedpositive in2000, growing
by 5.3 percent in2001, andestimated to grow by 4.5 percent in2002. Duringthe period
 1994-2000, when the IDP andPSAL were implemented, the country experienced
considerable macroeconomic volatility.

 1.6         The budget deficit, which reached a higho f 5.5 percent o f GDP in 1998, has
declined since then and was 2.8 percent in2002. Inaddition to the fiscal deficit shown
above, it is important to consider the country's non-energy quasi-fiscal deficit, as well as
the implicit subsidies andquasi-fiscal deficit o fthe energy sector, which also placeda
substantial burdenon the state treasury. (It was the aim o fthe PSAL to privatize many
large loss-making firms, and thus lessen the fiscal drain o f the enterprise sector; PSAL
11-not        the subject o fthis PPAR-addressed                       the energysector). One study estimates that
the deficit of 86 major loss-making firms was around 1.1to 1.4 percent o f GDP in2000
and2001.3 After rapidincreases inenergy sector losses in2000, energypriceswere
raised s~bstantially,~which resulted ina rapid decline inenergy usage and inthe sectoral
quasi-fiscal deficit (from 4.9 to 2.7 percent o f GDP between 200 and 2002).

 2.      IndustrialDevelopmentProject

 Objectives

 2.1     The objectives o fthe Industrial Development Project (IDP) were to (a) promote
 growth o f the private sector and create conditions for an effective supply response from
 viable private industrial enterprises; (b) advance structuraltransformation o fthe
 enterprise sector-specifically    privatization andrestructuring; and (c) facilitate
 transformation o f credit markets andintroduction o f safe and sound banking practices.
 These objectives were to have beenachieved by: (a) improving access to foreign
 exchange credit for investment and export finance to viable private enterprises; (b)
 assisting inthe design o f the necessary policies and strengthening the institutional
 fi-amework for privatization andrestructuring; (c) strengthening the capacity o f
 participating financial institutions (PFIs) to efficiently allocate resources and improve
 financial services to the corporate sector.

 2.2       Components andDesign-It was envisionedthat the US$175 million loanwould
 be allocated inthe followingmanner:

     Finance component-US$l72           million
         0   Investment finance-US$lO2        million
         0   Export finance-US$70       million

     Technical assistance (TA)-US$3        million (later raisedto US$7 million)

 2.3     The project designprovided for the Ministry o fPublic Finance (MOPF) to lend
 through an apex organization, initially the MOPF Treasury Department, to PFIs, which
 would then on-lend the funds to sub-borrowers. However, the MOPFwas unableto serve
 this function as a result o fa legal opinionthat Parliamentary approval wouldbeneeded,
 and consequently, prior to project effectiveness, Export Import Bank o f Romania
 (Eximbank) was appointed as the apex. (This change added to project delays) Funds
 were provided to PFIs basedon a reference rate based on LIBOR plus a market-based
 spread (0.5 percent) to cover EximBank's costs.

 2.4     Sub-loans were denominated inUS dollars under the Bank's single currency
 program, with a term o f from 3-17 years, with a maximum o f US$8 million (investment

                                                                  4


lending), and with lendingrates set at the reference rateplus a market-determined margin
set by each PFI (generally around 2-3 percent). PFIs assumed credit risk, while sub-
borrowers assumedthe foreign exchange risk. Loans to final borrowers were to be made
on a first-come, first-served basis.

2.5         Funds were also available for export finance, for which the borrower had to meet
the following criteria: possession o f an irrevocable letter o f credit or confirmedpurchase
order, and relevant export experience. The maximum loan size for an export loanwas
US$5 million, and the maximum lengthwas one year.

Relevance of the Objectives

2.6         The IDP objectives were o fmodest relevance because they didnot reflect a
completely accurate diagnosis o fthe development barriers confronting the country. The
project was based, inpart, on the presumptionthat the lack o f availability o f term lending
was a major constraint to enterprise expansion. This presumptionturnedout to be
unrealistic, because even when funds from the IDP did become available, many firms did
not have the expertise or resources to develop the feasibility studies requiredby lenders
(i,e,, they didnot a ~ p l y )or~they didnot utilize the funds successfully ifthey did secure a
                                       ,
loan (leading to a large proportion o fnon-performing loans, or NPLs, as described
below).

2.7         Inaddition, theproject design was insufficient to achieve its objectives. The
effort to advance structural transformation of the enterprise sector was dependent on the
sufficiency o fpolicy-related measures achieved duringproject preparation, along with
financial support to private enterprise restructuring. While these actions were helpful,
they fell far short o fbeingsuficient to ensure progress inthis very difficult area (see Box
1).6 Similarly, theproject envisionedtransforming credit markets andintroducing safe
and sound bankingpractices by utilizinga relatively small program o f technical
assistance, andthen bolstering PFIcapacity to appraise and manage loans usinga
"learning by doing" approach. The use o fthis approach for a sector dominatedby large
state-owned banks that were routinely providing extensive loans to large SOEs, inmany
cases on a politically-directed basis, also fell short o fbeing sufficient to assureprogress.'

2.8         The IDP was inconsistent with the 1994 partial CAS. While it clearly fit within
one o fthe five "main areas o freform emphasis," privatization andprivate sector
development, it did not meet the CAS requirement that lending inthis area "be
conditioned on an overall adequate macroeconomic framework," (see next para).

2.9         Quality at Entry-Quality               at entry was unsatisfactory. First, the IDP was
undertaken ina unstable macroeconomic environment (Table 1.1).8Inflationwas 137

percent in 1994, the year o fproject approval, over 200 percent inthe two years prior to
project approval, and over 30 percent andrising inthe years following approval. Other
macroeconomic indicators were also highly unstable.

2.10      The Operational Directive 8.30 o f 1992 was clear on the approach to be usedin
such circumstances:

           "[in unstable macroeconomicsituations] economic actors becomemore
           concerned with protecting the value o f their assets and less interested in
           identifyingproductive investments.

           Inadvance ofany financial sector operation, therefore, anexplicit assessment
           should be made o fthe conduciveness o f the country's macroeconomic
           environment to realizing the operation's goals. Inparticular, where inflation
           currently exceeds or i s projectedto exceed 30 percent per year, or the rate o f
           inflation exceeds 20 percent andhas shown an accelerating trend inthe current
           year, a proposal to go ahead with financial sector lending should include an
           analysis o f expected inflation trends and their effects on financial decisions inthe
           economy generally, and on the likelihood o fthe operation's achieving its
           intendedobjectives."

2.11 The project documents do not reflect an assessment o f the conduciveness o fthe
macroeconomic environment to the realization o fproject goals.9 The unstable
macroeconomic environment acted to reduce the demand for credits under the project.
However, other factors also acted to constrainthe demand for credit: delays inproject
effectiveness, (see para 2.13, below); a poor business environment, which made it
difficult for private firms to operate; and the relatively small number o fbanks that met
IDP eligibility criteria.

2.12      A second factor inquality at entry, the capacity of thefinancial sector to support
the IDP, was weak. Many state-owned banks accredited as PFIs consistently made
problematic loans, and so the government had to recapitalize weak banks to the extent of
1.5 percent of GDP in 1996, 1.7 percent in 1998, and 2 percent in 1999." Further, the
capacity o f the National Bank o fRomania (which hada keyrole inthe accreditation o f
PFIs-see      para 2.24) inbank assessment and supervision was deficient: ``.                             ..the    ability o f
the National Bank o fRomania's (NBR's) banking supervision staff to perform the most
basic risk-based supervision, and to obtain an accurate picture o fthe financial condition
o fbanks, i s questionable.""

2.13      Third,the project design presumed that the policy-relatedmeasures undertaken
duringproject preparation (see Box 1)would advance privatization andrestructuring o f
enterprises and serve as a catalyst for private sector growth. This presumption also
provedunrealistic, as the measuresfell well short of what was neededto achieve the

9. Exceptthat macroeconomic instability was recognizedas a risk:". ...the macroeconomicenvironmentand the progress-in-transition
programs and inproject implementationwill be thoroughlyreviewedone year after loaneffectiveness, with an option to cut oflfurther
commitments in case of seriously adverse developments or to redesign theproposedproject." SAR, para. 7.06 (italics added).

objective inthis area. Inthe event, support from Government was uneven, the State
Ownership Fundretained a majority stake inmany large enterprises, and overall progress
inprivatization andrestructuringwas disappointing." Itwas notuntil 1999, withthe
advent o fthe PSAL, that major progress was made inthese areas. Indeed, ifthe project
goal was to advance structural transformation, a more suitable instrument might have
been an adjustment or technical assistance operation.

2.14        Fourth, the project was over-dimensioned, Le., the credit lines were too large for
such a risky and unstable environment. The Bank mighthave utilized smaller credit lines
inaninitialeffort to gauge the market, andthendeveloped a larger facility ifdemandwas
strong and subloans proved to be o f good quality.

2.15        Afifth element o fquality at entrywas the confusingprocess established for initial
accreditation and ongoing review o fPFIs (discussed indetail inpara 2.24). This process
diffusedresponsibility betweenthe apex, the Bank, andthe NBR.

2.16        Finally, the project was not ready for implementation at the time o f approval.
This is explained more fully inthe next paragraph.

ImplementationExperience

2.17        IDP start-up was substantially delayed,13 andthe project disbursedmuchmore
slowly than envisioned. Board consideration was delayedby the time taken to reach
agreement on policy-related measures (Box 1). After Board approval, effectiveness was
delayed by factors including: the need to make detailed arrangements for EximBank as
the apex; difficulty inrecruiting qualified PFIs and intraining their staffs; and reaching
closure on other project administrative arrangements. When the project did become
effective, disbursements were delayedby the time needed to consummate sub-loan
agreements with PFIs. Meanwhile, other multilateral and bilateral financial institutions
(EBRD, EIB, bilateral export credit agencies) entered the market, resulting inless
demand for loans under the IDP. Figure 2, below, shows the loan's estimated versus
actual disbursements. Over the term o f IDP, macroeconomic turbulence andthe
availability o fmore attractive outlets for PFIinvestments also hindered lendingto
enterprises.

2.18    Bythe end o fthe project 80percent o fthe US$102 millionoriginally intended for
investment finance was disbursed, and 18 percent o f the US$70 million disbursed to
support exports. Ofthe technical assistance funds, US$4.1 million o f the US$7 million
was spent, or 51percent. One consequence o fthe slow disbursement was that the apex
organization, EximBank, lost money on the IDP from 1994 through 2000-when           it
beganto earn aprofit-because       it hadto paythe commitment fee onthe undisbursed
balance (0.5 percent per year). It i s estimated that Eximbank(and ultimately its owner,
the GOR), paid a commitment fee on the IDP o fUS$1.7 million.

2.19    Eximbank Role-In     1998, the MOPFrequested that Eximbank be permitted to
make loans directly to enterprises, Le., act as a PFI. Because of the numerous conflicts o f
interest that this would bring, a Bank mission discussed this question with the Ministry,
and MOPF withdrew the request. However, Eximbank was permitted to lendreflows
from loan repayments on its own account, subject to the same criteria as all other lenders.
While this resolutionpermittedEximbank to recover some o fits losses, it shifted
Eximbank's role away from the agency and administrative functions originally intended,
andpermitted it to assume credit risk for the sub-loans.

2.20    The question of Eximbank'sultimate role inthe banking systemis problematic. In
the long runthe private banking system should be able to provide export and export-
related financing, and there i s a questionwhether a public bank should be the position o f
competing with these private banks. It maybe useful to reconsider the role o fEximbank
andpotentially limitingit to providing insurance, export guarantees, and other products
traditionally provided by similar institutions.

2.21       Because o f the generally slow progress, the project was restructuredin 1998. At
that time, an effort was made to recruit additional banks as PFIs, additional emphasis was
placed on extending loans to small and medium enterprise^,'^ local currency lendingwas
offered, and loan approval procedures were streamlined. Itwas at this time that the TA
component was expanded from US$3 million to US$7 million. InSeptember, 1999, the
project was hrther restructured, with the loan amount reduced from US$175 million to
US$120 million, and the closing date extended two years to December, 2000.

2.22       Investment Component-Eight                 PFIsparticipated inthe investmentcomponent,
making 74 loans (to 55 enterprises) totaling US$80.4 million, or US$l.lmillionper loan.
As shown inTable 2, below, an additional six PFIswere accredited, but didnot
participate. The four banks accredited in 1999 reflect efforts to increase utilization o f
project funds-efforts               that were modestly successful. Lending under the investment
component was highly-concentrated: more than two thirds of investment lending was
made by three state-owned banks: Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR), Bankorex, and
the Romanian Bank for Development (RDB).




14. Small and mediumenterpriseshadbeen eligible since project inception, but few had the resources or sophistication to develop
successfulloan applications. Inthe 1998restructuring,PFIs were encouragedto seek business from SMEs, and lendingterms were
eased to facilitatetheir participation.

         2.23      Part o f the reason for the lack o f demand was that the loan proceeds were inU S
         dollars, andmanypotential borrowers receivedpayment indifferent currencies, and were
         unwillingto take the foreign exchange risk. Inaddition to the business andmacro
         environment described above, other factors limitingdemand included firms' inability to

approval process (especially prior to the 1998 project restructuring); a lack of interest on
the part o f some PFIs inutilizing IDP funds."

2.24        Accreditation of PPIs-The                    process o f initial accreditation andongoing review o f
PFIs was confusinginsofar as some institutional roles andresponsibilitieswere
overlapping.16 The S A R states that the process was to havebeenperformed inthe
following manner:"

      e      Prospective PFIs submit application to NBR
      e      NBRscreens applications accordingto specified criteria, including capital
             adequacy ratio (CAR), profitability, satisfactory loan classification and
             provisioning, and "satisfactory operationalperformance, especially concerning
             past-dueandNPLs and collection ratios regarding total loanportfolio andBank's
             portfolio" (see para. 2.27)
      e      NBRissues opinion, and, ifpositive, Bank appraises prospective PFI
      e      For PFIs approved bythe Bank, Apex issues accreditation
      e      NBRcontinues to monitor soundness o fPFIs, including their capacityto appraise
             loans and status o f their financial and operating condition
      e      Apex has primary responsibility for operational functions, including
             disbursementsto andrepayments from PFIs, andmonitoring PFIsto assuretheir
             continued qualification. However, the Bank also retaineda role inreviewingthe
             initial qualification o fPFIs as well as periodic updates

2.25         While the financial condition o fPFIs was reviewedregularly by Bank supervisory
missions, and a number o f PFIs were disqualified duringthe project because o fpoor
financial performance, there is no recordof a systematic effort to identi& andreport
NPLs-a critical omission (see next para). Itwould havebeenimportant to require
systematic reporting o fN P L s since that was a key element o fPFI financial performance,
andwas also an indicator o fthe extent to which enterprises benefited from the project.

2.26        Non-performing loans-The                       proportion o f non-performing loans under the IDP
was very high. The missionwas able to identify 11NPLs from the three largest lenders
(BCR, Bankorex, andRDB), totaling US$42.4 million, or 45.8 percent o f all lending
under the investment component." Sixtypercent o f all RDB investment lending was
comprised o fNPLs, and 69.6 percent o f BCR lending (including Bankorex). These 11

15. A major reason for the lack o f PFI interest inutilizing the loan was the availability o f more profitable and less risky uses for their

increasingly in low risk and highly remunerative government securities and indeposits with the NBR,and to withdraw concomitantly
from the risky and uncertain business o f financing enterprises inthe real sector." Romania, Financial Sector Review, March 31, 1999,
p. 5. (this is already pointed out in footnote 10)

continued qualification.

18. To put this into perspective, a financial institution that recovered 85 percent o f its outstanding loan principal annually would need
to collect a real interest rate o f 17.65 percent per annumjust to restore the lost capital and without consideringthe additional interest
income necessary to cover its operational and financial costs. Fred Levy, "World Bank Assistance for Financial Sector Development
inthe ECATransition Economies" (Draft).

One additional technical assistance loan o fUS$0.9 million fiom Bankorex is also non-
performing andhas been turnedover to AVAB.

2.27        Accreditation Criteria-The                  criteria used to accredit PFIs seem adequate, on
paper.     l9  However, inpractice, they were not sufficient to ensure that the banks selected
were well-managed and could avoid makingbad loans. Inretrospect, it i s difficult to
understand how an institution like Bankorex became accredited and was permitted to
participate for such a longtime: ``.                  ...the   largest state-owned bank inRomania, Bankorex,
long the source o f unsound financing o fnon-viable enterprises and dubious private
interests.' y20

2.28        ExportFinance Component-                        As notedearlier, this $70 million component was
the least utilized o f the IDP, withjust US$12.4 million disbursing in23 sub-loans, mainly
because o fthe reluctance o f firms to assumethe foreign exchange risk. Repaymentwas
relatively good for the export component, with only one loan being designated as a NPL
(the PFIeventually repaidthe loan).


Outcome

2.29        Outcome was unsatisfactory. As noted above, the objectives were only modestly
relevant because they didnot reflect a completely accurate diagnosis o f the country's
development barriers and because the project designwas insufficient to achieve its
objectives. With regardto the first objective-promote                                  growth o f the private sector and
create conditions for an effective supplyresponse from viable private industrial
enterprises-as             discussed earlier, nearly 46 percent o f lending under the investment
component consisted o f non-performing loans. This demonstrates that enterprises were
able to make only limiteduse o f funds loanedunder the IDP. While time series data
showing the proportion of economic activity inthe private sector were not available, data
are presented below (Figure 3) showing that credit to the private sector declined over
most o fthe period ofthe IDP, andthat Romania remains below many other transition
economies inthat regard.2' Achievement o f this objective was unsatisfacto ry.

2.30        Withregardto the second objective, advancing enterprise privatization and
restructuring, as noted above, progress inthis area duringthe period o fthe IDP was quite
limited, and so IDP achievement was unsatisfactory. The 2001 CAS states:

            "While many small enterprises were privatized inthe early years o fthe transition,
            includingall shops and service outlets, nearly all large industrial enterprises
            remainunder state ownership. As a result, the state still holds shares inaround
            6,000 enterprises and accounts for about three-quarters o f industrial output. While
            the private sector accounts for around 60 percent o f GDP, most o f its activities are
            inthe service sector."22

19.CAR had to be at least 8 percent, ofwhich 4 percentprimary capital; profitability and performance were requiredto be
"satisfactory;" loans to single borrowers were subject to quantitative limits; and the PFImust have satisfactory credit appraisal policies
and capacity.

2.31       Finally, with regardto the thirdobjective o ffacilitating safe and soundbanking
practices, some participating banks interviewedby the mission reportedbenefits from
informal training received inthe context o f the IDP, and also cited the positive
experience of appraising sub-loans under the project. However, other institutions which
participatedinthe IDP fared poorly. Bankorex, the largest PFI-which                        provided 40
percent o f all IDP investment lending-was                     "subject to unduepolitical influence, had
misguided management, and suffered serious credit losses.'y23Approximately 60 percent
o f Bankorex loans under the IDP were NPLs, and the bank was closed in 1999, with its
productive assets absorbed by another bank, andN P L s transferred to AVAB. The
Romanian Commercial Bank andRomanianDevelopment Bank also hadweak portfolios
(Table 2). And two smaller PFIswere declared bankrupt.

2.32       One factor inthe failure o fPFIs to perform better was that TA intendedunder the
IDP for that purpose was not provided (Para 2.36). Ithadbeenintendedthat TA would
beprovided to "Strengthen the capacity to appraise credit., ..administer credit lines and
develop loan supervision capacity.. ..develop monitoring andreporting systems.. ..and
assist ininitial appraisal and loan supervision o f sub-loans extended under the
However, project TA hnds were used for other purposes andno formal capacity-building
assistance under IDP was provided to PFIs.25

2.33       Also, ifIDP implementationhadproceeded inparallel with substantial progress in
restructuring the banking sector, the project could have played a complementary role in
facilitating betterbanking practices. However, during the term o f the IDP, progress in
reforming the sector was slow. The FESAL, approved inJanuary 1996, envisioned
privatization o f two o fthe country's four state-owned banks. But by April, 1998, when
FESAL was closed, none had been sold (although progress was made the following year).

2.34       Data on the financial condition o f individual Romanianbankswere not available,
andno assessment o fthe overall sector was done betweenthe 1998 assessment and
March, 2003 . Table 3 shows the findings o f the March, 2003, mission on the overall
condition o f the banking sector. As shown, the overall profitability o f the sector
improved over the time period, andthe returnon equity and loan to deposit ratios seem to
indicate a healthy banking sector. However, giventhe very highnumber o fNPLamong
the IDP sub-loans, the improvements cannot be attributed to the IDP. They are likely due
mainly to the privatization or removal o f insolvent banks, mostly state-owned, a process
not directly connected to the IDP.

2.35     From the available evidence, it can be seen that the IDP had a negligible effect on
introducingbetter bankingpractices.

2.36     TA Component-TA             was deemed very important for the success o f the project,
because o f the perception that skill deficiencies and lack o f institutional capacity (both in
the financial sector as well as inenterprise privatization strategies) were among the main
reasons for the country's lack o f reform progress. It was envisioned that sectoral studies
would facilitate privatization and restructuring, and that TA to financial institutions
would bolster their ability to appraise andmanage loans, while maintaining a sound
financial position.

2.37     Inthe event, the TA component was not implementedasplanned. The GORwas
generally unwillingto use borrowed funds for training and capacity development. While
some sectoral studies were completed-financed          by other donors-TA    funds underthe
IDPwere usedonly to upgrade the MIS (hardware and software) o fthree PFIs and
Eximbank. Training was provided to PFIsby the Bank on an informal basis, as well as by
other donors. Seminars were organizedby Eximbank, and by the project staff and
Resident Missionto bolster PFIknowledge o f credit appraisal and o fthe specific features
o fthe IDP, however, they were only modestly successhl inincreasingutilization o fthe
loan. Achievement o fthe TA component was therefore modest.

2.38     The purpose ofthe IDPwas to increase lending to the private sector, an area
where Romania trails other transition countries (see Table 4). Figure 3 below shows
credit to the private sector duringthe period o f the IDP. Although many factors affect
credit availability, ifthe credit line had substantial development impact, and ifthe
activity hadhad a catalytic effect as envisioned, thenwe might have seenprivate credit
rising. However, betweenproject effectiveness inmid-1995 and its closure at end 2001,
credit to the private sector declined overall (incontrast to the pattem inother transition
countries), but seemed to rise in2002, after te project closed, which coincided with
improved macroeconomic performance andthe privatization o f several o fthe country's
largest state-owned banks.

Sustainability

2.39     Sustainability i s rated as Likely. As discussed above, littleprogress was made
toward achievement o f most project objectives. However, some banks did report that the
IDP strengthened their capacity to appraise andmanage loans to the enterprise sector. In
particular, a number o f smaller private banks probably emerged from the IDP ina
stronger position: Ion Tiriac bank, Demir Bank, Turko-Romanian Bank, andThe
Romanian Bank. With the more favorable macroeconomic performance o f the last 3
years, reductions inthe fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, accelerated privatization, and the
prospect o fEUaccession, the progress achieved by these banks i s likely to be sustained.

Institutional Development Impact

2.40     Institutional Development Impact was negligible. As discussed above in
Outcome, little progress was made inachieving the institutional objectives o fthe IDP,
which were: advance structural transformation o f the enterprise sector-specifically
privatization and restructuring; and facilitate transformation o f credit markets and

                                                 15


introduction o f safe and sound banking practices. With respect to privatization and
restructuring, as noted earlier, progress was minimal untilthe advent o f the PSAL.

2.41      Withrespect to the transformation o fcredit markets, most o fthe technical
assistance envisionedunder the project did not get delivered-except        for informal efforts
made byproject and RMstaff-and            the record inappraising andmanaging loans ofthe
PFIsthat playedthe largest roles inthe IDPwas poor. As noted earlier, a number o f
small private banks seemedto have benefitedfrom participation inthe IDP, but inthe
context o fthe overall sector, progress was limited.

BankPerformance

2.42      Bank Performance was unsatisfactory. As noted earlier, Quality at Entry was
unsatisfactory, principally due to the following factors:

     0    IDP was undertaken inan unstable macroeconomic environment, which hindered
          lending
     0    The institutional analysis o fthe capacity o fthe financial sector to support this
          operationwas weak, and deficiencies inPFIs hinderedproject performance
     0    The size o fthe loanwas too large for such anunstable anduncertain environment
     0    The project was not ready for implementation at the time o f approval
     0    The presumptionthat the achievement o fpolicy-related measures would advance
          enterprise privatization andrestructuring and serve as a catalyst for private sector
          growth was unrealistic, and fell well short o fwhat was needed inthis area.

2.43      Supervision was unsatisfactory. Despite regular reviews o fPFIperformance, and
the suspension or disqualification o f some PFIs, it i s difficult to understand how the
number o fN P L s was permitted to reach nearly halfo f all investment lending.

2.44      Prior to 1998, supervisory reporting was consistently over-optimistic, e.g.,

     0    "Promote introduction o f safe and sound bankingpractices-Technical       assistance
          to PFIshas beenprovided, PFIs were trained inthe use o fproject implementation
          management system and loan appraisal software; the objective i s fully
          accomplished."26
          "Improve lending practices-rated      SATISFACTORY. The quality o f
          submissions of participating banks i s very high. Unsatisfactory subproject
          applications are rejected. Bankshave improved appraisal practices ingeneral,
          and their loan portfolio quality and collection performance continues to
          impr~ve."~'

      0    "The PFIs are elite Romanianbanks. Compared to other members o fthe banking
           sector, they are characterized by solid institutional andmanagerial capacity, above
           average profitability and better than average riskprofile, and robust risk-weighted
           capital adequacy.. .."28

2.45       As notedearlier, about $3 milliono fthe technical assistancecomponent was
cancelled, but no rationale for these actions could be found inthe project documentation.
Although considerable informal trainingwas providedto PFIsbyproject andRMstaff, it
is still difficult to understand how the project Task Managers made the decision to
proceed with disbursemento fproject hnds inthe absence o f this important augmentation
o f institutional capacity.

2.46       Starting in 1998 a strong effort was made to improve project performance by
restructuring the project (para 2.21). This effort was modestly successful insofar as it
was able to promote the IDP, recruit several additional PFIs, andmaintain lending at
betweenUS$15 million andUS$20 millionper year despite an inauspicious economic
environment.

Borrower Performance

2.47       Borrower Performance was unsatisfactory. While the implementing agency
(Eximbank) executed its responsibilities efficiently, the Borrower's implementation
performance had the following deficiencies:

     0     The Borrower did not maintain macroeconomic conditions that were conducive to
          the achievement o fproject goals. Infact, policies ledto a highly inflationary
           environment that provided an incentive for banks to avoid lending to the
          productive sector at all and insteadto focus on investingingovernment securities
     0     State-owned entities-Bankorex,                    BCR, andRDB-provided                        largeloans that
          proved to be ill-advised
           The Borrower did not accelerate privatization and restructuring to the extent
           envisioned at project inception.

2.48      Inaddition, there was tensionbetweenGORagencies involvedwiththeproject
that probably hinderedproject performance. A 1997 supervisionreport stated that the
MOPFcarried out a financial audit that "was not conducted ingood faith," tiedup the
staffs o f Eximbank and o fthe PFIs, anddiverted their attention from lending.Before
tensions were defused, Eximbank announced its intention to exit the project, but
mediation by the Bank mission avoided that outcome. There was also tension between
Eximbank andthe MOPF over who was to bear the risk o f loans that defaulted. This was
eventually resolved ina February 1998, MOUwhich clarified that MOPFwould be
responsible.

3.      Private SectorAdjustment Loan

Objectives

3.1     The objectives o f the Private Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL) were to support
reforms inthe enterprise, financial, and social sectors, as well as to improve the
environment for private business. Inthe enterprise sector, it was intended to accelerate
privatization o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs), enforce hardbudgetconstraints on
remaining SOEs and close specified large loss-makers-including        major coal mines
(highlyconcentrated inthe Jiu Valley). Inthejkancial sector, the loanwas intendedto
strengthen the bankingsystem, ensure that state bankswere properly restructuredas a
prerequisite for their privatization or liquidation; improve bank regulation, and further
develop the government securities market. Inthe social sector, the aim was to mitigate
the employment impact o f privatizationthrough employment support programs, job
training, social assistanceprograms, andjob information. And inthe area o f improving
the business environment, the project was intendedto strengthen the legal environment,
improve accounting standards, and implement an action planto stimulate private sector
development.

3.2     The PSALwas accompanied by aUS$25milliontechnical assistance project, the
Private Sector Institution BuildingLoan (PIBL), which provided complementary support
across all areas o fPSAL activity. (Activities under PIBL are summarized inAnnex C)

3.3     The PSALwas an ambitious attempt to effect enterprise andfinancial sector
reforms that could substantially reduce the pressure on the government's finances. The
project tackled many o f the country's largest loss-making companies; it was the intent o f
the PSAL toput intoplace aframework for privatization o f these firms and begin the
process. Their actual sale was expected to (and largely did) occur soon after the closing
o fPSAL. The project also aimed to privatize or liquidate banks that were themselves a
drain on the treasury, and which-by      making problematic loans-facilitated    the
continuing existence o f loss-making firms.

3.4     PSALwas structuredintwo tranches of US$l50million each, with specific
conditions to be met before disbursement. There were two majorfactors that greatly
motivated the government to undertakewide-ranging reforms. First, in 1997-98, GDP
contracted by more than 11percent (Table 1.1), and the budget deficit increased for the
fifthconsecutive year to 5.5 percent ofGDP. These factors, alongwith anunstable
current account balance andmounting external repayment obligations, increased pressure
on the GORYwhich moved inlate 1998to initiate an ambitious reform program. A
second major factor was (and is) theprospect of accession to the EU in2007. PSAL
conditions were well-coordinated with the milestones set out bythe EU, andthe
government-and      a broad segment o f society-support   the effort to ``join Europe",
reinforcedbyNATO's decision inNovember, 2002, to invite Romania to join the
alliance. Once the government signaled that it understoodthe severity o f the
macroeconomic situation, andwished to proceed with reforms, the Bank moved quickly
to prepare the project (see para 3.11).

                                                          18


Relevance of the Objectives

3.5       PSAL objectives were highly relevant to the country's development needs.
Despite numerous reform efforts duringthe previous 10 years, manylarge firms with
little or no prospect o f viability remained instate hands, causing a substantial fiscal drain
(para 1.6). While the FESALhad sought to apply financial pressure through bankingand
financial service reforms to serve as a catalyst for enterprise privatization and
restructuring, two broad weaknesses undermined efforts to achieve manyFESAL
objectives: government support and commitment were lacking; and the imposition o f
financial discipline inthe real sector was underminedbythe run-upo f arrears, rollover of
loans that were not serviced, the provision o fnew loans to loss-makers, and the
inadequate support infrastructure (e.g., efficient court procedures, market-based valuation
standards, professional liquidation companies) which made it difficult for banks andother
intermediariesto collect on loans. Government commitment to PSAL was high, and the
project was aimed squarely at the development problems that had vexed the country for
nearly a decade. With regardto the business environment, the PSALprogram
acknowledged that privatization and liquidation inthe Statement o f Expenditures (SOE)
sector would not be sufficient to develop sustainable growth. Therefore, PSAL also
focused on makingthe environment more conducive to private sector growth by
concentratingon secured interest inpersonal property, tax reform, bankruptcy,
accounting and audit, and the overall enabling environment.

3.6       Despitethe large quasi-fiscal deficit o f the energy sector, PSAL did not address
this area. Bank management envisionedthat energy wouldbe addressedina later
operation,3oandmade the explicit judgment that seeking to include additional reforms in
PSAL could have made the project politically infeasible. This PPAR concurs with that
judgment and the limitednature o f the PSAL objectives.

3.7       The PSAL was consistent with the 1997 CAS, which seemedto have absorbed the
lessons from the shortcomings of the FESAL. The CAS envisioned a new operationthat
would "more closely target the large loss-makers, simplifymainstreammethodso f
privatization, andprovide a renewed impetus to privatization of state-owned banks."

3.8       Quality at Entry-Quality           at Entrywas satisfactory, the same rating given by
QAG. PSALwas well grounded inanalytical work, and adequately established the
linkage between the problems diagnosed andthe reforms supported bythe project. The
project was fully consistent with the country strategy, andborrower commitment was
strong, althoughnarrowly-focused. The project team consultedwith a variety o f major
stakeholders. The project was prepared quickly-in                      less than 8 months-when the
govemment signalled that it was ready to consider a significant reform program. The
project design was sound, squarely addressed the identifieddevelopment obstacles, and
utilized an innovative approach ("pool privatisation") to the privatization o fmedium and
large enterprises.

3.9       The PSALwas beingreadied for Board consideration at around the same time as
the ICR for the FESALwas written. The main lessons identified were:

    1. FESAL hadtoo manyconditions andtoo manytranches; future adjustment
         operations should be shorter and simpler
    2. Many conditions were process-oriented; future conditions should bebased on
         fewer, but more easily verified, outcomes
    3. There was insufficient government ownership; a high-levelcounterpart group
         should be established to design and monitor implementation
    4. Institutional capabilities were too weak; the availability o f TA should be assured
    5. The legal and regulatory framework for enterprise andbankprivatization was
         weak; the legal framework shouldbe strengthened
    6. Greater attention should be paid to public awareness o fthe reform program


3.10    PSAL took into account the most important o fthese lessons-including       1,3,4,
and 5-which     were key to its success. PSAL did, however, have a large number o f
conditions, some o f which were process-oriented, and it didnot implement a public
awareness program.

ImplementationExperience

3.11     The PSAL team worked intensively with the government to develop the details o f
the reforms that would form the conditions o fthe loan. All first tranche condition were
metbyJune, 1999, whentheproject was approved bythe Board, however, aFund
program was not inplace at that time. InAugust 1999, the Fundapproved a Stand-by
Arrangement o f SDR 400 million to support the government's stabilization andreform
program, and the first PSAL disbursement o f US$150 millionwas made soon after. The
second tranche o f an equal amount disbursed inJune, 2000, after all remaining conditions
were met.


Outcome

3.12     Outcome was satisfactory, with significant progress made inall four areas o f
PSAL activity:

Financial Sector

3.13    Performance inthis area was satisfactory, with all conditions met, although
progress inthe establishment o f a legal and institutional framework for asset resolution
was not made as rapidly as hadbeenhoped. The first area dealt with privatization o f state
banks. InJune, 1999, BCR was subjected to an audit and loan portfolio review, which
facilitated development o f a satisfactory restructuring planprior to privatization.
Privatization advisors were appointed to help implementrestructuring andprivatization.
BCR has not yet beensold; it i s the subject o f PSAL I1conditionality, and in2002, two
unsuccessful attempts were made to sell the bank. TheninFebruary, 2003, the
government announced that 25% would be sold to the EBRD and IFC, and a majority
stake would be divested to a strategic investor at a later date.

                                               20


3.14     Inthesecondarea, dealingwithBankAgricola, thefinancialandoperational
assessment o fBankAgricola (BA) ledto an NBRtakeover o f the bank to contain losses,
transfer o f a majority o fnon-performing assets to AVAB, the asset resolution agency,
andpreparation o fBA for privatization or liquidation. BankAgricola has now been
privatized. Inthe third area, Bancorex' license was withdrawn inJuly, 1999, and its
name removed from the official company registry, and its assets transferred either to
AVAB or to BCR. Bancorex has ceasedto exist, shuttingdownthe largest source o f
loss-making activity inthe Romanian economy; its closure would have been
inconceivable a few years before andwas a milestone inthe country's reform progress.

3.15     Inthe fourth areadealingwith strengtheningbank supervisionandregulatory
compliance, activity had started before PSAL. NBRhad already established minimum
reserve requirements at 15 percent of all deposits, and duringPSALNBR introduced
stricter risk-weighted capital adequacy requirements to bolster bank solvency. Along with
higherminimumreserve requirements, these measures enabled NBRto identify problem
banks earlier.

3.16     Inthe fiftharea, the GORstrengthenedsupervisorycapacitybyreorganizingNBR
bankingsupervision activities into one department focused on on-site inspection, off-site
surveillance, strategic/policy coordination, and legal matters. Improved compliance with
prudential norms is demonstrated by regular reports based on Basle Core Principles,
external audits, andmonthlyreports relatedto specific provisioning requirements.

3.17     Inthe sixtharea, strengthening accounting andaudit standardsandpractices, the
government had already begunthis effort prior to PSAL with adoption o f a chart o f
accounts consistent with InternationalAccounting Standards (IAS), introductionin 1998
o f a new BankingLaw requiringthat all banks appoint independent external auditors, and
that banks produce quarterly statements. As part o fPSAL, NBR also introduced tighter
provisioning standards on a monthly pre-tax basis inthe currency o f exposure. These
measures were subsequently strengthenedbynew NBRregulations for better risk
classification. The condition that loss loans overdue more than 360 days be written off
was substantially complied with, while all others were fully complied with.

3.18     The seventh area, focused on creationo f a legal framework for asset resolution, is
the one areawhere government performance lagged through most o fthe PSAL. The
mainissue was that AVAB was slow to appoint needed management, staff and advisors.
However, this situation was rectified inApril-May 2000, andAVAB now has needed
management, staff and advisors inplace.

3.19    Withregardto development of a Government securities market, the government
established a plan for computerized clearing and settlement o f Government securities
transactions, and it has offered at least four different maturities.

Enterprise Sector

3.20    PSAL achievement inthe enterprise sector was satisfactory, as the government
met or exceeded loan objectives. The maingoal inenterprise reform was to strengthen
financial discipline inthe state enterprise sector, liquidate non-viable loss-making

                                                               21


enterprises (e.g., mines), privatize most remaining state enterprises (including utilities),
andcut losses and subsidies inthe state enterprise sector by22 percent. These objectives
were all met.

3.21      PSAL set into motion the sale or closure o f a number o f firms which became
landmarks inthe country's reform progress, andhad a substantial impact on the country's
fiscal situation. Inthe area o f large-scale case-by-case privatization, 64 large companies
were selected for case-by-case privatization, with 14 advised individually and the
remaining 50 grouped into five groups o f ten firms linkedto one advi~or.~'These 14
firms were the largest loss-making firms inthe country (outside the energy sector). At
the time o f the mission, 35 o fthe 64 firms hadbeen sold, with an additional seven in
negotiation, and four more still considering offers.

3.22      Inthe first group ofnine firms (case-by-case), four were sold, including thehuge
SIDEX steel and ALRO aluminum firms.32 Negotiations are well advanced for the sale
o f another large aluminum firm, ALPROM. One firm was offered for sale, but received
no offers; the govemment plansto reoffer it. Another firm was restructured, with some
constituent parts liquidated andnegotiationsunderway for sale o f the others.

3.23      Three firms were withdrawn from this privatizationprocess, with the consent o f
the Bank, and it is intendedthat two willbe soldbytheir branchministries. Thenational
airline, TAROM, was "shopped" by its advisor but found an inhospitable market for
airline sales. TAROM currently has a contract with Lufthansaunder which its operations
are being restructured. Additional attempts will be made to sell the remaining 15 firms of
the 64 large case-by-case privatizations.

3.24      Inthe areaofprivatizationsundertaken bythe State Ownership Fund(SOF),
PSALbenchmarks were generally exceeded.33SOF privatized 45 large SOEs and 717
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) (vs. target o f 15 and 600, respectively),
sold residual shares in255 companies (vs. target o f 160), and reduced losses and
subsidies by more than 15 percent (vs. target o f 12 percent). Inthe fourth program area
focused on loss reduction inthe mining sector, benchmarkswere also exceeded as loss
reductions averaged more than 47 percent (vs. target o f 25 percent), and 14 contracts
were signed for technical closure and environmental clean-up (vs. target o f six).

3.25      Inthe power andutilities sector, a 35 percent stake inPetromwas offered for sale,
however the sale was not successful. The govemment outlined an action plan for the
establishment o f an independentregulatory agency for electricity andheat. Similar
progress was made indeveloping an actionplan for the liberalization and regulation o f
the electricity, telecommunications, railways, and oil and gas sectors, all o fwhich will
receive EUassistance.



31. Investmentbankswere providedwith a small retainer and a larger success fee. The presumptionwas that there would be
economiesof scale with one firm advising 10clients. While this was apparentlythe case inmost instances, some officials interviewed
believedthat advisorsmostly concentratedtheir efforts on the most salable firms.

32. The missionwas told that SIDEX alonewas losing US$600-900 million per year

33. Firmsprivatizedby SOF were generally sold to local investors, whereas the 64 large firms describedin the preceding sectionwere
"shopped" internationally(althoughsome were sold to local investors).

Business Environment

3.27        Progressinimproving the business environment was satisfactory, though perhaps
less dramatic thanperformance inthe banking andprivatization areas. Priorities inthis
area were to strengthenthe legal framework for secured transactions, reformthe law
regulatingthe Court o f Accounts, improve the tax code, modernize accounting standards,
and launch a study to determine ways to reduce administrative obstacles to private sector
growth. These objectives were broadly achieved.

3.28        Inthe first area, Article 57 o fthe BankingLaw was abrogated-which                                         had
prohibited lendingby non-bank entities-and                           was superceded by a Law on Secured
Transactions. This was complementedby implementingregulations and an automated
registry for personalproperty, andpermitted a broader range o f financial transactions,
including factoring andleasing, and greatly facilitated use o f ~ollateral.~~The mission
was told that nearly 200,000 loans hadbeen guaranteed by collateral registered on the
system created under PSAL.

3.29        Inthe second area, tax reform, significant progresswas achieved. Farmers' and
pensioners' incomes were made subject to personal income tax, and the government
withdrew profit tax exemptions for exporters from the corporate tax base. (However,                                                 '


existing investment tax holidays remain because these legal commitments will be
respected.) Overall, tax legislation i s now more consistent with World Trade
Organization (WTO) and EUnorms, is more acceptable to the Bank andthe Fund, and i s
backedby a program o f implementation support (e.g., public awareness, IT, training).

34. The registry permits individuals to check to see ifan object may be used as collateral inanother transaction, and also greatly
facilitates seizure in case o f default.

                                                                23


3.30       Inthe thirdareaofbankruptcyreform, the govemment amended the law and
established a reform commission, which developed recommendations (later than
envisioned) which as o f end-2002 still neededto be acted upon.

3.31 Inthe fourth area o f accounting and audit reform, Ministryo f Finance (MOF)
issued an ordinance to bring accounting standards inline with IAS, and acceptable by-
laws were adopted by the Audit Chamber. However, institutional capacity inthe audit
field i s weak, which undermines the quality o fmanagement information generated by
firms, raising the cost o f credit and investment due to higher risks.

3.32       Inthe fifthareaofassessingthebusiness(or investment) environment, Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) surveyed 526 companies andprovided
recommendations encompassing regulatory reform, corruption, company and tax
registration, foreign exchange, property rights, standardization, employment, landand
site development, and customs and international trade. Based on these recommendations,
inSeptember, 2001, the government approved anActionPlanwhich is nowbeingusedas
a roadmap for measures to improve the business environment (an outline o f the Action
Planis inAnnex D).35To implement the Action Plan, the government set up an
implementation group with representation from the Chamber o f Deputies, the Chamber o f
Commerce, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), the business community, civil
society, importers, and exporters. Businessmenand representatives o f business groups
report that the business environment i s considerably better than it was a few years ago, i s
gradually improving-for                  example inthe effort requiredto register a business-but                          that
Romania still needs to accelerate progress andbecome more business-friendly to meet
Westem Europeannorms. The involvement of the WorldBank inaddressing the BEwas
thought to be a very positive development.

Mitigation of SocialImpact

3.33      Achievement inthe area o f social cost mitigation was satisfactory. The key
priority inthe social sphere was to protect those most vulnerable to the negative effects o f
downsizing and enterprise closure by providing unemployment benefits, severancepay
and a new law for micro-credits for new business start-ups. These objectives were
achieved, and close coordination was maintained with the EU's RICOP program which
complemented PSAL andprovided financial and retraining assistance to those laid off.

3.34      Intheareaofprovidingsustainableincomesupport tolaidoffworkers, PSAL
conditions were broadly met. The framework Law for Collective Dismissals was passed
inJune, 1999, andthe governmentprovidedsatisfactory evidence that all eligible workers
were paid severance andunemployment benefits. Inthe area o f targeting assistance to
laid offworkers, pre-layoff services are beingrendered, participation is increasing, and
NGO intermediaries are now permitted to provide micro-credits in affected geographic
areas. And a communications strategy was implementedto raise public awareness o fthe
needto actively search for altemative employment.



35. Business groups reported that the process o f implementingthe Action Planhas given the business community a voice in the
formulation o f policies that affect it.

                                               24


Sustainability

3.35    Sustainability o f the reforms achieved under PSAL i s highly likely. The new
government elected in2000 seems committed to the reforms; further reform progress i s
beingachievedunder PSAL11; the country's commitment was reinforcedbyNATO's
decision inNovember, 2002, to invite Romania to join the alliance, which provided
tangible evidence o fintegration into Europeaninstitutions; and, most importantly, the
prospect of E U accession in 2007powerfully motivates officials and thepublic to sustain
and extend reforms.


InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

3.36    ID1was substantial. Substantial progress was made inthe legal andinstitutional
framework for bank privatization and restructuring, though less rapidly than had been
hoped. And despite two unsuccessful attempts, BCR has not yet been sold. Bank
supervision capacity and accounting and audit standards were strengthened,and a legal
framework for asset resolutionwas developed, although implementation of the new
framework was slow.

3.37    As described earlier, progress inthe enterprise sector was substantial, with
satisfactory achievement o fprivatizationtargets-especially    amongthe key large and
medium-sized firms. Partially as a result, there has been a steady improvement inthe
fiscal deficit, which by 2002 declined to aroundhalfo fwhat it hadbeen in 1997. A new
law on collateral was passed and an automated registry established, andprogress was also
made on improving the business environment, although some o fthat progress was
embryonic, as it remains to be seenhow much actual progress will bemade as the
"Action Plan" i s implemented.

BankPerformance

3.38    Bank Performance was satisfactory. Quality at Entrywas satisfactory, as
discussed earlier inpara 3.8. Borrower officials interviewed had a very positive view o f
the Bank team, praising itsprofessionalism, expertise, andits ability rapidly to marshal
resources (usingPIBL) incritical areas.

3.39    The Bank coordinated well with other donors. PSAL conditionality was carefully
coordinatedwith the milestones that the EUrequires that Romania meet for its potential
accession in2007. Over the past few years, oficials increasingly came to view reform
progress, and compliance with PSAL conditions, as critical to their vision of "joining
Europe, whichgreatlyfacilitated advancement.
         "


3.40    PSAL conditions were reasonably well-coordinated with Fundprograms.
Nevertheless, duringthe period o f the PSAL, the Fundurgedthe Bank to include
restructuring o f the energy sector as part o f PSAL. However, as noted earlier, Bank
managementand staff considered that inclusiono fthe energy sector might "overload"

                                                                    25


reform capacity, and thus didnot do so (except for actions related to Petrom). This
PPAR concurs with the Bank

BorrowerPerformance

3.41        Borrower Performance was satisfactory. The government worked quickly and
well with the Bank team inthe identification o fthe PSAL. The government designated
that the implementing agency (PMU) be located inthe Ministryo f Transportation.
Although seemingly anunlikelylocation, the arrangement worked extremelywell, as the
Minister established an excellent staff and an efficient structure to coordinate
implementation o freforms that were the responsibility o f a broad range o f Government
o f Romania (GOR) agencies. Two or three key staff from each participating agency were
appointed to a committee that functioned under the Ministry o f Transportation, and the
PMUmaintained daily contact with these individuals. The Ministerwas provided with
daily reports on the status o f each reform action, and inturnthe Ministerprovided weekly
reports to the PrimeMinister and to the rest o f the government.

3.42       Borrower compliance with PSAL conditions was very good, especially
considering the short time frame o f the project. The most impressive progress was made
inthe areaofbankprivatization, withtwo ofthe mostproblematic banksremovedfrom
thepublic sector, with significant progress inother areas. Although there were delays in
establishing the asset resolution agency-AVAB-the                                unitis now fully functional.
Enterprise sector progress was also impressive, with 35 o f the 64 large enterprises sold-
including some o f the largest lossmakers-and                            some additional number likely to be sold.
Progress inimproving the business environment was satisfactory, although it remains to
be seenhow quickly the Action Planwill be implemented and how effective it will be.

3.43       Macroeconomic performance during and subsequent to the PSAL improved
significantly from the instability experienced earlier.

4.         Lessons Learned

IndustrialDevelopmentProject

4.1        Financialsector operationsshouldbeundertakenonly in a conducive
macroeconomicenvironment-The unstable macroeconomic environment hinderedthe
ability o fthe project to achieve its goals. The highand variable inflationgave economic
actors an incentive to focus on protecting the value o f their assets andpay less attention
to identifyingproductive investments.

4.2        For a projectwhose goal is to advancestructuraltransformationof the
enterprisesector,a moresuitableinstrumentmighthavebeen an adjustment
operation-The policy-related measures undertakenduringpreparation o fthe IDPwere
a useful first step, but fell well short o f what would have beenneeded to achieve
significant progress. An adjustment operation, with the transfer o fresources focused on


36. Also, as a matter of sequencing, increased energy prices were part of Fundconditionality, and it was logical to raise prices first,
and subsequently tackle the privatization of electricity distribution companies.

                                               26


policy change, might have been a better choice. Ifmacroeconomic instability precluded
an adjustmentoperation, a Technical Assistance loan mighthave beenutilized.

4.3     A financial sector operation must bebased on a realistic assessment of
sectoral capacity and a judicious use o f appropriate and meaningful eligibility
criteria for participating financial institutions-In      utilizing PFIs as intermediaries, the
IDP depended on them beingwell managed, with adequate financial strength, and with
requisite loan appraisal and management skills. At the time o fproject inception (and
until 1999), the Romanianfinancial sector was dominatedby state-owned banks that
often channeled resources to loss-making SOEs and suffered from frequent Government
intervention and a lack o fbasic bankingskills. Ina high-riskenvironment, the Bank
clearly needs to go beyondminimally-recognized international levels for accreditation
criteria and establish standards that assure that the banks selected have a solid track
record of making good loans.

4.4     The size o f the line o f credit was too large given the risks and uncertainties of
the macro and business environment-During            project identification, manybanks and
enterprises reported a "need" for term lending. However, the Bank paid insufficient
attention to the turbulent economic conditions prevailing, and the lack o f motivation o f
many enterprise managers to restructure their firms even after privatization. Onthe
bankingside, the Bank didnot appreciate the disincentives to lendcausedbythe lack o f
legal protection-including    the absence of effective collateral (addressed by PSAL),
weak capital bases, and the attractiveness o f short-term, high-yield instruments such as
government debt.

Private Sector Adjustment Loan

4.5     Timing and government commitment are critical to the success of an
ambitious reform program-Several          earlier efforts inthe area o f PSAL reforms hadnot
succeeded. Macroeconomic and financial turmoil brought the government to understand
that quick action was necessary ifa debacle, potentially including default, was to be
avoided. This, along with the prospect o f EUaccession, provided much o f the political
impetusfor PSAL success.

4.6     Ready access to technical assistance was key to project achievement-The
PIBLprovidedresources by which PSAL staff could readily access international-level
expertise inthe restructuring, privatization, and liquidation o fbothbanks and enterprises.
Outside expertise was also mobilized to support the creation o f an asset resolution
agency. And finally, expert advisors provided a great deal of input into the Action Plan
to improvethe investmentclimate.

4.7     Collaboration among donors contributed to project success-The             Bank
worked closely with other donors, which resulted inthe transmission o f a consistent
messageto the GOR. While there were occasionally differences inapproach or timing,
these were generally minor, and effective collaboration with the Fund, EU, EBRD,
bilateral donors, and FIAS played a role inproject success.
