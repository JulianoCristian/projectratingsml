Sub-sectors include:  (a)\n            irrigation and water-use efficiency - efficient operation of\n            new and existing infrastructure is critical as Tunisia moves\n            towards full mobilization of available water resources.  The\n            Agriculture Sector Investment Loan (ASIL) will finance small\n            scale dams, irrigation perimeters associated with either\n            such dams or tubewells, modernization of existing\n            perimeters, groundwater surveying and monitoring, and rural\n            potable water.  Needed policy actions are additional\n            increases in water charges, application of a binomial\n            tariff, and promotion of water user associations; (ii)\n            natural resource management - the ASIL will support soil\n            erosion control, port infrastructure to encourage fishing\n            along the high potential northern coast and to permit\n            meeting the European Economic Community import quality\n            standards, and agro-pastoral improvement of rangeland.\n            Policy elements include implementation of the revised Soil\n            Code, replacement of force account implementation of soil\n            conservation works by contracts with farmers and private\n            enterprises, and a review of existing subsidies intended to\n            encourage fishing in the north; (iii) animal health and\n            production - the ASIL will support the animal disease\n            surveillance network through obligatory national vaccination\n            campaigns and development of disease laboratories, and\n            promote quality standards by financing equipment for\n            programs aimed at genetic improvement and milk quality\n            monitoring.  Policy reforms include phased privatization of\n            veterinarian services, and increased cost recovery for\n            vaccinations, laboratory services and artificial\n            insemination; and (iv) land consolidation - parcel\n            fragmentation constrains rainfed area development by\n            limiting the economic viability of farm units and farmer\n            access to credit and by exacerbating soil erosion.  The ASIL\n            will support development of a pilot intervention based on\n            voluntary consolidation of fragmented parcels in several\n            locations, capacity strengthening of the agency to be\n            responsible for the pilot program, and rural infrastructure\n            in the pilot areas.  Policy reforms consist of expanding the\n            legal basis for government interventions in rainfed areas.\n            Finally, to achieve greater efficiency of public investment,\n            the government's planning and implementation capacity\n            would be strengthened."}, "docdt": "1993-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
