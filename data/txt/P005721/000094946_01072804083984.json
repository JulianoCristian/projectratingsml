This requires a high\n            degree of coordination. 3) The Borrower's financial and\n            procurement procedures need to be simplified. 4) The\n            Government emphasized the priority that they gave to having\n            the ASIL already in place at the beginning of their 1994\n            budget year and the Bank was responsive in accelerating the\n            processing timetable to accommodate this demand. However,\n            this complex multi-component project would have benefited\n            from more preparation time, taking into account the large\n            number of sub-projects and the time consuming nature of the\n            procurement and contracting procedures. 5) The follow up\n            project and the initiation of detailed preparation studies\n            on other key sub-sectors resulted in new operations that\n            deepened and strengthened the reforms initiated through this project."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
