1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In October 2008 a baseline study was conducted in 14 districts and 17 ministries to aid
benchmark all indicators for the planned eRwanda project activities. Following this study the
project has been involved in the implementation of several eGovernment and related
initiatives. A follow up study was conducted by the project in October 2010 to establish how
far the project had come in achieving its set objectives.

For this 2010 survey, field data collection, data entry and preliminary data analysis was done
by a team of 45 Computer engineering and information technology students (CEIT) from
Kigali institute of science and technology (KIST) as part of the final module of the M&E in ICT
program at KIST funded by the eRwanda project.

This end term evaluation study was conducted among at least 3,394 respondents with the
specific objectives to establish the existing ICT infrastructure and applications usage and
distribution in government institutions, the public service delivery performance at
Government institutions, the awareness levels and exploitation of eGovernace among
Rwandan citizens and to establish the level of citizenâ€™s access to Information and public
services.

Regarding ICTs in public institutions a response rate of less than 10% was obtained from the
civil service. It is for this reason that this study focused more on user studies than the
service providers to essentially ensure validity and reliability of the information gathered
and presented. For ICT infrastructure, phase out survey information statistics in the project
M&E matrix were obtained from internal project reports that reveal all information and
numbers with regard to the physical infrastructure that have been established by the
eRwanda Project.

To assess the public service delivery performance as perceived by the clients/citizens,
studies were conducted through exit surveys at public service offices as well as through
general population surveys at work places and households. Following the categories of
questions posed, 81% of respondents are satisfied with the speed of service delivery, while
80.8% are satisfied with the customer care at the service centres and 80.6% are satisfied
with the general delivery of government services. However this leaves a smaller percentage
than the 2008 percentages ranging between 20% and 25% dissatisfied with either the speed
or customer care offered by service providers at government offices. These findings show
increments of 15.8%, 19.4% and 12.3% in citizensâ€™ satisfaction with customer care, speed
and general service delivery respectively.

In addition to these perceptions on service delivery, those interviewed at service centres,
when queried as to their satisfaction with the results from their visits to the service centres
69% were found to be satisfied with the results they obtained from the service centres, an
improvement of 7% from the baseline studies.


                                                                                             3
In establishing the level of citizenâ€™s access to information and public services the study was
split into first an assessment of the ease of access to government services, availability of the
necessary access infrastructure, accessibility to information. Regarding the means with
which service centres are accessed, the commonest means of transport identified were on
foot 45.5% and by taxi/motorcycle 21.2%. And on average the majority (26.2%) spend
between a quarter and half and hour to access the service centres, over 13% improvement
from the 2008 survey. To assess the efficiency with which services are provided to the public
an estimate of time to identify service areas and the time it takes to obtain a service were
estimated and in both cases average times of 24 minutes and 19 minutes were obtained
respectively, there is 5 minute improvement for the former but a 9 minute increment for
the later, which is explained by the fact that infrastructure and applications deployed to
date have not yet been exploited.

In assessing the availability of necessary access infrastructure, an assessment of availability
of computers in the surveyed areas was done and 17% of the respondents consented
availability of computers at home while 23% acknowledge possession and usage of
computers at the work place, this was seen as a 8% increment ion the home ownership and
usage but a 4% reduction in ownership and usage at the work place. With regard to the ease
with which the communications infrastructure is accessible,36% (a 20% decline) consented
that is was very easy for them to access the necessary infrastructure and media, meanwhile
mobile phone access was acknowledged as accessible by more than 91% while fixed line and
internet access were considered least accessible by 87% and 78% respectively.

Further still in assessing the citizens level of access to information, in an opinion poll 74%
were satisfied with their current access to information which is mainly accessed through
radio, TVs, newspapers and the internet. Only 56% acknowledged awareness of telecentres
and what kind of information and services are available at these info-access points, a 20%
increase from the 2008 baseline, while 76% were optimistic that availability of telecentres
would be of great help to the communities around them.

Regarding awareness of eGovernment, only 50% of the respondents acknowledged
awareness of accessing services electronically, an increase of 25%. 26% consented ever
having accessed services electronically of which the commonest electronic services
identified included, e-nota, eSoko, driverâ€™s license online check and the electronic cash
power purchase.

After this assessment opinions were obtained from respondents on what services and on
how best they think service delivery and information can be improved in their societies. The
key services identified for improvement included infrastructure services, document
processing, health services, education services and general document processing. On what
to improve about the services the main proposals included increasing the speed of service
delivery, increased dissemination of information and decentralisation of the services to the
sector level. And finally how best to improve access to information the main response was
to improve the rural telecommunications infrastructure and reduction of
telecommunication costs.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The Government of Rwanda received a Grant from the World Bank for the implementation
of its eGovernment strategy. This Grant was provided under the eRwanda project that
became effective in June 2007 and is being implemented by the Rwanda Development
Board/ICT. The eRwanda Project has focused on specific activities within the National
Information and Communication Infrastructure (NICI) plan with potentially the greatest
impact on good governance and improved conditions for the countryâ€™s citizens, particularly
those most vulnerable, least economically advantaged and vast majority of citizens who live
in the rural areas including women, farmers and traders.

In line with this mandate, the eRwanda project works with the following line objectives to
contribute to the countryâ€™s vision 2020 goals;

GOAL: To Modernise the Rwandan economy and society into a knowledge based economy
using ICT as the engine for accelerated development, economic growth, national prosperity
and global competitiveness

OBJECTIVE 1: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of some internal processes of the
Government of Rwanda by end of 2010

OBJECTIVE 2: To improve the delivery of services in selected key sectors and better access to
information through the use of technology by end of 2010

The eRwanda project is currently working with all 17 Government ministries, at least 12
districts and several Public institutions on various ICT for development projects that include
setting up of ICT infrastructure, applications development and reinforcing human resource
capacity. All with the ultimate objective of enhancing the Governments performance to
enable better service delivery to citizens and the private sector.

Among the pilot districts in which the project operates are; Kirehe, Bugesera and Gatsibo in
the Eastern Province, Burera and Rulindo in the Northern Province, Ngororero, Rutsiro,
Nyamasheke and Karongi in the western Province and Gisagara, Nyaruguru and Nyamagabe
in Southern province. In addition to these, due to several changes and requests that were
put forward during the projects implementation several other projects such as capacity
building for citizens and establishment of telecenters were implemented in other districts
that were not part of the initial project pilot areas. As a result certain outputs of the project
are often found in areas outside those mentioned.

It is in line with the project objectives that the project carried out regular progressive
surveys and studies between commencement of the project and its closure to assess its
level of performance and achievements, in order to make necessary adjustments and
improvements in its approaches and strategies. This report is as a result of the final survey
conducted to asses the first level of project outcomes in its final year of implementation.



                                                                                               5
3.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE SURVEY
This final study (Phase out survey) is a follow up to the 2008 project baseline survey that
was carried out to establish the starting point of the project. The main purpose of this study
is to enable the project to establish how much it has impacted its stakeholders in relation to
the outcomes it is trying to achieve - i.e. the status of the projectâ€˜s Key performance
indicators at the point of closure of the project.

 Specific objectives of the survey are:

        Establish the existing ICT infrastructure and applications usage and distribution in
        government institutions

        Assess public service delivery performance at Government institutions

        Assess the awareness of eGovernace among Rwandan citizens

        Establish the level of citizenâ€™s access to Information and public services

4.0 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Questionnaires for the survey were designed in line with the survey objectives and
translated to the local language (Kinyarwanda).

Data collection was done through face-to-face interview forms, self administered
questionnaires, electronic forms and focus group discussions. Observation and probing were
also used to obtain some of the required information and for verification purposes.

For Government office surveys mainly electronic forms and self administered questionnaires
were used. In these public offices (district and ministry) all available and accessible staff
involved in service delivery were interviewed (self administered forms). However a total of
280 hard questionnaires were distributed to local government staff. No form of sampling
was done. These questionnaires were emailed to ICT officers in all 14 districts surveyed
during this baseline study. At the request of some staff hard copies were delivered to their
offices.

For clients, citizen/exit questionnaires were used for this first target group who were
Rwandan citizens at the service delivery venues - in this case all 14 district offices and public
service counters. Here the sampling over time methodology (Sapsford and Jupp, 06) was
used. It is used in studies that do not have a sampling frame, for example such a study where
one can not specify how many clients will come to access any service at the district offices at
any given time. In this technique the samples were drawn randomly from a series that
occurs naturally, in this case citizens coming to district offices and other public office centres
to obtain any kind of public service, over an extended period of time at a specified service
delivery point. Here cases were collected for a period of at least three days per district until a
total of at least 80 cases/respondents was reached; the sampling date was varied to avoid
systematic error. This was done for all 14 districts for a period of not more than 2 working
weeks. In total for this specific section of the study, we obtain a total sample size of at least
1,275 cases.
                                                                                                6
For the general Population study a separate questionnaire was designed and a two stage
cluster sampling technique was utilized. This method was chosen given the impossibility of
obtaining a list of all citizens and their respective occupations as well as physical addresses
and yet the need to obtain a totally random sample that is representative of the social
stratification that exists within the communities in and around the district offices was
eminent. Here the first cluster was the 14 districts listed in the annex 1.1 of this report. Then
the second cluster drawn from within each of these 14 districts was stratified into 6 broad
categories from which a sample of 20 respondents was drawn from each category. These
categories have been divided up as follows, Education institutions (primary, secondary,
university, tertiary institutions etc), Health centers (clinics, hospitals etc), Private set ups
(commercial centers, industries, non-governmental bodies etc), Public institutions (district
offices, government institutions etc), Farmersâ€™ organizations/communities and Individual
households. This stratification was not only to improve the precision of the cluster sampling
but also give a broad spectrum of the different kinds of citizens that constitute the Rwandan
population. During implementation, the enumerator in every category selected and
interviewed 1 case and then skipped at least the next 5 similar cases encountered and
interview the 6th case. In total a sample size of at least 120 respondents was drawn from
each of the 14 districts, to give a total of at least 2,119 respondents for this questionnaire.
This should give a sample which may not exactly represent the population in terms of
percentages but covers the range of different kinds of people and leaves no obvious group
unrepresented; we shall be able to comment validly on the differences between kinds of
users and between districts.

In all a total sample size of 3,394 respondents was obtained and it is upon these that all the
information given below in aggregate and in disaggregates has been based. In addition to
this the statistics from the 2008 survey have also been used for comparison purposes.

of which 1,867 (55%)                   1,       %) were female. This is an acceptable distribution
                                            (45%)
of the sampled population for a normal distribution across the entire population. However it is
noted that the reason for having mainly males as part of this survey was due to the fact that in
the exit surveys most of the clients/citizens at service centres were males, which is a common
case in Rwanda as most women stay home to do household chores or          or spend most time on
             rms conducting agricultural and related activities.

leave out other age categories that were also duly represented in this study.

This section of the report attempts to tackle two issues; the ease with which citizens are
able to access government services and the efficiency with which the services are delivered
to the citizen. For the first case the key variables used to gauge access to the service centres
is the mode or means of transport used and the time individuals take to get to the service
                                                                                                                     10
centres, regardless of the means of transport used. With the means of transport used, it is
evident that the majority of the respondents (45.5%) access the service centres by foot. This
is mainly because most or all of the areas surveyed were in rural areas and apparently let
alone a poor road network there is hardly any public motor vehicle means of transport from
deep in the villages to the service centres like district offices. Public motor vehicle transport
is mainly from urban or semi-urban centres but which is still not as frequent as desirable.
The next most common means of transport is by motor cycle (21.2%) and bicycles (16.7%).
However on a brighter note it is important to note a general improvement from the 2008
statistics that showed a larger percentage of 52.3% accessing the service centres on foot,
hence it can be generalised that there was a slight improvement in general physical
infrastructure that made it possible for larger proportion of the population access services
through alternative means of transport as well as provision of services to a more
decentralised level (cell level) and to a very less extent increased access to services and
information online (for example through the created Local Government portal in all
districts) are sighted as some reasons that have enabled this easier access. However as
shown in most interviews and in later sections there is still more need to bring most of the
required social services closer to the people.

Regarding time taken to get to the service centres, again this is used as a proxy indicator to
reflect the level of access to service centres i.e. the longer one takes to get to a centre the
less accessible it is to the individual. From the results it is seen that the largest number of
respondents (26.2%) take between quarter and half an hour to get to the service centre and
almost 20% take over an hour. This is a big improvement from the 2008 study that showed
the largest proportion of respondents (31.3%) taking at least an hour and a half to get to the
service centres and a relatively significant proportion (18.3%) taking at least half an hour to
get to the centres with only a few (12.6%) taking a very short time (less than 15 minutes) to
get to the access points. It can be concluded that this improvement of almost 21% accessing
their service centres in under an hour and a half has been a result of the 2 earlier mentioned
developments of better public infrastructure and attempts to bring services closer to the
citizens through decentralization of services to cells and sectors as well as establishment of
other public infrastructure such as telecenters (1 per district).

The next aspect in this section is the efficiency with which clients are able to be served on
arrival at service centres. This indicator is studied through 2 variables which are the time it
takes for a client to identify the exact point of service delivery and the time one spends at
the service delivery point/service counter. The findings in 2010 showed that for districts in
which eRwanda project had implemented some of itâ€™s initiatives on average it takes most
clients less than half an hour (24 minutes) to identify the exact point of service delivery,
there are also cases were a client spend an entire working day (8hours) before identifying
exactly where he or she should obtain the required service not mentioning those who get to
the service point as soon as they get into the service centre. This is a general improvement
by 4 minutes from the 2008 study that revealed that the average time it takes to identify a
service counter was 29 minutes. For comparison purposed to assess project impact this
same indicator was measured in 2 districts where the project does not operate (Control
districts), the general observation was that it took an average of 51 minutes to identify the
services point which was a terrible reduction from the 2008 study that showed it took an
average of 19 minutes.

                                                                                              11
With this observation it can be concluded that the eRwanda project has indeed had
contributed significantly to the dissemination of information about services at the various
district offices. This has been mainly through the project that involved the establishment of
the Local Government portal (http://minaloc.gov.rw/). Through this portal the public have
access to district information including where to access various services, not to mention the
public ICT infrastructure it has established in those districts that attempt to provide
information access points for the general public.

On the side of efficiency at the counter most clients acknowledge that it takes at least 19
minutes for one to get the required service at the service desk. However on a sad note some
case were also observed were people spent up to 6 hours at a service desk seeking a service.
It should however also be acknowledged that there were some few cases were clients
acknowledged identifying of theirs service points and obtaining the services they wanted as
soon as they got to the service centres, but then again most of these were clients who were
aware of where these services were being provided. In comparison to the 2008 figures there
was a general decline of about 9 minutes in the average time it took one to be served at the
service point. Similarly the control areas (districts in which eRwanda doesnâ€™t operate) there
was a decline of about 11 minutes in the average time it took one to be served at the service
point.

It can be concluded that despite the good job the project has done in providing service
information, no significant impact has been made in increasing the speed with which public
servants deliver their services. The project has established LANs in all itâ€™s districts of
operation and provided ICT equipment, however the public service operations still remain
paper based and bureaucratic hence nothing can be said to have been done by the project
to computerize these process. Not to mention the still lacking capacity among most of the
local government staff. However the project has conducted several initiatives to build the
basic ICT literacy levels in local government to enable them maximally exploit the existing
and emerging ICTâ€™s. The project has so far trained a total of at least 730 local government
staff in Basic ICT literacy. It is in line with this that one concludes that with the available ICT
infrastructure and availed capacity, the next stage is to actually develop applications that
will indeed simplify work and ensure faster and cheaper service delivery to the public.

       6.2     Client Satisfaction
This section of the Phase out survey endeavoured to also address the objective of the study
that focuses on assessment of public service delivery performance at Government
institutions. It mainly analyses public service performance from the impact on client
satisfaction point of view i.e. what the clients say about the services provided by
government. The four main areas tackled included satisfaction with the results obtained
from the service centres, the hospitality or customer care of clients, the speed with which
services are provided and their satisfaction with general government service delivery.

      Section 6.2.1 illustrates the nature of results obtained by the different clients that were
      found at the service centres seeking various services. The responses ranged from those that
      got what they wanted to those se who were referred to other service points to those who got
      totally nothing. Good enough it was observed that the majority of respondents ( (79.6%) lie in
      the category of those who got what they wanted regardless of whether they would have to

                                                                                                                                       13
  come back or go elsewhere to finish up their transactions. This is a general improvement of
  slightly over 12% for the 2008 study that had only 65% of the respondents in this category.
  Again for impact assessment purposes the same variable was looked out in the control
  districts and it was seen that only 55.6% of respondents were in this successful category and
  this was only 11% increase from the 2008 figures.
  This observation and comparison can be used to conclude that in areas where the eRwanda
  Project has been operating there was a positive impact on the delivery of services to citizens
  for various reasons that could be accounted to the massive sensitization the project has
  done in these areas to encourage administration to streamline their services both using ICT
  and also clear communication to the public via the established platforms.

  Still to the same respondents, a question on satisfaction with the results obtained was
  posed. From this it was observed that a big majority of the respondents (69%) were in the
  category satisfied with the results from their visit to the service centre. This was a 7%
  increase from the 2008 study and also 17% greater than those in the control districts as
  shown in the annex 8.1.2 figure.

  The conclusion from this is that the eRwanda project has indeed made a relatively
  significant impact in improving service delivery to citizens in terms of enabling them acquire
  the services results they so much need as reflected by an increment in the satisfaction with
  the results of their visits to the service centres.

         Here the study tried to investigate what the clients at service centres have to say about the
         hospitality/customer care at servcie centres and the speed with which services are delivered
         to the clients.
         In both cases it was observed that a greater majority of clients fall in the category of those
         who are totally satisfied with the customer care (80.8%) and speed (81%) with which the
         services are delivered to them. This in both cases is a signficant increase from the 2008
         study i.e an increase of 15.8% for the case of customer care and 19.4% for the speed of
                         ry. Like for other impact correlation
         service delivery.                         corre                      me variables were looked

         at in the control districts and it was seen that 53.8% and 75% of the respondents expressed
         satisfaction with customer care and speed of service delivery respectively.
         The conclusion from this is that in areas where the eRwanda project    project carried out its
         operations there is a higher rate of citizen satisfaction with regard to speed of service
         delivery and customer care compared to those areas in which the project did not implement
         its actions.

and/or satisafcation will be tackled in later sections of this report.Regarding
time it was observed that there was a12.3% increase in the proportion of the repsondents
that were satisafied with the general service delivery in the public sector. In compariosn
with control districts where the satistaftion rate was 78.3%, we see a slight difference
(2.3%), but still positive.

It can be consluded that indeed the project did have a difference on citizens perception      of
public service delivery in a positive trend, though the diffeence was so big as earlier
menthioned no significant impact can be measured at this stage as implementation of
electronic services still have a long way to go.

In both the general population study and the survey of citizeens at service centres
respondents were asked whether they possess and/or use computers at both their homes

    nowledge the use of computers at home of which 8% own the computers,

increase of 4% from the 2008 study that showed that only 13% did possesspersonal
computers at home.                                               ( %) acknowledge use of

the computers at the workplace. This is a disapointing statistic as it is a 4% decrease from
the 2008 finding of which 27% of respondents claimed possession and usage of computers
at the work place. Though the findings show a good trend in adoption of ICTs ICTs in the society
through the increase in possesion of computers at home which shows that there is
increased general awareness in the value of technology, it is still contencious as to why the
number of those with access to computer at work has declined by atleast 4% and further
still there was a positive increase in areas were the project doesnâ€™t operate where 30%
acknowledged possession of computers at the work place.
It is with this finding that we see that there is still need for provision of ICT equipment in
public insitutitons so as to increase the access and usage of these tools in attempts to
increase the advances of eGovernment in Rwanda most especially at local government level.

To obtain a picture of the citizenâ€™s perception on how easy it would be for them to access
government services if they were availed electronically, responses were obtained as
illustrated above. From the findings the majority of the respondents (36%) ( %) said i  it would be
                                           electronically,
very easy for them to access services electronically      , this again is a drop from the 2008
findings (56%) as well as significantly lower than the findings in the control districts where
53% of respondents claimed access to electronic services would  woul be very easy.   . Some of the
key reasons for poor access given were the lack of good telecom services in the rural areas,
lack of internet facilities and low capacity to use ICT tools and applications. It is important to
note that despite the fact that the eRwanda project played an important role it the
establishment of ICT access points in Rwanda i.e. establishment of telecenters in 18 districts,
by the time of this study the points were not fully operational hence it is not possible to
assess the impact of the project on peoples attitude towards access from this projects
initiative. However within a period of a year or two there will definitely be some positive
impact to record in this area of access to eServices and information.

As shown in the proceeding section the most commonly known and used telecom service
provider is MTN (24.6%),  %), the other most commonly used service providers are Rwandatel
whose recorgniition base grew by over 10% and Tigo which came into        into the industry at the
                               lable forms of telecommunication modes available in Rwanda the
end of 2009. Of all the available
best performing with highest penetration identified is mobile phone services which more
than three quarters (91%)                               areas surveyed say mobile services range
                           %) of the repsondents in all areas
between either Good or very good this is a 20% increase from the 2008 survey response
rate.. The poorest performing is internet facilities to which 78% of respondents say range
between bad and very bad access,access this is an insignficant increase of 2%.. Fixed lines are not
that common and were mainly found in a few public offices, and were they are found most
users (87%)%) classified them as being mainly in the category of bad to very bad access. This is
indicative of the true ue trend of telecommunication development in Rwanda today, mobile
                                             inte t connectivity and the phasing out of fixed
phone usage is at the top followed by internet
telephony. The slight improvement in access to internet connectivity has been mainly due to
the enabled ed access of Rwandas connectivity to the under sea broad band fibre optic
connectivity and the yet to go live national broad band backbone. The eRwanda project in
this phase did not realy engage in projects to provide internet connectivity to the lowest
   int though it went ahead to establish the necessary facilitation infrastructure that
point
included the ICT equipment and Local Area Networks in district offices, Busines
Development Service centres and Telecenters. In addition to this the eRwanda Project
        cted the preparation and continuoulsy supports the Regional Communications
conducted
Infrastructure Project (RCIP), a World Bank Funded Sister Project, whose main purpose is to
provide connectivity to the last mile. Hence in the long run impact of the established
infrastructure will be realised.

       As illustrated above, access to services through the different means also affects access to public
       information in more than one way. In the general population study respondents were queried to
       establish how easy it is for them to access information, what means eans of information access they
       commonly utilised and also a quick assessment of the usage of telecenters and the ICT Bus that

       The key means of access to public information identified in the surveyed areas included radio, TV,
       New papers, Phones and internet. A detailed querying revealed that radio is by     y far the most
       commonly used channel for accessing public information.

were satisfied with their access to information. Notably the majority of these expressed mainly
satisfaction with the information obtained via radio in comparison with other sources of
information. However in the control districts the proportion of citizens who were satisfied with
access to services was relatively higher (83%). It is important to note that in these control areas
there are the â€˜â€™oldâ€™â€™ telecenters that were established by RITA, hence its can not be directly deduced
that there is a lower or greater appreciation ofof access to services as a result of eRwanda project
efforts. Hence we can only focus on the change in the project areas of operation between 2008 and
2010 to state that indeed there was a positive impact as a result of implementation of project
activities in the areas of providing citizens with access to information. The other 26  26% expressed

awareness, in 2008 only 36.7% of the respondents were aware of the telcenters and the kind of

only 21% were able to acknowledge that they have ever used the telecenter services. However on
explaining what telecenters are, over 76%                                                   telecenter
                                            % of the respondents acknowlegded that having a telecen
within reach would be of great importance to the surrounding community, mainly as an information
access point and many other benefits shown in the annex of this report.
Regarding the ICT buses that were introduced in the country in November 2009, 26% of the
population acknowldged knowing what the ICT bus was and only 3% said they had been able to use
it. This can be corelated with the bus usage records that indicate that atleast 1200 citizeens from 4
districts have been able to use the ICT bus services (Not counting those that have visited it during
publicity events like the gorilla naming ceremony, National Expo and Fespad). This number is still
small as this is a rather new inititative that has been launched in the country with 4 buses and with
constantnt ICT awareness campaigns and capacity buildings these platforms will definitely be exploited
to the maximum at this rate.

To assess the level of awareness of electronic services, all respondents were asked if they had ever
heard of or used any services electronically. Only a small percentage of 29% of the respondents
                                                              acc
acknowledged having ever heard of public services being accessed        electronically in 2008. In 2010
this proportion almost doubled to 50% as indicated above. This increase in awareness of ICT and
more especially in the area of electronic services can be accounted for by the massive awareness
                           ilding the eRwanda project has been conducting through the last 3 years.
campaigns and capacity building
Regarding usage of the electronic services, there was also a significant increase of about 9% from
only 17% 2008 to 26% in 2010. This again can be explained by both the increase awareness  aware      of
existing services and improved capacity among citizens to utilise ICTs. Here it is important to note
that the eRwanda project through out its implementation has been able to support the
                                                                 information such as the eSoko project
development and deployment of some electronic services and information

that enables citizens access information up      date agricultural market price information using their
cellular phones and the world wide web. In addition to this the project has been actively engaged in
capacity building in ICT for several groups of citizens including members of cooperatives and
members of the National womenâ€™s council in rural Rwanda hence    ence the realised impact of increased
ICT usage as shown in the statistics of eService usage.

Out of the 26% (458) respondents who consented having ever used electronic services, further
probing was done to establish the nature of services they have utilized electronically. As shown
                                                                   nota (the National examinations

commonly sited eServices, i.e. electronic money transfers, eCash Power service and various bank
transactions (mainly ATM services).

The general observation is that there was a move from the usage of general eServices like
eCommerce based services to more day to day or social service based eServices. Notably the eSoko
project that was developed by the eRwanda project in collaboration with the ministry of Agriculture
and animal resources comes as one of the most successful in 2010, from the usage point of view. It
can be concluded from these figures that more emphasis should be put on developing electronic
services that address mainly citizenâ€™s social needs and less on high end eServices that donâ€™t address
the common mans direct needs.

         6.6      Population Recommendations
The progressive study went a step ahead to establish not only the major public services most citizens
frequent and would like to see provided more efficiently and effectively in their delivery but also
gathered from them how best they think delivery of these services can most efficiently be provided
to them as well as how best they think access to information can be improved in their areas of work
and at home. The preceding sections illustrate the findings of the mentioned study area. These are
findings of the 10 most popular responses and not an exhaustive list.

The commonest services citizensâ€™ access and would like to see prioritised in improving access to
services programs included; Infrastructure(energy, water, communication, transport) services
(18.2%), document processing operations (13.8%), Health services (11.2%) and education services
(8.5%). These were the 4 most commonly noted public services citizens would like to see availed
efficiently, what is observed is that this list of commonest services is identical to that of the 2008
study, hence emphasis should be put on these exact services in all endeavours to improve service
delivery to citizens. To give a break down of some of these broad categories of services, for
document processing the main documents identified included the notarization of official documents,
issuing of driving licenses, national identity cards, passports and temporary travel documents as well
as property ownership certificates such as land titles. Other key services identified included payment
processing (taxes and Public servants salaries), banking services and agricultural services.

Following this identification of services, citizens were queried on how they propose access and
delivery of these services can most efficiently and effectively availed to them. There was a difference
in the commonest means by which citizens say they would like to see service delivery improved from
the 2008 study. In 2008 the most common suggestion was increasing the speed of service delivery
but this year the majority of the population suggested decentralization of services would be the best

                                                                                                    24
way to improve service delivery to them. This is clearly related to the highest ranking issue they have
which was transport and communication infrastructure.
The second most commonly stated response was to improve the speed with which the services are
availed to the citizens. Interestingly in the third place, many respondents suggested that provision of
the required services on line (computerized service delivery) would also ensure faster and more
efficient access for citizens. This suggestion did not arise in the top 10 proposals on how to improve
service delivery in 2008. This again can be seen as a positive impact of ICT on the general public
awareness as more people now appreciate the power of technology and acknowledge that it is the
solution to most of their problems.
Other notable proposals from the public included improving customer care and improving public
servants punctuality and availability in public offices to provide the due services on schedule

 On specifics, responses on how to improve access to public information included suggestions such
as the need to increase internet connectivity, improvement of the rural telecommunication network,
increasing radio-television signal coverage as well as the number of TV stations and improve access
to electricity. Another important suggestion that was brought forward was the need to reduce the
cost of telecommunication.


7.0 SERVICE PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE
This section of the study addressed the main objective of establishing the nature of internal process
in the central and local government offices. It endeavoured to assess the service providerâ€™s
perception of the services they provide as well as finding out the extent of usage of ICT and
existence of the necessary ICT infrastructure in these public offices.

However despite the fact that questionnaires were emailed to all the public institutions involved in
the study. As well as hand delivered to the local government offices. There was a less than 10%
response rate from the public service offices. Only a few filled in questionnaires were returned to
the eRwanda M&E office. This has been observed in several other government monitoring activities
such as online post training evaluations that the project has conducted. It is for this reason that in
the conclusion of this study some further recommendations are made with regard to monitoring
internal processes of Government both at local and central government levels.

Further still, to address this challenge in completing data compilation for the eRwanda Project M&E
system, some figures were extracted from complementary studies that have been conducted by the
eRwanda project through different consultancies such as the Government staff training needs
assessment and the definition of LAN specifications requirements for government offices.

8.0 CONCLUSION
The eRwanda Project officially commenced operations in July 2007 despite its official grant approval
that was completed by January 2007, hence it can be said that eRwanda project has conducted its
effective operations for the last 3 and half years. During this period the project has been operating
all its activities with its primary objectives as improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of
some internal processes of the Government of Rwanda and improvement of the delivery of services
in selected key sectors and better access to information through the use of technology.

To achieve these objectives the project was originally designed into 4 components including; I.

telecommunications and IV. Project management. However during the projects mid term review in
2009 when the project was looking at its operations and achievements, the project was restructured
and the third component was dropped. However it is important to note that by the time of it
dropping, the project had implemented some activities under this component of which the main one
was the preparation of the Regional communications and infrastructure project that aims to increase
broad band access in Rwanda.

With regard to other components, under component 1; the project implemented several initiatives
including; Definition of Local area network specifications in public offices and establishment of LANs
in at least 12 district offices, 5 ministries and 5 PSOs, supplied ICT equipment to 12 districts,
developed the cyber security frame work and deployed a computing platform at the National data
centre. In addition to these infrastructure projects the eRwanda project supported the development
of other applications in a bid to improve government efficiency including the eParliament
application, the eCabinet system and the document tracking and workflow system to mention but a
few. The key purpose of these applications was to enable the public institutions conduct their
business more efficiently through ICT. To complement these actions in this component the eRwanda
project has also conducted several ICT related trainings for various government staff at both local
and central government level. In total the project has trained at least 700 government staff in both
technical fields and basic or end user levels.

As shown in the study, the impact of the activities under this component fall under mainly the 1st
study objective which was to establish the level of existing ICT infrastructure and applications usage
and distribution in government institutions. However as observed during the study and from the
facts on the ground, most of the infrastructure and applications were deployed in the last half year
of the project hence there hasnâ€™t been a valid amount of time to say any significant impact can be
assessed at this point in time. However a significant amount of output has been realised by the
project at this level and annexed to this report is a project outputs list showing a summary of
outputs the project has delivered over the last 3 and a half years.

The component 2 (Services and information access for the public and the private sector,) initiatives
included the Government portal, the Minaffet portal, the local government portal, Biodiversity
catalog, websites for several government ministries including Miniyouth, Presidents office,
parliament, Primature, Minict, REMA, RDB, RPPA, The National Univeristy of Rwanda Digital library
and many others. All these were designed and built with the primary purpose to provide citizens and
the general public with access to information about government as well as enable government
institutions have a platform to develop and deploy their electronic services and information to ease
access by citizens and promote government citizen interaction.

Further still under the second component of the project, the project took part in development of
systems and applications that would enable easier access for citizen to public services and
information, these included, the telemedicine project that was deployed in 3 hospitals, the
agricultural market price information system (eSoko project), the ICT bus project, the multi purpose
community telecenters project, the Private sector Federations BDS ICT equipment project, to
mention but a few. In order to enable citizens, especially those in Rwanda to exploit these
technologies, the project went a step ahead to build the capacity of local Rwandans , these included
35 ICT business owners, at least 195 cooperative members, 680 women from the Rwanda National
Womenâ€™s council and over 1,000 Rwandans from different walks of life in the ICT buses.

Even though component 3 of the project was dropped during the project mid term review, it is
important to note that the project invested in some initiatives which in the long term will make
significant impact on ICT development in Rwanda, especially in the areas of increasing access to
connectivity. Some of the actions conducted under this included, the study of the sub marine cables

                                                                                                   26
connectivity to East Africa and Rwanda options, the phase 1 and 2 national backbone feasibility
studies and the Regional Communications Infrastructure projects (RCIP) preparation phase.

All in all the study showed that the outputs of the eRwanda project have had a significant impact on
the citizens of rural Rwanda. This was displayed through the statistics on citizenâ€™s appreciation of
access to services and information. The general observation was that in the areas eRwanda project
implemented its activities there was a positive trend from the 2008 study. In comparison to areas in
which the project did not implement itâ€™s activities there were both negative and positive changes
which we can validly say implementation of the project has indeed positively affected Rwanda
citizens. However it is important to note that the most if not all projects are in their infant stages (No
project is more than 18 months old), hence it is not possible to make a total outcome or impact
evaluation conclusion at this point in time as the usage and adoption rates are still significantly low
for most projects. Hence a similar study should be conducted within the next 2-3 years to assess the
potential realised impact of the projects.
