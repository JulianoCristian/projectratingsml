communication infrastructure (NICI) plan with potentially\n            the greatest impact on good governance and improved\n            conditions for the country's citizens, particularly\n            those most vulnerable, least economically advantaged and\n            vast majority of citizens who live in the rural areas\n            including women, farmers, and traders. The goal is to\n            modernize the Rwandan economy and society into a knowledge\n            based economy using information and communication technology\n            (ICT) as the engine for accelerated development, economic\n            growth, national prosperity, and global competitiveness.\n            This final study (phase out survey) is a follow up to the\n            2008 project baseline survey that was carried out to\n            establish the starting point of the project. The main\n            purpose of this study is to enable the project to establish\n            how much it has impacted its stakeholders in relation to the\n            outcomes it is trying to achieve that is, the status of the\n            project's key performance indicators at the point of\n            closure of the project. Data collection was done through\n            face-to-face interview forms, self-administered\n            questionnaires, electronic forms, and focus group\n            discussions. Observation and probing were also used to\n            obtain some of the required information and for verification\n            purposes. This end term evaluation study was conducted among\n            at least 3,394 respondents with the specific objectives to\n            establish the existing ICT infrastructure and applications\n            usage and distribution in government institutions, the\n            public service delivery performance at government\n            institutions, the awareness levels and exploitation of\n            e-Governace among Rwandan citizens, and to establish the\n            level of citizen's access to information and public\n            services. After this assessment opinions were obtained from\n            respondents on what services and on how best they think\n            service delivery and information can be improved in the\n            societies. The key services identified for improvement\n            included infrastructure services, document processing,\n            health services, education services, and general document processing."}, "docdt": "2010-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
