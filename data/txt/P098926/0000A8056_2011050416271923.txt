                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key objective of the project is to improve (i) efficiency and effectiveness of some internal processes of the Government of Rwanda, and (ii) the delivery of
                         services in selected key sectors including better access to information through the use of technology.

                          The Project will complement existing activities by the World Bank and other development partners, in particular in the social sectors and in rural development.
                         It draws heavily from the fundamental building blocks lain in the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) in the areas of basic support of government
                         functions, improvement of service delivery, and capacity building.
