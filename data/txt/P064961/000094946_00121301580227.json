It\n            analyzes the institutional, judicial and regulatory\n            framework, as it relates to environmental management in\n            Burundi, followed by a description of negative environmental\n            effects, and measures to minimize those effects. It is\n            expected that soil erosion, and sedimentation will occur, as\n            well as flooding. As a result, water discharges will\n            increase, aggravated by poor drainage systems, thus\n            affecting health, and hygienic aspects among the population.\n            However, it is expected that the new long lasting roads will\n            improve traffic and transportation, and prod economic\n            growth, through increased commercial private initiatives\n            promoting local products, thus outweighing negative impacts.\n            Measures to mitigate negative impacts include: soil erosion\n            protection, taking into account natural slopes to\n            appropriately discharge rain waters, and in turn prevent\n            flooding, and, installation of sewerage collectors for\n            wastewater discharges, with special attention to the quality\n            of materials to be utilized; re-vegetation, and\n            re-forestation will be implemented, to control river\n            flooding as needed; aquatic species will be introduced for\n            reproduction as needed, while river flows will be protected\n            by forbidding waste disposals, and swimming; traffic signals\n            will be installed, and, periodic inspections will be\n            conducted on construction sites to enforce environmental measures."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
