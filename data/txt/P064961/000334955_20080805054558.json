and\n            Employment Creation Project for Burundi are as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory, risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was rated as satisfactory. Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) the delegated contract\n            management arrangement is well-suited to mitigating capacity\n            constraints in a post-conflict environment. Showing peace\n            dividends in a post-conflict environment requires swift\n            implementation of programs while ensuring that fiduciary\n            requirements are met. Delegated contract management\n            arrangements using streamlined and transparent procurement\n            procedures and faster payment methods of contractors have\n            proved to be very efficient in delivering quick results on\n            the ground ; 2) demand-driven selection through\n            participatory arrangements of communities'\n            infrastructure needs is most suited to address social\n            cohesion and sustainability of services in post-conflict\n            environments. With a social fabric very fragmented as a\n            result of years of conflict and the persistent perception of\n            Government unfairness in allocating public resources, a\n            demand-based approach to the selection and financing of\n            community infrastructure needs is appropriate to ensure\n            transparency in resource allocation and strengthened social\n            cohesion, while at the same time improving the prospects for\n            sustainable operation of financed facilities. However, a\n            proper mechanism to ensure equitable distribution of\n            sub-projects is needed to avoid project concentration in the\n            capital city and a few major urban centers; and 3) short\n            term employment creation is critical in post-conflict\n            environments. Public works projects using labor-intensive\n            technologies can address high unemployment levels and also\n            the revenue-generating needs of conflict-affected groups\n            such as single women, ex-combatants, returnees and refugees."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
