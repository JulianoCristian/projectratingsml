MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Brazil
Eletrobras Southeast Power Distribution Project
(Loan 2565-BR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Brazil - Eletrobras Southeast
Distribution Project (Loan 2565-BR) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office. The Borrower provided Part II of the report.
This is the eighth loan to Eletrobras, the federal power holding company, to
implement a time-slice of the development of the electricity distribution systems in the industrialized
areas of Sao Paulo, Campinas and Rio de Janeiro, and carry out a distribution planning study and an
energy conservation study. The scope of the project was substantially revised during
implementation. The length of lines installed was 8.1 percent higher than at appraisal, the sub-
station capacity 59.7 percent lower, the distribution capacity 84.2 percent higher, and house
connections 50 percent lower.
The revised physical objectives were met by two of the three Beneficiaries; the third
completed only about 60 percent of its intended expansion; studies were carried out, but their
conclusions have not yet been implemented; and the planned improvement in sector finances has not
materialized. The recalculated financial rates of return for each of the three Beneficiaries are:
"infinitely negative", -13.9, and -3.1. Although the Beneficiaries are quite competent, the
Government failed to honor its commitments on tariffs, and sector finances continued to deteriorate.
The Bank's major contribution was the provision of needed foreign exchange.
The project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, its institutional development impact
as negligible, and its sustainability as unlikely given the ongoing financial difficulties of the sector.
The PCR includes a satisfactory account of project implementation and results.
No audit is planned.

LOAN 2565-BR
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report  (PCR)  for the Southeast Power
Distribution Project, for which Loan 2565-BR in the amount of US$312.0 million,
was approved on June 4, 1985 and made effective on January 29, 1986. The loan
closed on December 31, 1992, as scheduled. The last disbursement was on May 5,
1993, at which time a balance of US$2.5 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by Andrew Waldrop, Infrastructure Division, Country
Department I (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) of the Latin
America and Caribbean Regional Office; and was reviewed by Mr. Alfonso Sanchez,
Division Chief, and Mr. Orville Grimes, Project Advisor.
Preparation of this PCR was begun in March 1994. It is based on material
in the project file.   The borrower and the beneficiaries participated in
preparation of the PCR by contributing data and other information, by reviewing
and correcting drafts of Parts I and III, and by providing other comments which
appear as Part II.

SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 2565-BR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction.    Between 1980 and 1990, the Bank made eight loans (for
about US$2.3 billion) to Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, SA (ELETROBPRAS), the
Federal holding company. Through relending agreements, the proceeds of all but
one loan were passed to operating utilities to finance transmission/distribution
works.  This Project Completion Report (PCR) uses some of the information and
judgments set forth in the PCRs (or equivalent) on other Brazil power loans, as
those loans shared a common background with Loan 2565-BR (Southeast Power
Distribution; US$312 million; 1985) (para. 1.01).
Government Objectives: Sector and Project. The Government expected the
energy and power sectors to make an important contribution to the development of
the country. In 1984, to rationalize power sector investments and to address
long-standing sector financial problems, the Government, with Bank help, prepared
a draft five-year least-cost expansion and financing plan--the Power Sector
Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP) . Implementation of the PSRP would enable the sector
to continue making its contribution to development (para. 2.01) . Consistent with
sector investment objectives were the project objectives: (a) expanding and
strengthening the electricity distribution systems in the industrialized areas
of Sao Paulo, Campinas and Rio de Janeiro; and (b) improving distribution
planning at the company and sector levels and preparing energy conservation
programs at the sector level (para. 3.02).
Bank Strategy  The Bank strategy in Brazil was to encourage economic
growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic stability. Con-
cerning the energy objectives of the Government, the Bank supported the conserva-
tion and rational use of energy; but urged careful examination of expensive new
energy-substitution projects and the more aggressive use of price increases to
control consumption (para. 2.02).  To ensure improved sector finances, the Bank
conditioned effectiveness for Loan 2565-BR to Government approval of an updated
and agreed PSRP. The Government agreed in a loan covenant to implement the PSRP
and to update it annually to the satisfaction of the Bank. By side letter, the
Bank and the beneficiaries agreed on annual (and improving) financial/technical
performance targets; by covenant, they agreed on annual (and improving) levels
of debt-service coverage and an upper limit for long-term debt as a percentage
of long-term debt plus equity (para. 4.01).
Experience and Results
Sector Financial Objectives.   In connection with Loan 2720-BR (Power
Sector Loan; US$500 million, 1986), the Bank and the Government amended the PSRP
to defer some of its financial measures. Later, to advance short-run political
and macroeconomic goals, especially fighting inflation, the Government did not
fully implement the PSRP. As a result, sector finances during the period 1986-
1989 were well below expected levels (para. 6.01) . In connection with Loan 3227-
BR (Electricity Transmission and Conservation Project; US$385 million, 1990), the



iii
Bank and the Government agreed to a new tariff-increase plan (the Rate Adjustment
Plan--RAP), which the Government did not implement. The loan agreement remained
unsigned for 22 months and sector finances worsened.  On April 20, 1992, the
Bank, taking account of the poor state of sector finances, the uncertain
prospects for implementing the RAP, and the overall state of country relations,
withdrew the loan.  On December 31, 1992, the remaining power loans, 2564-BR
(CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission; US$400 million; 1985) and 2565-BR, closed
(paras. 2.09-2.10). Given this withdrawal of support for the sector, the Bank's
effort to improve sector finances must be judged highly unsatisfactory (para.
7.01).
Project Objectives.        Except for some lines and substations,  the
project, albeit with many changes, was completed as of loan closing (December 31,
1992)--six months late because of delayed effectiveness, slowing market growth
and financial constraint. The actual and forecast project costs are US$1,072
million vs. US$1,028 million (in current prices; excluding IDC and the cost of
the ELETROBRAS studies). ELETROBRAS used a little over US$1 million from Loan
2565-BR to finance its studies (paras. 5.01-5.08) . The beneficiaries--Companhia
Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), ELETROPAULO-Eletricidade de Sao Paulo S.A.
(ELETROPAULO), and Light Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. (LIGHT)--completed their
studies (or equivalent) and adjusted their distribution planning accordingly.
ELETROBRAS is still reviewing the results of its studies (paras. 5.09 and 5.10).
Given the commissioning of completed works, the project successfully expanded the
supply of electricity  to Sao Paulo,  Campinas,  and Rio de Janeiro.    The
sustainability of expanded and more reliable service requires only normal
maintenance.   There is no reason to anticipate a premature ending of these
benefits. Due to the low level of tariffs, the internal rates of return of the
respective investment programs are negative. Nevertheless, the physical outcome
of the project should be rated as highly satisfactory (para. 7.02).
Key Factors Affecting Sector and Project Achievements. The attitude of
the Government was a key factor affecting the level of achievement for both
sector and project objectives.   Government tariff policy devastated sector
finances and appeared to show a declining sense of "ownership" and priority with
respect to sector investments.   By undermining the financial position of the
beneficiaries, this policy contributed to project delay but did not thwart its
completion. In other words, the Government continued to accord a high priority
to expanding the electricity infrastructure of Sao Paulo, Campinas and Rio de
Janeiro; however, as indicated by the declining financial performance of the
beneficiaries, the Government's sense of "ownership" was qualified (para. 8.05).
Institutional Performance
The Bank.    The  fact  of poor  sector  finances  prior  to  1986  (and
afterwards) reflected an institutional shortcoming which the Bank should have
addressed--the absence of an autonomous regulatory body with adequate authority
to enforce prevailing tariff legislation and to shield the sector from short-term
policy shifts. It is not certain how the Government would have responded to an
effort by the Bank to establish an autonomous regulatory body (para. 8.01).
From 1987 to 1992, for the sake of flexibility, maintenance of the
dialogue with the Government, and country considerations, the Bank continued to



iv
disburse from its power loans while trying to persuade the Government to agree
and imple-ment a new PSRP. Given the inherent contradiction of this approach,
the Bank did not send a clear and consistent message.   However,  the ruling
criterion, it appears, for continuing and then terminating Bank support (December
1992) was country grounds; and, indeed, the Bank did succeed in maintaining good
country relations, even though sector finances kept deteriorating (para. 8.02).
The Bank prepared, appraised, and supervised the project efficiently.
If the Bank had a fault, it was accepting at appraisal market forecasts which
turned out to be optimistic (paras. 8.03-8.04).
Government.   The subordination of sector finances led to a pattern of
underinvestment which may result in serious constraints on the economy. That the
sector still provides a reasonable level of service to current customers has led
political decision makers to underestimate the risk of having electric power
shortages (para. 8.05).
ELETROBRAS. The authority and position of the borrower within the sector
declined for lack of adequate political support by the Government (para. 8.06).
Beneficiaries.   If their efforts to improve efficiency produced mixed
results  (paras. 7.03-7.04), the beneficiaries managed the execution of their
respective sub-projects as well as could be expected within the context of
slowing market growth and worsening financial conditions--circumstances which
were beyond their control (para. 6.03 and 8.07).
Lessons Learned
Project Lessons. Two obvious project lessons are: (i) the Bank should
always examine market forecasts with a wary eye; and (ii) the standard disburse-
ment profile demonstrated its value and should be relied on in connection with
the preparation of future distribution projects (para. 9.01).
The project-execution performance of the beneficiaries was better than
that of the smaller, poorer distribution companies carrying out their respective
parts of other distribution projects financed by the Bank (Loans 2138-BR,
US$182.7 million, 1981; and 2364-BR, US$250.6 million, 1982). This implies a
trade-off between good implementation by the stronger companies in the well
developed South/Southeast regions and the greater need for Bank support by the
poorer companies in other regions (para. 9.02).
The endorsement of international competitive bidding (ICB) by the
beneficiaries and Bank staff is sufficient grounds to repeat a lesson made in
PCRs on other power projects in Brazil--namely, that ICB continues to prove its
worth (para. 9.03).
Sector Lessons. Since the existence of an autonomous regulatory agency
might have shielded the sector from the impact of short-term political, macro-
economic policy changes, the Government should establish a truly autonomous
regulatory agency--DNAEE or a new agency--with the power to enforce tariff levels
in line with the marginal cost of supply and to protect the sector from short-run
policy shifts on the part of the Government. Further, in order to prevent future



v
domination of the regulators by the regulated, the regulatory agency should
include, in addition to representatives of the Government, representatives of
various consumer groups. It should be recognized that establishing an autonomos
regulatory agency would touch upon sensitive political issues, including the
future role of the of state in the economy and the powers of its various
agencies, and would require reforms which the Government is only beginning to
consider (para. 9.04).
A seemingly contradictory lesson concerns the proper circumstances for
Bank lending. Continuing to lend despite a record of unkept commitments under-
mined the credibility of the Bank and led the Government to expect that the Bank
would not insist on adherence to either covenants or plans. It seems clear that
lending in such circumstances leads to a significant risk that agreed plans for
financial rehabilitation will not be observed. However, the decision to suspend
disbursements does not depend on project and sector developments taken in
isolation from the overall state of country relations. Country considerations
may, for a while, displace all other criteria, and, as was the case with Brazil,
may lead the Bank to purse a contradictory course in order to advance the
important goal of avoiding a crisis with the borrower (para. 9.05).

1.01   General.  Between 1980 and 1990, the Bank made eight loans (about US$2.3
billion) to Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, SA (ELETROBRAS), the Federal holding
company (Part III, Table 1), including Loan 2565-BR (Southeast Power Distribu-
tion; US$312 million, 1985) . Through relending agreements, the proceeds of all
but one loan were passed to operating utilities to finance transmission/dis-
tribution works. This Project Completion Report (PCR) uses some of the infor-
mation and judgments set forth in the PCRs (or equivalent) on other Brazil power
loans, as they share a common background with Loan 2565-BR. Primary reference
is made to Loans: 2564-BR (CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission Project; US$400
million, 1985), 2720-BR (Power Sector Loan; US$500 million, 1986), and 3227-BR
(Electricity Transmission and Conservation Project; US$385 million, 1990).
2. Background
Objectives and Strategy
2.01   Sector Objectives.   During the years 1984-1992, when the project was
planned and implemented, the Government expected the energy sector, including the
power sector, to play an important role in the development of Brazil. The objec-
tives of Brazilian energy policy were: (a) conservation and rational energy use;
(b) substitution of domestic energy sources for imported sources; and (c) exploi-
tation of existing domestic energy resources. In 1984, to rationalize invest-
ments and to address long-standing sector financial problems, the Government,
with Bank help, prepared a draft least-cost expansion and financing plan--the
Power Sector Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP) . Implementation of the PSRP was expected
to enable the sector to continue making its contribution to national development.
2.02   Bank Strategy.  The Bank strategy in Brazil was to encourage economic
growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic stability. Con-
cerning the energy objectives of the Government, the Bank supported the con-
servation and rational use of energy; but urged careful examination of expensive



2
new energy-substitution projects and the more aggressive use of price increases
to control consumption.
Sector Institutional Arrangements
2.03   Organization.  The power sector consists primarily of state and Federal
utilities responsible for, respectively, distribution and generation/ trans-
mission.   For example,  the beneficiaries of Loan 2565-BR are distribution
companies: Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), ELETROPAULO-Eletricidade de
Sao Paulo S.A. (ELETROPAULO), and Light Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. (LIGHT).
ELETROPAULO and CPFL are properties of the state of Sao Paulo.   LIGHT is an
operating subsidiary of ELETROBRAS (para. 1.01) . Their bulk supplier is Furnas
Centrais Eletricas S.A.  (FURNAS), a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS.   In 1984, they
distributed about 61,274 GWh--or forty one (41) percent of all the electricity
distributed in Brazil.
2.04   Legal Structure.   During the years 1984-1992, the regimes for sector
tariff-equalization, revenue-sharing, and regulation were such that the utilities
were strongly linked to one another and to the Government through centrally
coordinated tariffs, financing, planning, and operations.   For example, bulk
tariffs were equalized nationally; and the Global Guarantee Fund (RGG) trans-
ferred financial resources from the richer companies to the poorer companies.
ELETROBRAS, the Departamento Nacional de Aquas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), and
the Secretaria de Controle de Empresas Estatais (SEST) shared the regulatory
function. ELETROBRAS served as sector investment banker, planning agency, and
national load dispatcher. DNAEE set tariffs, granted concessions, and allocated
RGG funds. The final arbiter of sector affairs was SEST, a planning body, which
reviewed the decisions of DNAEE and ELETROBRAS to ensure consistency between
macroeconomic policy and sector policy on tariffs, borrowing and expenditures.
Under this arrangement, the Government ignored legislative standards for setting
power tariffs (10% return on remunerable assets) and subordinated the rehabilita-
tion of sector finances in favor of political, short-term macroeconomic objec-
tives. The sector experienced continuing financial constraints during the 1980s.
Macroeconomic Policy
2.05   Inflation.   Between 1984 and 1992, while civilian, elected government
became the norm in Brazil, the economy experienced irregular and declining rates
of growth, high levels of inflation, public sector deficits, and periodic debt-
service problems.   In addition, disputes as to the respective powers of the
President, the Congress and the states delayed policy formulation, thereby
complicating an already difficult economic situation.
2.06   Price Controls.   Due to political weakness, the Sarney Administration
(1985-1990) tried to curb inflation with schemes entailing minimum sacrifice by
major political groups. The Cruzado Plan (1986), the Bresser Plan (1987), and
the Summer Plan (1989) included price controls (which applied to electricity
tariffs), but, having no significant fiscal/monetary measures, these plans did
not  succeed in curbing  inflation and promoting stable growth.   The next
Administration--that of President Collor (1990-1992)--instituted (March 1990) a
stabilization plan based primarily on a "freeze" of liquid assets. This plan



3
reduced inflation temporarily, slowed economic growth, and improved public-sector
finances, but did not stabilize the economy.
Bank Power Lending in the 1980s
2.07   Lending Rationale.  Bank lending for power in Brazil continued through
the first of half of the 1980s, even as macroeconomic and sector problems became
more complex  (para. 1.01) .  In 1982-1983,  the prospect of default by Latin
American countries posed a threat to the stability of the international banking
system. Calming these fears by demonstrating faith in the creditworthiness of
Brazil was an explicit part of the rationale for Bank lending during the period
leading up to the processing of Loans 2565-BR (Southeast Power Distribution;
US$312 million, 1985) and 2564-BR (CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission Project;
US$400 million, 1985) (para. 1.01).
2.08   Sector Adjustment Lending (SECAL).  In 1986, Loan 2720-BR (Power Sector
Loan; US$500 million,  1986)  supported the final version of the PSRP.   To
accomodate the Cruzado Plan, the Bank and the Government amended the PSRP to
defer major tariff increases to the years after 1986. During the years 1987-
1989, the Government did not fully implement the PSRP and, due to macroeconomic,
tariff, and other factors, did not agree to a revised PSRP or the terms of a
second SECAL.
2.09   Continuing the Dialogue.   In 1990,  the Bank approved Loan 3227-BR
(Electricity Transmission and Conservation Project; US$385 million). The Bank
conditioned effectiveness to implementation of an agreed program of tariff
increases, the "Rate Adjustment Plan" (RAP) , and appraised a companion distribu-
tion loan for US$300 million. During the 22 months after Board approval, Loan
3227-BR remained unsigned and the financial condition of the sector deteriorated.
On April 20, 1992, the Bank, taking into account the financial deterioration of
the sector, the uncertain prospects for the implementation of the RAP, and the
overall state of country relations, withdrew Loan 3227-BR.
2.10   Ending  Financial  Support  for  the  Sector.        Loan  withdrawal  had
implications for those power loans still being disbursed--2564-BR and 2565-BR--
as the beneficiaries of these loans were not in compliance with their respective
revenue covenants. Since 1981, the Bank had refrained from enforcing the revenue
covenants of its power loans as long as the Government appeared to be trying to
implement an agreed plan for sector financial rehabilitation. Withdrawal meant
that the Bank was no longer acting on these premises.   However, rather than
further exacerbate relations with Brazil by suspending disbursements, the Bank
instead decided to allow both loans to close as scheduled on December 31, 1992.
3. Project Origin, Obiectives, and Description
3.01   Origin.  In January 1984, the Government asked for Bank assistance in the
formulation, financing, and implementation of a plan to address long-standing
sector investment and financial difficulties (Part III, Table 2) . This request
led to a draft PSRP (para. 2.01), of which the project was a part, and to an
expression of interest in Bank financing by the Government.



4
3.02   Prolect Obiectives.   The first project objective was to support the
expansion and reinforcement of the distribution systems in the industrialized
areas of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Campinas. The second objective was to
improve the distribution planning and to prepare electric energy conservation
programs at the company and sector levels. Improved sector finances--a sector
objective--was to result from implementation of the tariff increases and other
measures included in the PSRP.
3.03   Project Description, Timetable, and Cost.  The project consisted of a
time-slice of the beneficiaries' investment programs for 1986-1989 (substations,
lines, etc.), plus training for staff and studies (para. 3.02).  Due to the
expectation of changing sector finances and changing market developments, the
physical goals of the project were defined only in general terms.   Implemen-
tation activities--procurement, manufacturing, installation, and construction--
were to be carried out during the period July 1985-December 1989. The project
was expected to cost a little over US$1.0 billion (excluding interest during
construction).
3.04   Borrower. Beneficiaries, and Guarantor.  The Loan Agreement (LA) provided
for a loan of US$312.0 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of
miscellaneous distribution equipment, training, studies, and interest during
construction  (up to US$50 million) .  ELETROBRAS, the borrower, would relend
US$179 million to ELETROPAULO, US$71 million to LIGHT, and US$60 million to CPFL;
and would retain the balance (US$2.0 million) to finance studies. The Government
acted as guarantor.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01   Proiect Design.   The project design was sectoral--that is, since the
utilities were strongly linked (paras. 2.04), it made sense to design an
investment program--the draft PSRP (para. 3.01)--which took such factors into
account, and to base the project on the distribution works of high-priority
regions included in the PSRP. Since the Bank and ELETROBRAS had, for many years,
planned and executed projects in the light of sector investment needs, there was
little new in this approach. What was new was the conditioning of effectiveness
to Government approval of the PSRP, to which the Government was formally and
directly committed. The Government agreed in a loan covenant to implement the
PSRP and to up-date it annually to the satisfaction of the Bank.   By side
letters, the Bank and the beneficiaries agreed on annual (and improving)
financial/technical perform-ance targets; by covenant they agreed on annual (and
improving) levels of debt service coverage and an upper limit for long-term debt
as a percentage of long-term debt plus equity.
4.02   Project Preparation.  Preparation and appraisal were executed promptly
between October 1984 and February 1985.   Negotiations for Loan 2565-BR were
completed in May 1985; the Executive Directors approved the loan on June 4, 1985;
and the loan and project documents were signed on August 28, 1985 (Part III,
Table 2) . Thereafter, efforts to comply with conditions of effectiveness slowed,
as the new Sarney Administration wished to assure itself that the early version
of the PSRP was consistent with its national macroeconomic program.



5
4.03   Ownership.  With respect to its origin, the project clearly reflected
initiative on the part of the Government.   With respect to its content, the
project reflected agreement and acceptance by all parties.
4.04   Roles and Responsibilities.  At the time of loan approval (June 4, 1985),
the roles of the Government, the borrower, and the beneficiaries were clearly
understood. The Government was to improve sector finances by implementing the
PSRP; ELETROBRAS was to execute its studies and to relend the proceeds of Loan
2565-BR (para. 3.04); and the beneficiaries were to carry out the rest of the
project.
5. Implementation
5.01   General.  Due to different factors, variances materialized with respect
to project implementation dates, the mix of works, and costs.   Studies and
training were also late in their execution.
Dates
5.02   Effectiveness.   After loan signing (August 28, 1985), ELETROBRAS and
LIGHT satisfied the first two special conditions: they signed a satisfactory
relending contract and submitted related, satisfactory legal opinions.1  The
third special condition required formal Government approval of a satisfactory
PSRP. The Government complied (November/December 1985) with this condition and
implemented the 1985 component of the tariff adjustment program.   The Bank
considered that the measures taken, together with the implementation of the
agreements reached in 1985, would place the sector on the path of financial
recovery, and justified declaring that portion of Loans 2565-BR relevant to LIGHT
effective on January 29, 1986--about a month late.
5.03   Delayed Project Start-up.   Calling for bids--the first stage of the
procurement process and therefore project start-up--commenced in about August
1986, about a year behind schedule.   The late project start-up was due to the
investment ceiling mandated by the Government in connection with the Cruzado Plan
(March 1986) (para 2.08).
5.04   Late Signing of Relending Agreements.  Effectiveness of Loan 2565-BR did
not apply to CPFL and ELETROPAULO until February 17, 1987 and April 7, 1987.
They were late in signing their relending agreements and late delivering
satisfactory legal opinions. In the case of ELETROPAULO, late signing was due
to the successful effort of ELETROBRAS to obtain a commitment to repay unpaid
amounts due the RGG (para. 2.04) .  According to the project timetable, by
February-April 1987 ELETROPAULO and CPFL should have been receiving goods under
Bank-financed contracts, but, of course, this was not the case. As for LIGHT,
due to difficulties in obtaining proper import licenses in 1987, its sub-project
was about as delayed as those of CPFL and ELETROPAULO.
' The legal opinions were concerned with: (i) due execution and legal validity of the reLending
contract and the corresponding project agreement; (ii) authority of the beneficiary to execute its sub-
project; and (iii) related approvals by the Government and the state required for execution of the sub-
project.



6
5.05   Project Completion.  As of December 31, 1992, the loan closing date, the
project was complete, except some works to be executed by LIGHT. This project
completion date was only six months later than the date in the LA (June 30,
1992). The SAR indicated a project completion date of December 31, 1989. The
different completion date in the LA  was due to the fact that the standard
disbursement profile for distribution projects in Latin America called for seven
years rather than four years, as expected at appraisal. The seven-year period
was used for calculating disbursements from the loan and for calculating price
contingencies. The beneficiaries noted that the initial effectiveness delays
were compounded by slowing market growth and financial constraints.

(thousands of house meters)
* Sub-transmission and distribution lines. ** Includes pending instaLLation of 320 conductor-km
of sub-transmission Lines and 1,016 MVA of substation transformation capacity.
Because of the availability of financing for power transformers from sources
other than the Bank, ELETROPAULO obtained Bank agreement (August 13, 1986) to
reduce substation MVA by 82.2% and to add kilometers of conductors (+34.7%) and
MVAs of distribution transformation capacity (+43.9%) with the freed Bank funds.
Due to lower-than-expected sales growth and variations with respect to the
locations of new power loads, LIGHT obtained Bank agreement (May 3, 1989) to
expanding the scope of the project by reducing the conductor-kms of lines
(-45.3%) and increasing substation MVA (+51.1%) .2  Its incomplete substation
transformation capacity represented about 26.2% of the corresponding equipment
category. In the case of CPFL, lower-than-expected prices for Bank-financed
contracts led to the purchase of more equipment than originally expected, thereby
increasing the mix of works completed under the sub-project: km. of lines,
+43.4%; sub-station MVA, +23.6%, and distribution MVA, +183.8%.
5.07   Project Cost and Sources of Financing.  On the following page, Schedule
5.2 shows actual and forecast project costs: US$1,072 million vs. US$1,028
million (excluding the cost of the ELETROBRAS studies and exluding interest
during construction--IDC). ELETROBRAS used only a little over US$1 million to
finance its studies. Including IDC, disbursements from Loan 2565-BR amounted to
US$309.5 million, or 99% of the original loan amount.
2 For LIGHT, the change in the project description consisted of the installation of SF6 high tension
(138kV) switchgear at a newly constructed substation (Joquei); a reduced overaLl tength of subtransmission
and distribution lines; an increase of substation transmission capacity; and a reduction of consumer meters.
In Part II, LIGHT expressed its appreciation for the support provided by the supervision mission of January
1989 in connection with changing the project description.

5.08   Comparability of Actual and Forecast Cost.   Since the mix of works
completed under the project was substantially different from what was expected
at appraisal, actual and forecast costs are not truly comparable.  Other factors
also limited the comparability of actual and forecast cost data. For example,
in the opinion of CPFL, price contingencies for imported goods were overestimated
at appraisal, especially with respect to Bank-financed contracts (which
benefitted from international competitive bidding--ICB), and goods procured under
local bidding procedures had higher prices expressed in US dollars than the
prices estimated at appraisal because the rates of local-currency devaluation
were lower than those of inflation. Bank staff who supervised the project shared
CPFL's opinion on the benefits of ICB.  Definitive price comparisons are not
available.   Part III, Tables 3, 4 and 5 compare, respectively,  actual and
forecast project costs, timing of cumulative disbursements and allocations of
loan proceeds.
5.09   Light Sub-project.  LIGHT expects to complete the installation of sub-
transmission and distribution lines (302 conductor-kms) and substation
transformation capacity (1,016 MVA) by 1997. According to LIGHT, the estimated
cost of completing its sub-project is about US$114.2 million or 10.7% of the
total project cost: US$39.5 million for lines and US$74.7 million for substation
transformation capacity including the cost of inspection. In Part II (p. 16),
LIGHT notes that inadequate counterpart financing accounted for the delayed
project completion and the premature purchase of equipment with Bank funds.
5.10   Borrower Studies.  In 1989 and 1992 respectively, ELETROBRAS incorporated
the findings on distribution expansion and energy conservation into technical
documents. According to ELETROBRAS, one of its planning groups is analyzing the
distribution planning study; and for lack of personnel with adequate training,
the energy conservation study has yet to be integrated into the planning process.
5.11   Beneficiary Studies.  The beneficiaries fulfilled their training goals,
completed their studies (or equivalent) and implemented their findings. with
Bank agreement, LIGHT hired a consultant to assist with the procurement and
installation of new load dispatch equipment. CPFL completed its studies in 1989



8
with its own staff. Consultants delivered to ELETROPAULO their final report in
May 1993, well after the covenanted completion date of December 31, 1987.
6. Operating and Financial Performance: Sector and Beneficiaries
6.01   Sector.   During 1986-1989, operating and financial performances of the
sector were well below what was expected in connection with Loan 2720-BR (see
Schedule 6.1).  For example, by 1989, actual sector sales, 189 TWh, were 15*
below the forecast level, and average revenue per kWh sold, US cents 3.03, had
declined by 22% compared with the level of the prior year and as compared with
a forecast increase of 17%. The ratios for annual debt service coverage were
also well below target levels. Post-1989 sector data based on format agreed in
connection with Loan 2720-BR are not available to the Bank. The sales shortfall
was primarily due to uneven macroeconomic conditions; the revenue shortfall
reflected the Government's decision to subordinate sector financial rehabilita-
tion to political goals or other strategic objectives (paras. 2.06-2.09).
Beneficiaries
6.02   Sales.  The load growth of the beneficiaries in 1986-1989 paralleled that
of the sector.  By 1989, the actual sales levels of ELETROPAULO (48 TWh) and
LIGHT (19 TWH) were 10% below forecast and that of CPFL (12 TWh), 7% below fore-
cast. As of 1992, the combined sales of the beneficiaries, 81 TWh, amounted to
slightly more than the level prevailing in 1988, 78 TWh (see Schedule 6.1) . The
impact of various stabilization plans, especially the Collor Plan in 1990-1991
explains part of the shortfall with respect to commercial and industrial sales.
6.03   Finances.  The annual financial performance of the beneficiaries varied
in 1986-1989 both above and below their forecasts and above and below sector
norms (see Schedule 6.1).  For example, LIGHT and ELETROPAULO, as measured by
tariff levels, rates of return on remunerable assets, operating ratios and debt-
service coverage, exceeded their financial forecasts after 1986 and exceeded the
corresponding sector data (excluding the operating ratio). On the other hand,
CPFL's performance was generally below forecast and below sector norms. Between
1989 and 1992, due to low tariff levels, CPFL revenues did not cover operating
expenses, with the result that the company generated negative returns on
remunerable assets. The same was true for LIGHT and ELETROPAULO in 1992. Part
III, Table 6 compares actual and forecast technical and financial indicators
established for each beneficiary.
7. Results
7.01   Sector Obiectives.  By not fully implementing the PSRP and its successor,
the Government devastated the finances of the sector and the beneficiaries
(paras. 6.01 and 6.03). This inadequate performance is one of the reasons why
the Bank withdrew its support.  Given such devastation, the Bank's effort to
improve sector finances must be judged highly unsatisfactory.
7.02   Project Obiectives.  The project expanded and reinforced the distribution
systems in Sao Paulo, Campinas, and Rio de Janeiro, thereby helping to advance
development. Ordinary maintenance should sustain the benefits of expanded and

and more reliable service until the works are retired or replaced. Due to the
low level of tariffs, the internal rates of return of the beneficiaries,
investment programs are negative (Part III, Table 8). Nevertheless, the physical
outcome of the project should be rated as highly satisfactory.
7.03   Efficiency.   The efforts of the beneficiaries to improve efficiency
produced mixed results. For example, the loss ratios of CPFL and ELETROPAULO
showed improvement, declining from 7.3% in 1985 to 6.1% in 1992 while that of
LIGHT worsened, rising from 9% to 13% (see Schedule 7.1 on the following page).
According to LIGHT, the worsening ratio was due to inaccuracies of the metering
system. Modernization of metering at the energy interchange points of LIGHT with
other companies as well as at the receiver substations is contemplated.   Such
modernization and stepped-up action against fraud are expected to lower the loss
ratio.
7.04   Efforts to reduce staff met or exceeded target ratios of employees to
customers because the beneficiaries increasingly relied on service companies to
perform functions previously carried out by employees. This explains the large
increase of average personnel and material expenses between 1985 and 1992. At
LIGHT, the increase was 175% (net); at ELETROPAULO, the increase was 207%; at
CPFL, the increase was 140%.
8. Institutional Performance
The Bank
8.01   Institutional Shortcomings.   Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank, taking
account of the complex problems of Brazil, made eight power loans based on the
understanding that the Government would implement a series of plans for
rehabilitating sector finances.   The plans failed to achieve their objective
because the Government, in its effort to combat inflation and due to political
considerations--plus other factors (including deficiencies inherent to the
plans)--did not support the sector with adequate tariff levels. This situation
reflected an institutional shortcoming which the Bank should have addressed--the
absence of an autonomous regulatory body with sufficient authority to enforce
prevailing tariff legislation and to shield the sector from short-term policy
shifts. It is not certain how the Government would have responded to an effort
by the Bank to establish an autonomous regulatory body.
8.02   Contradictions.    From  1987  to  1992,  for the sake of  flexibility,
maintaining the dialogue with the Government, and country considerations, the
Bank continued to disburse from its power loans, but did not complete the pro-
cessing of new power loans due to macroeconomic, tariff and other factors. Given
the contradiction of this approach, the Bank did not send a clear message to the
Government; hence, this tended to undermine the Bank's efforts to influence
sector policy.   The ruling criterion,  it appears,  for continuing and then
terminating Bank support (December 1992) was country grounds; and indeed the Bank
did succeed in maintaining good country relations, even though sector performance
kept deteriorating.

8.03   Project  Appraisal.    The  Bank  prepared  and  appraised  the  project
efficiently. If the Bank had a fault, it was accepting forecasts which turned
out to be optimistic. In connection with Loans 2564-BR, 2565-BR, and 2720-BR,
the Bank accepted company, regional, and sector forecasts which reflected an "up-
beat" approach to future market developments. However, as shown in Schedule 8.1
below, these "up-beat" forecasts were not validated by events.

8.04   Project Supervision.   The level of supervision,  including visits to
beneficiaries, was adequate (Part III, Table 9) and the measures recommended were
generally appropriate. In Part II (p. 16), LIGHT noted that inadequate levels
of counterpart funding adversely affected its performance and that it (LIGHT) had
been unable to install all of the equipment it had purchased with Bank funds.
LIGHT also noted that the inadequate level of counterpart funding adversely
affected the Bank's performance. Since LIGHT did not illustrate this point, it
does not appear that LIGHT was critical of Bank perturmance.
8.05   Government.  The attitude of the Government was a key factor affecting
the level of achievement for both sector and project objectives (para. 2.04).
Government tariff policy devastated sector finances, deviated from covenanted
commitments (Part III, Table 7), and caused the Bank to withhold its financial
support from the sector. It also led to a pattern of underinvestment which may
result in serious constraints on the economy and appeared to show a declining
sense of "ownership" with respect to sector investments in spite of the
importance of the sector to national development. By undermining the financial
position of the beneficiaries, this policy contributed to project delay but not
thwart its completion. In other words, the Government accorded a high priority
to expanding the electricity infrastructure of Sao Paulo, Campinas and Rio de
Janeiro; but, as indicated by the declining financial performance of the
beneficiaries, the Government's sense of "ownership" was qualified.  That the
sector still provides a reasonable level of service to current customers has led
political decision makers to underestimate the risk of having electric power
shortages.
8.06   The Borrower.   ELETROBRAS relent the proceeds of Loan 2565-BR to the
beneficiaries, as expected; but its authority and position in the sector declined
during the 1980s. Contributing to this decline was the emergence of SEST as the
final arbiter of sector affairs (para. 2.04). The Government did not implement
the tariff and financing policies recommended by ELETRORBAS and did not support
ELETROBRAS in disputes with state power companies. Part III, Table 7 sets forth
the record of compliance on the part of ELETROBRAS with respect to the LA.
8.07   Beneficiaries.   If their efforts to improve efficiency produced mixed
results, the beneficiaries managed the execution of their respective sub-projects
as well as could be expected within the context of slowing market growth and
worsening financial conditions--circumstances which were beyond their control.

Their performances exceeded those of the smaller, poorer distribution companies
executing their respective parts of the ELETROBRAS I and II Power Distribution
Projects (para. 8.05) . Part III, Table 7 sets forth the record of compliance on
their part with respect to the PAs.
9. Lessons Learned
Project Lessons
9.01   Market Growth and Disbursement Profiles.  There are two obvious project
lessons, one relating to market forecasts and the other relating to the criteria
for estimating disbursement timing. By 1992, the group sales of ELETROPAULO,
CPFL, and LIGHT were only marginally above the level of 1988, mostly because of
shortfalls with respect to industrial sales. Clearly, the "up-beat" character
of the sales forecasts was not validated by events. Given the risks of oversized
loans and extra interest costs resulting from sales shortfalls, implementation
delays, and disbursement lags, it is important that during appraisal Bank staff
always carefully scrutinize sales forecasts. As for the criteria of disbursement
timing, the fact that the actual disbursement period for the loan almost exactly
coincided with that expected from region-wide experience demonstrates the value
of the standard disbursement profile. The lesson, of course, is that the profile
should be relied on, unless special factors are expected to prevail.
9.02   Project  Location.        The  project-execution  performances   of  the
beneficiaries exceeded those of the smaller, poorer distribution companies
executing their parts of the ELETROBRAS I and II Power Distribution Projects
(para. 8.05) .  This implies a trade-off between good implementation by the
stronger companies in the well developed South/Southeast regions and the greater
need on the part of the poorer companies in other regions.
9.03   ICB.  A fourth project lesson, which is not new, is that ICB again proved
its worth, as demonstrated by the testimony of CPFL and as affirmed by Bank staff
(para. 5.08). LIGHT also testified to the worth of ICB (see Part II).
Sector Lessons
9.04   Regulation.  In the 1980s the Government ignored power tariff legislation
and the regulatory authority of DNAEE in favor of financial rehabilitation plans
and review by SEST.  The substitution of these plans for the norms of tariff
legislation started the sector on a downhill path which allowed for the
subordination of the long-term financial needs of the sector to short-run
political and macroeconomic objectives. Since the existence of an autonomous
regulatory agency  might have avoided this situation, the Government should
establish a truly autonomous regulatory agency--DNAEE or a new agency--with the
power to enforce tariff levels in line with the marginal cost of supply and to
protect the sector from short-run policy shifts on the part of the Government.
Further, in order to prevent future domination of the regulators by the
regulated, the regulatory agency should include, in addition to representatives
of the Government, representatives of various consumer groups.   It should be
recognized that establishing an autonomos regulatory agency would touch upon
sensitive political. issues, including the future role of the of state in the



14
economy and the powers of its various agencies, and would require reforms which
the Government is only beginning to consider.
9.05   Circumstances for Bank Lending. Another, seemingly contradictory, lesson
concerns the circumstances for Bank lending. Continuing to lend despite a record
of unkept plans for financial rehabilitation undermined the credibility of the
Bank and led the Government to expect the Bank not to insist on adherence to
either financial covenants or plans. This message undoubtedly detracted from
implementation of the plans. It seems clear that lending in circumstances of
continuing financial deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message and leads
to a significant risk that agreed plans for financial rehabilitation will not be
observed.   However, the decision to suspend disbursements does not depend on
project and sector developments taken in isolation from the overall state of
country relations.   Country considerations may,  for a while,  lead to the
displacement of all other criteria, and, as was the case with Brazil, may lead
the Bank to pursue a contradictory course to advance the important goal of
avoiding a crisis with the borrower.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BRAZILIAN PERSPECTIVE
Note: DNAEE, the borrower and the beneficiaries supplied corrected factual data
which been incorporated into Parts I and III without duplication in Part II. The
cover letter for the comments of DNAEE, which was signed by the Minister of Mines
and Energy, Mr. Alexis Stepanenko, expressed no opinion on the PCR. Set forth
below are their respective comments which have been edited as required. With
respect to quotations, words which have been added or changed are enclosed with

Results of the Project
1.             "The report finds that there were substantial variations in the
capacity expansion of the systems constituting the project under Loan 2565-BR
(Part I, "Evaluation Summary", p. iii; Part I, Chapter 5: "Implementation", p.
6, para. 5.06).  These findings are consistent with the [information] on the
projects presented by the beneficiaries through their respective tariff-planning
processes in the period 1986 to 1993.
2.             "The quality and number of the variations indicate too many large
deviations between the sub-projects as planned and completed, leading to the
sustainable conclusion that the [planning] criteria and the methodologies used
by the beneficiaries ought to be reviewed prior to the next projects which come
to be based on decisions relative to the management of the expansion of the
respective systems.
3.             "The  report  shows  considerable  gains  in  efficiency  [by  the
beneficiaries] as indicated by such indices as GWh sales per employee, customers
per employee, and reduced loss ratios (except for LIGHT; see Part I, Chapter 7,
Schedule 7.1, p. 11) . DNAEE interprets these results as being due to short-term
sector factors (such as the socio-economic context and policy) and not integrally
due to actions by the managements of the beneficiaries, as concluded by the
report.  This interpretation is justified by the fact that at the [same] time
when numbers of staff were being maintained or reduced by the beneficiaries,
there was an increase of payments to contracted third parties (see Annex 1 to
DNAEE comments). [For the beneficiaries,] the reduction of sales per customer
[between 1985 and 1992) reflects a small increase of customers relatively larger
than the increase of sales (see Annex 2 to DNAEE comments).  [The reduction does
not represent] the effect of the beneficiaries' marketing efforts directed toward
improving the efficiency of consumption.  However, it is true that the reduction
of the loss ratio is due to action carried out by the management of the
beneficiaries, especially the equipment, reinforcement, and expansion introduced
into the systems with the resources supplied by the Bank through Loan 2565-BR.
Institutional Performance
4.             "It is true that the Federal Government did not explicitly disavow
the [sector rehabilitation] plans, thereby expressing its implicit agreement with
contradictory action  ("Evaluation Summary",  pp.  iii and iv)-- [that is,  the



16
appro-val of] vigorous programs for investment which were in certain respects
unreal in the face of the performance of the market and of low and unstable
tariff levels which reflected the priority of national macroeconomic policy at
the expense of necessary tariff levels based on regulations specific to national
electric sector. However, the recurrence of the inflationary or recessionary
process of the economy should be considered in the period under analysis.  [Such
destabilizing events] occurred after each stabilization plan was adopted by the
Government (Cruzado Plan, 1986; Bresser Plan, 1987; and Summer Plan, 1989) --plans
principally based on freezing price indices; and these events caused various
frustrations in planning for expansion of the economy as a whole and certainly
for the market for electric energy.
5.             "The agreement of the Federal Government with [vigorous] investment
plans while at the same time establishing insufficient tariff levels was
certainly conditioned to the expectation that as each macroeconomic plan was
implemented, the adjustment of prices and tariffs was always foreseen in the
later stages, justifying thereby the expectation of economic and financial
equilibrium. That is to say, the mechanism of guaranteeing remuneration through
[an exchange of] credits of the beneficiaries [via] the Compensation Account
(CRC) represents a guarantee for compensation [to substitute for] insufficient
tariffs. The above considerations therefore explain in part the posture of the
Government with respect to its electricity tariff policy, but they do not excuse
the disastrous consequences to the beneficiaries. DNAEE agrees therefore that
the value and propriety of the Government with respect to the electric sector
declined increasingly (Part I, Chapter 8: "Institutional Performance: the
Government",  p.  12,  para.  8.05).    [In  fact,  the  Government]  surpassed
[reasonable] limits, including the expectation that the CRC mechanism for
compensation would be effective, in its action to restrain tariffs [in its
struggle] against inflation.
6.             "The disastrous institutional performance characterized in the
report is viewed by the Bank as a shortcoming of in the institutional model--
specifically the absence of an autonomous regulatory agency with sufficient
authority to sustain the application of tariff legislation without excessive
interference from the untimely, short-term changes of macroeconomic policy
("Evaluation Summary, p. iv; Part I, Chapter 9: "Lessons Learned: Sector
Lessons", p. 13, para. 9.04) . DNAEE agrees with this conclusion and understands
that the next step to which the Government ought to respond [is] helping to
establish an autonomous regulatory agency.   [The Government ought to]  lead
negotiations among various levels of government, state and Federal, and with
various consumer groups with a view to establishing a Council with sufficient
political backing to approve electricity tariff policy, based on which the power
companies would develop their tariff plans and policies. The Council ought to
be sustained by an Agreement between the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the
Ministry of Finance, the state governments, and consumer groups; and there should
be provision for intervention on the part of the World Bank as an observer.
DNAEE ought to be the executing agency for the Council, complementing its current
functions as sector regulator; and it ought to be thoroughly restructured with
respect to both human resources and its organization.

ELETROBRAS
Project Objectives:   'Starting with the first objective of the loan, we
observe that the expansion of the distribution system of the industrialized areas
of the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro was carried out with success and
within the time period agreed with the Bank, even though the tariff policy was
not adequate."
Authority of ELETROBRAS: "With respect to the position of ELETROBRAS within
the sector, we remember that its capacity to take action is limited, that it
controls only the Federal generating companies, while the distribution
concessionaires  are  under  the  control  of  their  shareholders,  the  state
governments.   ELETROBRAS also carries out its role as adviser to the Federal
Government for the establishment of long-term policies for sector expansion.
ELETROBRAS coordinates [the implementation of these policies] in participative
forums such as the Electric System Co-ordinating Planning Group.  All of the
power companies are members of this Group."
Recent Tariff Legislation.   "Concerning tariffs, we point out that, as a
relevant result of Law 8,631 of March 1993, [there] was a [tariff] increase of
10.1% as compared with 1992. Moreover, legislation permitted an equalization of
intra-sectoral arrears with signification compensation [through the exchange] of
debt between the power companies."
LIGHT
Note: To enhance their clarity, the comments of LIGHT have been edited,
summarized, and reorganized by subject.
Bank's Performance: Concerning project supervision by Bank missions, LIGHT
cited the first and second missions (January 1988 and January 1989, respectively)
as being particularly useful for the successful implementation of the project.
The mission of January 1988 familiarized the project task force at LIGHT with
Bank procedures; the mission of January 1989 provided good support to the task
force with respect to changing and modifying the project description and the
investment program. "The modification... allowed a significant change in the
profile of investments and quicker use of the loan funds." According to LIGHT,
under the modified project description, lower prices for under-ground cables were
obtained and additional substation equipment was purchased. LIGHT credited these
positive  results to the January 1989 mission.   During the subsequent four
supervision missions (1990-1992), the project was carried out as expected.
LIGHT noted that 24 months elapsed between the declaration of effectiveness
and date of the first supervision; and recommended that no more than one year
elapse between the declaration of effectiveness and the initial supervision,
given the special nature of the first mission: "....The nature of the first visit
should have been an appraisal of how the company [was] reacting to starting up
the project, which is quite different to a follow-up supervision. Perhaps the
maximum period of that first appraisal [first supervision mission] should have
been one year after the reloan (sic)."



19
Concerning procurement, LIGHT credited the Bank with good support in
amending the specifications for underground cables. This effort resulted in the
substitution of multiple tenderings and lower prices for a single tendering and
a high price. LIGHT was pleased with the results of international competitive
bidding which led, in its opinion, to reduced project costs.
LIGHT cited its unsuccessful effort to persuade the Bank to disqualify a
manufacturer with a continuing history of supplying defective equipment as
grounds for recommending that the Bank revisit the issue of the quality of the
equipment supplied versus the lowest price criterion.. "In our opinion, the Bank
should have disqualified [the supplier] based on its bidding documents, setting
a good example to the world market in terms of quality levels.... "   (The
implication of LIGHT's recommendation, it appears, is that the Bank should
establish standards for qualifying and disqualifying suppliers.)
Concerning  project  financing,   LIGHT  stated:   "Although  the  matter
of.. .counterpart [financing] had (sic) already been discussed at great length by
the Bank, we feel that this circumstance has very adversely affected the
performance of the Bank and of the beneficiary.    [An adequate  level  of
counterpart] financing of other important items of the project, besides the
equipment, should have accelerated it [project implementation] because its [the
project's] essential aim is to perform [carry out] works and not just to acquire
equipment. In LIGHT's case, the accelerated use of the loan funds put us in the
paradoxical situation of having an appreciable stock of equipment with the
consequent financial costs and a still deficient electricity system due to lack
of investments."
Concerning relations with the Bank, LIGHT noted that relations were good,
urged a continuation of the relation even after the loan closing date, and
recommended that the Bank maintain a list of qualified manufacturers. "We feel
that after the equipment begins operation, the Bank, should [monitor] the per-
formance of the equipment... to have feedback for its list of manufacturers ..."
LIGHT's Performance: Concerning project management, LIGHT judged positively
the performance of its project task force, which was created in September 1987
and charged with the responsibility for coordinating the activities of other
technical and financial departments with a view to keeping the physical
performance and utilization of the loan funds within the agreed schedules. "It
always worked for the national energy system as a whole.. .regard-less of
modification made to the company's administrative structure."   Based on its
positive experience with the project task force, LIGHT recommended considera-tion
of task forces for the management of future projects: "The setting up of a Task
Force (with the national energy system in mind) to manage the project and report
to the company's board on its progress, is a point which should be borne in mind
by all the beneficiaries."
Concerning difficulties leading to late project implementation, LIGHT cited
problems with respect to adapting its technical specifications to Bank standards.
To address this problem, LIGHT recommended that at appraisal the project
implementation schedule should reflect the time and effort required for such
adaptation.



20
Another problem delaying the project was the slow action by a government
agency with respect to the issuance of import licenses. In the first two years
of the project, there were delays of between four and five months: "On 1.12.88
we gave the Bank a list of permits being held up [by the agency] . The Bank felt
that the solution of problems of this kind should be sought first without the
Bank's participation."  (LIGHT dated the termination of this problem at the end
of 1987, but LIGHT may have meant the end of 1988.) To avoid this situation in
the future, LIGHT made no specific recommendation, but did point out that the
delay constituted a violation of Article III, Section 3.05 of the Guarantee
Agreement--the implication being that more vigorous effort on the part of the
Bank would have helped solve the problem sooner.
Concerning the proper balance between planned investment expenditure and
available financial resources, LIGHT noted that at appraisal that the
transmission lines and substations (Specific Projects--SPs) were included in the
Plan of Works to be Financed (POF), which were interrelated from the planning
point of view (Master Project), but that after the supervision of January 1989,
the POF '"...contained only EPs (sic.) that had financed equipment, which made it
easier to manage the project as a whole." LIGHT noted that its POF never exceeded
25% of its general investment program (PGI) .  It also remarked: "If the Bank
begins financing other important items of the project, apart from the equipment,
the companies may carry out POFs closer to their PGIs." (This last remark may
be a recommendation that the Bank financing should extend to local-currency
items.)
CPFL
Note: The first three parts of its four-part commentary are not included in Part
II, as they repeat or correct factual data already covered in Parts I and III.
Set forth below is a translation of the fourth part which appears to recommend
that, in the event of delayed effectiveness, the Bank should assist in identify-
ing alternative financing--say--bridge" loans from other lenders.
Bank's Performance. "1. During its evolution, implementation, and up to the
completion of the project, there were issued by CPFL 296 applications for
disbursements, which were confirmed and approved by the Bank through 'Payment
Advices' as shown below:

1993         10     1,390
Total       296    52,367
As we can observe from the above data, the larger column of disbursements
occurred in 1990, 1991 and 1992--the total value being US$32.166 million.
"2. The table below demonstrates that with respect to future financing,
there ought to be greater agility at the the beginning of the project in order
to use the foreseen resources in their totality, avoiding thereby the use of [the
borrower's or beneficiary's] resources and maintaining their availability [to the
borrower or the beneficiary].

"3. CPFL received prompt attention (from the Bank] in connection with
its requests to use loan proceeds earmarked for consultant studies to pay for
purchases of materials, provided that CPFL carried out the studies with its own
human resources."
ELETROPAULO
International Competitive Bidding. "In spite of the difficulties due to
frequent changes in the politics and economy of the country, during the
effectiveness of the loan (1986-1992), international bidding for material and
equipment was planned and executed in a satisfactoy manner and in a fashion such
that all of the line of credit was available. Also, we want to point out that
3 The above annual data for the years 1988-1991 are not in agreement with Bank records (Part III, TabLe 4), which show the
following annual disbursements (in USS miLlions): 1988: 6.800; 1989: 6.923; 1990: 14.009; and 1991: 6.726. Notwithstanding the
annual differences, totaL disbursements (USS52.367 miLlion) as recorded in Bank and beneficiary records are the same. Differing
dates on the "Payment Advices" and corresponding Bank records probably account for the differing annual data.



22
the practice of international competitive bidding [for contracts] financed by the
Bank led to major competition between national and international suppliers, the
result being good prices and advantageous purchases by ELETROPAULO."
Value of New Bank Loans.   "We also wish to affirm that obtaining new
loans from the Bank would be of great value to ELETROPAULO, taking accounting of
past successes and the availability of personnel trained for the execution of the
processes of acquisition and subsequent related steps."

Identified in May 1983, the predecessor to the project--the so-catLed "Energy Substitution Project"--consisted of sub-
transmission and distribution works needed in connection with a Goverrwnent program to promote the substitution of excess
electrical energy for imported oil. Due to the introduction of a special, low tariff and the rapid acceptance of the program by
industrial customers, the operating companies stopped considering investments to advance the program. In these circumstances,
the Government shifted its discussions with the Bank to the more general problems of the sector. With the help of the Bank, the
Government revised (and reduced) the sector investment program to take account of financial constraints and to reflect the
minimum investment needed to meet expected growth at acceptable levels of reliability. This revision had the objective of
developing a comprehensive strategy for addressing the technical and financial probLerms of the sector; it later included a
corresponding financing plan. Given the new priorities of the expansion program, the Bank and ELETROBRAS reformulated the
proposed project as a normal distribution project for high-priority regions: Sao Paulo, Campinas, and Rio de Janeiro.

2/ The forecast sub-project cost data shown above is taken from p. 24 of the SAR, Southeast Distribution Project
(Report No.5578b-BR, dated May 13, 1985) and reflect price contingencies based on a seven-year disbursement
period and a loan closing date of December 31, 1992. The SAR also contains a cost forecast of US$570.1 million,
based on a four-year disbursement period ending in 1989 (p. 64, Annex 4.2.2). The difference between the two
forecasts is due to differing amounts for price contingencies--that is, the longer disbursement period, the
larger the price contingency.  Comparison of the actual cost with the cost forecast based on the seven-year
disbursement period is appropriate because both values share the same loan closing date.

2/ LIGHT furnished slightly different actual values (in US cents): 1985: 1.44; 1986: 1.59; 1988: 2.35; 1989: 2.10; 1990: 2.87;
and 1991: 2.96.
3/ As per "Financial Indicators", Annex 5.2.4, Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 5578b-BR), dated May 13, 1985.
Above ratio, which was computed on the basis of financial projections, is not the same value as that appearing in
Annex 4.3.4, "Performance Indicators", which   shows values of li.x for 1984 5, 1.2x for 1986,  etc., to 1.5x for 1990.
The basis for these values is not apparent in the financial projections.
4/ LIGHT furnished slightly different actual ratios for the collection period in 1987 (44.0) and for the operating
ratios for 1985 amd 1986--respectively 86.6% and 91.1%.
5/ As per "Financial Indicators", Annex 5.2.4, SAR. Ratios were computed on the basis of financial projections. LIGHiT
furnished values, actual and forecast, which differ slightly from those shown above perhaps because of the
use of a formula other than the appraisal formula. For example, for the years 1987-1992, according to LIGHT, the
actual and forecast annual ratios should be: 1987: 46.4 and 36.8; 1988: 44.9 and 31.7; 1989: 49.7 and 26.0; 1990:
29.8 and 19.8; 1991: 27.8; and 1992: 31.7.

of financial rehabilitation. In
1986, the Bank and the Govern-
ment agreed on a Power Sector
Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP) in
connection with Loan 2720-BR
(SECAL). In years 1987-1989,
Bank and Government did not
agree on revised PSRP and terms
for second SAL. In 1990, the
Bank approved Loan 3227-BR (a
sector investment loan) based on
related Rate Adjustment Plan
(RAP);however, loan agreement
remained un-signed for 22 months
and financial situation of the
power sector deteriorated. As
prospects for implementing RAP
were dim, Bank withdrew Loan
3227-BR on April 20, 1992. At
the end of the year, Loan 2565-BR
closed on schedule and the Bank
did not agree to extend the closing
date of Loan 2564-BR, as
requested.
