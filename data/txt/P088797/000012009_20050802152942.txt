vhicih are incffectve. There is also no valid monitoring mechanism   to verify
complpanicc tO ag-rced norms and practices. A survcy carned otu in 2001 to assess
health care waste management in health facilities in Ghana showed that wastc
managcment practices were below acceptalle standards and1 poscd nisks to staff and
counniLlities. Kycy findings of that survey ilclude:
o  .\bscncc of a national po1icy   ind guidelines and   standard opcating
prloccdurct-s
o  Different systerms in place for xvastc segregation
o  No colouir coding in place and wvasrc \v\erc not la,ibelled;
o  (;ontaincrs for wvastc were unaccepta)blc and not standardized.
O \'chic]Ls for transporting waste wer-e inadcquate;
o  Storage sitcs for waste wVithiln tlc facilities wcre open, accessible to
unatrhorised persons and an.imals, brecdjng grounds for flies, rodents and
other insecrs;
o  l;inal dlisposal of waste was unacccptable; burying and open burning were tht
notll andc in somc cases infectious zwaste was dumped on  peIn groundls.
lII orderl. to addr(eiss these shortfalls, rinc i\ltstr of I-lcaltli set ulp a wvorking grolup
madec ul of sakcholders in the sector, borih public and( private to devclop a policV

1.2 Objectives of the Policy and Guidelines

I     npursuit of thle  poLicies set oUt in the preceditng sections, tiie technuical
guidelints provided below shall apply.
4.1 Classification of Health Care Waste
IHcalrh care waste includes all untreated solid and liquid waStC (botih hazardous
and non-hazardous) generated during the administration of medical carc, or thc
performance of miedlical research involving humans and animals. flhse include
infectious, pathological, radioactive, pharmaccutical and othel 1IazltdoULs wastes.
Gcneralk-, bcttween 75-90% of the waste produced by healti-cire providers is
non-risk or "general" health-carc wvasic, comparable to dloilCstic wvaste.  The
reIllaininllg( 10-25"9,) of health care wastc is regarceCI as haza'dIus.  Thes
gLuidelinIes there-fore identify r%vo broad catcgorics of licalhti carie w<aste. Ihest:
arc:
1. (lneral or non-hazardous waste not contaminaitlerd with    ulooid, body
fluids, or otiher harmful agents or materials (also referrcd to as domlecstic
or muinicipal wastes) such as paper, falbrics, glass, food treSidUtS and
contaimcrs:
2. Wastes considered hazardous dut to tileir risk of creating a variety of
lhcalth risks as a result of theit actual or presumed biological, chiemical
and!/or radioactive contaruniauon.  Due to their potentially hazardous
nature, these wastes require care from the poinit of generation utiul Final
dis posal.
'thc classification systern adopted is based on the point of generation, mtnthod of
Storage and thie treatmcnt options available, as showvn in 'fablc 1. rhese
categories are a geneval guide and are not meant to be all-inclusive and sp ecific
to all situations that may be encountered inl a health care facilit. Iherefore, as
questionable situations arise, each health care facility must decide if a partcular
device, material or substance slhould be regarded as hazardous \vaste, based on

4.2.3 Colour Coding:
Colour coding of waste containers and plasuLc bags should he used to facilitatc

'I'hc rcco (mmenlded colour-coding schemne for Ghana (adapted from \W1HO) is as
follows:

YELLO\XW     hnfectious waste (c.g. sharps, paticnt xvaste (e.g. s\\al)s. drcssin,gs

BROWN        1-lazAlr_dous \vasre (c.g. expired drugs, vaccines, chenmicals etc)
Table 2 shows the colour coding for the storage medium an d transportatioln ot

or matclh with the waste contailers both at the internal and exterrnal storage sites.

to obtain the widest possiblc support including financial commnitment and the
development of a legal framework. Feature articles in the print media drawing kcy
messages from the findings of the study should be published. This is necessary, for
wvhlpping up the multi-scctor collaboration and financial support that is required for
tihc success of the programme. There slhould also be media encountIrs, all in an
effort to move health care waste management to the top of our priorities. We ought
to bc saying that if we cannot handle the waste that wegenerate izn the process of crinfg oulrpeople
an1d this can become a serious sozirce of health problems, then our people are betle,' off withoutl a
health .ystem. Our health i'stition; shorlold be safeplatces to (cquire uwe-not infections.
To secure the cornuitment of pnivate health institutions, the MOH slhould involve
themn tlhrough their respective trade associations, in programs meant to implemcnT
the policy. The implementation of the policy has financial implications for health
insutunons, which may tend to be a disincentive in the face of scarce resourccs. The
pilvate healtlh institutions in particular should bc encouraged to participatc in tile
trainillg pr  an-ims that the i\IH- wvill orgaillse for thle 11ealth insitutic)ns tnder cost
sharing arrangements. The assistance of development partners, NGOs and other
civil society organizations should be sought in orclcr to reduce the financial burden
on the institutions at least at the bcginruing. In thc long tern, more durable solutionls
to the funding problem that are consistent xviti the existing cost recoveny polic
should be explored.
''lie advocacy program should also encourage health care training institurions to
include health care waste management into their curticula. All efforts should1 be
made to inform and educate key stakeholders in order to achiieve unity of purposc
and action.   These efforts should include insti tions that arc responsible for
approving newv health institutions, e.g. Private Hospitals and Maternity  lomes
Board, to ensure that tley insist otn dte health care waste management readincss of
newv institutions in terms of facilities, humnan resources, plans and othler aspects of
capacity to deliver. The same rigorous standards should be maintained in the
monitoting of existing institutions and sanctions should include the withdra al of
certihcates until the relevant shortfalls are corrected.
