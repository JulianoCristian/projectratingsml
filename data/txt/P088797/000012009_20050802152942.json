It\n            identifies the persons who will likely risk contamination\n            from accidental injury and subsequent infection by\n            pathological agents - especially the agents causing HIV -\n            through sharp objects, or other. Incinerator operators are\n            especially vulnerable to chronic respiratory ailments, and\n            cancers resulting from dust and toxic substances caused by\n            combustion. There is also the minor risk of odors from\n            biomedical wastes accumulating. The report points out that\n            not only medical personnel are at risk from biomedical\n            wastes, but the entire population, particularly children\n            playing in dump sites, and without protection, and\n            maintenance workers who are exposed to un-segregated wastes.\n            It focuses particularly on health care waste management. The\n            method used for waste disposal - whether buried, incinerated\n            or released into surface or underground waters - will\n            determine the level and type of hazard posed to the\n            environment. Hence possible risks include air, water, and\n            soil pollution/contamination (e.g., toxic gases produced\n            from burnt plastics - dioxin, chloro-benzene and other\n            carcinogens). The report recommends that liquid biomedical\n            waste be disinfected with chlorine solutions in specific\n            concentrations, and be stored in stabilization, or septic\n            tanks where they should biodegrade. The report weighs the\n            risks, and benefits of using various options for solid waste\n            disposal, including chemical disinfection, sanitary burial\n            in stages, burial within the confines of the hospital\n            grounds, and incineration. Waste management may be improved\n            by building the capacity for training the public, medical\n            professionals, and sanitation workers in hygienic practices;\n            providing equipment for adequate waste collection storage,\n            and transport; providing protective gear; installing a\n            system to separate biomedical waste from ordinary garbage;\n            installing incinerators in hospitals and health centers; and\n            establishing laws, rules and procedures for waste management."}, "docdt": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
