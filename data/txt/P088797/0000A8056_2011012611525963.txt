                         Implementation Status Overview
                          This is a 5-year project, with the objective to increase access to HIV care, prevention and impact mitigation services for high risk groups, vulnerable populations and the general

                         population. The Project started in 2006 and will close in June 2011.
                          The project generally supported annual Program of Works proposed by GAC and agreed between GAC and its partners. Most targets aimed at for the end of project are not
                         achieved, some show an improved situation, and some show the situation having become worse-off.
                         However, the sectoral indicators for the country are starting to show some achievements, especially for the transmission rate from mother to children.
                         However, much of the project's intention was to reduce high-risk behavior especially among the vulnerable groups, including the youth. The Project was supposed to concentrate its
                         effort in the final year of the project on defining and supporting a strategy targeting the Youth, and on behavioral change communication. However, the project in unlikely to show
                         results by project closing.
                         The project also aimed to improve engagement of the private not-for-profit sector. Generally, the Project under the GAC has outsourced much of the project implementation to non-
                         government organizations (NGOs). The progress of how and where the resources were used by the NGOs will be reported through the technical and financial audit that will be
                         conducted by consultants recruited through GAC in early 2011. The findings of the audits will be key to understanding project performance.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           During the final year of the project, the GAC is to conduct an evaluation of the project, to provide some evidence and documentation on what the project was able to achieve and

                         what hurdles and challenges it faced in achieving some of the objectives stated in the project design.
                         The Project is to conduct a financial and technical audit of the project implementing agencies in late 2010 - early 2011.
                         The next review will be in early 2011, and the mission intends to visit the beneficiaries, people living with HIV-AIDS, and visit NGOs and local government to understand better what
                         they feel the project has offered to them.
                         The Bank and Government are to prepare the project implementation completion report (ICR) in March-April 2011.
                         The project will close in June 2011.
