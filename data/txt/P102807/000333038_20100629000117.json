The changes will reallocate the\n            savings from the cancelled $2.1 million procurement of Avian\n            Influenza vaccines to provide laboratory equipments for a\n            Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory facility at the ministry\n            of agriculture. Savings from cancelled procurement of\n            vaccination equipment and from other completed contracts add\n            up to additional savings of about $1.1 million. It is that\n            the additional savings will be used to procure motorcycles\n            and information technology equipment (laptop computers,\n            internet connection, faxes) for the benefit of local\n            veterinary clinics to enhance their capacity for disease\n            management, surveillance, and reporting."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
