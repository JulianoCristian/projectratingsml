1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
·
Egypt has felt the greatest impact of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) 
within the MENA region.  
·
The disease was first reported in February, 2006 in Upper Egypt at several 
backyard poultry farms. On March 20, the first human case of HPAI was 
confirmed near Cairo.  
·
The virus spread extremely rapidly to encompass most of the country within 3 
months.  
·
A
large number of infections likely went unreported.  
·
The World Bank has the funds and capacity to provide Egypt with technical 
expertise, advice, and assistance on HPAI contingency responsiveness.  
 
2. Proposed objective(s) 
 
The overall development objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed to human health 
and poultry in Egypt by HPAI infection and other zoonoses in domestic poultry, and to prepare 
for, control and respond to an influenza pandemic and other infectious disease emergencies in 
humans. 
 
3. Preliminary description 
 
Priority activities would consist of the following components: (1) Improved Disease 
Management and Surveillance; (2) Review of Regulatory and Legal Framework of Veterinary 
Services; (3) Improved Cairo Laboratory Services Capacity: the Central Laboratory for Quality

Control of Poultry Production; and (4) Project Management Unit. The project would provide a 
large amount of funds to purchase animal vaccines to support vaccination programs aimed at 
backyard poultry farms.
