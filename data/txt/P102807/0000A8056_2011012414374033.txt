                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To date, most project activities have been successfully completed. The only major exception was the poultry vaccination campaign, which was canceled in 2009 due to doubts about
                         the effectiveness of vaccination in the poultry backyard sector. This cancellation created unexpected savings of about $3.3 million (approx. 45% of the total budget). The project was
                         restructured in June 2010 to allow re-allocation of remaining funds: $2.1 million were allocated to the CLQP for the establishment of a Biosafety Level Three (BSL-3) laboratory

                         Given the complexity of the technical issues related to the BSL-3 lab, the CLQP has been very cautious in making a final decision on the design of the BSL-3 lab, particularly in light

                         BSL-3 lab and is currently in the process of launching the procedures to procure the BSL-3 lab.
