Lessons address the\n            following. Concerning water supply and sewerage services,\n            risk analysis should precede project implementation, focused\n            more on the risks that sufficient raw water might not be\n            available. In turn, an appropriate analysis of these supply\n            risks must put greater emphasis on the broader issues of\n            water resources management, and on identifying the\n            least-cost sequence of developing different supply schemes,\n            including consideration to a low-cost supply for providing\n            base load, and a higher-cost supply which can be mobilized\n            when \"Peak Demand\" needs to be met. Second, an\n            analysis should be done to track the effective capacity of\n            each component in the supply/distribution chain, in order to\n            identify any bottlenecks, and then remove them. As a result\n            of the failure to undertake such an analysis, Chennai seems\n            to have over-invested in treatment capacity, and\n            underinvested in the distribution system and in metering.\n            Third, the reliance on private sub-contractors, demands much\n            of Metrowater's ability to supervise not only the cost\n            of outsourced services, but also the quality provided by the\n            sub-contractors. It would thus be prudent to invest more in\n            training Metrowater staff in monitoring, and controlling its\n            private sub-contractors, particularly with respect to the\n            proper maintenance of the outsourced facilities. In\n            particular, Metrowater would be well advised to prepare for\n            the introduction of metering for domestic consumers."}, "docdt": "2004-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
