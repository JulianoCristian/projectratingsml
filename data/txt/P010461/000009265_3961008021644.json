of all metropolitan areas in India and great\n            susceptibility to drought. The project's major\n            objectives are to: 1) provide water from a reliable source\n            within the State to Madras on an urgent basis; 2) improve\n            the distribution of water within Madras; and 3) strengthen\n            conservation. The project will consist of the following: 1)\n            source works at the existing Veeranam irrigation tank to the\n            south of Madras; 2) a transmission pipeline from Veeranam to\n            Madras, a distance of 235 km, with associated treatment and\n            pumping facilities; 3) continuation of distribution\n            improvements within Madras being undertaken in the First\n            Madras Supply Project; 4) a water conservation program\n            including physical works such as leak detection and repairs\n            and tariff increases to encourage more efficient use of\n            water; and 5) technical assistance in the form of project\n            preparation and implementation support. Adequate steps will\n            be taken to ensure people adversely affected benefit from\n            the project where this is possible and otherwise are made no\n            worse off as a result. To remove possible farmer resistance\n            to the proposals at Veeranam, a new regime to regulate the\n            flow has been introduced following consultation under which\n            the irrigation flows will exceed those that would otherwise\n            have occurred."}, "docdt": "1995-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
