We are pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees with the proposed restructuring of the Project,

2002.
The proposed restructuring of the Project has been discussed between representatives of the 
Ministry of Transport, Departamento Nacional de Infra-Estrutura de Transportes (DNIT), Agência

the term "Authorized Allocation" means the amount of $30,000,000, or such other

shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the amount of $15,000,000 until the 
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal 
to or exceed the amount of $125,000,000.
2.
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been duly 
opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special 
Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a 
request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed 
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank 
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to the

for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.

Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special 
Account:

was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall,

Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
