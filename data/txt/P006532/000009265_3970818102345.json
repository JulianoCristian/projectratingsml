objective is to improve\n            and maintain the serviceability of the main highway network\n            on a sustainable basis, with a view to reducing road\n            transport costs. Specific objectives are to: 1) rehabilitate\n            federal highways; 2) decentralize highway responsibilities\n            to state governments; 3) increase the participation of the\n            private sector in the management and financing of highways\n            through concessions and maintenance management contracts;\n            and 4) strengthen the capabilities of the National Roads\n            Department and the State Road Departments to prepare,\n            contract and monitor efficient network rehabilitation and\n            maintenance programs and highway concession projects. The\n            project will consist of three main components: (a) highway\n            decentralization, including: (i) technical assistance and\n            training services; and (ii) state rehabilitation\n            subprojects; (b) highway concession development, including:\n            (i) technical assistance and training services; and (ii)\n            concession studies; and (c) federal highway comprising: (i)\n            technical assistance and training services; and (ii) federal\n            rehabilitation subprojects."}, "docdt": "1997-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
