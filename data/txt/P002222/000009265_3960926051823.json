Specifically,\n            it aims to strengthen institutions involved in the water\n            supply subsector, establish cost recovery mechanisms  for\n            safe water and support a program to rehabilitate rural water\n            supply systems.  To this end, the project intends to provide\n            (a) an institutional component with technical assistance and\n            training, to reinforce the General Directorate of Water\n            (GDW), as well as the communes and the users associations.\n            It also includes (b) a national program utilising \"line\n            of credit financing\" for rehabilitation, operation and\n            maintenance of existing rural water supply systems\n            throughout the country. The first-year work program is\n            expected to be ready about the time of credit effectiveness.\n            The communes will carry out the sub-projects pertaining to\n            their communities, with assistance from local\n            non-governmental organizations. Lastly, the project involves\n            (c) specific investments for the rehabilitation and\n            expansion of seven water supply systems in the Lava Region\n            (North-West Rwanda).  Benefits under the proposed project\n            are expected to result in improvements in the productivity\n            and well-being of the rural population throughout Rwanda."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
