MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATTON OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
On a Proposed Credit to Rwanda for a Second Water Supply Project
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Rwanda for
SDR 11.9 million (US$15.0 million equivalent) Is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance the
development of rural water supply in Rwanda. Cofinancing would be provided by
CCCE (US$16.0 million), AfDF (US$12.5 million), BADEA (US$7.25 million), Austria
(US$7.00 million), Switzerland (US$8.3 million) and UNDP (US$0.7 million).
2.        Rwanda has a solid record of development achievements in the
post-independence period but faces deep-seated problems mostly related to the
pressures of population on scarce land resources. Rwanda's population of 6.0
million or 230 persons per km2 makes it the most densely settled country in
continental Africa. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy contributing 46%
of GDP, 83% of the total value of exports and employing 952 of the population.
About 5.7 million people (95% of the total population) are scattered in rural
areas in small hamlets of less than 300 inhabitants. Many travel long distances
daily to obtain water, as much as 10-15 km in the highest part of the Lava
Region. The purpose of the project is to provide them with safe water at less
than 1 km.
The Water Supply Sector
3.        Responsibilities for rural water supply are with the General
Directorate of Water (GDW), established in January 1984, withiu the Ministry of
Public Works and Energy. Water Supply in urban centers is the responsibility of
Electrogaz, the national water and electricity company, beneficiary of the First
Water Supply Project (Credit 1345-RW). Under this project, an institutional
study for rural water supply was carried out. Its recommendations for new
institutional and cost recovery policies have been approved by the Government on
November 15, 1985, and would be implemented through the project.
4.        The recently adopted national policy for the rural water supply sector
is based on the following principles: (i) at the lowest level (a group of
standpipes), users associations would be established prior to carrying out works
to decide on the system design, organise participation in the
rehabilitation/extension and to operate and maintain the facilities; (ii) at the
next level the comune would have responsibility, through a communal water
committee, for supervising the operation and maintenance of facilities within
the commune boundaries. This communal water committee will be composed of
representatives of users associations and of commune officials; (iii) a system
of water charges would oe established at the communal level payable by all
beneficiary families to cover operation, maintenance and renewal costs. These
water charges would be collected by the users associations; and (iv) a National
fund for Rural Water Supply (NFRWS) would be created, as a specialized window of
the existing Communal Development Fund (CDF) to finance rehabilitation or
construction of rural water supply systems. NFRWS is intended to become the
principal channel for all funding to the rural water supply sector.



-2-
Project Obiectives
5.        The main objectives of the project: are (i) to strengthen the
institutions, including the legal framework, involved in the rural water supply
sub-sector; (ii> to establish cost recovery mechanisms for safe, self-sustaining
systems of supply; and (iII) to support a program to rehabilitate rural water
supply systems and implement recently adopted institutional dnd cost recovery
policies throughout the country, concentrating initially in the Lava Region
where there are no alternative sources of supply.
Project Description
6.        The project would include:
(a) an institutional component with technical assistance and
training, to reinforce the General Directorate of Water (GDW), as
well as the communes and the users associations, in order to
implement the new policy;
(b) a national program utilising "line of credit financing" for
rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of existing rural water
supply systems throughout the country. Priority works would be
selected from a national inventory, based upon agreed criteria.
The first-year work program is expected to be ready about the
time of credit effectiveness. The communes would carry out the
sub-projects pertaining to their communities, with assistance
from local NGO's; and
(c) specific investments for the rehabilitation and expansion of
seven water supply systems in the Lava Region (North-West
Rwanda).
7.        The project would be implemented over a six-year period.  The total
project cost is estimated at US$72.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$45.4 million (63%). Several cofinanciers would participate in
the project (see schedule A). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement and
a disbursement schedule are shown in schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Rwanda are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6602-RW dated
March 31, 1987 and including a map of Rwanda is also attached. A Project
Preparation Facility of US$0.5 million (to be refinanced under the Credit) has
been arranged to facilitate initiation of project activities, including studies
and technical assistance.
Rationale for Bank involvement
8.        The dialogue on the organization and financing of rural water supply
systems has progressed through the first water supply project, (Credit 1345-RW),
The Bank was a leading participant at a UNDP-sponsored Round Table meeting
convened in Kigali in January 1986 to discuss the findings of the institutional
study, which developed the new sectoral policy based on users participation and
cost recovery. The discussions provided a valuable opportunity to promote donor
coordination and to foster support for politically difficult decisions,



especially the nationwide introduction of cost recovery measures that, thus far,
have only been applied locally. It is Important for the Bank to retain an
effective presence in rural water supply as Rwanda embarks on these sectoral
adjustments.
Agreed Actions
9.        In the course of project preparation, agreement was reached on several
key technical, institutional and finanuial issues. Appropriate covenants have
been incorporated in the legal documents. The most Important actions are
conditions of effectiveness: (1) creation of a National fund for Rural Water
Supply as a special account of the existing Communal Development Fund and
initial deposit by GOR of US$0.2 million equivalent (10% of estimated annual
expenditures); (2) establishment and staffing of the project coordination unit
for the Lava Region; and (3) fulfillment of conditions precedent to
effectiveness of other loans and grants provided by cofinanciers except for
UNDP. Other actions have been agreed: (1) establishment of a consultative
donors committee for the overall supervision of the project with representatives
of all cofinanciers; (2) amendment of GDW's organization; (3) submission to IDA
every year during project implementation for its review of a three-year rural
water supply investment program and of GDW's proposed annual budget for the
following fiscal year, and their finalization based upon this review; and (4)
annual review of water charges by the Government to ensure that they are
sufficient to cover operation, maintenance and renewal costs.
Justification
10.       Benefits under the proposed project would consist in improvements in
the productivity and well-being of the rural population throughout Rwanda
resulting from (i) time savings, mainly for women; and (ii) better health by
provision of safe water. The project would also have a significant
institutional impact and would mobilize resources for the sub-sector through (1)
Improved efficiency in GDW's operations; (1i) institutional decentralization of
responsibilities for water systems to the communal level; and (iii)
implementation of a cost recovery policy for operation, maintenance and renewal
of the facilities. Finally, over the medium term, it would help draw people
away from encroaching on a national nature reserve in search of water by
providing reliable supply closer to settlements.
Risks
11.       The major project risks are institutional and financial and are
related to (i) the capacity of the communes, helped by users associations to
operate and maintain the water facilities and (ii) the capacity of the
benefitting population to cover the cost. To minimize these risks, substantial
efforts would be required to sensitize the population as to the necessity to pay
for safe water and extensive training programs for GDW's and communal staff.
Measures included in the project to minimize risk are the participation of the
benefitting population to the construction and the operation and maintenance of
the distribution facilities, with the help of technical assistance and of NGO's.
Recommendation
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Credit.
