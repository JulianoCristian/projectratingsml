The lessons learned indicate that significant\n            time is required to develop a model. Building blocks of\n            local processes and clear rules for decision making had been\n            instituted in the first Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)\n            but required continuing development. Continuing leadership\n            from a recognized change agent remains important even as\n            local units and communities become more empowered.\n            Approaches need to be flexible and responsive to local\n            differences. Monitoring and evaluation systems need plenty\n            of time to develop and to demonstrate their usefulness at\n            the local and central levels. Standard economic and social\n            indicators may not be significantly sensitive to changes at\n            the community level; alternative measures may need to be\n            developed. Creating a climate of accountability among public\n            and private entities is a long-term venture. Specialized\n            expertise is needed for specific types of subproject\n            support. Loan financing of subprojects is an important tool\n            for financial sustainability. Even the most disadvantaged\n            communities have untapped stores of local vision and\n            leadership that can be mobilized through flexible and\n            responsive approaches."}, "docdt": "2004-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
