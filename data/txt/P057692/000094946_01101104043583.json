development objective of the\n            Second Magdalena Medio Regional Development Project, is to\n            test new forms of managing, and operating the Program for\n            Development and Peace in the region, to unravel a more\n            influential citizenry, able to rely on responsive local\n            institutions, and able to enjoy tangible socioeconomic\n            benefits. Project components will: 1) support the\n            Corporation for Development and Peace Magdalena Medio's\n            program leadership role, by covering its core costs, and\n            incremental costs of offices, consultant services, and\n            related training, equipment, and operating costs. The\n            program will increase the role of community organizations,\n            will take into account the regional diversity, particularly\n            the armed conflict, and, will gradually decrease dependence\n            on the Corporation, who will transfer capacity, and\n            decision-making to regional organizations; 2) strengthen\n            local, and regional institutions, to improve accountability,\n            with particular attention to municipalities, by developing\n            information databases, and developing groups capacity to\n            influence policies, plans, and programs within the municipal\n            administration, with particular attention to the health\n            sector; 3) identify productive subprojects, concerning\n            improvements in small peasant farming practices, development\n            of agro-industrial projects, and small businesses, aiming at\n            employment, an income generation, supported by technical\n            assistance, and training; and, 4) finance social subprojects\n            in vulnerable communities, addressing food security, primary\n            health care, and basic education."}, "docdt": "2001-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
