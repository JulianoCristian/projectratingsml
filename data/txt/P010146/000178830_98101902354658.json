        the economy. The Project will permit power from\n            hydroelectric stations now under construction to reach\n            consumers and includes primary transmission,\n            subtransmission, and distribution works. Also included are\n            consulting services to review management performance and to\n            assist with preparation of engineering design for\n            transmission works from the hydroelectric stations which are\n            being developed under the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga\n            Development Program, and training. The Project faces no\n            unusual risks."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
