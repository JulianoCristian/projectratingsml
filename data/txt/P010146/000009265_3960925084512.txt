PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(CR. 1048-CE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Power Project
in Sri Lanka, for which Credit 1048-CE in the amount of US$19.5 million was
approved on June 19, 1980. The credit was closed on March 31, 1988, three
years behind schedule. The last disbursement was on October 3, 1988 and the
undisbursed balance of US$0.55 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division, Country
Department 1, of the Asia Region.
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's supervision mission of
the ongoing power projects in February 1989, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, and correspondence between IDA and the Borrower. The
Borrower provided information required for the preparation of Part III of the
PCR. The comments of the Borrower on Parts I and III of the PCR have been
incorporated in the final report. The lorrower did not complete Part II as
requested.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(CR. 1048-CE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objective
The main objective of the project was to assist the Ceylon Electricity
Board (CEB) to augment and reinforce its transmission and distribution
facilities to meet increasing demand and improve the quality of supply
(para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
Project implementation experienced long delays, necessitating extension
of the credit closing date by three years. The main reasons for the project
slippages included: (i) delays in finalizing the cofinancing arrangement;
(ii) protracted internal procurement processing; (iii) poor performance of
contractors; (iv) weak project management; and (v) occurrence of civil
disturbances (para 5.1).
Project Results
The project's primary objective was achieved. Except for two sub-
components, all project components were completed. Implementation of a
decentralized organization structure for CEB was completed in early 1987 (para
6.1).
Project Sustainability
Being part of the utility's least-cost investment program, the project
will maintain r. steady level of net benefits throughout its economic life.
Given the Governmer.t's commitment towards enabling CEB to achieve a minimum 8%
rate of return on revalued net fixed assets, CEB is expected to maintain a
sound financial position (paras 7.1 and 7.2).
Findings and Lessons Learned
T1- importance of conducting a thorough review during project appraisal
of the constraints facing project implementation and the project entity's
project management capacity cannot be over-stressed. Technical assistance
should be incorporated in the project scope to address identified
deficiencies. Also, advance procurement actions . ld be initiated in view
of the protracted nature of the .orrower's internal procurement processing
procedure (para. 8.1).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.   Project Identity
Project Name:        Sixth Power Project
Credit No.:          1048-CE
RVP Unit:            Asia
Country:             Sri Lanka
Sector:              Energy
Subsector:           Power
2.   Background
2.1  Sri Lanka has few indigenous resources.  The major indigenous resources
are hydropower and fuelwood. There are no known hydrocarbon reserves. The
hydropower potential is estimated to be about 2,300 MW, with an energy
Dotential of about 6,600 GWh a year under average hydrological conditions. In
1980, installed hydro-generating capacity was 331 MW. Per capita energy
consumption in 1980 was about 232 kg of oil equivalent, 68% of which was
supplied by fuelwood and agricultural residues, 29% by imported petroleum
products and 3% by hydropower.
2.2 The country's substantial dependence on imported energy and its high cost
since 1973 strongly influenced the Government of Sri Lanka's (GOSL) energy
sector policy, the principal objectives of which are to: (a) develop domestic
hydropower resources to reduce the country's dependence on imported oil; and
(b) improve the access to, and quality of, electricity supply throughout the
country. To accord with this policy, GOSL has given high priority to the
development of the power subsector. The centerpiece of hydropower development
was the Accelerated Mahaweli Program (AMP), which added 533 MW generating
capacity to the national grid (Victoria, 210 MW; Kotmale, 201 MW; and
Randenigala, 122 MW) during 1984-1988.
2.3 The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), formed in 1969, is a statutory
corporation with responsibility for the generation, transmission and, to a
major extent, the distribution of electricity in Sri Lanka. In 1980, CEB's
total installed generating capacity was 421 MW, comprisirng 331 MW
hydroelectric plants and 90 MW thermal plants. In parallel with the
development of hydropower plants constructed under the AMP, CEB is the
executing agency for the complementary investments required to augment and
reinforce its transmission and distribution systems in order to meet the
increasing demand for electricity.
2.4 The Bank Group's involvement in the power subsector started with a loan
of US$19.1 million (Loan 101-CE) in 1954 to help filnance a 25 MW expansion of
the Laksapana hydroelectric scheme. To date, the Bank Group has financed Len
operations in the power subsector, of which eight have been completed. The



2
Sixth Power Project and the four subsequent lending operations are consistent
with the Bank Group's strategy for the Sri Lankan power subsector, aimed at
supporting efforts to ensure the efficient development of the subsector to
meet demand at least cost. The Sixth Power Project initiated organizational
reforms in CEB to strengthen its planning, operational a i financial
management capabilities. Also, under the same project a tariff study was
carried out and a 8% rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets was
set as a financial objective for CEB, which provides a useful broad indicator
for cost recovery and has been the driving force behind the various tariff
adjustments implemented by GOSL since 1981.
3.   Project Objectives and Description
3.1 The main objective of the project was to assist CEB to augment and
reinforce its transmission and distribution facilities to meet increasing
demand and improve the quality of supply. The project comprised a four-year
time slice (1981-1984) of CEB's investment program for the augmentation and
reinforcement of the 132 kV transmission system and distribution system. The
key project components were:
(a) 172 miles of 132 kV second circuits to be strung on existing towers
to improve supplies to Ratmalana, Jaffna and Trincomalee;
(b) 50 miles of new single circuit 132 kV line to
Valachchenai;
(c) construction of a new 132 kV grid substation at
Valachchenai and augmentation of three existing 132 kV
switching stations at Kolonnawa, Ratmalana and
Anuradhapura;
(d) Colombo Distribution System Expansion;
(e) construction of 500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission lines;
(f)  construction of 250 distribut-on substations together with
125 miles of associated 33 kV spur lines;
(g) vehicles and tools; and
(h) engineering and management consulting services.
4.   Project Design and Organization
4.1  The project scope was defined based on the load forecast and system
studies prepared by CEB. Project design was straight-forward. During proiect
appraisal, GEB decided to undertake itself the engineering and project
management for IDA-financed components and construct the 33 kV project
components through force account, with the Bank's concurrence. Although CEB
had previous experience with such works, the manpower requirements, division
of responsibilities between the central construction department and the seven
divisions under the two operating regions, project scheduling, monitoring and



3
reporting arrangements were not assessed and defined during appraisal and
credit negotiations. This omission contributed to the excessive
implemenration slippage of the 33 kV project components (para 5.3).
5.   Project Implementetion
5.1  The most critical variance betwoen planned and actual project
implementation was excessive delays in the construction of the Habarana-
Valachchenai single circuit 132 kV line (60 miles) and the 33 kV components.
The original project completion date was March 1984. The credit was closed on
March 31, 1988 after three extensions, indicating an overall project
implernentation delay of 48 months. Delays dogged the project from the
beginning of implementation. The planned and actual completion dates for each
project component are compared in Table 4, Part III. The main reasons for the
project slippage were:
(a) delays in finalizing the cofinancing arrangement by the Saudi Fund
(mainlv for the Colombo Distribution System Exparsion component)
which dela i the IDA credit's effectiveness by six months;
(b) protracted procurement processing and tender evaluation within
CEB/GOSL;
(c) poor performance by several contractors;
(d) project management deficiencies; and
(e) civil disturbances.
5.2 132 kV transmission lines. During project appraisal, it was agreed that
CEB would implement the 132 kV project components through four single
responsibility contracts, which would cover: (i) the 132 kV transmission
lines, the 132 kV grid substation and switching stations financed by IDA, and
(ii) the 132 kV primary distribucion substations and the 132 kV underground
cables for the Colombo distribution system financed by the Saudi Fund. During
implementation, the scope of the 132 kV transmission lines component was
somewhat changed. First, construction of the second circuit 132 kV line ;rom
Anuradhapura to Kantalai was undertaken by CEB's force account and thus
deleted from the projecz scope; instead of this, construction of the 132 kV
second circuit from Kantalai to Trincomalee (12 miles) was added. Second, the
new single circuit 132 kV line to Valachchenai was rerouted from Habarana
instead of Kantalai. The length of new route is about the same, but the total
distance the energy must travel from the source of supply is shorter, leading
to reduction in transmission losses.
5.3 Tenders for the 132 kV transmission lines closed on May 12, 1981.
However, CEB was unhappy with the lowps; evaluated bidder's amount of
experience in stringing the second circuit lines on existing towers with the
first circuit live and preferred to award the contract to the second lowest
evaluated bidder, whose pricc was 2.7% higher, but who had more experience.
IDA did not agree with CEB's recommendation. A solution to this long-standing
impasse was finally found by splitting the original contract scope into two



4
part:s: the first covered the stringing of the second circuit along three
existing lines and was awarded to the more exper'enced conitractor; the second
was for the construction of the new single circuit 132 kV Habarana-
Valachchenai line and was awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. By good
fortune, when the works were so divided, each of the two contractors was the
lowest evaluated bidder for the works awarded. The two contracts were awarded
on December 3, 1982, two years behind the SAR schedule.
5.4 The contract for stringing the second circuit 032 kV lines was
satisfactorily conipleted by March 1935. However, construction of the single
circuit 132 kV Habarana-Valachchenai line was plagued with problems from the
outset. First, the contract award was not accepted by the contractor until
May 1983. Ther, implementation suffered a fourteen-month delay (September
1983-November 1984) on account of strikes at the contractor's factory in
India, followed by a seven-month delay (November 1984-May 1985) due to civil
disturbances in the project area. The contractor remobilized in October 1985,
but progress was extremely slow. By the end of 1986, only 54 of a total of
345 towers required for the 60 mile-long line had been erected and only 90
foundations had been completed. Even material supplies were not complete.
The material delivered by then was available for 35 additional towers, thus
CEB was unable to take up the erection work on force account. As the line
route was in areas affected by the civil disturbances, the zontractor showed
no interest in completing the work. Consequently, the contract was cancelled
in 1987. No alternative arrangement was made to complete the erection work
for this line.
5.5  33 kV Components.   As mentioned in para 4.1, during project appraisal,
CEB decided to construct the 33 kV components on force account. However, the
manpower requirements, division of implementation responsibilities, as well as
scheduling and monitoring aspects were niot defined. Had strong project
management been in place, this project organization deficiency could have been
rectified in an early stage. Unfortunately CEB's overall project management
capacity was constrained and overstretched as a result of the accelerating
exodus of experienced officers from CEB to better paid jobs in the Middle East
and elsewhere, as well as the competing demands on the central project
department. Apart from under-staffing, project management suffered from the
lack of an effective scheduling and monitoring system. Consequently,
construction of the 33 kV components was neglected, and little work was
carried out until 1984. ln June 1984, CEB decided to contract out about 250
miles of 33 kV lines erection works to local contractors. Two local
contractors were engaged in July 1984; due to their inexperience, progress was
dismal, and one contract was eventually cancelled at the end of 1986. A third
contractor was engaged in August 1985, who satisfactorily completed 66 miles
of erection works in May 1987. Due to competing demands, CEB's construction
gangs were not available for the project, and erection work through CEB's
force account only started in August 1986. By credit closing date, out of a
total of 500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission lines, 375 miles were completed,
including 275 miles constructed by CEB's force account. Erection works for
about 60 miles of 33 kV lines were not taken up due to civil unrest and
resultant depressed electricity demand which did not justify the lines.
Erection works for the 250 distribution -ubstations with associated 33 kV spur



5
lines were completed by the construction gangs in the two operating regions ir.
mid-1989.
5.6 Given the delays in constructing the 132 kV Habarana-Valachchenai line
and the 33 kV coiaponents, and under-utili7ation of credit funds as a result of
lower actual costs, IDA agreed, in February 1985, to finance additional
substation works at Kand', Kurunegala and Habarana in the amount of US$4.8
million.  These works were completed by mid-1988.
5.7 The occurrence of civil disturbanLes which affected project
implementation could not have been foreseen during project appraisal.
However, inadequate assessment by the Bank staff of CEB/GOSL's procurement
procedures, CEB's project management capacity and the strength and
availability of CEB's force account conscruction gangs during project
appraisal contributed to the project slippage. A more thorough reviev of the
internal procurement and bid evaluation procedures would have sharpened the
Bank's appreciation of this issue and led Bank staff to: (i) initiate
discussions with GOSL regarding the need to striamline the internal
procurement procedure; (ii) pay more attention to procurement packaging,
particularly the need of separating the 132 kV lines cnmponent into two
packages in view of the technical requirements involved with stringing the
second circuits on existing toiwers with the firsr circuit line, thus avoiding
an 18-month procurement delay; and (iii) initiate advance procurement actions.
Also, a more careful review of the capacity of, and competing demands on CEB's
force account construction gangs would have led Bank staff to recommend supply
and erection contract for at least a portion of the 500 miles of 33 kV
subtransmission lines.
6.   Project Results
6.1 Except for the 132 kV Habarana-Valachchenai line and about 125 miles of
33 kV lines, all project components were completed. The project's primary
objective was thus achieved. Apart from the construction of physical
facilities, the project provided management consulting services to re-examine
CEB's organization structure, as the existing structure was inappropriace for
its expanead size anid responsibilities. The consultants recommended a
decentra `zed organization consisting of seven departments at headquarters,
two operating regions with seven divisions under them, and a generating group.
In September 1982, CEB's Board agreed to restructure CEB in accordarce with
the consultants' recommendations. Implementation of the new organizational
stru-ture began in January 1984 and was completed in early 1987. This was an
important step in strengchening CEB's institutional capasity.
6.' Since the project constituted an integral part of CEB's 1982-1992
investment program, its benefits to consumers cannot be separated from those
generated by the rest of CEB's capital expenditure. Thus the economic rate of
return (ERR) is reassessed for the entire investment program, as at appraisal.
The ERR thus calculated is about 3.4% (if average tariff is used as a proxy of
economic benefit) or 12.2% (if consumers' willingness to pay is used as a
measurL of economic benefit). The ERRs compare very well with the appraisal



6
estimates of 3.3% (based on average tariff) and 11.6% (based on consumers'
wiilingness to pay) respectively.  Two variances are noteworthy which have
mutually off-setting impacts on the rate of return. One variance relates to
the load forecast. At appraisal, energy sales were pro]ected to grow at an
avera6e annual rate of 10% during 1981-1990; this waE an overestimate compared
with the historical average annual growth rate of 7.6% for 1975-1980. Actual
encrgy sales growth avecaged 8.2% p.a. during 1981-1986 and 1.8% p.a. during
1987-1989. The sluggish sales growth during the past three years was the
result of civil disturbances which seriously curtailed the level of economic
activities and thus de,mand for electricity in the troubled areas of the
country. Correspondi'ig to che lower demand growth wa,' the postponement of
major investment, -.g., the commissioning of the Rantambe hydropower plant (49
MW) and the Samanalawewa hydropower plant (120 MW) has been shifted to 1990
and 1991, respectively, instead of 1987 and 1990 as assumed at appraisal.
7.   Project Sustainability.
7.1 The project is a part of CEB's least-cost expansion program. Based on
the GDP growth projections prepared by the Bank for the Econom_... Restructuring
Credit (Cr. 2128-CE) and the hi.storical linkages between the GOP and
electricity consumption, electricity sales are projected to grow at an annual
rate of 5% in 1990, 6% in 1991, 7% in 1992, and 7.8% thereafter. In this
context, the project will maintain a steady level of net benefits throughout
its economic life. The benefits are likely to be aiigme_nted by CEB's take-over
of local authorities' distribution systems, a process supported by IDA Credit
1933-CE.
7.2 Under the project, GOSL/CEB agreed to carry out a tariff study based on
long-run marginal cost and to implement tariff adjustments to enable CED to
achieve a rate of return on revalued average net fixed ass_ts of not less than
8%.  Tariff increases were introduced in 1982 (32%), 1985 (75%), 1988 (17%)
and 1990 (40%). As a result, CEB met the rate of return target during 1985-
1988. In 1989, the rate of return was below 8% mainly due to depressed
electricity sales. The tariff study completed in 1981 was updated in 1984 an'i
is now being updated under IDA's Power Distribution and Transmission Project
(Cr. 1933-CE). Given this record, it is expected that GOSL would continue to
support CEB to meet its financial objective. CEB's financial performance for
1981-1989 is given in Annex 1.
8.   Bank Performance.
8.1 Through the project, the Bank made a positive contribution to CEB's
physical and institutional development. The main weaknessec of the Bank's
performance were: (a) inadequate emphasis on project implementation
arrangements; and (b) inadequate assessment of CEB's project management
capability and the impact of the continuing exodus of experienced staff from
CEB on project management. In retrospect, Bank staff should have: (i) pressed
for more concrete project implementation arrangements, including definition of
the staffing levels and authority of the project management unit, and the
requirements and availability of construction gangs for the 33 kV project
components; (ii) increased the scope of consultant services to supplement
CEB's in-house project management capacity since it had experienced



7
difficulties retaining experienced staff due to governnment-imposed ceilings on
remuneration; and (iii) paid more attention to procurement packaging and
allowed advance procurement actions in view of the protracted internal
procurement procedure. These lessons are very relevant for future lending
operations.
9.   Borrower's Performance.
9.1 Considering the staff constraints faced by CEB and the general conditions
in the country during project implementation, the attainment of the primary
project objective is a tribute to the dedication of CEB management and project
staff. The main weaknesses of the CEB's performance were:
(a)  protracted internal procurement processing and bid evaluation;
(b)  slow decision-making which affected the resolution of implementation
issues; and
(c)  weak project management resulting from under-staffing of the project
management unit, inadequate authority assigned to project managers,
and lack of an effective project monitoring and reporting system.
The experience of the project points to the critical need for CEB/GOSL to
streamline the internal procurement procedures and strengthen project
management to ensure timely and efficient implementation of ongoing and future
projects.
10. Project Relationship. The Bank maintained close working relationships
with GOSL and CEB on the project.
11. ConsultinF Services. The performance of the engineering consultants for
the design and supervision of the Colombo distribution system expansion
component and of the management consultants was satisfactory.
12. Project Documentation and Data. The legal documents adequately reflected
the project's objectives. The Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful
framework to monitor project implementation. CEB's project cost accounting
has improved since 1986 and is being strengthened. CEB provided useful
information for the preparation of the PCR.

Stringing the Second Circuit
from Kantalai to Trincomalee
Comments:
1. This section was rerouted from Habarana to Valachchenai following further
system studies; construction of the line was suspended in 1987 due to
poor perfc7mance of the contractor and civil disturbances in the project area.
2. By end 1 889 about 000 kms of 33 kV lines were constructed as compared with
the original target of 800 kms; the costs of towers in the amount of US$1.96
million were provided by the cofinancier, the costs of conductors and
erection works were financed by CEB
