The main weakness\n            of the Bank's performance were: (a) inadequate emphasis\n            on project implementation arrangements; and (b) inadequate\n            assessment of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)'s\n            project management capability and the impact of the\n            continuing exodus of experienced staff from CEB on project\n            management. Project implementation experienced long delays,\n            necessitating extension of the credit closing date by three\n            years. The main reasons for the project slippages included:\n            (i) delays in finalizing the co-financing arrangement; (ii)\n            protracted internal procurement processing; (iii) poor\n            performance of contractors; (iv) weak project management;\n            and (v) occurrence of civil disturbances. Technical\n            assistance should be incorporated in the project scope to\n            address identified deficiencies The importance of conducting\n            a thorough review during project appraisal of the\n            constraints facing project implementation and the project\n            entity's project management capacity cannot be over-stressed."}, "docdt": "1990-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
