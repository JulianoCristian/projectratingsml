Its ecological\n            stability depends on the conservation of such heterogeneity.\n            Man's activities lead to environmental simplification,\n            and a deterioration of its abiotic and biotic components.\n            In most of the area man has extended his range to the\n            floodplain.  The report suggests that within the anthropic\n            environment the potential negative impacts from the\n            structure for protection against floods should be less\n            significant than those caused by floods when these\n            structures are lacking.  They evaluated the adequacy of\n            these structures considering those currently existent and\n            those programmed for the near future, a special point to be\n            dealt with in order to recommend future trends of urban\n            expansion.  The main objectives of this report are directed\n            to describe the most relevant environmental features of\n            Paraguay, Parana, and Uruguay rivers flood plains, regarding\n            their abiotic, biotic and anthropic components, and their\n            conformity with the pulsatile regime.  The obtained basic\n            information has been used to assess those potential\n            environmental impacts that would be produced by the flood\n            control projects."}, "docdt": "1995-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
