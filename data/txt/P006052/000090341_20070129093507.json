Lessons learned from the project: Sharing\n            the costs and obligations is a sound principle and will\n            likely promote efficiency and sustainability. Decision\n            making authority should be aligned with ability for\n            influencing project progress. Complex works such as flood\n            protection construction requires flexible systems for timely\n            implementation. Effective flood protection requires\n            basin-wide action.
