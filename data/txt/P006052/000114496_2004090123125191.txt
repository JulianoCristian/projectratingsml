concessionaires with respect to the AMBA passenger rail system; (c) assist in improving traffic 
safety and urban transport-related environmental quality in the AMBA; (d) contribute towards the 
development of an integrated urban transport (road and rail) system for the AMBA; and (e) 
improve maternal and child health through the delivery of quality services, and to strengthen

track without deviating from the original existing track bed, renovating their electric substations 
and electric transmission systems, installing automatic signals and an operations control center 
for the lines, improving their passenger stations (such as by installing or rebuilding escalators), 
improving their mechanical workshops, ventilation systems and drainage systems and 
reconstructing approximately eight Urquiza line electric coaches. 
 
2. 
Rehabilitation (including civil works supervision) of Buenos Aires subway system line A 
by completely replacing its track without deviating from the original existing track bed, installing

Major improvements (including civil works supervision) of road/rail transfer facilities by 
carrying out Integration Subprojects (consisting of, e.g., building or improving bus terminals, 
transfer centers and car parks) at selected major AMBA subway and/or rail stations. 
 
2. 
(a)  Minor improvements (such as, e.g., installation of bus-only lanes and other traffic 
flow enhancements, traffic signals, walkways, sidewalks and bicycle parking facilities) at 
outlying AMBA subway and/or rail stations, so as to ease bus, car, pedestrian and bicycle access 
to such stations; and (b) carrying out of a promotional campaign to encourage bicycle access to 
such stations.

construction); (b) installation or rehabilitation of automatic barriers at the sites of selected 
road/rail crossings in the AMBA that will not be converted to non-grade crossings; (c) carrying 
out of a study to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve the safety of road/rail grade 
crossings in the AMBA; and (d) implementation of other traffic safety measures in the AMBA

2. 
Payments out of the Special Account ‘B’ shall be made exclusively for eligible

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account ‘B’ has 
been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to 
replenish the Special Account ‘B’ shall be made as follows: 
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account ‘B’ of an amount or amounts 
which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of such 
request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account

requested. 
 
(b) 
(i) 
For replenishment of the Special Account ‘B’, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account ‘B’ at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 
 
(ii) 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of 
which replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, the

shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents 
and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account ‘B’ for

the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 
 
4. 
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account ‘B’, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and 
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures. 
 
5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not be 
required to make further deposits into the Special Account ‘B’: 
 
(a) 
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals should 
be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of 
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to Parts E and F of the 
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan 
allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by 
notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that 
the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account ‘B’ as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 
 
6. 
(a) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special 
Account ‘B’:  (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 
2
of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:  (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank 
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account ‘B’ (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund 
to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible 
or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account ‘B’ shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account ‘B’ will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the

amount.
