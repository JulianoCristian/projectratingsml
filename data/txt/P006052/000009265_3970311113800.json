of economic assets and\n            persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense\n            facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by\n            strengthening national and provincial institutions and\n            systems for dealing with future floods as a next phase after\n            the Flood Rehabilitation Project to restore the assets lost\n            in the recent floods.  The specific objectives will be to\n            enhance provincial capacity to deal with periodic flooding\n            by upgrading their flood preparedness and mitigation\n            systems, as well as strengthening coordination within the\n            Basin.  The project will support the first phase of a\n            two-stage Flood Protection Program.  It will include the\n            following components: a) structural measures; and b) non\n            structural measures consisting of a new institutional\n            framework, upgrading of flood preparedness, early flood\n            warning system and project implementation and administration."}, "docdt": "1996-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
