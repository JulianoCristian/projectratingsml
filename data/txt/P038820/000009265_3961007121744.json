and d)\n            reduce fuel costs by facilitating the economic dispatch of\n            generating units. The project includes the following\n            components: 1) implementation of the complete rehabilitation\n            program for the Dnieper I and II hydropower plants and the\n            Kiev pump storage plant (PSP); near-complete implementation\n            of the rehabilitation program for the Kakhovka hydropower\n            station (HPS); and partial implementation of the\n            rehabilitation program for the Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug and\n            Dniprodzerzhinsk hydropower plants; 2) installation of dam\n            safety monitoring systems at the main water reservoirs on\n            the Dnieper river; 3) upgrade of communications, dispatch,\n            system control and protection, and generating unit control;\n            and 4) technical assistance for project implementation, and\n            optimization of the use of the reservoirs on the Dnieper river."}, "docdt": "1995-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
