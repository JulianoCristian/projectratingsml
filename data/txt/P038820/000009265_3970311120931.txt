MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDA'TION OF T'HE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE 4EXECUITIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO UKRAINE
FOR A HYDROPOWER REH,ABILITATION AND SYSTEMS CONTROL PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Ukraine for the equivalent of US$ 114.0 million to help finance a project for the
rehabilitation of hydropower plants and improvement of power system control. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years. including 5 years of grace. The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to Dniprohydroenergo (DHE) and the National Dispatch Center
(NDC) for 17 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at the IBRD rate plus a mark-up of 1.5
percent per annum. Cofinancing in the amount of US$ 12.9 million equivalent would be provided by
other donors on a grant basis to support the implementation of the proposed project.
2.           Country Context. Ukraine's economy, with a GDP per capita estimated at US$ 1,910
in 1993, rests on industry and agriculture, which together accounted for about two thirds of GDP.
Ukraine is also heavily dependent on trade, notably with the rest of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Real
GDP contracted by 14 percent in 1993, bringing the cumulative fall in output since 1990 to 38 percent.
This trend accelerated in 1994 as GDP declined by about 23 percent. Due to loose fiscal and monetary
policies, the rate of inflation rose to an average of 4,735 percent in 1993 (up from 1,210 percent in
1992), and, in addition, varied significantly from month to month. In the first half of 1994, the inflation
rate came down to single digit levels, primarily on account of flagging demand, itself the result of a large
drop in real wages and a stringent credit policy. The external situation has become increasingly tenuous,
reflecting a significant trade deficit with the FSU -- about US$ 3 billion in 1993 - which was only
partially offset by a trade surplus with the rest of the world.
3.          In October 1994, the Government adopted a comprehensive program of macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms, supported by a purchase of US$ 365 million from the IMF's Systemic
Transformation Facility and a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million from the Bank.
The Govermnent's program calls for accelerating the transition to a mnarket-oriented economy. Within
this framework, the economic package that the Goverrment has adopted aims to break inflationary
expectations and promote a sustained recovery in economic growth. To this end, the program focuses
on four key interdependent elements. First, a stable political and economic enmironment is required so
that producers and consumers can make sound decisions without fear of macroeconomic disruptions. The
stabilization of the economy will rest upon tight fiscal and monetary policies. Second, competition in
markets is essential to an efficient allocation of resources. In an effort to promote free and open markets,
the Govermnent will rely upon the liberalization of prices and domestic and foreign trade; the dismantling
of the state order system; demonopolization; and promotion of the private sector. Third, the hardening
of enterprise budget constraints through corporatization, privatization and the enforcement of bankruptcy
laws will encourage enterprises to respond to the new market forces. The elimination of directed credits
and credits to settle inter-enterprise arrears and financial sector reform are expected to support behavioral
changes at the enterprise level. Finally, the social safety net is to be strengthened through improved
targeting in order to protect the segments of the population most vulnerable to the adjustments associated
with the structural transformnation of the economy.

4.           Sector Background. Energy denand in Ukrainc is characterized by high energy intensity
in relation to industrial output and the high share of industry in final energy consumplion. Following a
decline of 11 % betwecn 1985 and 1990, the cnergy intensity of GDP increased by 40% in the 1990-1993
period reaching 2.5 kilogram oil equivalent per US$, a ratio that is several times higher than in the most
developed countries. Domestic energy production, consisting of fossil fuels and primary electricity
(hydro and nuclear power), represented 48% of consumption in 1993-94. The main import items were
crude oil and oil products, originating almost exclusively in Russia, and natural gas, originating in Russia
and Turkmenistan.
5.           In 1993, installed electricity generation capacity was 52,122 MW, consisting of 12,818
MW of nuclear (25%), 32,364 MW of thermal (62%), 4,700 MW of hydro (9%) and 2,240 MW of
industrial (4%) power generation capacity. Most older fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) use coal as
their primary fuel, but need gas or mazut for co-firing. About 5,520 MW of power generation capacity
as well as about 3,500 MW combined heat-and-power plants run on gas and/or mazut as main fuels.
Between 1990 and 1993, electricity generation decreased by about 23%, domestic consumption by 15%,
and net exports by 96%. Both generation and consumption decreased by a further 14% in 1994. The
forced separation of the Ukrainian power system, in November 1993, from the hydro plants on the Volga
river that controlled system frequency, revealed serious structural and functiona' weaknesses with negative
consequences on overall system operation, security, reliability and quality ot power supply. Inability of
the system to maintain the balance of supply and demand in real time led to the separation of all
neighboring systems, causing further deterioration of system performance and reduction in export
capacity. The existing peaking capacity is provided by aging hydro plants that are in need of
rehabilitation.
6.           Electricity demand is expected to drop even further during the next three to five years,
due to a number of factors such as general economic downturn, electricity price increase and economic
restructuring. Assuming that three new nuclear units that are under construction are completed to replace
the Chemoby: plant, there is no need for additional base-load capacity in the next decade. Total power
generation investment requirements are preliminarily estimated at US$ 3.5 billion in the 1995-2005
period. Of this total. US$ 1.9 billion is needed for nuclear power, including US$ 0.6 billion for safety
upgrades, US$ 0.6 billion for deconmmissioning and other works at Chemobyl, and US$ 0.7 billion for
the completion of three new nuclear units. The rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants and the
completion of the Dniester pump storage plant to provide additional peaking capacity requires about US$
1.6 billion.
7.           Gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil prices are liberalized. Electricity, gas, and coal prices
are set by the central govermnent. Local govermnents set the price of district heating, LPG, heating oil,
peat and wood. With the exception of electricity, household energy prices cover only a fraction of costs.
The difference is covered by central and local govermnent budgets, and also by a non-transparent
surcharge on industrial consumers (for gas and district heat). Even for electricity, there are several
categories of households who are entitled to discounts, and the cost of these discounts is borne by the
industrial consumers. During most of 1994, additional price distortions were caused by: (i) a subsidy
to non-household consumers of coal; (ii) an artificial exchange rate that did not allow the passing of the
full cost of imported gas to consumers; and (iii) price adjustments for electricity and heat that lagged
behind fuel cost increases. Non-payment by customers became a major problem for electricity, gas and
heat suppliers, further weakening the financial position of the utilities. In October 1994. the Government



3
started the implementation of a program of price adjustments that: (i) drastically reduces household energy
price subsidies; (ii) eliminates the explicit and implicit (through the exchange rate) subsidy to non-
household consumers of coal and gas; and (iii) ensures the full recovery of increased fuel and other basic
input costs in the price of electricity and heat.
8.           The Govermnent's long term investment program assumes that the remaining units of the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant would be closed when their reactor channels reach the end of their life
in 1998-2003. During discussions with the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group, the Governmnent agreed
to consider the possibility of the early closure of the Chernobyl plant provided that a solution was found
for a set of related issues, such as the financing of replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, and the
mitigation of social consequences. It was agreed that an international Task Force would be formed from
Ukrainian and foreign experts with the task of developing a detailed, comprehensive Action Plan for
nuclear safety in the context of a power sector development strategy. The joint international Task Force
was set up in December 1994, and its work is underway.
9.           On May 21, 1994, the President of UKraine signed Decree 244/94 on Market
Transformation Measures in the Electricity Sector of Ukraine. The Decree ordered a broad restructuring
of the power industry based on the model of separating generation, transmission, and distribution
functions, corporatizing and privatizing the generating and distribution companies, setting up a
competitive wholesale market for electricity, and establishing an independent agency to regulate the
industry (i.e., independent from the enterprises and not subordinated to any Ministry). After some initial
delay, the Government adopted an Action Plan to implement the Decree on November 2, 1994. As a
first step, a National Electricity Regulatory Commission was established in December 1994. Full
implemi atation of the restructuring in the next couple of years is expected to increase the efficiezicy and
reliability of electricity supply, restore the financial health of the industry, and create a favorable
framework for private investment in power generation. The Bank, jointly with the Ministry of Power
(Minenergo), organized a donor meeting in Kiev in July 1994. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure
the availability of technical assistance for the implementation of this important reform initiative in the
power subsector. The US Agency for International Development, British Know How Fund, EU TACIS,
Government of Switzerland, Government of the Netherlands and the World Bank offered technical
assistance of about US$ 4 million equivalent for Lt!e first year of the reform (including US$ 450,000 from
the Bank's Institutional Development Fund). The Government and the donors asked the Bank to assist
the Government in coordinating the implementation of the technical assistance program.
10.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the project are to: (i) improve the efficiency,
reliability, safety and environmental performance of hydropower plants; (ii) increase hydropower
generation capacity; (iii) improve the quality of electricity supply by upgrading load and frequency
control, which would also improve the safety of nuclear plants; and (iv) reduce fuel costs by facilitating
the economic dispatch of generating units. A decrease in hydropower capacity would lead to further
deterioration in the reliability and quality of electricity supply. In view of large frequency flucruations
and the high share of base-load plants, it is also necessary to enhance the system regulating capacity by
increasing load-following capability and improving system control and dispatch. The Goverrnent of
Ukraine assigns a high priority to the improvement of the efficiency and quality of electricity supply.

11.          Project Description. The project consists of the following components:
(a)    The initial five years of the rehabilitation program for eight major hydropower
plants (57% of total project costs);
(b)   Installation of dam safety monitoring systems at the main water reservoirs on the
Dnieper river (2% of total project costs);
(c)    Upgrade of communications, dispatch, system control and protection, and
generating unit control (38% of total project costs); and
(d)    Technical assistance for project implementation, and optimization of the use of
the reservoirs on the Dnieper river (3% of total project costs).
12.          Intemnational Waterways. One of the hydropower plants is about 15 km upstream from
the point where the Dniester river forns the borderline between Moldova and Ukraine. There is no
dispute between the two countries conceming the operation of this plant. Upgrading of the dispatch and
generation control equipment for this plant will not affect the reservoir nor any other water retaining
structure, and will have no effect on the flow of the river.
13.          Project Cost and Financing. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 190.2
million equivalent, of which US$ 106.7 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed World Bank loan
of US$ 114.0 million would cover 50% of project costs, and also includes US$ 18.3 million out of a total
of US$ 24.1 million of interest during construction. Following a five year grace period, repayment of
the principal and in:erest payments would commence and continue for 12 years. The borrower would
be Ukraine, whose Government would enter into subloan agreements with the beneficiaries. The
beneficiaries would be Dniprohydroenergo (DHE) and the National Dispatch Center (NDC). The
subloans would have a maturity of 17 years including five years of grace. The interest rate in the subloan
agreements would be equal to the World Bank's standard variable interest rate plus a margin of 1.5% to
cover the cost of loan administration. The foreign exchange risk will be bome by the beneficiaries. The
beneficiaries would also reimburse the Government for the commitment fee. The Governments of
Switzerland, Canada and Norway agreed to provide grants of US$ 12.9 million equivalent to finance part
of the cost of the hydropower rehabilitation and technical assistance components. DHE and NDC will
finance the remaining costs, part of interest during construction, and the commitment fee, estimated at
US$ 88.3 million equivalent, from internally generated revenues. Schedule A presents the project cost
table and the financing plan, and Schedule B presents procurement arrangements, disbursement categories
and the disbursement timetable. A timetable of key processing events and the status of IBRD operations
are provided in Schedules C and D, respectively.
14.          Project Implementation. The project would be implemented over a period of 5 years
and is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000. Implementation of the project will be the
responsibility of the beneficiaries. i.e., DHE and NDC. A Project CoordJination Unit (PCU) in
Minenergo will coordinate project preparation activities, technical assistance, scheduling, reporting,
training, and other aspects of project implementation requiring coordination between the Project
Implementation Units. Separate Project Implementation Units (PIUs) will be set up in DHE and NDC
with responsibilities to manage implementation of the hydropower rehabilitation (including dam safety)



5
and the system control components, respectively. The managers of the PlUs will be appointed by the
Directors of DHE and NDC, and will havc the title of Deputy Projcct Coordinators of the PCU.
Installation of equipment will bc the responsibility of the respective facilities (hydro plants, dispatch
centers, thermal plants and substations), which will use their force account and specialized local
construction and installation companies, under the guidance of the suppliers with additional assistance
from internationally qualified project implementation advisors.
15.          Project Sustainability. Following project completion, the life of the hydropower plants
will be extended by about 20 years. The operation of the rehabilitated plants is not expected to pose a
technical challenge for the well-educated, experienced staff working at the plants. The hydropower plants
will continue to be the lowest cosi electricity generators in Ukraine, and the cost recovery arrangement
embedded in the contract with NDC is expected to ensure the long term financial viability of DHE.
NDC, as the operator of the future wholesale market for electricity, will have a key role in the reformed
power industry. NDC, whose activities will be monitored by the National Electricity Regulatory
Commission, will recover its costs by adding a margin to the price of electricity it sells to local electricity
distributors/suppliers. The facilities installed by the project will be essential for the successful functioning
of the wholesale market, including daily bidding, dispatching, metering, verification, and settlements.
Under the project, technical training will be provided to NDC staff in the operation and maintenance of
the modernized comnnunications, system control and dispatch facilities. The donor funded institutional
building effort that has been mobilized in support of the power industry reform will provide the necessary
training for NDC's commercial functions (para. 9).
16.          Lessons Learned from Past Bank Experience. A review of several decades of the
Bank's worldwide lending for the power industry recommended that Bank lending for electric power
should focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving the performance of the power industry
by commercialization, corporatization and the establishment of a transparent regulatory framework. The
proposed project meets these criteria. The Bank's experience in power rehabilitation is limited since there
were very few purely rehabilitation projects. To the extent that rehabilitation components can be
evaluated separately, performance has been satisfactory. The first loan for US$ 27 million equivalent
to Ukraine was approved in June 1993 (Ln. 3614-UA) to finance an Institution Building Project aimed
at supporting enterprise reform, financial sector reform, and public economic and financial management.
Initially, the implementation of the project suffered from the unstable policy environment, and the lack
of coordination between the many implementing agencies. Institutional rearrangements and the improved
policy environment significantly improved the performance of the project in late 1994.  The
irnplementation of the IDF grant (No. 28842) that supports the development of competition in the power
industry is progressing satisfactorily. The implementation of the second Bank operation, a Rehabilitation
Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million equivalent approved in December 1994, has started only
recently.
17.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has been involved in the Ukrainian energy
sector since early 1992. An Energy Sector Review (Report No. 11646-UA) was issued in 1993, leading
to close cooperation between the Bank and the Govermnent in the area of power industry institutional
reforn. The proposed project demonstrates that the Bank is willing to step up assistance to those sectors
of the economy that are committed to reform. This is particularly important at this timne when the power
industry is making the first bold reform steps. Also, the Bank's support is needed for the imnplementation



6
of high priority investmcnhs under the present conditions of sevcrc rcsource constraints. By increasing
the efficiency of electricity generation, (his project is conisistent with the limited Country Assistancc
Strategy as discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln.
3831-UA) on December 22, 1994. A full Country Assistance Strategy presentation to thc Board is
scheduled in FY96.
18.          Agreed Actions. At negotiations, agreements were reached on the following: (a) on-
lending arrangements between GoU and DHE, and GoU and NDC, including on-lending interest rate,
maturity and repayment method; (b) power purchase contract between NDC and DHE, including the tariff
formula ensuring the full recovery of investmrent and operating costs; (c) contract between NDC and its
downstream customers, including the application of interest penalty and curtailment of deliveries in the
case of non-payment; (d) reduction of NDC's delay in paying its suppliers and reduction of NDC's
accounts receivable; (e) price setting mechanism for NDC that aliows it to recover an allowance for bad
debt in its resale tariff; (f) commitment of DHE and NDC to maintain a self-financing ratio of at least
40% and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 during the project period; (g) qualifications for
Project Coordinator and Deputy Project Coordirnators; (h) signing of suitable contracts between DHE and
the turbine and generator manufacturers by November 30, 1995; (i) arrangements for establishing,
operating, and auditing the Special Accounts; (j) auditing requirements of the accounts of DHE and NDC;
(k) set of Project Performance Indicators; (I) mid-term review of project implementation; and (m)
operation plans of DHE and NDC. Conditions for effectiveness include: (a) execution of subsidiary loan
agreenents between the GoU and the two beneficiaries; (b) signing of power purchase contract bLtween
NDC and DHE; (c) resolution of NDC's arrears for previous hydropower purchases; (d) transfer of
owvnership of regional dispatch centers to NDC; and (e) establishment of PCU and PlUs, and appointment
of Project Coordinator and Deputy Project Coordinators.
19.          Environmental Aspects. The project is expected to have a positive impact on the
environnent. The rehabilitated turbines will have improved and longer-lasting sealing, significantly
reducing or eliminating the leakage of lubricating oil into the rivers. Improved turbine efficiency will
lead to the production of more electricity from hydropower, replacing electricity generated in thermal
power plants. Inproved dam safet, monitoring will reduce the risks of accidents and allow for improved
water management and control. Introduction of automatic generation control and economic dispatch will
lead to a more efficient use of fossil fuel plants, resulting in commensurate reduction in fossil fuel use
and the corresponding emission of pollutants. During implementation, there will be no activities that
would result in a measurable impact on the existing patterns of water flows and water usage.
20.          Program Objective Categories. By rehabilitating and upgrading facilities that utilize a
renewable resource, the project is consistent with the objective of environmentally sustainable
development.
21.          Participatory Approach. Due to their close involvement in project preparation, the
beneficiaries are familiar with the details of the project, and are cormnitted to implementation.
Specifically, the staff of the hydropower plants and NDC have been closely involved in the preparation
of the feasibility studies. The results of the studies have been presented to and approved by the directors
of each hydropower plant and the management of NDC. As described above, project implementation will
be the responsibility of the beneficiaries.

availability of hydropower plants, and tile increased ef ficiency in thc loading ol hydro- and thennal power
generation units. The expected economic rate of return is 18.1 percent. Additional, non-quantified
benefits are: (i) the increased security of the power system that will lead to fewer blackouts; (ii) the
improved stability of frequenicy that will enhance nuclear safety; (iii) the better environmental
performance of the hydropower plants that will reduce the pollution of rivers; and (iv) the improved
monitoring of dams and reservoirs that will reduce the risk of dam breaks.
23.           Risks. The main risks for the project are that the Government would be unwilling to (i)
adhere to the agreed pricing formula for the electricity produced by the hydropower plants; and (ii)
implement a strict regulatory policy to prevent the further accumulation of payment arrears. These could
seriously undermine the financial position of DHE and NDC, and thereby endanger the implementation
of the project. The reform of the power industry based on Decree 244/94 is expected to decrease these
risks, but cannot eliminate them. The implementation of the reform itself is subject to political risks.
Risks arising from the pricing of electricity have been addressed under the project by requiring the
adoption of a tariff formula that includes all operating costs, recovers investment costs, and allows for
regular adjustment to reflect inflation. Risks arising from non-payment by NDC's customers (i.e. local
electricity companies and large industrial plants) have been addressed by requiring appropriate contractual
arrangements, including the reduction/termination of service in the case of non-payment.  The
beneficiaries' inexperience in implementation of Bank projects poses additional risks.  Inferior
performance of domestic equipment and domestic supply constraints could also delay project execution
and affect the quality of work. These risks have been addressed through the careful planning of activities
that are on the critical path, and by providing technical assistance tt' the PIUs in procurement, supervision
and quality control. Economic returns are very robust relative to variations in key project parameters.
A switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose a significant risk because both major
components remain economic even in the face of considerable overruns in investment costs. The
hydropower rehabilitation comporient remains economically viable even at 60% of the assumed economic
value of electricity. The systenm control component retains economic viability even when fuel savings
amount to 41 % of the level assumed for the base case.
24.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
