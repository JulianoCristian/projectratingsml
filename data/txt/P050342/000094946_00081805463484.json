The main two\n            components include: 1) the establishment of the Grassroots\n            Initiatives Fund (GIF), which will be primarily, a\n            demand-driven financing window, to provide support to\n            women's groups, in organizing themselves in productive\n            activities. Local coordinating offices, in consultation with\n            women's groups, will select intermediaries to provide\n            technical assistance in the coordination, design,\n            implementation, and supervision of those activities. Grants\n            will be provided for group-owned assets that, either creates\n            income-earning opportunities, or as an entry point to build\n            up capabilities in managing savings, and credit. However,\n            the latter will only be granted if strong intermediaries\n            support such group, and, if accepted under the legal\n            framework; and, 2) capacity building, as an integral part of\n            project design, will raise intermediaries skills, with a\n            focus on strengthening indigenous, and community based\n            organizations. Training will be provided, to strengthen\n            technical support, as needed. An information, education, and\n            communication program will increase awareness, and,\n            monitoring on the socioeconomic status of beneficiaries will\n            be conducted."}, "docdt": "2000-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
