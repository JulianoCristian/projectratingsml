The Women Development Initiatives Project, aims at testing methodologies to enhance the
social, and economic welfare of households in selected poor districts, improving opportunities for
women, by increasing their skills, productivity, and income. The main two components include: 1)
the establishment of the Grassroots Initiatives Fund (GIF), which will be primarily, a demand-
driven financing window, to provide support to women's groups, in organizing themselves in
productive activities. Local coordinating offices, in consultation with women's groups, will select
intermediaries to provide technical assistance in the coordination, design, implementation, and
supervision of those activities.



Grants will be provided for group-owned assets that, either creates income-earning opportunities, or as an entry point to
build up capabilities in managing savings, and credit. However, the latter will only be granted if strong intermediaries support
such group, and, if accepted under the legal framework; and, 2) capacity building, as an integral part of project design, will
raise intermediaries skills, with a focus on strengthening indigenous, and community based organizations. Training will be
provided, to strengthen technical support, as needed. An information, education, and communication program will increase
awareness, and, monitoring on the socioeconomic status of beneficiaries will be conducted.
