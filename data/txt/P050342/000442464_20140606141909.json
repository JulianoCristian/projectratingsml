The study assesses the\n            empowerment status of Ethiopian women in both rural and\n            urban areas, and evaluates the impact of participation in\n            WDIP on women's empowerment. Empowerment status and\n            impact are measured against indicators in the economic,\n            political, social, and psychological domains, on the\n            assumption that WDIP, a project designed to expand economic\n            opportunities, strengthen self-reliance, and build\n            awareness, will affect outcomes in all these spheres. WDIP\n            is a community-driven development project that seeks to\n            enhance women's empowerment and participation in\n            development interventions by mobilizing women at the\n            grassroots level and capitalizing on their potential to\n            support development processes. WDIP seeks to redress gender\n            imbalances in development opportunity by investing in\n            women's skills, productivity, and organizational\n            capacity. This report is structured as follows: section one\n            gives introduction. Section two outlines the objective and\n            conceptual framework. Section three presents research design\n            and methodology. Section four focuses on analysis of\n            women's empowerment and the determinants of\n            empowerment. Section five presents impact evaluation of WDIP."}, "docdt": "2005-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
