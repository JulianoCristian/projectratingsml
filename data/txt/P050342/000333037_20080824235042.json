Some\n            lessons learned included: investing in women's\n            development is a worthwhile goal. Success or failure depends\n            on the identification, design, and relevance of a project.\n            Collaboration of the local administrative officials plays an\n            important role for the success of women's economic,\n            social, and political empowerment. Success depends on mutual\n            understanding between the Regional Coordinating Units\n            (RCUs), Facilitators, and Intermediaries. Training and\n            Information, Education and Communication (IEC) on legal\n            awareness and harmful practices are important and effective.\n            Tracking of a project's strengths and weaknesses\n            requires a simple but comprehensive and participatory\n            monitoring system; and attribution of the impacts to a\n            project requires a sound impact evaluation methodology. It\n            is possible to empower poor, illiterate women socially and\n            economically through small-scale and group-based\n            micro-business initiatives. A nation-wide pilot is not\n            desirable from both financial and administrative\n            perspectives, as it requires a complex and costly\n            institutional set up."}, "docdt": "2007-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
