    MEASURING WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT AND THE IMPACT OF ETHIOPIA’S
             WOMEN’S DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES PROJECT

1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter discusses the World Bank aided Women’s Development Initiatives Project (WDIP),
currently under implementation in Ethiopia. The project’s recent impact evaluation served as one
of the country case studies under the five country initiative.

The context of the Study
The study assesses the empowerment status of Ethiopian women in both rural and urban areas,
and evaluates the impact of participation in WDIP on women’s empowerment. Empowerment
status and impact are measured against indicators in the economic, political, social and
psychological domains, on the assumption that WDIP, a project designed to expand economic
opportunities, strengthen self-reliance, and build awareness, would affect outcomes in all these
spheres.

Gender inequalities are very pronounced, well-known, and widely studied in the Ethiopia.
Review of secondary sources reveal a grim picture of women’s individual human and economic
assets, placing severe constraints on their ability to exercise agency. Ethiopia ranks well below
the average for Sub-Saharan Africa in its gender gap in primary school enrollment and
representation of women in government, and also falls below the average gender gap in adult
literacy.1 Women consistently have lower levels of education than men, with over 75 percent of
women in the country having no education at all (compared to 50 percent of men). 2 While in
some health indicators females perform slightly better than males, particularly in life expectancy
and child malnutrition, overall women are at higher health risk than men.3 Women are more
likely to be infected with HIV/AIDS, and less likely to have ever heard of the disease or know
and make use of effective prevention mechanisms. A significant factor contributing to women’ s
lack of knowledge of is their lack of access to outside information through media outlets. Less
than 14 percent of women in Ethiopia access media, and women are much less likely than men to
have heard of the disease through media sources.4

Women have a significantly lower employment rate than men. Nearly 43 percent of women are
unemployed, and over 36 percent of them are chronically unemployed. Women also have little
representation in decision-making positions. For example, although 40 percent of government
employees are women, 71 percent of them are concentrated in the lower levels. 5 In addition to
income-generating activities, women work long hours cooking, providing childcare and carrying
out domestic chores (such as fetching fuelwood and water). They have greater responsibility than
men for a wide range of other domestic time and labor-intensive tasks. Combining income-
generating and domestic chores it is estimated that rural women in Ethiopia work 15-18 hours a
day.6

The GOE recognizes the disadvantaged position of women, and has implemented a number of
policies, laws, and initiatives to promote women’s empowerment, including removal of
discriminatory laws from the Constitution. With the announcement of the National Policy on
Women in 1993 and promulgation of the new Constitution in 1995, the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) highlighted its commitment to the equal development of women.
Article 25 of the Constitution clearly guarantees equality and makes any discrimination on the
grounds of race, color and sex illegal. However, although violations such as female genital
mutilation, domestic violence, and sexual harassment are outlawed in the Constitution, the penal
code contains no provisions for adjudicating them, and existing laws are often applied by judges
in a manner that does not take account of women’s rights.7 In the case of women, the strength of
traditional systems is damaging their ability to live freely as equal citizens (World Bank, 2004).
A major component of this appears to be limits to the capacity of the GOE to enforce the laws
that are in place to protect women. Informal rules and norms are strong, and present severe
obstacles to efforts to change views on women’s positioning. In the words of one Ketema elder,
“A woman should be like the ground: whether you spit, pee or pound on it, it does not answer
back”.

The Project
WDIP is a community-driven development project that seeks to enhance women’s empowerment
and participation in development interventions by mobilizing women at the grassroots level and
capitalizing on their potential to support development processes. It does so by facilitating the
formation of self-help groups, strengthening existing grassroots groups, and enhancing women’s
capacity to act collectively, thereby aiming at increasing the social and economic welfare of their
households. It also provides training to enhance business skills and awareness on women’s
issues.

WDIP seeks to redress gender imbalances in development opportunity by investing in women’s
skills, productivity, and organizational capacity. The project components include (1) a demand-
driven fund that finances women’s group activities, such as grain and spice processing,
handicraft production, and the rearing of animals and poultry; (2) capacity building and training
for women’s groups and other project stakeholders on organization, facilitation, project design,
appraisal, and monitoring and evaluation; and (3) information, education, and communication
activities that enhance gender awareness (World Bank 2000a).

The remainder of this chapter outlines the objective and conceptual framework (2) and
methodology of the study (3). It then proceed with the analysis of women’s empowerment and
the determinants of empowerment (4), and finally with the impact evaluation of WDIP (5).

2 OBJECTIVE AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The objective of this study is two-fold. The first is to measure the level of empowerment of poor
Ethiopian women and study the determinants of key empowerment outcomes in four domains
(economic, political, social and psychological). The second is to evaluate the impact of WDIP on
empowerment in these same four domains.

Conceptually, to meet these objectives, the study treats asset endowments and institutions (i.e.
the rules of the game) as the elements of the opportunity structure that each woman faces.

Starting from these structures, women decide to either participate or not in one or more domains
under consideration. For example, women may chose to participate or not in the labor force, or in
social groups. In other words they choose to exercise their agency in these domains. Given their
participation, influence is measured as the returns to their assets controlling for prevailing
institutions. The outcomes are selected indicators in each domain that represent the level of
achievement in each. For example, income is one of the outcomes in the economic domain and
number of people one can rely on is one of the outcomes in the political domain. Outcomes may
also encompass changes in opportunity structure variables, such as skill acquisition.

The framework is similar to a participation model, where individuals decide to participate
depending on their assets and on the institutional environment they face. Once the individual
participates, then outcomes are a function of individual assets within the structure of returns
determined in the market.

The treatment of these elements differs slightly from that suggested in the rest of the book, in as
much as opportunity structure includes both assets and institutions. Because of definitions used,
the difference between the two models is little more that one of semantics. Looking at Figure 1
and the variables used in each boxed category, this study, in the terminology of this book,
measures effective agency, or empowerment. Thus there are in reality no substantive differences
in the conceptual frameworks. Yet, the terminological differences require careful interpretation
of narrative reporting. Where the term “agency” is used in the WDIP evaluation document, this
book substitutes “empowerment” and where the term “opportunity structure” is used in the
WDIP evaluation, this book unpacks variables and subsequent analysis by institutions and assets.

3 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

This section outlines the instruments and sampling frame used in this study, and provides a
review of the types of variables collected.

Instruments and Sampling

The study used a mixed method, combining a secondary source review with qualitative data
collection and a quantitative household survey.

   The secondary source review screened both legislation as well as other research work on
    women’s empowerment. This served to provide information on the existence of the formal
    institutional framework under which women live. Screening research documentation
    furthered understanding of the realities of women’s lives and helped refine the focus of the
    study.

   The qualitative fieldwork was undertaken in four kebeles in the Amhara region and four
    kebeles in and around Addis Ababa. It involved 80 in-depth interviews with key informants
    (kebele officials, business women and men, community leaders, elders, WDIP
    representatives, religious leaders and civil servants), 24 individual interviews with
    community men and women (both WDIP beneficiaries and non beneficiaries), and 16 focus
    group discussions with beneficiary women, non beneficiary women, men, and mixed gender
    groups. The qualitative fieldwork characterized the situation of women in these communities,
    helped understand how poor local women perceived empowerment, investigated how women
    operated within their environment, and identified the outcomes that could be used to measure
    the impact of WDIP. Results from the qualitative fieldwork informed the preparation of the
    survey instrument.

   The quantitative work was undertaken in five kebeles in the Amhara region and six kebeles
    in Addis Ababa. The survey was delivered to a total of one thousand households. About half
    of the observations were households of beneficiary women, and the other half households of
    women who had wanted to participate but had been rationed out on a random draw.

    The selection of communities for the qualitative fieldwork was purposive and based on
    several considerations. On the assumption that urban areas are at the vanguard of change and
    that they offer women an expanded set of opportunities (economic, reduced peer pressure,
    etc.), both rural and urban communities were selected to allow for analysis of the process of
    change currently taking place in Ethiopian society. Only communities that were beneficiaries
    of the Women Development Initiative Project (WDIP) were selected. This choice was based
    on the need to measure the impact of increased social awareness and economic opportunity
    on women’s own sense of empowerment. The project in each community was sufficiently
    small that changes on outcomes at the community level and spillover effects are thought to
    be small. In addition, only WDIP communities where beneficiary selection had been
    undertaken in a random manner were chosen to ensure the availability of an appropriate
    control group.

    The study visited all project areas in Amhara and Addis Ababa regions to compile a full list
    of beneficiary women and women who had presented themselves for project selection but

                                                4
    had been randomly excluded from the project due to rationing. Sample selection for the
    survey based fieldwork was a random sample of the complete list of beneficiary (treatment
    group) and randomly excluded women in these project areas (control group). Capitalizing on
    this “natural” experiment, we assume that average characteristics were the same at the
    inception of the program in the two groups.

    This sample is used to measure empowerment and study the determinants of empowerment.
    Regression models for key outcome variables are developed in each domain of interest and
    hypothesis tested accordingly. As the sample is not a random sample of the population but a
    random sample of beneficiaries and excluded women, mean values for indicators should be
    interpreted accordingly and not compared, for example, with means from population samples
    (e.g. DHS).

    The impact evaluation portion of this study proceeds to compare average results in outcome
    variables, and measure impact as the simple difference in average outcomes between the
    treatment and the control group. Because of the absence of a baseline survey for our study,
    more reliable difference in difference estimates of impact are not available. Because of this,
    results must be interpreted carefully in case the assumption of identical initial conditions for
    the treatment and control group does not hold. Econometric analysis is used to control for
    possible differences in opportunity structure in the two groups. The self-assessment portion
    of the survey is also used to gauge the direction of change in outcomes of interest. Self-
    assessments however are notoriously generous on program results. The analysis will take this
    in consideration.


Indicators

The types of indicators used in this study include: (i) asset endowments (human, financial,
social), (ii) formal and informal institutions and rules of the game, (iii) agency (participation in
the labor force, social and political activity, etc), and (iv) outcomes (income, happiness, etc.).
The qualitative and quantitative instruments gathered data on women’s indicators in the
economic, political, social and psychological domains. Empowerment indicators mainly
corresponded to the local and intermediary level.

Annex 2 provides the full list of indicators used in this study. The list is long but to illustrate, in
the economic domain:
     Asset variables include schooling, marketable skills, and experience
     Institutional variables include access to markets, finance and information, traditional
       gender roles, and service provision
     Agency variables include participation in labor force, and demand for loans
     Outcome variables include income, change in assets, and loans received

In the political domain:
     Asset variables include literacy, information, and personal experience
     Institutional variables include legal framework and traditional practices
     Agency variable include participation in groups, participation in community meetings,
        speaking in public, and breaking traditional rules of conduct


                                                   5
         Outcome variables include number of people women can rely on for support, women’s
          effect on community decisions, awareness of women’s rights and protection, and
          awareness of low female representation in government

In the social domain:
     Asset variables include family background, personal authority, and knowledge on
        traditional harmful practices (THP)
     Institutional variables include gender roles and traditional rules of conduct, domestic
        violence, and THP
     Agency variable include willingness to take independent decisions, and getting involved
        in THP training
     Outcome variables include freedom, sending girls to school, stopping THP at home,
        going out alone, or riding a cart

In the psychological domain:
     Asset variables include age and education, and physical and mental health
     Agency variable include eating, working and sleeping
     Outcome variables include happiness, and capacity to aspire


4 EMPOWERMENT OUTCOMES AND DETERMINANTS


4.1       Explaining Empowerment

Ethiopian women have low levels of empowerment across the economic, political, social and
psychological domains. Even though some reforms at the macro-institutional level have taken
place, tradition still rules over most aspects of life for the average poor Ethiopian woman.

Economic domain
Results from the qualitative data analysis suggested that women suffer from low levels of asset
endowment, such as education, skills and experience. Poor services and traditional roles put high
demand on women’s time and constrain their labor force participation. They also face few job
opportunities due to the combination of poor growth in the Ethiopian economy and little access
to input, output and credit markets and information.

Quantitative analysis confirms many of these findings. Human capital endowments as measured
by literacy are very low. Overall, sixty percent of women sampled report being illiterate. The
situation is worse in the rural areas were illiteracy characterizes three quarters of the female
population. Having a more educated father, however, can improve prospects significantly. Thirty
two percent of women report being illiterate if their father had a primary education down from
66 percent for women born of fathers with no education; and only 16 percent report illiteracy if
their father had a secondary education or more.

As measured by skills, around 90 percent of women report good or excellent housework and
cooking skills. But the percentage falls to a third or less for more marketable skills: 14 percent of
women report good or excellent weaving skills, 5.5 percent pottery making skills, 21.4 percent
farming skills, and 32.8 percent animal raising skills. On less measurable skills, women rank
                                                 6
themselves quite high, showing a certain level of self-confidence. Between 60 and 80 percent of
women rank their money management, leadership, and peoples’ skills and creativity above
average!

The cycle of low investment in girls perpetuates differences in human capital and economic
outcomes. Girls continue being employed in non-remunerative and non-marketable activities,
while their brothers are allowed time to work on their schooling. Girls are responsible for every
type of household chore many times over their brothers, and are called to substitute for their
mother’s labor two to three times more often than boys. In 92 to 100 percent of the cases, it is a
female child that is kept from school to help with household chores! In any weekday, 42 percent
of boys and 36 percent of girls spend time on school work; while 11 percent of boys and 63
percent of girls spend time on housework.

Poor services continue to inflict costs on women. Only 3% of women have a tap inside the house
and only 33% within their compound. The rest must walk to public water points, wells and rivers
to get their water. On average the closest water point is at a 14 minute walk. Lack of gas and
electricity force women to use biomass as their main source of cooking fuel (81%). Seventy-one
percent of rural women collect their own firewood and 11 percent more purchase it. Even in
urban areas, firewood is used by 66 percent of women. Overall water fetching and firewood
collection together cost women 50 minutes a day, on average, and in the rural areas as much as
one hour and twenty minutes.

Low human capital and poor services combine with inadequate access to markets, financing and
information. Four out of ten women think it improper to ride a cart or an animal. So, women go
to the trade market alone (81%), on foot (64%) and walk for an average of 5 kms on an unpaved
road (64%). This is strenuous activity, particularly when carrying heavy loads. But most women
can do this with no difficulty (average difficulty is only 1.13 out of 4). Lack of financing ranks
number one among the economic constraints faced by women (with an average score of 6 out of
7). This is confirmed by a measure of credit rationing: 56 percent of women claim that they
would take a loan today at available rates if they could. For the most part credit rationing is due
to the lack of financial development in the country, but it also has a gender component. When
women are asked whether lender trust men or women more to repay debts, half of women think
men are more trusted by lenders. But when they are asked whether men or women are better at
repaying their loans, three quarters think women are better at it. It is likely that lenders are
underestimating women’s credit worthiness, and lending less than optimally from an economic
point of view. The inability to apply for a loan due to illiteracy may also come into play. In terms
of access to information, illiteracy again is a powerful impediment. Only 13-15 percent of
women read newspapers or posted bulletins. The majority relies on word of mouth, mainly
family and friends (85%), community meetings (65%) and the radio (50%). About half of
urbanized women watch television. On most counts, the situation is significantly better for urban
than for rural dwellers.

Constraints notwithstanding, the poor cannot afford not to work. In the words of one woman,
“We are too poor not to work or for our husband to have an issue with it.” Female labor force
participation among respondents is 96 percent with an employment rate of 75 percent. This
compares to their husband’s employment rate of 92 percent out of a 95 percent participation rate.
The much larger active unemployment of women (21% vs. 3%) points to gender differences in
employment opportunities and agency. Further, employed women earn only 114 Birr per month
on average while employed husbands gain almost twice that (220 Birr).

negotiation skills, and health), social capital and family background. Institutions include access
to markets and information, as measured by distance to markets, use of information and distance
from information sources; cultural restrictions; and location (urban dummy). Participation in
WDIP is included to investigate the role of the project in improving economic outcomes.

The model successfully explains 89 percent of the variation in the dependent variable. As
expected, assets are strong determinants of economic outcomes. Among human capital variables,
years of schooling increase income albeit at a decreasing rate. Returns are highest for the first
few years of schooling, but fall sharply after that, reflecting the lack of opportunities for more
educated women. Years of experience also have positive returns—each year of experience
adding 9 birr per month to a woman’s income. A woman’s ranking of her negotiation skills
relative to those of a man is also a very significant signal on her ability to earn. For example, a
woman who ranks herself ‘much better than a man’ in her negotiation skills gains on average 62
birr more than the woman who ranks herself ‘somewhat better than a man’. Finally, health as
measured by the number of days of sickness in the last six months significantly decreases
monthly income, each day of sickness lowering income by the prevailing daily wage (4 birr).
Social capital, as measured by the number of people one can rely on for a small amount of
money, does not appear to be a significant determinant of income. Parental background,
measured by the father’s level of education, is negative and significant. This reflects the finding
that women from a better social background are less likely to work outside the home and when
they do they work fewer hours.

Institutional variables affect income significantly. Access to markets is important. Women live,
on average, at 2 kilometers from the produce market. Each additional kilometer decreases
monthly income by an astonishing 88 birr. Distance from the main trading market on the other
hand affects income in an unexpected direction. Trading markets are sparer and average distance
is about 5 kilometers, but an additional kilometer from the market adds to a woman’s income an
estimated 11 birr a month. As interpreted together, what the result say is that it is better to be
relatively closer to the produce market than to the trade market. This makes sense if women are
mostly involved in food processing. As for access to information, women who watch television
earn 130 birr more than the average. Since television is only available in the urban areas and
even there, less than half of the women have access to it, the variable must be a proxy for women
living in better than average urban milieu. On average, the closest phone is at a distance of three
quarters of an hour on foot. The estimated parameter is positive but not significantly different
from zero. Cultural restrictions, as a self identified economic constraint, does not appear
significant, while location definitely is. Living in Amhara rather than Addis decreases earning by
79 birr per month. This might reflect purchasing power differences, and/or the level of economic
opportunities for women in the capital city.
                                                 8
Results finally point to a strong positive effect of WDIP on economic outcomes. Participants
earn between 35 and 167 birr more a month than non participants (98% confidence interval).

Political domain
Review of secondary sources reveals that women’s empowerment is low in the political and
institutional domain. Their political representation is among the lowest in the continent, and so is
their ability to affect political decisions. Representation in the national civil service is only 8%,
less than 2% in the Parliament, and 5% in elected regional councils.8

Results from participatory data collection suggest that “it is one in a thousand the woman who
can speak in public and make herself be heard”. But that one, men say, will speak for all women
and make a difference. She will raise issues of social interest like water and sanitation and
harmful traditional practices that would not otherwise be raised. Conversations with focus groups

also reveal that continuous participation in meetings teaches women to be more forthcoming in
expressing their opinions in public.

Regarding the rule of law, and notwithstanding the legal reforms implemented at the national
level to eliminate outward discrimination against women, the participatory stage of the study
pointed to the problems associated with a dual judiciary system of regular and traditional courts
that perpetuate the use of discriminatory rules against women by delaying the application of
modern family law. During focus groups and interviews women shared many a tale of
discrimination by the local courts. Traditional courts were found to encourage women to submit
to their husband’s will, obey his orders, and stay home. In some divorce cases, women were
asked to leave the household and their property to their husband, or, in the case of their
husband’s death, to estimate the value of her property at 100 birr ($12), and assign no share of
land and other household property to her.

Issues investigated during the quantitative stage of this study include participation in groups,
women’s awareness with their political representation and rights, and access to state institutions
and their perceived fairness.

 Political representation and participation in groups. The women interviewed are poor women
with little opportunity for accessing government positions. Their participation at the level of
community groups and associations, however, is quite high. Ninety-one percent of respondents
belong to one or more Eder (funeral club), 16 percent to one or more Tsewas (religious groups)
and 14 percent to an Ikub (ROSCA). Overall, among the women interviewed all belong to at
least one group. The main reason for participating is to get emotional support in the case of Eder
(72%), to pray for a Tsewa (73%), and to obtain financing in the case of Ikub (79%). The
outcome of participation is consistent with the initial motivation. Eighty-three percent received
                                                      emotional support from an Eder, 34% felt they

a. Dependent Variable: Social K Women affect decisions



In terms of political representation, a very significant portion of women do not seem to be aware
of just how low the level of female representation in government is. Thirty-two percent of female
respondents think that women are as well or better represented in Kebele councils as men.
Another ten percent simply does not know. Across, more than 40 percent of women do not know
that women are more scarcely represented than men in kebele and woreda councils, in the courts
and in the civil service. Contrary maybe to intuition, rural women are much more aware of this
than urban women. Only 12 percent of rural women, for example, think women are equally or
better represented in kebele councils than men. This might be associated with high female
participation in Women’s Association in the rural areas (60% vs 39% in urban areas).

The main reasons identified by respondents for low representation in kebele and woreda councils
are that women have poor education and experience, are home bound and do not present
themselves for election. But the majority of women think weak representation in the courts and
in the civil service is overwhelmingly the result of poor female education (62% and 73%
respectively).

To investigate some of the factors that determine the level of awareness of women on issues of
political representation, regression models are estimated relating awareness to literacy,
information, social capital, and location. Awareness of political representation variables include
representation in kebele councils, woreda councils, the courts and the civil service. They range
between 1 and 5 depending on whether women think female representation in various bodies of
                                               11
government is much greater, greater, same, less or much less than that of males. Explanatory
variables include key asset variables such as literacy, access to information (through family and
friends), distance from information sources, participation in groups, location, and religious
affiliation. A WDIP participation dummy is added to monitor WDIP effect on these outcomes.
The model has a relatively low explanatory power (16 percent at best) but it nonetheless points to
some of the factors that are significant in explaining awareness.

Estimation of the representation in kebele council model, for example, finds that literacy
increases the level of awareness significantly and so does obtaining information from family &
friends. Participation in social groups however is ambiguous: participation in religious groups
(tsewas) increases awareness while participation in funeral clubs (eders) seems to be negatively
associated with it. Women in Amhara are more aware than their counterparts in Addis, and being
a Muslim adds significantly to one’s level of awareness. Participation in WDIP does not have
any significant effect. These results are roughly consistent across awareness variables.

Rule of Law. The majority of women believe they are treated equally under the law (91%), and
that they are protected against violence at home (77%) and against sexual violence (75%). This
flies against the evidence provided by these same women on domestic violence, and in spite of

                                                      12
the fact that the law has no provisions against domestic violence or domestic rape. Even extra-
marital rape is exonerated if the woman can be coerced into marrying her aggressor.9

When their family is attacked or robbed or when they are raped, women go to the police (80%
and 74% respectively), but in case of domestic disputes or violence they instead take repair with
neighbors, family and friends (53% and 47%). In very few cases, women will go to the courts,
whether traditional or formal.

Overall, these institutions are said to take decisions fairly in each case. After family & friends,
the police receives the best fairness ratings (85%) followed by the traditional courts (82%) and
the formal courts (74%). These overall averages do not lend particular support to the findings
from the participatory stage. But looking at some of them in more detail might. Women do not
choose to recur to traditional courts, and in the case of domestic violence these courts receive the
lowest rating on fairness. Formal courts are also rated poorly on this count and well below the
attention given to the issue by friends & family. Police receives very good ratings but again the
lowest ones are awarded in domestic disputes and violence cases. This suggests that protection of
women may be weakest when the issue directly involves male versus female confrontations.

Logistical models of awareness on women’s rights are estimated to investigate the impact of
personal experience on the perceived gap between de jure and de facto rights of women.
Dependent variables are defined as the difference between the respondent opinion regarding the
rights of women and their purported ability to uphold those rights. Respondents who believe that
women should have a certain right but cannot uphold it in their society are assigned a level one
of awareness; the others a level zero. Awareness is then modeled against relevant personal
experience and WDIP participation.

Results confirm that personal experience is central to developing awareness around important
women’s issues. For instance, knowing at least one woman who was raped increases awareness
of the gap between the right to be protected and actual protection against sexual violence by 20
percent. Having chosen one’s husband decreases one’s awareness of the gap between the right
and ability to choose one’s husband by 6 percent, while being abducted increases that awareness
by 9 percent. Muslim women, who tend to both marry later and choose their husband, are less

a. Dependent Variable: Gap between right and ability to choose their own spouse



On political representation and protection under the law, Ethiopian women fare poorly on
empowerment. Results from WDIP evaluation suggest that there are ways to increase women’s
empowerment in this domain. The first and foremost is education. Second is teaching women to
associate and learn to speak up. Third is by providing them with opportunities that increase their
social standing in the community, turn them into role models, and increase their self-confidence
and capacity to aspire. Fourth is to provide information and training that increases women’s
awareness and exposure to women’s issues, including the law and the tension with traditional
practices, and harmful practices that undermine women’s capacity to ascertain their value, such
as early marriage and lack of schooling.

Social domain
In the social domain, within their home and within their community, women submit to traditional
codes of conduct. Large proportions of women believe it is improper for them to do or engage in
a whole series of activities and behaviors. They believe that it is improper for them to go to a bar
(84%) or walk at night alone (67%), to disobey their husbands (74%), to ride a bike or a cart
(42% and 39%), or wear trousers (35%). Their freedom is curtailed not only by force but by the
assertion of their own beliefs.

In addition, women submit to and perpetuate a host of traditional practices including genital
mutilation (82%), milk teeth extraction (32%), and forced and early marriage (11% before the
age of 12 and 60% before the age of 18). In this sample, only 55 percent of women were able to
choose their own husband, and as many as 4 percent were abducted. Thirty-one percent of
respondents know at least one woman who was abducted, and while few admit to rape (2%),
many say they know at least one woman who has been raped (26%). These practices are even
more common in the rural areas where 95 percent of the women are genitally mutilated, 40
percent had their teeth extracted, 15 percent were married before age 12 and 75 percent before
age 18. When asked whether their girls will be submitted to the same fate most women deny.

Looking at the determinants of the age of marriage, we find that living in Amhara rather than the
capital city tend to decrease the age at which women marry by almost two years. But schooling
will significantly delay marriage—each year of schooling adding almost half a year to the
woman’s age of marriage. A girl will also marry later the lower her social background is relative
to that of the (perspective) husband. Finally, the model confirms that Muslim women marry later
than Christian women by as much as 1-2 years on average.

a. Dependent Variable: Age at Marriage



The host of traditional practices and beliefs affects intra-marital relations and intra-household
bargaining. Married on average at age 17 to a man of 25, and moved to her in-laws house, the
young wife is immediately at a bargaining disadvantage. Her belief that she must obey her
husband (74%), and that she cannot openly voice disagreement with him (69%) or her in-laws
(44%) limits her control over her own life and her ability to take household decisions.

In the great majority of households, husband’s supremacy is enforced through physical beatings.
“The woman is like a donkey”, a traditional saying goes, “she must be beaten to ensure her
docility”. Circumstances under which a man beats his wife include cheating (82%), husband’s
jealousy (68%), disobeying (62%), saying or doing something the husband disapproves of
(58%), disagreeing openly with the husband (52%), even regularly to maintain authority (35%),
and for no other reason than when the husband is drunk (66%).

But the most troubling statistic of all is that almost half of the female respondents identify at
least one acceptable reason why a man should batter his wife! This includes one-fifth of women
who think their husband has a right to beat them when they disobey him, and 5 percent who
uphold his right to beat them regularly.

A regression model of domestic violence indicates that stress in family life is significantly and
positively correlated with all domestic beatings whether regular ones to maintain husband
authority or beatings related to specific reasons. The only exception is beating resulting from
wife infidelity. Living in urban areas significantly increases beatings. This is certainly the result
of many factors: one might be the availability of alcohol, two greater urban stress, and third
men’s attempt to maintain tradition within an urban context where women have more of an
opportunity to break with traditional rules and roles. Indeed, women’s awareness of their rights
                                                 16
and the lack of protection of those rights tend to be associated with more beatings from their
husband, even though the direction of causality remains unclear. But so does being a more
traditional wife—the one who believes it is improper for her to go to a bar alone. Traditional
women tend to suffer more from beatings, maybe because they are more willing to accept it. But
possibly the most interesting result of all is that women who chose their own husband, which
represents 45% percent of the sample, are beaten less then women who had their husband chosen
for them. The latter group includes women who married as a result of abduction and rape.

Given how widespread physical intimidation is in the poor Ethiopian household, one issue is to
assess the amount of control that women have in household management and management of
household resources. Women tend to have a greater say on small consumption decisions (67% of
women take that decision by themselves). These include everyday food purchases, such a coffee,
salt and spice. Men retain their say on larger consumption and investment decisions. Only 16
percent of women would take on their own a decision on big food items, and about one in ten
would take a decision on adult clothing, children clothing, medicines and medical care, and
school supplies. The husband would not make these decisions on his own either. Most decisions

                                                              18
are made in consultation. If disagreement ensues, however, it becomes clear from the discussion
above that it is the husband who has the last say.

It is in the realm of reproductive and sexual decisions where women are least empowered.
Thirteen percent of men will take the decision of having another child without consulting the
wife, but no woman would. Similarly 7 percent of men versus only 3 percent of women will
make decisions about contraception without consulting the spouse. And while almost no wife
will initiate sexual encounters (0.4%) or discuss the possibility with her husband (1%), 27
percent of men take the decision of having sex with their wives without consulting them.

What are then some of the factors that help explain women’s control over domestic decisions?
One hypothesis is that reduced economic dependency provides women with a greater say in
domestic affairs. This would come as the result of both the authority that comes from having a
job or running a business and from contributing a greater share to household resources. Another
hypothesis is that relative social standing of women vis-à-vis their husband might affect their
bargaining power. These hypotheses are tested through a series of logistic regressions looking at
the effect of income, WDIP participation and family background on the ability of women to take
decisions on their own.

The first hypothesis is confirmed through econometric results while the second hypothesis is not.
Regarding decisions on large food items, adult clothing, children clothing, medicines and
medical care, school supplies, and children schooling, we find that the woman’s income
significantly increases independent decision making while her participation in WDIP does not.
Living in urban areas also strengthens independent decision making while family background, as
measured by father’s education, affects it negatively, when significant. A woman’s income also
affects her ability to take decisions on purchase of animals and farm inputs, but not on business
tools nor inputs, house durables, kitchen utensils, farm tools, and yard animals. Finally, the effect
of participation in WDIP is significant and positive in affecting sheep and cattle purchases. This
makes sense since so many of WDIP women are involved in sheep fattening activities, and their
business decision would be made within their group and not within their household.

Overall empowerment in the social domain is weak. Economic achievement is one factor helping
women strengthen their control over social outcomes but this is clearly not enough. Strengthened
awareness and legal protection of women’s right and against violence and abuse has to be part
and parcel of an approach to solidify women social empowerment. And cultural change will be
affected by increased education, information and training.

Psychological domain
Half of the women felt sad in the previous week, 31 percent cried a lot, 34 percent did not feel
like eating, 29 percent did not feel like doing their work, and 42 percent suffered from restless
sleep. The incidence of these signs of depression is high relative to a 22 percent marker from,
e.g., U.S. Study on Moods.10 Eighty-two percent of women claimed to suffer from stress over
economic resources and opportunities, 50 percent over uncertainty about the future, 39 percent
over the children’s future, 35 percent over control to make decisions on one’s life, and 28 percent
over loneliness and isolation. An astonishingly high 58 percent of women say that this stress
interferes with their normal activities. Still, women’s capacity to aspire in undiminished. Eighty-
seven percent of them believe their children will have a better life with more freedom and
opportunities.

Investigating the determinants of happiness is a challenging task. Women were asked to match
their level of happiness to one of five expressions on a smiley face (very happy, happy, neither
happy nor sad, sad, very sad). The resulting variable is regressed against age and education,
10
  Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles reported findings from a population of 4,161 women aged 36-44. That study
found significant depressive symptoms in 22.4 percent of the sample.
                                                     21
physical and mental health, employment status, location, family background, current income,
social capital and the (unlikely) event of being raped. The model developed here is able to
account for a surprisingly large amount of the variation in women’s response to their level of
happiness (64%). Significant variables include parental background: the more educated the father
the least likely is the woman to feel happy. This is intuitive given the fact that the regression
controls for current income levels: given the same income, the women with higher socio-
economic background are relatively less happy than those with lower socio-economic
background. Physical health as measured by days of sickness in the last six months significantly
increases the level of happiness. Although this is counterintuitive, it may be the result of a
feeling of relief after having recovered from sickness. Mental health, on the other hand, as
measured by stress over economic resources, has a large and significant negative effect on
happiness as it would be expected. Social capital, measured as the number of people one can rely
upon for support, significantly increases happiness. Participation in WDIP is significant and
positive. This is in addition to a large and significant effect from being employed and to no
significant effect from income, which implies that the mood benefits of WDIP participation
come from factors other than employment, income or expanded social capital. This might
indicate that participants are simply feeling better about themselves, about their place in society
and in their level of control over their lives and that of their children. Finally, a domestic
violence variable, which was added to monitor the effect of beatings on depression, has instead a
positive and significant effect on happiness. However surprising, this result is robust across
different domestic violence variables.

4.2    The Impact of the Project on Empowerment of Women
The WDIP targets poor and disenfranchised women and offers a chance for these women to
come together and start a productive activity. It combines economic opportunity and financing
with social capital building, skill development and increased awareness around women’s issues.
Overall, the evidence suggests that WDIP-type intervention can significantly impact women’s
sense of self-worth, and empower them to take control of their lives. The evidence also shows
that the economic impact of the intervention might be significant but that improvements in the
business model supported by this project might strengthen economic outcomes and long-term
sustainability.

The impact analysis in this section relies on two sources: participants’ self-assessment, and
simple difference in average outcomes between the treatment and the control group at the time of
observation, under the assumption that those differences were zero at the beginning of project
implementation due to randomization of self-selected petitioners. This assumption may not fully
hold. Judging by average endowments, which are not likely to be affected by the project, it can
be concluded that women in the control group are somewhat better off than women in the
treatment group. For example, among non-beneficiaries 45 percent of women are literate versus
only 38 percent among beneficiaries. Non-beneficiaries married at age 18 on average and
beneficiaries at age 17 (which indicates lower social background or more rural setting). Because
of this, measured differences in outcomes (measured impact) can be considered a lower bound
on actual differences (true impact). In other words measured differences will underestimate true
differences. Econometric analysis in this and the previous section is used to control for
differences in initial conditions by using variables, like schooling, that are not affected during
the life of the project. Self-assessment, on the other hand, tends to overestimate impact, and can
be roughly considered an upper bound on true impact.

Economic domain
Economic outcomes. Judging by beneficiary self-assessment, economic outcomes improved
greatly under WDIP. Women report on average a 59 birr change in monthly income (accounting
for 48% of current beneficiary income) and 420 birr change in accumulated assets (accounting
for 20% of total household assets). Women also report a 28 hour change in the hours of work per
week. This implies a daily wage of almost 4 birr (the prevailing female daily wage in Amhara).
In addition, 65 percent of women say they can negotiate prices better than before and 74 percent
claim they have gained business skills.

Measured average differences between treatment and control, however, are negative. In the
control group, women have 13 birr more of income per month and 211 birr more in household
assets. This confirms that asset endowments need to be controlled for when comparing treatment
and control because of differences in initial conditions. When controlling for asset endowment
and access variables within the income regression model estimated in 4.1, the impact of WDIP
participation is 101 birr mid-point estimate of a 35-167 birr confidence interval (98%).

obtained by older groups—the ones that received project funding more than two years ago (93
birr change in income and 587 birr change in assets). This implies that measured impact can be
expected to improve as businesses age. Indeed most women are well aware that they had not yet
achieved satisfactory levels of income, but they are also confident that profits would increase in
the future. Another finding is that the most lucrative business by far among those WDIP groups
engage in is sheep and cattle (112 birr change in income and 613 birr change in assets).

What is then the cost-effectiveness of WDIP relative to income changes? The following figures
should only be taken as indicative since they hinge on several assumptions. WDIP transfers
$4,000 to each group. Let us assume an average group size of 15, a business life of five years,
and a project overhead of 20 percent. Taking the estimated confidence interval of income gains
between 35 and 167 birr per month, and with a rate of discount of 10 percent per annum, the net
present value (NPV) of the investment would range between a loss of $1,990 and a gain of
$8,606 per group attended. The internal rate of return (IRR) over five years would range between
-8% and 68% a year. Using the self-assessed gain in income (59 birr), the IRR would be 10%.

Project assessment and discussions with beneficiaries suggest that there might be ways to
improve the economic returns of this project. The first issue is group size. Groups falling below
ten women lose their benefits. Firm theory suggests that the optimal firm size depends on
transaction costs, economies of scale, specialization and technology. The businesses within
WDIP have little or no division of labor or economies of scale except maybe in marketing, and
use traditional technologies. Yet they must sustain significant transaction costs to keep the group
together. Economic viability might be improved by reducing minimum group size, introducing
new technology, and diversifying business activity.

Access to markets. Market indicators suggest beneficiary women are engaged in more tradable
activities than non-beneficiary women. Between 12 and 15 percent more beneficiaries than non
beneficiaries go to the produce and trade markets to buy inputs for their activity and sell outputs.
And while most women walk to the market, beneficiary women are more likely to be
                                                24
accompanied by someone else. This might be because of the increased load they carry and might
indicate that their activity is now recognized as economically viable and deserving of support. In
addition, fewer beneficiary than non-beneficiary women think access to market is a constraint to
their economic activity. Only 21 percent of beneficiary women rank access to market among the
top three problems affecting economic activity while more than 28 percent of non-beneficiary
women do.

 Access to finance. Financial markets are still elusive. Beneficiary women are less likely to ask
for a loan or to receive one. In addition, the average size of the loans obtained is less than half
that of non-beneficiary women. As a result, beneficiary women feel more credit rationed than
              Credit by WDIP beneficiary and non-beneficiary           non-beneficiaries, and are

Non-beneficiaries tend to have a stronger showing in funeral clubs, religious groups, and credit

Regression analysis confirms this result. WDIP participation is positive and significant in
determining this social capital variable. Other significant variables include literacy, creativity
and religious affiliation. As it would be expected, urban location tends to decrease social
cohesion.

Social domain
The majority of participants say that since WDIP they have more freedom (71%), have more
power to make decisions in their household (59%), and have broken some of the unwritten rules
like wearing trousers (13%), going out alone to public places (55%), and riding bikes, animals or
carts (13%). Eighty-one percent say that they have learn more about traditional harmful
practices, have stopped them in their own household (64%), and got involved in teaching others
about them (55%). Thirty-five percent of women say they are now sending their children to
school.

Indeed, WDIP participants are somewhat less likely to uphold unwritten social rules. They are 6
percent less likely to believe farming is improper for a woman (although 7 percent more believe
construction is); 7 and 6 percent less likely that a woman should not ride animals or carts; and 10
percent less likely that she should not walk alone at night. But still more WDIP participants
believe that they should obey their husband, and more of them uphold their husband’s right to
beat them.

Even though so many more WDIP participants received training on traditional harmful practices
than non participants, they are still more likely to genitally mutilate their daughters, extract their
milk teeth and marry them off at an early age.

Results are ambiguous. WDIP might have had some impact on social mores, but it does not
appear to have had a major impact in this domain, at least not in the two-three year period under
observation.

Psychological domain
The qualitative data analysis suggests that women express an increased level of psychological
satisfaction. They feel they can aspire to something better in the near future, they are out of the
confines of their home, have established a group of women with whom to relate and plan, and
have gained some access to the local government offices. Overwhelmingly in the self-assessment
questionnaire, participants claim that they feel happier, less lonely and isolated (80%), and have
become someone others look up to (63%).

Straight comparison of averages between treatment and control does not provide much evidence
in this regard, except in the capacity to aspire for their children. Eighty-six percent of
beneficiaries envision a better life for their children with more freedom and opportunities, five
percent more than for non-beneficiaries. Otherwise WDIP participants report both higher
happiness and higher sadness levels. Depression indicators tend to be worse for participants than
for non participants. Seven to ten percent of participants versus only four to seven percent of
non-participants suffer from recurrent bouts of crying, sleeplessness and lack of motivation to eat
or work.

But, as we have seen in the previous section, when we control for education, family background,
and social capital, among other variables, WDIP participation becomes a positive and significant
determinant of happiness, accounting for almost one step change in the level of happiness on a
five steps ladder. So, overall, from self- assessment and econometric assessment, we can
conclude that WDIP has a positive impact on psychological wellbeing.

Overall, WDIP is found to have a positive impact on economic, political and psychological
outcomes. WDIP beneficiaries offer a menu of improvements for WDIP design that might help
strengthen these impacts and the long-term sustainability of sponsored projects. These include
strengthening the efficiency of project management (12%), reducing the compulsory group size
(14%), introducing new technology (5%), and expanding project financing (23%).

5 CONCLUSION
The study reviewed the level of empowerment in four distinct domains: economic, political,
social and psychological, and found that much progress must be made to improve the conditions
of women in Ethiopian society. In the economic sphere, women start from a disadvantaged
position in terms of both asset endowments and the rules that affect them. While agency is high
by necessity, women face fewer opportunities than men. Gaps in economic outcomes persist.
Expanding asset endowments, and improving services and access to markets are necessary to
strengthen economic outcomes of women and close gender gaps in remuneration. In the political
sphere, traditional beliefs and low education keep women from participating to a greater extent.
Efforts to organize women help in teaching them to speak up and influence decisions. But more
efforts must go to educate, inform and increase their awareness levels. More also must be done to
close the gap between formal and informal practices and thus improve women’s protection under
the law. In the social and psychological spheres, women are severely disadvantaged with the
large majority still suffering from genital mutilation, forced marriage, and domestic abuse.
Cultural change through training and awareness campaigns, and legal reform and enforcement
must combine to stop age long practices that humiliate women and lower their self-esteem.

The study also finds that interventions like WDIP might help in improving empowerment
outcomes but these interventions cannot be small and isolated, but must encompass reforms at
the macro-institutional level to more significantly expand economic opportunities for all,
aggressively closing the gender gap in education, and deepening legal reforms and strengthening
enforcement to protect women’s rights. WDIP has a clear impact on economic outcomes by
expanding access to opportunities, financing, information and training. These appear to spill over
the political and social spheres, helping women gain greater control over decisions that affect
their lives and that of their children. WDIP is also effective in expanding social capital outcomes
by providing an expanded support network and greater access to government. WDIP impact on
self-realization improves psychological outcomes and women’s capacity to aspire.
