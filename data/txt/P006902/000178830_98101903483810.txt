1.        The Government of Costa Rica requested a loan of US$32.6 million
(para. 21) to assist in financing an agricultural credit project involving
medium- and long-term on-farm investments, agricultural machinery, expan-
sion Of cotton ginning capacity and technical assistance. The loan would
be administered by the Banco Central through the four state commercial
banks.  This appraisal report is based on the findings of a field mission
composed of Messrs. D. Stoops (Leader), J. Andreu (IBRD), P. Peperzak (FAO),
F. Knobel (IBRD Consultant) and S. WHiilson (IBRD Consultant), which visited
the country in August-September 1965.
II.  BACKGROUND OF THEE COUNJTRY'S AGRICULTURE
20        Ccsta Rica has an area of 55,000 km2, most of it appropriate for
agricultural uses, but less than half actually under cultivation and
grazing, principally of an extensive character.   The country is divided
into four main climatic zones: (1) hot and dry tropical (Guanacaste,
North Puntarenas); (2) hot and monsooncl tropical (southern Puntarenas
ancl southern San Jose); (3) hot and humid tropical (Atlantic); (4) sub-
tropical (Central Plateau).  These four regions also mark the geographical
concentration of agricultural production: cotton and cattle breeding in
Guanacaste; bananas and cocoa in the Atlantic and South Pacific; coffee
ancl dairy cattle in the Central Plateaut and a diversified production in
the South Pacific. Corn, beans, and rice are grown throughout the country.
3.        Agricultural production represents approximately 33 per cent
of GDP, and agricultural exports 21 per cent, while industrial production
represents 14 per cent. Despite a rapid industrial expansion in the
sixties, GDP has increased at a slower pace than population since 1956,
resulting in a slowly declining per capita income through 1961. with
an improvement thereafter.
4.        Costa Rica will have to depend heavily on the agricultural
sector to strongly reverse the above general trend in the next decade.
Since the country is self-sufficient in most agricultural products and
its main traditional exports are either limited by absolute ceilings. e.g.
coffee under the International Coffee Agreement, or have been declining
in past years, e.g. cocoa (due to an unfavorable cost-price relationship),
the most promising opportunities for expansion seem to be in products
economically produced and already exoorted but at relative-Ly low levels,



e.g. meat, bananas, cotton, and new exports, e.g. pineapple. The result
woiuld 'e a higger and more balnced vo]lum-e cf 'nrnrution and exports.
.Beef cattle are rnised througrhou_t the cont   but are mainlv
concentratecL in Guanacaste Province. IHost of the herds are criollo
(native) or criollo crossed with Zebu.   Di. seases and pests are relt-ively
well controlled and the country is free of foot-and mouth disease.     Both
production aLnd exp0orts have steadly increaed in the last deadcae, the
la-tter amounting to US$5.1 million or four per cent of total exports in
1965.'J* ~~4±O~ J.LV Uan a hUav  bUL c4v±eA inV ex+ensiv  -ra   both i  +he

Cotton has been produced at an annual average of only 6,000 bales in
recent yearS, but its o-utput has mnore t;han do-ubled in 'he crop years
196!/66.   Pineapple production has been recently started in the Province
0±L rUI  tlIreircs and results looK promising.
6.        The Government has promoted a vigorous expansion of rice, bealn
and sorghum through the establishment of price support policies involving
heavy consumer subsidization, especial:Ly in the case of rice which has,
among other things, hampered the development of cotton as a substitute
crop. Subsidies are likely to be lowered under pressure from otner
Central American Conmon Market partners.
7.        Important Government contributions to the expansion of agri-
cultural production, rendered primarily through a relatively well-
organized Ministry of Agriculture, havea included the creation and develop-
ment of two experimental stations, one at Taboga in Guanacaste Province
and another at Los I)iamantes, in the Atlantic Region, coupled with an
extension service whlich now numbers more than 100 technicians throughout
the country. The Government has also started a program for the settle-
ment of squatters irn the Atlantic and South Pacific Regions. This program
is now administered by an autonomous body.
II]:. BACKGROUND OF AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
8.        The agricultural sector has traditionally enjoyed the services
of a relatively well extended and organized credit system which has
contributed greatly to its expansion in the recent past. Funds have
been made available generally at six per cent for all types of agri-
cultural lending, and a high percentage of credit has been supplied on
a medium- and long-term basis.   Another important function of the banks
has been the provision of storage facilities on a large-scale throughout
the country. The commercial banks have provided their storage facilities
in the absence of other suitable ones, both private and public. Wqhile
these facilities have filled an important need, the practice of their
being owned and oneratpd bv the commercial banks deserves careful analvsis
to determine the best arrangement for ownership and administration of a
nationral storaep sy-tpem.

The latter iplays a minor role in agricultural lerding and did not wish
to participate in the projected IBRD loan.   It is, therefore, omuittUed
from the following analysis of the banking system.
The Banco Central
10.       The Banco Central was established as an autonomous institution
by Law No. 1552 of April 1953. Its only office is located in San Jose
and is staffed by a body of professionals selected on the basis of
training and experience in their respective fields.
11.       The Banco Central has the responsibilities normally attached
to central 'banks. 'To discharge its credit responsibilities, it is empowered
to impose general and specific credit ceilings; to establish absolute
ceilings, determine the eligibility of documents and fix rates of redis-
counting; and finally, to change the percentage of legal cash reserves
of' banks. The Banco Central has made extensive use of the first two
measures.  It makes preliminary annual estimates of credit supply and
demand, apportions the supply according to banks' credit programs and
resources, both internal and external, and supplements these with alloca-
tions of its own. It reviews constantly the credit market situation and
adjusts its measures accordingly to promote the most appropriate and
timely use of funds. Finally, the Banco Central has participated directly
in the channeling of external funds, more than half of which (US$13.2
million in the last eight and a half years), it has distributed to
commercial banks on the basis of performance, including IBRD loans for
machinerv imnorts. 1/   The appraisal nmission checked the Banco Centralls
and commercial bankst records in processing external loans for agri-
cult.ural marhinery imnnorts annd fou]nd them satisfactorv

local offices numbering 158 (see map), more than 75 per cent of which
belong to the Ban-c-  Nacional.  Tne Livre to seven members oi the Board are
selected by the National Government Cabinet for four-year terms, and in
turn select; the general manager. Most of the country offices are managed
by experienced administrators and the technical appraisal work is done by
agriculturists of the banks.
Resources
14.       The Government made the original capital contribution to the
four banks,, Their combined net worth amounted to 0 296 million on
December 31:, 1964, roughly 50 per cent of which belong to the Banco
Nacional and 30 per cent to the Banco de Costa Rica. The banks have th ee
main sources of credit capital, which in the last five years have remained
relatively stable percentagewise as follows: (a) deposits, capital,
reserves, bonds issued, 77 per cent; (b) short-term rediscounting with
Banco Central, 12 per cent; (c) foreign loans, 11 per cent. Profits
have been mainly used to finance the construction of branch and agency
buildings. Capital and reserves have increased only 9 per cent since
1960 as compared to 36 per cent increase in the volume of lending, whichi
amounted to 0 1,147 million in July 31, 1965 (Annex 3 and 4). This has
been due mainly to decreased profitability of bank operations, net
operating income having been reduced from 1.54 per cent to o.88 per
cent of the total volume of lending between 1960 and 1964 (Annex 1, parall).
Interest rates as low as six per cent are increasinalv insufficient in
the face of mounting administration costs (Annex 5). Other sources of
financing include denosits. rediscounts with the Banco Central. bonds and
foreign loans. Main assets are loans to the private sector, which
represented more than 80 per cent of total assets on December 31. 1964
(Annex 4). The credit record of the commercial banks shows a steady
increase in arrears beyond 90 days. atlthough those over 180 days (excluldirn
unmatured installments) amounted to only five per cent of the total
volume of loans outstanding on DecePm-ber 31- 1961 (Annex 6)  TnLoss have
been kept at a very low level (Annex 1, para. 12).
Lending Policies and Procedures
15.       Agricultural lending has been increasing at five per cent
~rn.11ii -r.d has rersne      'toiiud 55 per cent of the bnk>;" s
loan portfolio since 1960.   Industry is second with an average of 14
n'    n + 4'or tbe same        &fllrd  7 / 0



16.       The agrictltural and livestock loan portfolio is distributed
rougUly as follows:
Ezbnu-r2pis               rer uenii
Cofifee
Beef. cattle                  21

Sugar cane
Cocoa                          1
Not classified                24
Total agricultural credit has been almost equally divided between short-
term operational and medium- and long-term investment 1/, the latter
showing a sLow rela-tive increase. In 1964/65, the distribution was 44
per cent and 56 per cent, respectively. The relative importance of
medium- and long-term credit has been due to heavy financing of invest-
ments in land and s-tock purchases, land clearing and equipment for
livestock, rice, cotton and beans production.   It is estimated that
between 65 and 75 per cent of the total number of 6h,ooo farmers are
obtaining credit from the banks. The extent of private non-institutional
lending is unknown, but appears unimportant.
17.       LDan making procedures are practically the same throughout the
banking system. At the head office level applications are reviewed in
the credit section, handed to the appraisal section for inspection of
the property and its uses, and technicans (agriculturists and financial
technicians) review the investment plan. They are then checked by the
legal office and transferred to the manager and/or to the Board of
Directors for final decision. In cases handled at the local level a
technician makes a field inspection of the property and the loan request
is subsequentlv decided upon by the manager and/or the local loan
committee. The legal status of real estate is certified by a public
registrar whenevpr it is nledged as collateral, Insnections of loans
approved are regularly made and plans for distressed loans worked out
betwP.n bhrrower anrl lonripr-. Toan n rrctsqns are relativelv long and
cumbersome duemainly to three factors: lack of personnel, excessive
cen.tralization at the hend office        nnvel   and the exaggerated administrative
burden placed on field technicians. Pleasures proposed to correct these
deficienci-es are stipanted ;n paras. 32

and livestock operations and development is being negotiated. Repayment
of outstanding loans is on schedule. 2There would be no overlap between
the 1DB and AID loans to small farmers and the proposed Bank loan to
medium. and commercial farmers.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Scope of the Project
190       The agricultural credit project would be for 0 66 million
(US$10 million) approximately 50 per cent of which would be financed
through a Bank loan and the remainder through loans made by the banking
system and through farmerst contributions.  Funds would be invested in
land preparation, pasture improvement, fertilizer, herbicides and
insecticides, fencing, water facilities, handling facilities, breeding
stock and semen, farm buildings, machinery and equipment, expansion of
cotton ginning capacity and technical services. These investments would
be made in selected areas in the fields of beef cattle, bananas, cotton
and pineapple in a period not to excee(d two and a half years. It is
interesting to note that the foreign exchange component of the proposed
Bank loan would be approximately 88 per cent (para. 35).
2o.       The size of the_ _rit_ has heen reidiind by annroximately two-
thirds of the ¢ 215 million (US$32.6 million) originally contemplated
in the loan ren uestsn   This reduction a hs been determined bvy  (1) the
limited availability of bank technicianls amd Ministry of Agriculturets
extension agents; (x) nroposd higher !:tandards that would be required
for appraisal and suLpervision which reduce the number of loans which
eac-h t+ePhnirnian  an process annually; (3) a shortage of' heavv macthinerv
contractors and operators for land clearance; (4) the limitation of the
lme11  oesM nfW bredngC cattle purc s under the ivesmtcok project;! (5 mnn
the elimination of investments in the coffee plantations due to a quicker
than e-.pected recovery of production f:rom the dami.ages of the Irazu volcano
eruption.

andi pineapple,  f 3.9 (Us$0.6). The cost of technical services and
facilities would be approximately 0 0.5 million (US$0.1).
Beef Cattle
22.       The beef cattle industry presents one of the best possibilities
for long run expansion in the agricultural field. Production can be
intensified mainly in Guanacaste and new development carried out in the
Central Atlantic and South Pacific Regions, which have good rainfall
distribution and fertile soils (see map).   The leniding program would
concentrate on pasture improvement including fertilizer, fencing, handling
and water facilities for approximately 150 to 180 ranches, writh herds of
at least 200 animals each and to a lesser extent in the purchase of
seLected breeding stock and semen and some agricultural machinery (Annex 9).
Domestic and. export demand would absortb the increase in production envisioned
(Annex.14).
Bananas
23.       Bananas are cultivated in medium and large farms and annual
production is marketed through three concerns: The United Fruit Company,
the Standard Fruit Comnanv and the T.Test Tndies Fr-uit Company. The con-
templated investments would be made on approximately 3,000 ha. in the

high quality of the fiber produced (Anunex 14).
Pineapple
25.       Pineapple is cultivated on a small-scale by commercial planters
and its production is highly mechanized.  The on-farm investmentJs planned,"
mainly on machinery, fertilizer and buildings (Annex 9) would make this
essentially a pilot project covering an area of approximately 1,000 ha.
in Buenos Aires and Puntarenas (see map). Approximately one-half of the
expected increased production would be sold to canneries in or around
San Jose and the rest exported to the UJnited States as fresh fruit, a
practice already proven economically justified in trial shipments (Annex 14).

26,       Thne project contemplates the prOviSiOn of technica  specialiss
from abroad for agricultural credit administration, pasture improvement
and livestock management, entomology and horticulture. The training of
more agriculturists and agents, and the further training of existing ones
in financial. analysis of projects will also be conducted to assure more
thorough evaluation of loans in the future (para. 30).  Related supplies,
equipment, transportation and amenities necessary to support all technical
services would also be eligible for financing out of the proposed loan.
C. Administration
27.       The credit program conternplates on-farm investments with dis-
bursement periods as follows on each farm: beef cattle, two years;
bananas and cotton, one year; pineapple3, four years. The Project cash-
flow shows the annual volume of lending and relending which is foreseen
during the :life of the proposed IBRD loan (Annex 10), as derived from
the contempLated consolidated profit and loss statement of the state
commercial banks (Annex 11) and the statements of their assets and
liabilities (Annex 1L2), both regarding the project.
28.       The Banco Central will be responsible for the administration
of the investment program operating through the four state commercial
banks   It will facilitate the provision of domestic bank financing and
allocate to the commercial banks the funds from the Bank loan according
to suitability of investment items, the pursuance of sound project
evaluation techniques, and pace of disbursement. It will constantlv
supervise the execution of the program and check the results obtained
after investments have been made. The Banco Central will need three to
four technicians specialized in agricultural credit and farm management
to fulfill these functionsr Such technicians are available locally.
290       The four state commercial banks are -rneted to particinpte
in the lending program in the same relative order of magnitude as
indicated by their present volume of onprations, The use of the four
banks for the proposed credit would permit the fullest utilization of
marnpower and other administration anyd technical resources avaJlehip in
the banking system, which should increase the speed of loan disbursement

use of tropical legumes which would be applicable both
in Costa Rica and in other semi-tropical and tropical
areas.
(5) An entomologist for the cotton project and a horti-
culturist for the pineapple project. These specialists
would spend from 3 to 6 months in Costa Rica at the
outset of the Project and would be available for further
consultations as their services are needed.
After consultation with Costa Rican officials, it is believed that most
of the specialists would have to be hired abroad. The appointment of
specialists would be made in consultation with the Bank. The Banco
Central will have the administrative responsibility for the specialists.
D. Lending Policies and Procedures
31.       Loan applications would be processed following the current
practices of the state commercial banks, which are considered appropriate,
with the necessary irprovements noted belowr. Terms for loan repayment
are considered to be appropriate for the types of investments envisaged
arid would be as follows:
(Years)

further ioan.s for similar investments over the life oI the proposed Bank
loan, after they deduct the repayments of the Banco Central loan, made
to them in the same terms as those of the Bank loan to the Banco.
32.       The follojing improvements are necessary for a proper and
timely utilization of the investment funds envisaged and appropriate
assurances have been obtained during negotiations:
(l)  The state commercial banks should speed the enforce-
ment of their present decentralization plans through
the delegation of authority to local bank offices.
This would enable local loan approval up to 0 40,000
for agencies, % 100,000 for managers of local branches
and up to 0 150,000 by the boards of directors of
local branches and by managers of central offices.
(2)  The state commercial banks should make technical
and financial analyses of loan applications before
granting such loans.
(3)  The state commercial banks should seek and receive
from each other information regarding applicantst
credit history and debt situation on a confidential
basis.
(L) The state commercial banks and the Ministry of
Agriculture should coorclinate the work of
extension officers directly associated with the
project with that of commercial bank technicians.

1/ Rounded figures
34.       The farmiers' contribution  is based on their estimated
capabilities in each field.  The banking system's contribution to the
project financing was calculated as feasible without causing undue strain
in their medium- and long-term availabilities.   The IBRD would provide
the balance of fin.ancing. The state commercial banks would provide the
necessary short-term credit (estimated to be in the order of magnitude
of 0 60 million through 1968) to supplement the medium- and long-term
credit made available under the project.
F. Procurement
35.       Procurement of all items financed would be through normal
commercial. channel.s. The countryz has a well established system ofl private
importers and dealers of farm machinery and equipment, fertilizer and
insecticicles, and produces most of the pasture irmrovement and fencing
materials needed under the project. Repair services are adequate.



- 12 --
G. Disbursement
36.       The documents pertaining to :Loans under the project would be
periodically presented to the Banco Central by the conmercial banks showing
disbursements made. They would be examined and classified as eligible by
the Banco Central before being submitted to IBRD for 60 per cent 1/ reimburse-
ment. Disbursements of direct costs of' technical services contracted by the
commercial banks would be for services rendered and associated costs as
specified in each contract with the consultants.   The Bank would disburse 6C
per cent of the cost; of these services.

IntroCduction ofI new and better lending policies and procedures in the field
of agricultulre; improved technical preparation of bank technicians and
field extension officers; strengthening of staff connected with the above
operations as a permanent contribution for further development; and creation
of newf employment opportunities, especially in the banana and cotton sec-tors.
The project contributions to increased production and exports are particularly
relevant in view of the past decline in per capita income and the importance
of improving the outlook for Costa Rica's balance of payments through higher
export earnings. Project benefits would compare favorably with those of
past agricultural investments, which were not necessarily accompanied by
the above mentioned technical, economic and administrative improvements.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOHiMEVIbNDATIONS
40.       Costa Rica, is endowed with a wide variety of climatic conditiorns
and generally ferti]e soils. It has not made sufficient use, however, oil
its agricultural resources, with the result that annual increases in
agricu.turaL product-ion have lagged behind annual population increases ir
recent yearS. At this critical stage, the proposed credit project which
emphasizes investments in the most productive enterprises would make an
important contribution to the development of the national economy.
41.       Banco Cent;ral and commercial bankst staffs, when augmented and
further trained, woulid be capable of adiministering the credit project
envisaged.
42.       The project is technically sound and economically justified,
warranting an IBRD ].oan of US$5 million to be rapaid in 20 years including
a five-year grace period. The borrower would be the Banco Central, which
would also bear the exchange risk.
43.       The following assurances have been obtained during negotiation::
(:L) The Banco Central, the state commercial banks and
the M4inistry of Agriculture Extension Service would
increase their staff and would establish training
programs (paras. 28 and 30).
(2)  The ,pecialists deemed inecessary under the project
would be appointed in consultation wi-th the Bank
(para. 30).
(3) The Banco Central will have the administrative
responsibility for the specialists required (para. 30).
(1X) The upper limit for the aggregate of loans to any
indivicidial horrower without prior BRqnk annrovqI irnder
the project would be $9 700,0CO except in the case of

II. The Banco Central
Organizatio:n, Management and Functions
2.        The Banco Central has a board of directors, manager, auditor,
treasurer, and three main departments: economic studies, foreign commerce,
and accounting.
3.        Besides the general powers and functions referred to in the main
body of the report, the Banco Central can:
(1)  loan to commercial banks for terms shorter than one
year for operations involving small farmers and in
conditions similar to those prevailing in the Juntas
Rura:Les of the Banco Nacional;
(2)  loan to commercial banks for terms not longer than
90 days with the security of public bonds and in
times of emergency for the same period without such
a guarantee;

(3)  loan for up to one year to institutions carry-
ing out agricultural price stabilization program;
(lo)  loan to commnercial banks, the proceeds of ex-
ternal loans, and make disbursements in anticipa-
tion of forthcoming external funds; and
(5) Buy and sell first grade highly liquid securities.
L.        The Banco Central has also been useful in other ways.   Its
Economic Department has made marketing studies of agricultural and indus-
trial commoidities and has also done valuable research in external trade
and Central American Common Market matters; special ad hoc committees
have studied the structure of the banking svstem, its functions and limi--
tations, and recommended desirable reforms; and it has either directed
or cooperated in the nrepanratioTn nf 'cin=ifinrproets rveqniring external
financing, as was the case with the credit project submitted to IERD.
II. The    o-Iercil Bankls
Organization and Management
5.        The four State commercial banks have each:
(:L) a Board of Directors of five to seven members ap-
pointed by the Central  ovtme      C-     f
four-year terms;
(2) Manager;
(3) Auditor;
(h)  Commercial and Mortgage Departments; and
(z)  sections for Credit, Appraisals, Deposits, Foreign
Exchange, Accounting, branches and offices, Legal
and Administration.  An organization chart of the
Banco Nacional appears in Annex 2.
6.        Three of the four banks have their head offices in Jan Jose.
The four banks have 158 offices distributed throughout the country as
f ollows:

These facilities are more than sufficient to meet present needs, since
there exists a cert,ain degree of duplication of services in the main
centers of economic activity.
7.        Approximately 235 administrative and technical staff are direct-
ly concerned with making loans. Also involved are 22 members of boards
of directors and 300 loan committee members of branches, agencies and
Juntas Rurales, who work on a per diem basis and pass upon loan applica-
tions.

11.        The relative importance of banks is given by the size of their
respective loan portfolios (Annex 3).     Total assets increased by 5.5 per
cent annually while liabilities increased at 7 per cent average from 1960
to 196L.   Although combined canital and reserves increased bv M 10.7
million, they declined from 36 per cent to 27 per cent of total loans out-
t.a.ndirng (An:nx )'  This is due inr great measure to the fact that aggregate

12.        On the other hand, although the volume of delinquent loans has
lncreased percentagewi s e, the volun,e of Uelinquent loan-Es over I8 du ays

13.        Agricultural lending has always been given high priority and
has represented about 55 per cent of the banking system's loan portfolio



AN]TEX 1
Page 5
in each of the last five years . General agriculture represents more thar
70 per cent and livestock 30 per cent of the total outstanding volume of
agricultural lending (Annex 7).
11.       Since records are kept only on the number of loans made and
many farmers have more than one loan w-Lth the same bank or have loans with
more than one bank, it is irpossible to have a precise estimate of the
nimhbr of farmerqs heing servpe bhv the credit. svqft.Tem. buit other indlirect
methocds indicate that roughly 65 to 75 per cent of the 6h,o00 Costa Rican
farmersq nhbtan bannk c-redit.
15.       Greater attention is given to the collateral nositini of the
borrowrer than to his repayment capacity as derived from the project being
finnnrced, TTith the resul+s that many rerpaym,n ent schedules are not adapted
to the nature of the particular investments.
16.       Total agricultural credit has been almost equally divided be-
LI UV            opera'-t onal arlmedi= and long-ter.,. lr.vestment uses,
the latter showing a slow relative increase. In 1964-1965 the distribu-
tion vras )  l per centLf andu 56 per centu respec tively. TheI e&U>Ltl Jf pri.LVCtU
lending is unknown, but appears to be unimportant.
17.       Loan making procedures are practically the same throughout the
banking sys-tem. At the head office level, they can be s-umm,arized as
follows: a prospective borrower submits a simple application form stating
the purpose of the ;Loan and offered security. The credit section of urie
bank checks creditworthiness and status of title to real estate if it is
pledged as Security.  The application then goes to the appraisal section
for inspection of the property, its uses, estimated value, and in the
larger and more comp)lex cases, a development plan. The report with a
recommendation from the chief of the appraisal section goes back to the
credit section, where it is reviewed thoroughly by a credit specialist
and together with comments by the Section Chief transferred to the loan
committee or to the Board of Directors, depending on the bank in ques-
tion. In branch, agency and Junta rural offices the loan comnittee is
composed of the manager and three prominent local citizens wiho serve on
a per diem basis. O)nce the loan is approved, the commercial or mortgage
departments handle its administration after a final check is made by the
legal office. At the local level, the application is submitted to the
bank manager who makes a preliminary review, sends a request to San Jose
for information on the status of the security pledged if it is real
estate and hands the application to a technician for field inspection.
Depencling on the category of the local office and the amount involved,
the loan request is decided upon by the manager alone or by the manager
with the local loan committee.
18.       Loan processes are too long and cumbersome. It takes frequently
up to three months to process loans involving real estate security. Fac--
tors affecting speecl of processing are: lack of sufficient personnel at

making an the head offi^e level! too grent an administrative burden (which
is highly tim.e consuaming) on the technicians who do the field work.

the actual amount delinquent atl end of 196L was 34.183, miLLion colones as compared with 225.454 million colones

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT

1.        The projected disbursements are based on: the absorptive
capacity of farmers in eacn fieid; the availaDbiity OI bark and other
technicians; the new standards required for appraisal of farmers, loan
applications; technical requirements for farm operation (pineappie).
2.        The basic assumption underlying the income statement and the
cash flow regarding the project is that loans to farmers will be made
at 8 per cent interest, the minimum charge which would permit coverage
of operating costs and provide a surplus for a reasonable accumulation
of reserves.
3.        It is also assumed that net annual flows after the initial
loans are disbursed will be relent in the following proportions: 80 per
cent for livestock and 20 per cent for bananas, both of which offer the
most ample possibilities for long run development. This relending will
be made on the same terms as above.
4.        The four state commercial bankst contributions to loans
consist of the 40 per cent counterpart funds to the IBRD loan (60 per
cent). Taking into consideration that; the lending volume of the banking
system as a whole has increased by an average of ¢ 75 million annually
in the last four years it is estimated that the financial effort demanded
by the project, including short-term credit, can be satisfied reasonably
well.
5.        Technical services expenses relate to the agricultural
specialists and the study of storage of agricultural products in the
country. Administration expenditures include the appointment of
bank supervisors and appraisers and junior personnel to undertake the
administrative work load of bank appraisers, as well as facilities
needed for the prolect. The share of general bank administration
expenses is based on the percentage share of project loans as compared
to the nroieeted total volume of bank lendine.
6.         n this basis annual net income shows an almost uninterrupted
rise throughout the life of the project, which would permit a gradual
repturn townrd the rpeak nf i961 hankinng svstemts income levelsq

AGRICULTURAL CR]3DIT PROJECT
ASSUT4PTIONS REIATLIG TO TIE FINAIqCIAL AND
ECUNOMIC MIALYSIS OF THE AGR[CULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The geographical concentration and the relatively narrow vari-
ance of farrm sizes in each field of investment permitted a more specific
microfinancial and economic study of the individual subprojects than is
usual in agricultural credit financing.   'ne remaining variables could be
isolated and assumptions established on reasonably firm grounds.
Beef Cattle
2.        I-t is expected that a total of 150 to 180 loans will be
processed in a period of two and a half years; taking into account
delays due to organ-ization of the administrative machinery and the
introduction of new appraisal and supervision techniques.   This loan
schedule involves a small investment soillover in the first half of the
third year of disbursements.
3.        On the basis of the number of existing farms and readiness for
credit absorption, the mission estimates that approximately 80 per cent
of the on-fa3rm investments will be made in Guanacaste Province, and 20
Der cent in the area of San Carlos (Central Atlantic Region) and along
the Inter-Anerican Highway in the South Pacific Region.   These latter
areas apnear to be most promising long run development areas once the
necessary infrastructure is provided.
4.        Roughly 30 per cent of the number of farms would be in the 400
manzana (28', hectares) categorv: hO ner cent in the 800 manzana (570 hec.-
tares) category and the remaining 30 per cent in the 1,000 manzana (710
hectares) axroupn TMh financial rate.s of rf-tairn (14 ner eent for ruana-
caste and 16 per cent for the other two regions) are conservative in the
sense that in:crem.en"al cvrirent costs wJere heaayr¶l weighted nnr f-onsirdred
as proportionately fixed regarding the different sizes of farms, while
it is reasonable to expect economies of scale as fnrm size increases.

Indies Fruit Company. If the latter cane in full force, the absolute
returns, both financial and economL.c, would increase appreciably.  The
average size of farms (100 ha.) is based on Standard Fruit Company's
regulations regarding suitability for aerial spraying.
Cotton
7.        One-half cf the investments planned are expected to be made in
the Tempisque River Basin and one-half in the Canas Area, both in Guana-
caste Province. Yields are 15 to 20 per cent higher in the former, which.
comprises alluvial soils with good drainage conditions. Average farm
size should be 70 ha. which permits the utilization of one set of
machinery for on-farm work under intensive conditions.
8.        The missicn allowed for a 6 per cent gradual price decline in
the first four years of operations due to expected export increases in
the United ctates, Another important assumption is that farm machinery
will not be transferred from rice production into cotton, which increases
investment costs accordingly.
Pineapiple
9.        The mission estimates that one-half of increased production
will take place in the Puntarenas Area and will be sold to canneries
around. San Jose involving an average distance of 66 km. The other half
would be produced in. Buenos Aires, in the South Pacific Region, and
marketed as fresh fruit in Florida. There is, on the other hand, a
specif'ic purchase of'fer by an American firm on the basis of production
on a mnarimum h40 ha.
10.       Financial returns were calculated in all cases after taxes.
The weight of taxes in the calculations is notable, particularly in the
cases of nineanole. bananas. and cotton. All returns were calculated on
an incremental basis and economic returns are weighted according to
probable developmpnt area Histribution.. The 20 per cent overall internal.
rate of return to the economy takes into account technical assistance and

Beef
1        About 6,000 tons of meat are expected to be produced by 1975
-aicier Ihe bUee  cattle projUc, C ID  xidUU±y u 60 pe  cent for doUuwe" -±
consumption and 40 per cent for exports. Domestic consumption per capita
has increased in recent years, but it is expected that an im,Jpr-o-vement in
general economic conditions in the country will lead to a large increase
in total internal consumption in the next ten years, which on the basis of
population increases alone would be more than enough to absorb the expected
increase in supply at that time according to projections made by Costa
Rican planners.
2.        The West European Yarket should be characterized by an excess
of demand relative to supply in the next five to ten years and should
remain in balance for a period of several years thereafter.  Costa Rica's
expected export increases represent a very small addition to world market
supply and should not face serious sales problems with its comparative
location advantage vis-a-vis the Western European and United States markets.
Trial shipments have already been made to Italy and results look promising.
Baranas
3.        The market for the expected increase in banana production
seems mostly assured under present marketing contracts with the Standard
Fruit Company. An additional mar}et outlet might be operated by the
West Indies Fruit Company, which has already entered ten-year contracts
with the Banana Producers' Cooperative at Bataan in the Atlantic and has
inclicated its desires to market the production of a further 2,000 ha.
Cotton
4.        The export market should absorb the estimated 5,000 tons of
lint forthcoming from the project's investments in full production., The
outlook for exports to Japan and Western Europe of cotton of upper
middling quality (which comprises Costa Ricals quality standards) is
reasonably good and the projected increase in exports represents only
about 5 per cent of total Central American exports at present.  Relative
shortage of suitable lands, pests and diseases, on the other hand, have
severelv limited the overall exnansion of cotton production in Nicaragua
and Salvador. The Cotton Growers' Association is actively pursuing
common mArket policies to assure early sales and the highest possible
prices for producers.

To the above -must be added b[at the lo-verIIlelun hacs recently
given tentative approval for the construction of three new textile mills,
two of wnich would start operating in 1968 witn a combineu capacity of
2,h00 tons of lint and the third in 1970 with a capacity of 950 tons.
6.        Approximately two-thirds of the expected increase in the supply
of cotton seed would be domestically consumed by the livestock industry.
The remaining one-third would have to be exported and efforts are under
way to this effect.  The relative value of these exports is, however,
very small.
Pineapple
7.        The existing two canneries in San Jose have publicly advertised
their readiness to go into contracts with pineapple growers to assure a
steady supply of fruit up to 7,200 tons per year, This would represent
approximately one-third of the projected increase in production.
8.        The favorable geographic situation of Costa Rica vis-a-vis
the East Coast Market in the United States gives it a comparative
advantage to supply this area. The Kraft Company, Lakeland, Florida
has recently indicated their willingness to buy fresh pineapple in
Costa Rica provided a minimum of 10,000 tons a year can be supplied to
satisfy their envisaged consumption needs and trial shipments have
already proven economically justified. This figure alone represents
approximately 50 per cent of the total increase in production envisaged
under the project.
