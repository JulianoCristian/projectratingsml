development of a cluster of six oxbow lakes, currently under\n            exploited, as a pioneer undertaking aimed at increasing carp\n            production through the introduction of new composite culture\n            techniques; carp seed production; and the provision of\n            improved lake management technologies. It will provide\n            training and technical assistance to facilitate the transfer\n            of these technologies to local fishermen. Specifically, the\n            project will assist in the financing of: supporting lakeside\n            hatchery facilities, including a Central Hatchery complex,\n            access roads, water supply, telephone and electricity;\n            up-grade the professional competence of local fishery\n            personnel and fish farmers through in-service training; and,\n            provide a dependable source of good quality carp fry and\n            fingerlings for use by fish farmers in and around the\n            project area."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
