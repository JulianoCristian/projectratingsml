1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design



The Ceará Multi-Sector Inclusion Development Project was a loan of US$ 149.750 million to the
Brazilian State of Ceará, one of the most important states in northeast Brazil. It was an innovative
investment loan drawing on both the sector wide approach (SWAp) modality and the adaptable
program loan (APL) modality. In addition, it built on the existing SWAp approaches by funding a
multi-sector program and supporting the key issue of public management across these sectors. It
was a model that drew great attention and support from the Federal Government in Brazil and has
been replicated in the Second Minas Gerais Development Partnership Loan ($US 976 million,
approved by the Board on May 31st.) and is being replicated in several other projects at the State
level (Bahia, the Federal District and Pernambuco). The second phase of the APL (Ceará
Inclusive Growth II, US$ 240 million) will be discussed at the Board on September 30th, 2008.

As with any new approach, implementation demonstrated aspects that worked well and others
that did not function as well, which this ICR will address. In all, this project has been both
successful and critically important to the development of a new instrument and new way of
working, leading to increased demand by the Government for the World Bank's assistance.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background

At appraisal, Ceará State confronted huge poverty and development challenges. Ninety-eight
percent of its area was categorized as caatinga, an arid, thorny, dry vegetation biome that suffers
serious draughts on average once every four years. The population living in northeastern Brazil's
caatinga was considered the poorest in Brazil. The region was marked by low educational levels,
high infant mortality and a paucity of social and physical infrastructure and basic services. About
70% of Ceará's population lived in the caatinga. The remainder was crowded into the narrow
coastal strip.

Ceará was poor in absolute terms and relative to many other Brazilian states. Its absolute ranking
across states hovers generally around number 16 or 17 (out of 27 states) depending upon the
index being used. However, a study by the Government's research institute, IPEA, affirmed that
of Brazil's 27 states, Ceará progressed the most in the social areas over the decade 1993-2003,
Ceará's ranking across various composite poverty related indices based upon improvement
included the following at appraisal:




                                                1

Under Governors Tasso Jereissati and Lucio Alcântara, the Government of Ceará was committed
to state modernization. Governor Alcântara assumed office in 2003 and developed an ambitious
fiscal, state modernization and social inclusion agenda. However, the economy at the national
level undermined State's efforts: low growth, reduced revenues and high interest rates over the
previous 3-4 years plus the concentration of debt repayments (2004-2009) conspired to seriously
prejudice the State's fiscal situation and undercut implementation of its development efforts. The
State cut programmed investment by more than 50 percent and expenditures on basic service
delivery were constrained. Investments in 2004 were expected to be less than one third of
budgeted amounts. Resource allocation to critical programs underpinning the State's efforts to
address poverty was seriously compromised by liquidity problems. Ceará needed an infusion of
financial and technical support to strengthen its institutional reform efforts and maintain its
ambitious development and social agendas.

Faced with this difficult environment, the Government adopted a two-pronged strategy. First, it
continued to contain costs and under-run programmed budget expenditures, while attempting to
preserve the integrity of priority programs and reforms. Second, it approached the Federal
Government and the World Bank to obtain support for a large State loan ­ the Ceará Multi-
Sector Social Inclusion Development Project (`usually referred to as the "Ceará SWApL') ­ to
support critical growth and social programs and ensure state modernization and fiscal
sustainability in the medium term.

The Bank CAS for 2003-2007 supported integrated operations in the impoverished Northeast
region. Two key pillars of the CAS ­ strengthened human capital and social development for a
more equitable Brazil and macro and public sector foundations -- were central to the proposed
project. The project was thus emblematic of key CAS goals. The Bank loan was expected to play
an important catalytic role by leveraging and guiding State efforts and resources to address
critical development issues while helping to bridge the difficult fiscal situation over the period
2004-2009.

In addition, Ceará had demonstrated a commitment to reform. The State's fiscal performance
compared favorably with many states and especially Northeastern states. As mentioned above,
performance in the social areas over the previous decade was assessed as strong. In addition,
Bank specialists rated health, water and sanitation, and water resource management as `good' or
`best' practice in Brazil. Education had improved markedly in recent years and also compared
favorably with other states in the Northeast region. Ceará had also been a leading recipient of
Bank loans and thus Bank-state relations were very strong. The State's strong collaboration in
developing this demanding, results-based operation further underlined its reform commitment.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective (see pages 8 and 34 of the PAD) was to help the Ceará
Government achieve fiscal sustainability and address key fiscal and social inclusion challenges
across six critical sectors. On the fiscal side the project aimed to restore and strengthen Ceará's
fiscal sustainability. On the social inclusions side the aim was to improve service delivery in key
sectors such as education, health, water and sanitation.

The CE loan was designed drawing on both the sector wide approach and adaptable program loan
modalities. Like an APL it set out a medium-term program of actions to help the Government
reach its objectives and as such, included a set of triggers for moving from one phase of the
APL to the next. (See tables below).


                                                  2

As in a sector wide approach, specific programs were developed in each sector to be assisted by
the program (education, health, social inclusion & culture, water supply & sanitation, water
resource management and environment.) In addition, public sector management was treated as an
umbrella sector ­ cutting across the other sectors by applying a model of results­based
management to all the project sectors. The approach built on the Government of Ceará's
continuing efforts to strengthen results-based management across the government. Each sector
program built on diagnostics carried out by Bank specialists and Government counterparts and
that identified a set of eligible expenditure programs (EEPs) that were of high priority to the
Government. The Bank's resources would disburse against evidence that at least 70 percent of the
budgeted expenditures in each of these priority expenditure programs was attained (the so-called
"70 percent rule"). The sector diagnostics and subsequent plans also identified a series of
disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) (defined for each sector) to be attained in order for
disbursements to occur, as well as benchmarks, which were part of the Government's program,
but were not essential for disbursement.

The project was organized around three "axes": Public Sector Management, Human Development
and Sustainable Resource Management. What follows sets out the axes and sectors with the key
APL triggers and disbursement linked indicators for each sector. (See Annex 4 of the PAD for
detailed descriptions based on the Sector Plans.)

I. Public Sector Management Axis

The thrust of this axis was to ensure prudent fiscal management and institutional strengthening
both in the central and line secretaries through results based-management. In addition to the
indicators below, maintenance of a primary surplus was also maintained as a disbursement-linked
indicator throughout the project.

Indicators
Maintain a ratio of (tax + own non-tax         · Maintain debt/net current revenue ratio not
revenue)/GDP at no less than 8.5% in               higher than 1.5

                                                   with short and medium term fiscal and
                                                   financial planning and management

                                                   public administrators accounts ("contas de
                                                   gestão") and reduce the backlog

The PSM had no large EEP type programs so normally it would be left out of a traditional SWAp
and only addressed in DPL type loans or SILs. However, the team created the `umbrella sector'
of PSM with indicators and supporting TA to support principally Results-Based Management
(RBM) and fiscal management.




                                                 3

The loan also supported fiscal sustainability through incorporation of Sector Plan benchmarks in
the State's Sector Strategic Plans for important fiscal problems such as tax and user charges, real
estate and asset management, contingent liabilities from legal cases, establishment of an
independent administrator ("gestor único") for pension administration and fiduciary oversight
improvement.

II. Human Development Axis

A. Education Sector

The Sector strategy was supported by and supported the Bank's large basic education loan (BR-
#45910) and "satisfactory" loan implementation was a disbursement condition. The strategy
focused on learning achievement and strengthening of the Secretary's ability to efficiently
administer resources and resolve issues outstanding from the decentralization of primary
education to municipalities in compliance with the 1988 Constitutional requirement. Ceará was
the state that had most decentralized education but difficult teacher and resource allocation
problems needed to be resolved.

Annual Disbursement-Linked Indicators              APL#2 Triggers
    · Improve learning achievement through              · Resolve outstanding State: municipal

    · Reduce illiterate population 15 years
        and older by 100,000/year for 2005-6.




B. Health Sector

The sector diagnostic conducted for the project pointed to infant and maternal mortality as
Ceará's most pressing health problems. These were targeted by the loan along with institutional
strengthening measures designed to ensure expanded coverage by basic health providers and
increased targeting and efficiency of service provision.

Annual Disbursement-Linked Indicators              APL#2 Triggers
    · Increase percentage of pregnant                  · Implement performance contracts

        treatable in clinics-21%/20% in
        2005/2006

The Sector Plan added benchmarks in areas of dental care and supply of basic pharmaceuticals
plus several programs designed to strengthen basic care for the poor, especially as it affected
infant and maternal mortality. These benchmarks were not linked to disbursement.

C. Social Inclusion and Culture Sector

The Human Development Axis included an APL trigger for the study of the rehabilitation of a
multi-site historic and cultural corridor in the center of Fortaleza and it included a Sector Plan for
the Social Inclusion and Youth Secretary in order to strengthen targeting, M & E, implementation
of priority programs and State/municipality collaborations.            The program did not have
disbursement linked indicators.

Annual Disbursement-Linked Indicators               APL#2 Triggers
                                                         · Rehabilitation of a multi-site historic
                                                             and cultural corridor in the center of
                                                             Fortaleza.




III. Sustainable Resource Management Axis

A. Water Resources Management Sector (WRM)

Water is the critical natural resource in this arid state. Ceará ranks among Brazil's strongest states
in water resource management. Even so, there was a huge institutional and development agenda
that required implementation in order to optimize water resources management.

Annual Disbursement-Linked Indicators                 APL#2 Triggers
    · Manage water resources finance and                  · Create 2 new Water Basin Committees
        demand through increasing percentages                 by end 2005 and a third in 2006
        of industrial, irrigation, and                    · Water Basin Committees officially
        aquaculture water users being charged-                included in the State Water Resources
        2005-06 benchmarks are fixed.                         Council CONERH.


The Castanhão water conveyance system was arguably the most important civil works in Ceará
and would resolve a Fortaleza water problem and spur development along the coast. The water
conveyance system was financed by a Bank loan and satisfactory completion of 80km and
120kmin 2005 and 2006, respectively, was a loan requirement for disbursements in this sector.
Sector Strategic Plan items also included the establishment of a modern COGERH (the State
water resources management company) system for water resource management with M&E of the



                                                   5

quantity and quality of reservoirs' water and volume of river water, strengthened management
information systems for managing water use including upgraded systems for registration of users,
permits, and M&E, and the creation of reservoir management commissions.


B. Water Supply and Sanitation Sector (WSS)

Ceará has one of Brazil's best State water supply companies (CAGECE) and regulatory agencies
(ARCE). As is the case in most states and municipalities, the critical sector objectives were
expanding coverage, especially to the poor, and the fiscal sustainability of operations.

Annual Disbursement-Linked Indicators             APL#2 Triggers
    · Increase water coverage by                      · ARCE to develop a reformed
        23,600/34,160 new connections                      regulatory accounting system to be
        (67.7%/68.5%) in 2005/2006                         implemented by CAGECE
    · Increase sanitation coverage by                 · Implement recommendations of a 2005
        14,400/18,550 new connections                      tariff and subsidy study
        (27%/27.6%) in 2005/2006                      · Submit a new WSS law to the State
    · Reduce CAGECE's working ratio                        Legislative Assembly
        (operating costs/revenue) to
        71.4%/70.7% in 2005/2006


The Sector Strategic Plans supported expanding service coverage for small communities (through
the SISAR system). It also addressed different reforms to strengthen financial sustainability and
efficiency through upgrading CAGECE's internal functioning (HR, IT, expenditure reviews,
reducing water loss), promoting the nexus between CAGECE, ARCE and municipalities, and
exploring new business models (eg. floating CAGECE shares and public-private partnerships).

C. Environment Sector

Environment had not been one of the State's better managed sectors. Nevertheless, it was
extremely important because of its impact on scarce water resources, predatory development of
coastal biomes affecting the tourist industry, and degradation of the "caatinga" biome. The
caatinga is the only biome unique to Brazil and is an exceptionally rich repository of biological
diversity. Two of the world's ten most threatened bird species are found in the caatinga.

Disbursement-Linked Indicators                    APL#2 Triggers
    · Establish and manage Ceará's first two          · Implement coastal management in the
        fully protected areas of 5,000 ha each             East Coast and Metropolitan regions
        in critical caatinga and carnauba             · Submit a reformed environmental law
        biomes                                             to the Legislative Assembly
    · Finalize coastal and caatinga zoning
        (ZEE) including requisite
        laws/decrees, contract humid foothills
        biome in 2006; implement and report
        on biome management annually




                                                6

The Sector Plan included a diagnostic of the State's dwindling forestry resources and a program to
address the growing desertification problem. The Plan also added ambitious monitoring and
evaluation programs (air and water quality, fish farming and licensing), cadastre updates (solid
waste producers, forest raw material consumers) and strengthening of protected area
management.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The main beneficiaries were the citizens of the State of Ceará at large with special
attention to the poorest and vulnerable populations. It was intended that these groups
would benefit from: a more effective primary, secondary and tertiary health care system;
strengthened school systems, including rural and urban high school education; improved
urban water and sanitation systems, as well as biodiversity programs. Direct, if secondary,
beneficiaries of the project were members of central and line Secretaries since the project
targeted public sector management reforms to improve fiscal sustainability and social
inclusion goals in central (Finance, Planning, Administration and Controllers) and line
Secretaries. The project played the role of an `integrating umbrella' program that aimed
at improving efficiency in all sectors.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The CE SWApL design included two components: (a) reimbursement against expenditures in
nine Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) across six sectors requiring achievement of
disbursement-linked indicators (Component 1); and (b) funding of specific technical assistance
activities (Component 2).

Component 1: Reimbursement of Eligible Expenditure Programs (US$ 145.750 million)

Component 1 of the project was designed to support nine EEPs in the six sectors described in
section 1.2 and as set out in the Ceará budget. These were (numbers correspond to the relevant
budget line item): Primary Health Care (536); Secondary Tertiary Health Care (535); Ensino
Médio (049); Basic School Operations (544); Municipal Participation from Fundef (060); Urban
Water and Health (583); Eixo Castanhão-Galvão (576) and Biodiversity program (475). All
disbursement of Component 1 was against spending in these EEPs. Reports on EEP spending
were generated from the State of Ceará Treasury as part of their financial management
information system (FMIS) and forwarded to the Bank. The Planning Secretariat forwarded
reports on accomplishment of the disbursement-linked indicators in the various sectors.
Achievement of the 70 percent spending rule and the disbursement linked indicators was required
for disbursement.   Five disbursements were anticipated in Component 1, all going to the
Secretary Finance (Treasury Department) to be pooled with other resources of the State.

Component 2: Technical Assistance (TA) (US$4 million)

The loan included technical assistance valued around $4 million or about 3.3% of the loan
amount. Most of this TA would go to support Public Sector Management Axis initiatives to
strengthen state administration, including fiscal and results-based management in the central and
line Secretaries. The anticipated studies, systems work and training are detailed below:

1.6 Revised Components
There were no revisions to components.

1.7 Other significant changes
There were no significant changes; the closing date was December 31, 2007 as initially planned
in the PAD.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The strengths and challenges of preparation, design and quality at entry were as follows:

Investing in Collaboration and Ownership during project preparation. Since this was the first
mulitsectoral SWAp at the state level, disbursing to Treasury, and involving a State with three
Bank loans that were struggling, the team found it essential to ensure collaboration and ownership
by line and central secretaries. Bank teams traveled to Ceará to develop proposals with sectoral
counterparts and build program ownership. A three day stakeholders' workshop was held to
discuss and finalize the Public Sector Management program. The program had also been formally
vetted by participating Secretaries, the Governor and Vice Governor. The Secretaries were strong
loan proponents since it supported implementation of their key programs. Because of the State
fiscal situation at the time (the state was in a severely constrained situation) the sectors did not
receive funds. Under the SWApL the sectors were assured of receiving 70% of their largest
programs and support in attaining their key programs/indicators. The loan changed the internal
dynamic: in place of arguing with the center to obtain budget, the sectors had an incentive to
work on their programs as the Treasury would not get SWApL disbursements without giving
funds to secretaries and getting indicator results.

Ownership and efficient reporting line and authority: Having ownership was important and the
project benefited from having key people with proper authority to make decisions. The main
counterpart for this loan was Marcos Holanda of IPECE. Mr. Holanda reported to the Sec. of
Planning Maia Jr. who was Vice Governor and the CEO of the State and they both bought into
the loan from the very beginning.

Creating disbursement incentives in the project design by drawing on other projects. The
Mexican infrastructure SWAp contributed to the concept of disbursement-linked indicators.
Mexico's was in infrastructure and based on unit costs (the funds would be linked to the number
of paved km). It helped to illustrate the notion of multi-sector (paving roads + 2 others).


                                                   9

Obviously, the identical approach could not be fully replicated in this loan because unit costs
could not be used for institutional strengthening.    Brazil's Bolsa Família provided the idea of
increasing disbursement amounts every year to strengthen results-based incentives. The
incorporation of required EEP expenditure levels also came out of this discussion. Both these
projects were helpful to understand the concept of disbursement-linked indicators.

The choice of a multi-sectoral model and activities. At the time of project preparation, SWAps
were predominately single program/sector loans. Yet Mexico had just completed a multi-sector
SWAp and the Bank was emphasizing multi-sectoral approaches. This was echoed in the CAS,
Bank ESW and Ceará's own development agenda. Hence, six key sectors were selected along
with EEP and benchmarks with strong links to MDG, CAS and State priorities. Inclusion of the
umbrella Public Sector Management Axis and identification of disbursement conditions, triggers
and the technical assistance component assured that institutional reform synergies would take
place across sectors.

Easing disbursement mechanisms. The disbursement mechanism was designed in such a way that
disbursements were made to the Treasury and not to the sectors. The Ceará SWApL followed the
$572 million Federal Bolsa Família (BF) SWAP that disbursed to the Federal Treasury. BF was
obliged to disburse to Treasury as the BF program had dedicated funding and funding could come
from no other source. But it established a precedent that the team used and was fundamental for
the loan (just as the Mexico Loan established payment for indicators even though the types of
indictors used in Ceará were entirely different.) The Ceará loan safeguarded EEP expenditures by
establishing annual minimum required levels and sectoral disbursement-linked indicators. It
allowed the Government to manage its fiscal resources and allocations while forging a
partnership between the central secretaries and the line secretaries who were responsible for
meeting disbursement conditions and hence had to receive timely disbursements from Treasury.

Innovation challenges and complexity of the operation. One of the consequences of synergies
maximization is the complexity of this operation. The Ceará SWApL incorporated over a dozen
lending innovations. Unlike traditional SWAps that normally support a single large Government
sector program, this loan worked in six main line sectors. Two or three disbursement linked
indicators were established in each sector. In addition, other `global' conditionalities included
completion of prototype sector strategic plans, primary surplus targets and satisfactory
performance by the Bank's other three loans to Ceará. Clearly the complexity of this operation
made it challenging for resource people inside the Bank as well as on the counterpart side to
prepare and implement it.

Number of Indicators: Too many or just enough? The question of the adequate number of
indicators was the source of intense internal discussion during project preparation. In the CE
SWApL project, there were 13 disbursement-linked indicators, 3 cross-conditionalities on
portfolio, and one global indicator (primary surplus) so a total of 17 indicators. In addition, there
were 9 EEPs that needed to comply with the 70% rule. In sum, a total of 26 criteria needed to be
monitored during project implementation. There was also a 3rd disbursement condition on Sector
Strategic Plans. The sectors working with the project had worked with the Bank on sector
diagnostics and plans. The indicators chosen were considered to be the key indicators for each
sector (each sector has a set of secondary indicators on which it was working but these were not
tied to disbursement.). The indicators chosen were also those that the government confirmed
would be among those that it also was closely monitoring through the financial management
information system or through oversight of Government programs.

Designing the loan so that it created positive spillovers effects on the other World Bank projects
in Ceará. By linking the Ceará SWApL loan with three ongoing Bank projects, the loan
reinforced existing loans in the portfolio. Ceará had three Bank loans--education, water resource
management, and rural poverty. Implementation had been prejudiced by weak management and
fiscal constraints. Two projects were Unsatisfactory. The project picked up indicators related to
both and used related EEP. Both loans turned around. The third Rural Poverty loan was never a
problem. Cross conditionality was another innovation. Attending the requests of task managers,
and because these loans support Ceará SWApL programs, "satisfactory" loan implementation
was incorporated as a disbursement condition (see in Annex 4, Section C, Table 4.C. 1.of PAD)
in the design of the project.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation of Component 1 occurred over the expected period of time, with five tranches
and closing on December 31, 2007. However, as is common in projects of this nature, not all
programs fully met the disbursement linked indicators and therefore the amounts of
disbursements differed somewhat from what was set out in the PAD. In addition, disbursement of
the component 2 (TA) moved very slowly and in the end the TA program had significant issues in
implementation.

While the first three disbursements in November 2005 were as expected, partial accomplishment
of some of the disbursement-linked indicators meant that portions of the November 2006
disbursements were delayed. Waivers or partial waivers were also requested for the final
disbursement.


                                                11

Of the 23 indicators required for the 4th disbursement, 13 were exceeded, 7 were complied with
and 3 experienced some difficulties. All EEPs but one met the 70 percent rule. After submitting a
request for partial waivers, a fourth tranche of US$ 24,076,912 was released. The details on the
indicators not met are as follows:

· The Ceará Integrated Water Resource Management Project (PROGERIRIH) was meant
    to have Lots A & B contracts signed and invoices equal to 10 percent of the total value of
    each contract presented and paid by the borrower. A partial waiver was requested because,
    although all contracts were signed, only 6.5 percent of the contracts had been invoiced and
    paid. This was due to an unforeseen delay by sub-contractors. The problem was resolved in
    January of 2006, one month late, and by then the benchmark was exceeded. A waiver of the
    compliance date was requested and granted.

· The Ceará Basic Education Quality Improvement Project was required to have disbursed
    R$17.5 million percent of loan proceeds, but by end-Dec 2005 R$17.3 million had been
    disbursed. In 2005 the project was upgraded to satisfactory and was extended, but the
    discussions on extension slowed disbursement for a period. A partial waiver was requested
    given the relatively small size of the shortfall, which would be made up in 2006.

· In the health sector the indicator, "Not more than 21 % of hospital admissions for children 5
    years old or younger for diarrhea during CY 05," was not attained. Hospital admissions were
    25.3 percent and further diagnostic work into the issue suggested that the indicator was
    poorly defined and subject to many factors outside the sector. Field studies in at-risk
    municipalities followed by an in-depth study of the causes of non-compliance suggested that
    issued related to the water system had a significant impact on the indicator. A cross-sectoral
    committee set out a comprehensive work program to address the topic. Ultimately it is clear
    that the definition of this indictor was problematic and would unlikely be met during the loan.

· Spending on the Biodiversity program was required to reach R$6,000,000 in order to meet
    the 70 percent rule. In 2005, 40 percent of the required amount was spent. The EEP
    overestimated the cost of creating of creating a park by some 23 times. The Government
    decided to create a single caatinga park of 10,005 hectars. The Bank supported this decision
    as a larger park is better for biodiversity conservation. The Government of Ceará obtained
    grant funds from Petrobrás of R$4.1 million. Combined with Government spending of R$1.7,
    spending totaled R$5.8 million. In the end this amount was sufficient to meet the goal of
    creating the Park and meeting the goals of the sector.

The fifth and final tranche release was for US$35,748,776. It included the delayed payments from
the fourth disbursement on the childhood diarrhea indicator, as well as the resources for TA that
had not been used (The option of rolling the unused TA money in the last disbursement was
included in the Loan Agreement.). While the great majority of indicators were met or exceeded,
the 5th disbursement requested six partial waivers: one on the execution of the TA component,
two related to DLIs. Two related to portfolio indicators and two related to expenditure programs.
The details of these are as follows (see the 5th disbursement documentation in IRIS for more
detail.):

· The PROGERIRH water conveyance system construction indicator (120 km) was met but
    with a delay. A rainy season that was two months longer than normal disrupted construction




                                                  12

    and the Electoral Law constrained funding and resulted in the project being demobilized for a
    period of roughly six months. The target of 120 km was met, but with a delay.

· The indicator `children's hospital admission for diarrhea' remained flawed. It measured
    a number of different health care phenomena and the use of a percentage resulted in non-
    representative and volatile results.     The indicator was missed in 2006 despite the
    Government's comprehensive program to address childhood diarrhea and despite having
    registered by far the lowest absolute number of internments since at least 2000.     SWAp 2
    will continue to track implementation of diarrhea program implementation.

· The charging of bulk water use was a composite indicator covering industrial, aquaculture
    and irrigation water users. Performance exceeded targeted values for the first two and the
    third was partially met as the volume of water charged significantly surpassed expectations.
    This indicator will be refined to measure volume of water in the SWAp 2 operation.

· The election period in 2006 (and IDB procurement problems) also slowed implementation of
    the SANEAR II program. Consequently, only 90% of the threshold EEP expenditure level
    was met. However, the indicator targets for the number of household water and sewerage
    connections were significantly exceeded. The indicator will also be continued in SWAp 2.

· Similarly, following from the fourth disbursement, the threshold expenditure target for the
    Biodiversity Program was not met. About 72% of the threshold was spent or approved
    pending validation of land prices by the new administration. As mentioned the cost of
    establishing the Carnaubas Park--an important SWAp 1 achievement ­ was overestimated
    and inflated the threshold expenditure level. Furthermore, the expenditure exceeds by a
    multiple of 20 the level of Biodiversity Program expenditure at the inception of the operation
    and other environmental indicators were also met.         Ultimately the objectives of the
    Biodiversity Program were met.

Implementation of the TA. The Bank team monitored and supported the implementation of the
TA component, however, only $614,000 was actually spent over roughly three years leaving
about $4.8 million to be reallocated to the SWAp component. There are a number of reasons for
not having spent more TA component funds.

· Contingency funds were to be reallocated including funds to cover a fiduciary oversight sub-
    component that was developed by the Bank (as part of a state CFAA underway at the time)
    and that was included in early versions of the SWAp.     The Government of Ceará took the
    component and transferred it to IDB's PROMOEX loan. Contingency funds were set aside in
    the event the IDB loan was not finalized. These funds were never used.
· Owing to time constraints, a large water tariff study could not be completed prior to the
    closing date and required a COFIEX approved reallocation.
· About $130,000, was allocated for work on precatorios. However, the Executive has no
    control over the Procurador Geral do Estado (PGE--State Attorney General's office) and
    that body only belatedly showed interest in the problem. None of the funds were spent. PGE
    was persuaded to     make a trip to Paraná and brought back software for precatorios that is
    expected to help manage the problem.
· About $1.5m of activities were fully or partially carried out by the Secretaria de Planejamento
    (largely through IPECE ­the Instituto de Pesquisa e Estratégia Econômica de Ceará) and the
    GOC with their own funds or funds from other sources.




                                                13

· The remainder of the funds to be reallocated pertains to activities which were not considered
    sufficiently high priority and/or did not have ownership.

In retrospect, it is clear that the TA program was too ambitious and did not take fully into account
the Government's ability or desire to do some things in-house. The need to carefully select TA
activities to be included in the TA component and to link them closely to achievement of the
DLIs is one of the lessons learned that has been incorporated into SWAp 2 and other                  SWAp
operations.

The final set of indicators used to assess implementation were the triggers for movement to the
second phase of the APL. Table 2 presents the results on these indicators.

                17. A reformed environmental     Law nº 13.796 was published on June 30, 2006,

                Assembly                         State Plan for Coastal Management. The implementing
                                                 decree for this law was under discussion in 2007
                                                 through various public forums.



Although not without some delays and issues, the Government of Ceará substantially
implemented the first component of the project, which included the critical sector programs.
However the TA was not successfully implemented. Some of the key factors affecting overall
implementation were as follows:

No changes of key actors on counterpart side. The main counterparts remained the same during
project preparation and implementation and had decision-making authority. This greatly
facilitated project implementation and the resolution of problems.

Relying on a small PIU. SWAps use existing client organizations and systems. Consequently a
small Project Implementing Unit (PIU) of full-time staff under the immediate supervision of the
head of the SEPLAN Research Institute (IPECE) ­ the main counterpart during loan
preparation--managed the implementation. In fact, IPECE used its department staff as needed to
help manage and report on the loan.

Missed Indicators and uses of waivers.           Some indicators were not met during project
implementation. The use of waivers is a key issue of debate in the development of this type of
project. On the one hand, one would like certainty. On the other hand, the reality is that teams
make their best efforts at choosing indicators in extremely complex areas and some will be
missed. Waivers provide some degree of flexibility and afford the Bank the opportunity not to
punish governments when things that are out of their control sometimes occur. This project, the
first of its kind, highlights the importance of carefully defining indicators. In each case where
waivers were used, the broader sectoral goals were being attained.

The consequences of elections. In the case of the PROGERIRH project WRM indicator/EEP, the
elections effectively reduced project budgets the second half of 2006 and the laying canal was not



                                                 16

completed. This required a waiver (see previous point). The elections played havoc with many
things. In addition, the arrival of a new Governor creates some uncertainties. However, it is
worth noting that despite (or thanks to) this situation of uncertainty (i) the key liaison staff in
IPECE were retained; (ii) the implementation phase of the project was a very effective vehicle for
engaging the new Governor; and (iii) by engaging the new Governor the Bank managed to
establish a dialogue on SWAp II of the APL (which ended up at US$240m--much larger than the
original $90m).

Lack of focus on the TA component. Considerable TA was being leveraged through this operation.
Alternative funding sources totaling over $2 million were found for technical assistance for key
institutional development needs, originally a part of this loan. Education and WRM assistance
would be funded through existing Bank loans. IDB loans (PROMOEX, PNAGE) were picking up
other activities identified in Bank diagnostics. Government budget allocations would finance
what remained. The program was far too ambitious with insufficient attention paid on both the
Borrower's and the Bank's side to implementation of the TA.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

A thorough framework for monitoring and evaluation was developed during project preparation
and used during project implementation. Monitoring and evaluation was an integral part of
operational design. The disbursement-liked indicators and the M&E framework were developed
collaboratively. The M&E was simplified for the Bank since the Government had to present
evidence of fulfillment of disbursement-linked indicators in order to receive loan funds. For
instance, a key indicator for the public sector component was to ensure primary surplus: "achieve
primary surplus target no lower than R$134 million in 2005 and no lower than R$ 147 million in
2006" (PAD, Annex 3; p38). For the Monitoring and Evaluation of the targeted values, the
primary balance baseline indicators and values during the project were calculated following the
methodology used by the Fiscal Adjustment Program (PAF) agreed by STN and the GOC on May
25th, 2004; this enabled clear and reliable sources for monitoring the results.

The M&E mechanisms were undertaken at different levels (EEP/triggers etc) and times (quarterly,
continuously) to validate Eligible Expenditure Program, achievements of primary surplus,
portfolio status, disbursement-linked indicators, and triggers as follows:

    · Validation of Eligible Expenditure Program expenditures was undertaken annually in the
         2nd and 4th quarters and was carried out for purposes of disbursement. EEPs were
         monitored every 6 months.
    · Achievement of primary surplus and portfolio status, were monitored on a continuous
         basis. Since these conditions had disbursement implications, protocols were established
         for each. Evidence of satisfaction of the indicators had to be formally presented in written
         documents by the client.
    · Progress on achieving APL triggers was continuously tracked through the life of the
         project. Protocols were established for triggers and results presented prior to project
         conclusion to allow time for decision and preparation of the second phase.




                                                 17

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

The Safeguards questions were resolved at the beginning of the project. The Ceará SWApL was
in an "A" category rating owing to the fact that it supported an EEP that incorporated counterpart
funding for the Bank's "Ceará State Water Resources Integrated Management Program"
("PROGERIRH, BR-PE6449) which was an "A" project. PROGERIRH safeguard questions were
therefore resolved in CY2000 when the loan was presented to the Board and implementation had
been satisfactory. If not for PROGERIRH, the project would have received a "B" rating. The
team also used the IDB safeguards for the SANEAR II loan counterpart, which was also in an
EEP. Having safeguard arrangements in place with existing projects that influenced the EEPs
substantially facilitated the discussion and implementation of safeguard policies.

Fiduciary Compliance

In general fiduciary compliance was adequate. Only a small Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
was used. No Financial Management specialist was required. The PIU received and vetted
quarterly reports from the Secretary of Finance used for determining disbursement against EEP
expenditures prior to passing them on to the Bank. Audits, carried out by the State Chamber of
Control (TCE-CE), were provided but with some delay. Sectoral audits were carried out within
the State's general accounts (Relatoria Annual das Contas do Governador). While the TCE-CE
benefited from training from the TCE of Bahia, the TCE-CE would have benefited from further
capacity building both in terms of audit standards and the assurances required in a SWAp.
Strengthening of audit capacities at the state level is a high priority for Ceará, as well as for most
other states in Brazil. The second phase of the loan will focus on this more directly.

Procurement under the TA component was organized in a small number of bidding packages:
Ceará procurement of goods through shopping procedures; consulting services with firms
following the QCBS method as established in the loan agreement; and individual consultants.
Procurement during the project was decentralized to the line Secretariats. This combined with
little procurement capacity in the PIU meant that overall procurement capacity for the project was
very weak and that this is likely to have played a role in the limited disbursement under the TA.
Weaknesses in procurement capacity also represented a high risk of mis-procurement (although in
the end, there was no mis-procurement found.)         The ex post review after project completion
recommended that the PIU in IPECE play a more proactive role as a filter to ensure quality
control of the procurement process. While a full time procurement consultant was not required,
having a procurement consultant on retainer to assist line secretaries as needed would have helped
project implementation. In addition, in order to ensure compliance with procurement conditions
under the first component, the identification of potential eligible expenditures needed to be made
at the "intenção de gasto " phase and not at the stage of the "empenho" when contract values are
verified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The success of the first SWApL led to the preparation of a second operation (Phase II). As set out
above, fifteen out of the 17 APL triggers were substantially met, so work began on the second
loan. The Ceará Inclusive Growth Project SWAP II for US$240 million, to be discussed at the
Board on September 30, 2008, is a continuation of the SWApL I loan. The first phase supported
implementation of the state's development agenda and sectoral investments between 2004-2007.



                                                 18

This new loan does the same for the period of 2008-2011. The innovative design of the project
elevated the importance of results-based management and provided an important model for inter-
sectoral and inter-institutional management of key programs, demonstrating the state's capacity
for innovation. The proposed SWAp II remains focused on achieving key social objectives
through institutional strengthening efforts and policy reforms. At the request of the Government
of Ceará, this new operation also expands beyond the social sectors to address issues of growth
and competitiveness. The Bank team, many of whom have participated in both projects, has
interacted continuously with the Government over the closing of the first project and preparation
of the second.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

The Ceará Multi-sector Social Inclusion Development Project faced many challenges, fostered
innovative thinking, experienced some failures and many successes. Before going into details in
this section, let us summarize the main characteristics of this project.

Notable achievements of the project include:

· The loan disbursed the entire amount (US$m 149.75) and closed on time.
· The project helped the state financially by disbursing to Treasury and allowing the state to
    smooth a spike in debt repayment and to create additional fiscal space.
· The loan substantially met the majority the DLIs and triggers for the second phase. Those
    triggers that were not met were counterbalanced by a signficant number of indicators in
    which targets were well exceeded.
· Some of the indicators are responsible for doing things that would not have been done--
    perhaps the most important are implanting the culture of results-based management and
    creation of the biodiversity park.
· The loan helped to reinforce other traditional investment projects in the State in water,
    education and rural development.         Two of these investment loans were upgraded to
    satisfactory as a result of cross-conditionality.
· The loan had many precedent setting innovations, not least of which was a new loan modality.
· Last but not least, the loan was repeated and upsized in Ceará and similar loans are now
    approved or underway in Minas Gerais ($976 million, approved), Pernambuco ($155m), the
    Federal District ($130m). Other countries in the region are also deploying this model
    including Jamaica (ECD) and Barbados.

Areas in which the project was less successful and from which subsequent projects have learned
are as follows:

· The scope of the project was very broad and, as a result, the component on Social Inclusion
    and Culture was not implemented. Although a sector plan was developed, there were no
    disbursement-linked indicators attached to this component, which was under the human
    development axis, and this meant that neither the Bank nor the relevant Government
    Secretary was keeping an eye on it. The trigger for the second APL was not met. In hindsight,
    it was clear that there was a desire from Bank management to include this component, though
    it had little real ownership and was not closely tied with other aspects of the project. While all
    other components were actively pursued and made great progress, this component probably
    should not have been included.



                                                  19

· The project was less successful in implementing the TA component. Partly this was due to
     the focus on meeting EEP expenditures and the disbursement­linked indicators. The TA
     would have benefited from being more tightly linked to the sector programs and DLIs to be
     met. It would have also benefited from more pro-activity from both the Bank team and the
     Government's PIU. More involvement from the sectoral team members in supervision would
     also have helped to avoid this problem.

· While the project drew on existing financial management and procurement systems, more
     could have been done to strengthen the Government's capacities in these areas. The TCE of
     Ceará received some training and the audits were undertaken, however, they were sometimes
     late. Although a US$ 1 million component for these issues was included in the original design,
     the Government decided to support this through the IDB PROMOEX loan. This loan moved
     slowly and the contingency funds on the TA to cover this eventuality were never activated.
     There was little oversight on the procurement side, and while no mis-procurement occurred,
     an opportunity for further strengthening procurement was missed.

· Implementation of the project highlighted the need to put more and very careful attention into
     definition of the indicators. Compound indicators, which included two or three parts created
     problems when there was success in one or two components of the indicator, but not the third.
     The indicator on hospital admission for children under 5 with diarrhea proved to have a
     number of issues ­ even though internments were going down the denominator of the
     indicator was fluctuating for other reasons and meant that the target was never reached even
     though hospitalizations were being reduced. Finally, there were some cases where indicators
     were affected by exogenous shocks, such as excessive rains, that meant that the indicator
     could not be achieved. Again, teams working on subsequent multi-sector SWAps have taken
     many of the lessons on indicators on board when defining their own projects.

One issue that has remained under discussion is the use of "waiver" requests while implementing
the project. Teams & governments typically aim to define disbursement-linked indicators in a
way that Governments can meet, but with an effort. While many in the Bank are opposed to any
type of waiver, the team felt that the waiver mechanism was extremely useful for providing a
mechanism in which the Government had an incentive to keep working on a problem. Typically a
waiver request required the presentation of a work plan for meeting the relevant indicator. In
many cases in the loan, indicators were met, but just a month or two behind schedule due to some
factor outside of the Governments control. Waivers lent a degree of flexibility to the loan that was
highly constructive.

Overall, the project was the first of its kind and provides an example of an innovative response to
client demands. It allowed the Government to focus on key sectoral issues while addressing
critical public sector management issues across several sectors. The project was satisfactory in
meeting its objectives and created a model for which there is great demand in Brazil.

Overall assessment: Satisfactory

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of achieving fiscal sustainability and increasing social inclusion were (and remain)
highly relevant to state, national and Bank assistance strategies. The secondary objective of




                                                  20

strengthening results-based management in the state was also highly relevant to both the state and
in the CAS.

The Government had specified its development priorities in three documents: the Development
Agenda, the Social Inclusion Indicators, and the Multi-Year Budget ("Plano Pluriannual 2003-
2007) or "PPA"). Ceará's Comprehensive Development Agenda groups activities and under four
Development Axes which identify priority sectors and benchmarks. The Ceará SWApL
reconfigured the priority sectors into three axes: (a) Public Sector Management, (b) Human
Development, and (c) Sustainable Resource Management. The Public Sector Management Axis
strengthened fiscal and results-based management, promoting sustained improvements in central
and sector specific public administration. The Human Development and Sustainable Resource
Management Axes directly or indirectly supported seven of eight MDG benchmarks including:
extreme poverty eradication, universal primary education, reduced child mortality, improved
maternal health, combating diseases, environmental sustainability, and global development
partnership.

The Ceará SWApL with its multi-sector emphasis on fiscal sustainability and social inclusion
tracked directly three of four CAS priorities:
    · The Human Development Axis (Education, Health, and Social Inclusion) addressed the
        CAS priority, a "More Equitable Brazil"
    · The Sustainable Resource Management Axis (Environment, WRM, WSS) corresponded
        to the CAS's "More Sustainable Brazil"
    · The Public Sector Management Axis (Public Sector Management including fiscal,
        financial and efficient expenditure activities) corresponded to the CAS "Foundations of
        Economy & Governance" priority.

In this context, the operation addressed 20 of 40 targeted "medium-term outcomes" in the Brazil
CAS "Results Framework" (Report No. 27043-BR, November 10, 2003). Its focus on the
impoverished northeast was in line with CAS lending priorities and the multi-sector, integrated
approach echoes the CAS emphasis on an `integrated' development approach- 12 of 17 sub-
national loans in the CAS's 5-year lending program were integrated operations of which 6-8
would be in the Northeast. Its institutional strengthening activities would modernize the State and
significantly improve the impact of key EEP and other State programs. Hence, the Ceará SWApL
applied the CAS at the state level.

Relevance of Objectives: Highly Satisfactory

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The achievement of the PDO is rated as Satisfactory. Overall the project met its objective of
improving Ceará's fiscal sustainability. As a result of prudent fiscal management from 2003
to 2007, Ceará's fiscal situation is very healthy. The state government has achieved
increasing and substantial positive current savings that have permitted the state to
increase public investment and to reduce significantly its indebtedness. Primary balances
and net financing were also positive and increasing until 2005. In 2006, given its
improved fiscal conditions, the state government promoted a strong expansion of public
investment that led to a reduced primary balance (albeit, still positive) and to a small
borrowing requirement. In 2007, the new state administration adopted a very tight fiscal


                                                 21

stance that increased the operating and primary balances and accelerated the decline in
Ceará indebtedness. (see Figure 1). More details on Ceará's fiscal and debt sustainability can be
found in Annex 1 of the Project Appraisal Document for the second SWAp loan.

The project's objectives were also largely met with respect to social inclusion. While attribution
is always a thorny issue, the project can be said to have contributed directly to the following
results:

· At least 90% of pregnant women have received 4 pre-natal consultations;
· At least 60% of the population is covered by Family Health Program teams;
· Implementation of national and state education testing cycles is completed and results
    disseminated;
· The illiterate population aged 15+ was reduced by over 100,000;
· 120 km of the critical Castanhão-Fortaleza water conveyance system was completed;
· 34,160 new household water connections and 18,440 new household sanitation service
    connections were installed;
· The ratio of CAGECE's (water company) operating costs to operating revenues was less than
    70.66%;
· Industrial bulk water users (>80%), large irrigation users (5%) and aquaculture users (40%)
    were charged for water use;
· A caatinga (vulnerable and biodiversity rich biome) park of over 10,000 ha was established
    with zoning and management plans;
· Economic and environmental zoning studies were completed (caatinga, coastal) or contracted
    (serras úmidas) and a report issued on implementation of the coastal program so important for
    the tourism industry.


Achievement of PDO: Satisfactory

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency: NA
No economic analysis was done for the project and efficiency is always difficult to measure
especially for institutional reforms. As per the ICR guidelines, the efficiency in the Outcome
rating asks whether the costs involved in achieving project objectives were reasonable in
comparison with both the benefits and with recognized norms ("value for money"). It is worth
noting that with an amount of US$149.75 million, the project leveraged a huge amount of money
across 6 different sectors. In that perspective the project can be seen as very efficient. In addition,
the design of an M&E system contributed to better efficiency.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

The Ceará SWApL project was highly relevant, very innovative and has contributed to positive
outcomes in interrelated sectors (public sector management, human development and sustainable
resource management). As demonstrated above, both the fiscal sustainability and social inclusion
objectives of the project were met. In addition, the project played a key role in supporting the
development of improved public sector management building on results-based management. Key
objectives in individual sectors were also accomplished. Finally, it also supported implementation
of existing investment projects in the education, water and rural development.

The project was not rated as highly satisfactory because: (a) 2 APL triggers were not met and, (b)
the TA was not entirely done: a waiver for partial execution of the TA was provided (a number of
studies were done in-house and elections interrupted some work). Resources allocated to TA in
the project were not fully absorbed because TA needs and requests were not as fully integrated
into the sectoral programs as desirable. In effect, they had no "owner"; and (c) the protocols for
some indicators were not necessarily adequate. The indicators that were the most problematic
were the subjective education indicators and the one related to diarrhea.

In all, the project provided a new mechanism for responding to the needs of the State of Ceará,
one that achieved very positive results and has been taken up by a number of other states in Brazil
and other countries in the region. While not all indicators were fully met and there were issues
with implementation of the TA, it is not surprising that a new model would experience some
teething pains. Subsequent projects have aimed to incorporate the lessons of this project into their
design.

Rating: Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty levels are still unacceptably high in Ceará, with more than half the population (53%)
living below a poverty line of ½ minimum wage, and more than a quarter (26%) below an
extreme poverty line (¼ minimum wage). It is not yet possible to determine the specific impact of
the project on poverty levels -- the team will not be able to do so until the new round of the
PNAD household survey is done. However, it is evident that sustaining social inclusion gains and
obtaining a substantial reduction in current poverty levels will require more rapid economic

growth. The new administration, inaugurated in January 2007, has placed a greater emphasis on
"inclusive growth," as part of its program.

The project most targeted gender issues in the indicator on women receiving pre-natal care. At
least 90 percent of women receive at least 4 pre-natal care visits. Efforts to extend both health
care and education services, as well as better access to water, are all likely to have a positive
impact on women and children, further strengthening social development. As noted above the
social inclusion & culture leg of the human development axes had no disbursement­linked
indicators and as a result this component had little impact.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project focused on results-based management (RBM) and by the end of the project
this theme has taken a huge leap, more than the team had initially contemplated. In the last
year of the loan, the Governor used indicators throughout his Annual Address. See the 2006
"Mensagem a Assembléia Legislativa": the State expanded from the loan's six Sector Strategic
Plans to cover all Sectors with Strategic Plans and indicators. Presentations also indicate that the
RBM was extended at several levels:
        · Government-level strategic results (39 indicators)
        · Sectoral Strategic Results (116)
        · Sectoral Programs (75)
        · Sectoral Products (234)
        · Operational Plan (SWAp Indicators)

The project also made an effort to strengthen financial management, procurement and auditing
capacities. While some progress was made, further work is needed in these areas and has been
included as part of the Second SWAp.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One positive outcome relates to the consequences that arose from an indicator that was
not met and for which a partial waiver was granted. The percent of hospital admissions of 5
year olds or younger for diarrhea did not drop from 2005 and 2006. Upon further diagnosis it was
clear that the indicator related not only to the health system but to water as well. A cross-sectoral
group was established, a work program implemented and absolute numbers of children
hospitalized for diarrhea declined significantly. The creation of the group also strengthened the
Government's capacity to work on issues in a cross-sectoral manner as opposed to in stove-pipes.
Because this indicator was a disbursement indicator, additional efforts were put in place to
understand why the indicator had not been reached and to work together more effectively across
sectors.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Although no formal beneficiary survey has been held, there have been on-going consultations
with stakeholders in the preparation of Phase II of the project. Consultations have been held with
respect to safeguard issues with the disclosure of the relevant frameworks for addressing
safeguard issues. In addition, the Government has consulted broadly across the state on its overall
programs and priorities. Feedback on improved services has been positive, but there is great
emphasis on increasing incomes. As a result, at the request of the Government, the second Ceará


                                                  24

SWAp has included a greater emphasis on the growth and competitiveness of the State, while
maintaining a focus on key social issues.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

As in most projects, the period of study is too short to be able to assess the development outcome
or whether the outcomes are going to have a long lasting effect. However, some features were
introduced in the project in order to sustain positive development outcomes. The timing of loan
disbursement was calculated to ensure that the State could grow and implement its development
agenda while achieving a sustainable and improving primary surplus. In addition, the Ceará
SWApL indicators were projected for the second SWAp loan over a six year period, ensuring
continuous improvement and solidifying them within the M&E framework. The risk to
development outcomes is relatively low as sustained support of the development outcomes will
be provided Ceará SWAp II, going to the Board on September 30th.

Rating: Negligible

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Specific diagnostics were undertaken in each sector that enabled an effective prioritization of
issues and partnership with Government counterparts. Although the design was innovative and
complicated, it was thoroughly discussed in the Bank, both in DC and Brazil, with a full QER
undertaken. The loan was fully aligned with the Bank's strategy and was seen as an innovative
approach to meeting the CAS's goals on the ground. The project's results monitoring framework
was aligned with that of the CAS. Although the team new that there were risks to a new approach,
they took measures to mitigate these risks.

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Supervision was facilitated by the significant reporting requirements that had been built
into the project. Supervision for disbursements in Component 1 was effective, but that for
the TA was not. The Bank could have and should have been more effective on this front.
In addition, supervision around disbursements was such that sector staff over time came
to be less and less engaged in the project. This was partly due to limited resources, but
also due to the focus of the project on IPECE, the PIU and counterpart for
implementation. Finally, supervision of EEP spending reports was good, but supervision
of financial audits was less strong. These were often received with some delay. The

project would have benefited if we the Bank team had been more proactive on
supervision of financial and procurement side.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall Bank rating for the project is satisfactory. Although supervision could have
been improved for the TA component, the effort that went into sector diagnostics, design
and preparation of a new and innovative project and the effective supervision of EEPs,
disbursement-linked indicators and APL triggers all argue for a satisfactory rating. The
SWAp has demonstrated itself to be an effective new lending modality and in high
demand in Brazil. The Bank team deserves credit for its development.

Rating: Satisfactory


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

The Performance of the Borrower needs to be assessed taking into account the complexity of the
project and the variety of monitoring reports that had to be produced on a regular basis. Different
Secretariats of the Government worked hard to develop sector strategies, to reach disbursement ­
linked indicators and to understand what was causing difficulties when indicators were not
reached. In addition they complied with significant reporting requirements. The Government as a
whole was highly committed to the reforms and to the results-based management approach.
While performance on implementing the TA could have been improved, as a whole the
Government performance was satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

A small Project Implementing Unit (PIU) of full-time staff under the immediate supervision of
the head of the SEPLAN Research Institute (IPECE) was the main counterpart during loan
preparation and implementation. The team was dedicated and followed the project closely, with a
"central command' room where posters of progress were on the walls and where the frequent
cross-sectoral meetings for project supervision were held. The PIU team was very pro-active and
contributed extensively from supporting the design to maintaining a Committee with regular
reports, to joining battle on tough problems, and transforming the RBM culture. More could have
been done from the PIU's side with respect to supporting implementation of the TA component
and on oversight of delivery of the financial audits by the TCE-CE. In addition, it would have
been useful for the unit to have had, at least on retainer, a specialist on procurement to assist
when issues arose. Overall, the PIU's performance was satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory




                                                26

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Both the Borrower's and implementing Agency's performances were satisfactory making
overall Borrower performance satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory


6. Lessons Learned

The Ceará Multi- Sector Social Inclusion Project was the first in Brazil to use a SWAp modality
to support a multi-sector program. The Bank reimbursed key Eligible Expenditure Programs in
line with results based on key sectoral indicators. The following lessons can be drawn from
the experience in implementation of this project:

1. Despite its complexity, a multi-sectoral SWAp, can be very a very effective instrument,
especially when addressing issues that cut across sectors, such as public sector reform. The
Ceará SWApL allowed the Government to drill down into specific sector needs, but at the same
time to focus on developing a framework for results-based management in all the sectors. This
helped the Government to more effectively address its key development issues. However, given
the complexity of the SWAp mechanism, care needs to be taken to assure that the scope is
manageable and that there is ownership for all sectors included and of all components of the
operation. Implementation suggests that there was little ownership for the Social Inclusion &
Culture component and the ultimate impact of the project would not have changed had this
component not been included.

2. The disbursement design created positive incentives. Disbursing against spending on priority
programs and against achievement of key indicators worked well. In particular the notion that a
disbursement can be pro-rated according to the number of indicators achieved (and so that an
entire tranche is not held up when one indicator is missed) helped provide flexibility and
incentives for different government actors to both achieve their own goals as well as to help
others in achieving their indicators. Disbursement of Component 1 resources directly to the
Treasury complemented these incentives.

3. State capacity needs to be taken into account. At the beginning of the project, there was a
concern that the multi-sectoral, results-based APL approach could overwhelm the State's
institutional capacity. Benchmarks might not be achieved, and the loan might not disburse. These
concerns were mitigated by loan design features. EEP programs, disbursement indicators, APL
triggers and Sector Plan benchmarks were jointly determined by Bank and client sector specialists
and were by and large feasible. Having an efficient counterpart who understands the project and
can implement it in a timely fashion is important and should be carefully assessed during project
preparation. In particular, it is important to assess the strength of the financial management,
auditing and procurement capacities.

4. Ownership matters. The program and indicators were developed and reflected the Borrower's
own program. Without full ownership, this project would not have had positive outcomes. The
Government of Ceará took ownership and was committed to carrying out the program. The key
counterparts remained the same throughout the project and had the authority to request
information from other entities involved and to make decisions.



                                                27

5. Indicators require careful thought and design. Many issues related to the definition and design
of indicators arose in the project. It is best not to use compound indicators where one or two
aspects can be accomplished but another not, thus creating confusion with respect to whether the
indicator is achieved or not. Care needs to be taken as well to assure that when ratios are used
that both the numerator and denominator move consistently and are not subject to exogenous
factors that can distort measurement of an outcome. Specific protocols indicting data source,
periods for measurement and other key details should be included.

6. Have some flexibility throughout project implementation. EEP expenditures and disbursement
conditions were reviewed throughout the project (and disbursed every 6 months). Projects should
enable some small adjustments during project implementation. In the case of this project, partial
waivers allowed for some degree of flexibility, but were only used in cases when overall goals of
the sector were being achieved. "Waivers" should not been seen as a failure but rather as a way
to foster discussion and bring together different stakeholders to solve a common issue. This
happened for the indicator on hospital admissions for diarrhea in children under 5 years old. In
the end, the problem was not related to the health sector and a multi-sector group, including water,
was established, a work program was implemented and absolute numbers significantly declined.
Beyond this example, the general issue is that designing real indicators means that some of them
might be missed during the course of the project and this is something teams need to be prepared
for.

7. The importance of a good M&E system to track results. The Government of Ceará and the
Bank had embedded a strong M&E framework to support operations. The M&E was simplified
for the Bank since the Government had to present evidence of fulfillment of disbursement
indicators in order to receive loan funds. For instance, the first intermediate indicator for the
public sector component was to ensure primary surplus: "achieve primary surplus target no lower
than R$134 million in 2005 and no lower than R$ 147 million in 2006" (PAD, Annex3; p38). For
the Monitoring and Evaluation of the targeted values, the primary balance baseline indicators and
values during project were calculated following the methodology used by the Fiscal Adjustment
Program (PAF) agreed by STN and the GOC on May 25th, 2004; this enabled clear and reliable
sources for monitoring the results.

8. Close attention needs to be paid to the TA Program. The ability to include a TA component in
a multi-sector SWAP is a key advantage of this type of instrument. However, it is critical that the
TA be well-designed, closely linked to the achievement of results and owned by the government.
Also, it is critically important to assure that the capacity for implementing TA exists

9. Importance of internal collaboration and adequate supervision funding. As described
throughout this document, the project drew on several sectors and required the contribution of the
sectoral, fiduciary and safeguard teams. The project was very innovative and would not have
happened without the strong collaboration of all these teams. Attention needs to be paid to keep
the full team engaged beyond project preparation. Sufficient supervision resources are critical,
especially when a multi-sectoral loan is the only avenue for sectors to dialogue with a counterpart.
It is particularly important to make sure that supervision on the fiduciary and safeguard side
continue despite the reliance on state systems.

7. Comments on Issues    Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

At the program design stage it is important that the main Government and Bank stakeholders to
come up with an initial proposal to be presented and negotiated with the line secretaries.
Therefore, the program final design is a result of mixed up-down / bottom­up negotiations.

The sector teams should be aware that there is a trade ­ off when working with a multi-sector
SWAP program. As you work with many sectors you have to be focused on few priority issues.
On that matter it is important a close work between the Bank's sector teams and the program
TTLs (Bank and Government).

The use of DLI (Disbursement Linked Indicators) is a shared risk-taking strategy between the
Government and the Bank. As so, the waiver mechanism plays a key role and it very important to
face real world uncertainty.
