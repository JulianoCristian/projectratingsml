There are two project components: Component\n            1: This component supports nine eligible expenditure\n            programs across five key line sectors: health, education,\n            water & sanitation, water source management and\n            environment.

Component 2:\n            This technical assistance component supports primarily the\n            public sector management umbrella sector but will improve\n            Government management across all sectors.
