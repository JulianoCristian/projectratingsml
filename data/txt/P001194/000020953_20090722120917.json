b) Rapid\n            mobilization of resources available through the easing of\n            budgetary procedures and rules of procurement and\n            disbursement. The main hypothesis for reformulation of the\n            Project is as follows: Two (2) years the project will focus\n            on the operational components in order to: 1) have concrete\n            results and effects on the framework and living conditions\n            of populations in areas of the Project; 2) have a high rate\n            of disbursement; 3) build on past achievements and results\n            of two years to prepare a second phase of twelve (12) years.\n            The impact of resettlement caused by development projects,\n            if not mitigated, often give rise to economic, social and\n            environmental safeguards that may be realized by the\n            dismantling of production systems: a) The involuntary taking\n            of land and other property causing: The removal or loss of\n            shelter; The loss of property or access to assets; Loss of\n            income or subsistence products that affected people should\n            or should not move to another site; b) The involuntary\n            restriction of access to parks and protected areas legally\n            designated causing adverse impacts on living conditions of\n            displaced persons."}, "docdt": "2008-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
