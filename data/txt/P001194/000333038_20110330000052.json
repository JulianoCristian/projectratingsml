the Rural Land Management\n            and Community Infrastructure Development Project for Cote\n            d'Ivoire were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in view of\n            the institutional environment at the time of preparation,\n            Government resisted the idea of merging two projects under\n            the umbrella of PNGTER (Projet National de Gestion des\n            Terroirs et Equipment Rural - Rural Land Management and\n            Community Infrastructure Development Project). Had the Bank\n            accepted this to finance separate projects, the impact will\n            likely have improved for both objectives. Bank teams should\n            make sure that institutional arrangements are realistic,\n            achievable and acceptable to the government. It took seven\n            years to convince the government to authorize the transfer\n            of funds to communities. In cases like this where the\n            Borrower is unwilling to move forward, tough decisions must\n            be made on whether or not to proceed. Despite active\n            community participation in local development planning,\n            discussions during development of the Bank's country\n            partnership strategy and the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) mission revealed that there was generally a\n            poor understanding of projects financed by the Bank. A lack\n            of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of\n            beneficiaries is likely one factor for the poor performance\n            of PNGTER. An important lesson learned is the necessity for\n            Bank-financed projects to respect their commitment to\n            accompany the Government in the implementation of its\n            policies. The PNGTER had the mission to help Government\n            implement its decentralization policy and land tenure\n            reforms. However, the institutional link between the project\n            and national programs was tenuous at best, and PNGTER\n            operated largely independently, without coordination at a\n            higher level."}, "docdt": "2011-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
