Potential negative environmental impacts\n            resulting from the infrastructure- or agriculture-related\n            project activities of the PNGTER will be mitigated or\n            avoided entirely by emphasizing social, environmental,\n            economic, and cultural factors in community planning and\n            decisionmaking. Impacts that arise from rural road\n            rehabilitation will be mitigated by rehabilitating quarries,\n            creating drainage systems, clarifying land tenure, and\n            reverting to community-based land management. Impacts\n            arising from building small dams and levies, including\n            altering downstream water flows and siltation, will be\n            mitigated by properly dimensioning dams and levies, and\n            introducing erosion control measures in watersheds. Soil\n            depletion and erosion caused by intensifying agricultural\n            practices will similarly be alleviated by watershed control\n            measures, improving fallow, afforestation, and using cover\n            crops. The loss of biodiversity and hydrological regulation,\n            irreversible soil damage, and the lowering of the water\n            table will be avoided by land use preserving a portion of\n            vegetation, careful drainage of organic soils, and careful\n            placement of irrigation infrastructure. Soil and water\n            contamination, health hazards, and utrophication of\n            freshwater bodies resulting from increased chemical use will\n            be reduced by improving the organic matter content in soils,\n            training in application techniques, pesticide control,\n            educating the local population on pesticide use, and\n            protecting sensitive water bodies."}, "docdt": "2008-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
