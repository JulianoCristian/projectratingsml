Highway 1A\n            is Vietnam's most important transport artery\n            facilitating the movement of goods and people and underpins\n            its economy. HRP 1, through restoring significant sections\n            of that highway, was highly relevant to the country's\n            economic priorities. The project also represented an\n            opportunity to lay the groundwork for longer-term\n            collaboration between Vietnam and IDA in the transport\n            sector. Transport sector strategy at appraisal agreed\n            between Government of Vietnam (GOV) and the Bank was to\n            focus assistance on the rehabilitation of existing\n            infrastructure rather than new construction projects. This\n            strategy was justified at the time because it was clear that\n            the economy in the early 1990s was radically changing for\n            the better, but uncertainties about the sustainability of\n            the economic transformation made it difficult to predict\n            future transport demand. Nevertheless, worldwide experience\n            of countries transitioning toward a market economy has shown\n            that one of the first pressure points due to pent-up demand\n            is usually to rapidly expand capacity for road transport\n            through increasing the capacity of under-developed road\n            systems. Therefore it could be argued that the conservative\n            approach adopted in this project may not have been the most\n            relevant or appropriate investment strategy. In the view of\n            the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) team the\n            failure to anticipate the future capacity constraints\n            suggests a high rating would be inappropriate and it is on\n            this basis that substantial was selected."}, "docdt": "2004-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
