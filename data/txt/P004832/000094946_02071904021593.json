Lessons highlight the hands-on-training\n            approach undertaken by the project, as an effective capacity\n            building method, but points that clear objectives, and\n            institutional arrangements are needed. Such method was\n            implicit in the project design, which resulted in a high\n            level of capacity, and knowledge being exchanged during\n            implementation, and, allowed focusing on a limited number of\n            high return investments, rather than spreading larger\n            numbers over wider areas, thus avoiding complex project\n            elements, and implementation arrangements. Contributing\n            factors to this approach were an open dialogue, selective\n            technical assistance, and high-level of project supervision.\n            However, and particularly in transition economies, careful\n            consideration is required to build capacity, and supervision\n            arrangements, especially so, in the absence of experience\n            with international financial management practices,\n            contracting, or procurement procedures. It is worth noting,\n            that since the public sector may still be dominant in Viet\n            Nam, clear guidelines, and qualification criteria should be\n            established for state-owned enterprises, at the early stages\n            of the project. And, to avoid undermining the benefits of\n            road improvements, road safety must be given sufficient\n            visibility at all levels of project design, supervision, and operation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
