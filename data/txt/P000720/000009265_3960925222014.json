The main findings of the project\n            are: in emergency projects of this nature, it is correct to\n            keep the project simple by limiting it to easily manageable\n            key components, with emphasis on action, and giving other\n            institutional aspects only secondary consideration; and to\n            accelerate the arrival of key inputs such as trucks which\n            were crucial to the transport of relief materials, the\n            Borrower should avail itself of the Bank's sample\n            bidding documents and specifications when these are\n            relevant, and the Bank should provide technical assistance\n            to help the Government through the procurement process when\n            the implementing agency lacks this experience."}, "docdt": "1990-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
