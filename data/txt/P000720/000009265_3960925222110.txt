PREFACE
This is a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of the Drought
Recovery Program (Credit 1576-ET) involving a credit in the total amount of
US$30.0 million. Credit 1576-ET was approved in April 1985 and closed, fully
disbursed on April 30, 1987.
The PPAR is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) issued in
May 1990 by the East Africa Department/Africa Regional Office, the President's
Report, Credit documents, and a review of project files. Staff involved with the
project was interviewed. An OED mission visited Ethiopia in January/February
1991.   The mission had discussions with officials  of the Ministries  of
Agriculture and Finance, the Relief and Rehabiliation Commission and other
agencies connected with the project.   A field trip to the project area was
undertaken.  The kind cooperation and valuable assistan e given by all persons
met is gratefully acknowledged.
The PCR provides a fair account and assessment of project experience,
and discusses the performance of the Bank and project executing agencies. This
PPAR, prepared a few years after completion of the project, discusses problems
of village water supply and farmer credit.
The draft FPAR was sent to the Borrower for comments but none were
received.

DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAM
(CREDIT 1576-ET)
I. BACKGROUND
Context
1.1         Between 1982 and 1984 severe drought conditions persisted throughout
the country with the worst effected regions being Wello, Tigray, Eritrea, Gonda
and Sidamo. It is estimated that by the end of 1984, between 6-10 million people
were affected by the drought and needed relief assistance.   Only about 2-3
million could be reached, however, because of poor infrastructure and transport
facilities and civil unrest in parts of the drought areas, particularly those in
the northern part of the country.
1.2         At the Annual Bank-Fund meeting of 1984, the Government of Ethiopia's
(GOE) Finance Minister outlined his country's intentions towards drought areas.
The GOE requested the donor community, the Bank included, to supplement its
efforts in saving the lives of thousands of starving people.
Obiectives
1.3         The 1984/85 famine required quick action of the donor community. The
Bank's assistance had the following objectives:
(i)      support the recovery of peasant crop and livestock production;
(ii)      increase  the  Government's  capacity  to  cope with  the  drought
situation and to implement the relief effort; and
(iii)      reduce the fiscal and balance of payment impact of the drought
resulting from diversion of foreign exchange from development
purposes to relief operations.
Design
1.4         The project was to finance the foreign cost of:
(i)      50,000 tons of fertilizers (diammonium phosphate), and one year
supply of pesticides and veterinary drugs and equipment to enhance
food and livestock production by peasant farmers;
(ii)      spare parts for the public and private truck fleets, and 100 medium
size four wheel drive 5-10 ton trucks for the Governmert's Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC); and



-2-
54ii)      pumps, motors and generators to repair water supplies in drought
areas and two drill rign with accessory equipment to rehabilitate
water supplies and construct new ones in those areas. The package
included 170 pumps and engines, 90 generating units, and 800 hand
operated pump sets and spare parts; and The program was also to
fund technical assistance for the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA)
Technical Support Unit to provide administrative services for the
program in coordinating disbursements and progress reporting.
Finance Plan
1.5         Total project cost was estimated at US$41.4 million equivalent
including duties and taxes of about U6$4.5 million and a foreign exchange
component of US$30.0 million or 81 percent of total project cost, net of duties
and taxes. The IDA Credit of US$3.0 million was expected to cover 100 percent
of all foreign cost.   Since the project was an emergency relief program no
Economic Rate of Return was calculated at appraisal.
II. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
2.1         The implementing agencies--the Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation
(AISCO), the National Road Transport Corporation (NATRACOR) now called Ethiopia
Freight Transport Corporation (EFTC), and the Ethiopian Water Works Construction
Authority all supported by the "Technical Support Unit of MOA"--cooperated to
facilitate quick disbursement of the credit.
2.2         The project was implemented almost on-time with 97 percent of the
program complete within two years.   Seasonal inputs especia'lly fertilizer,
pesticides, and veterinary drugs were rapidly distributed.  Some delays were
encountered in the procurement of 100 four-wheel drive trucks when the National
Transportation Corporation was reluctant to accept the lowest bid for the sake
of keeping the truck fleet standardized.  On the insistence of the Bank, GOE
finally agreed to procure the vehicles from the lowest evaluated bidder.
2.3         The water supply component was also implemented in a timely manner.
Techniical Assistance (TA) was successfully implemented with about 85 percent of
the Credit Category spent on TA addressing long term aspects of drought through
research on improved seed varieties. The credit component of the project through
the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was not implemented, but
was not essential to meet the basic project objectives.
2.4         The April 1987 Closing Date was not modified, but the Credit account
was kept open until January 1988 to facilitate payments for vehicles and for some
water supply equipment. Despite IDA's constant requests for audited accounts for
the project, only NATRACOR provided such accounts for the period up to July 1987.



3-
III.  PROJECT OUTCOME
3.1         The project succeeded in substantially increasing fertilizer use and
com-ensurately raieing the output of baosc staples.  The trucks financed by the
project facilitated to a large extent the transport of required inputs to the
I rming areas and of food to urban centers. The drilling of 22 boreholes and 20
shallow wrells safeguards the supply of good quality drinking water to more than
90,000 ptople.  Due to the naturt, of a relief/emergency project no economic
evaluation has been undertaken.
IV. FINDINGS AND ISSUES
Genera.
4.1         The audit agrees with the PCR on the expeditious manner the Bank
handled the emergency situation caused by the severe 1984 drought. Especially
commendable was the work of the appraisal mission which did not only properly
identify and appraise the three project components, undertakings which wiere
likely to have the greatest impact on resolving the drought emergency, but also
for making Credit negotiations possible only 2-1/2 months after the appraisal
mission had returned to headquarters.   There are two aspects which provide
interesting le._ons for future projects dealing with emergency situations.
A.    Inputs for Restarting Production
4.2         The appraisal was,  in the audit's view, absolutely correct in
focusing on the needs for getting agricultural production back to normal as
quickly as possible.   Since the supply of seeds to farmers was found to be
assured by Government and other donors, fertilizers, pesticides, and veterinary
drugs were rightly considered as most important inputs to address the short term
production problems, i.e. contribute to generating more food in the shortest
possible time. The appraisal assumed that the most rapid results to improved
food supplies could be obtained through concentrating activities on areas of high
agricultural potential, i.e. the highland regions with high rainfall in normal
years.
4.3         Fertilizer application in these areas had remained at disappointing
low levels during the first half of the eighties because of the Government's
freeze of producer prices offering farmers little if any incentives to use modern
seasonal inputs.l/

Source:  World Bank Report No. 8062-ET:   EthioRia's Economy in the 1980s,
March 4, 1990, Tables 7.8 and 7.11.
4.4         From the above table it can be seen that fertilizer use declined from
1979/80 onwards. This decline was the consequence of relatively high fertilizer
cost on the one hand and Government controlled producer prices. The project, by
supplying farmers with free fertilizers, reversed the downward trend and by once
more demonstrating the positive effects of fertilizer application paved the way
for the substantial sales during the following years.
4.5         The Bank, at the time of project appraisal and Credit negotiations
was fully aware of the repercussions on production by the Government's adherence
to freezing input/output prices, and no efforts were made by the Bank to correct
the proven unfavorable input:output ratios.
4.6         The Bank having recognized the difficult situation of the Ethiopian
farmers in the past, especially during the implementation of the Grain Storage
and the Second Agricultural Minimum Package projects,2/ on the one hand and the
most difficult situation caused by the drought on the other, nevertheless
recommended input sales on standard credit terms.  The President's Report of
March 26, 1985 does not refer to the unsatisfactory input/output price ratio but
expected farmers to obtain inputs under prevailing Agricultural and Industrial
Development Bank (AIDB) conditions. In addition the Credit Agreement stipulates
that:
2/    op. cit.



-5-
"The Government shall cause AIDB to provide credit... through service
cooperatives to farmers, who purchase agricultural inputs financed
out of the Credit, credit being on terms and conditions with
standard rates in Ethiopia."
4.7         A better understanding might have previled within the Bank about the
difficult situation of the Ethiopian farmers caused by the drought. Belonging
to the poorest population segment and having been hit hard by a natural calamity
it was unrealistic to assume that farmers would be in a position to meet standard
credit terms, i.e. make a 15 percent down payment and pay up to 15 percent on
loans for financing inputs. In addition the question should be asked as to the
incentives farmers would have had to buy fertilizer in light of its relatively
high costs and the unsatisfactory low producer prices. The Bank was aware of the
unfavorable fertilizer cost:grain price ratios, but nevertheless, without having
any good reason expected farmers to apply costly fertilizers.
4.8         Although in breach of the Credit Agreement Covenant stipulating the
credit operations, the Government made the right decision in light of the
agricultural sector's difficulties, i.e. it distributed the inputs free of
charge. There is no indication on files that the Bank ever remonstrated against
the violation of the Credit Agreement.
4.9         While the audit sees a justification for the Bank's acquiescence in
this case, it also regrets that a chance for input "repayment" in kind was
missed.   Similar to the Freedom from Hunger programs, under which the rural
population receives food for communal work, recipients of the project financed
inputs could have been requested to provide work for projects of common interest,
such as reforestation, erosion control measures, establishment of contour bunds,
feeder road maintenance, etc.
B.    The Water Supply Component
4.10        The component was included in the project primarily to rehabilitate
existing boreholes and wells in drought afflicted areas and to provide
repla_ements for inadequate and obsolete drilling equipment which had mostly been
used for longer than its expected life span.   Equipment procured included
drilling rigs, submersible pumps, centrifugal pumps, hand pumps, well casings,
generating sets, etc. A total of 42 wells/boreholes were drilled and equipped
serving more than 90,000 people.
4.11        Little indication has been given in Bank reports--at appraisal stage
or at completion--about the arrangements for future operation and maintenance of
Bank financed water works. The mission discussed this issue with officials of
the EWWCA and is satisfied that all steps have been taken by the authority to
safeguard  operation  of  the  wells/associated  equipment.          Water  users
associations/committees have been set up and EWWAC staff is regularly inspecting
well   sites,   undertaking   minor   repair   works,   and   advising   the
associations/committees.   For more important repair works EWWAC's regional
offices are in charge and sufficiently equipped to carry out their expected work.
The associations/committees collect water charges from the households using the
water facilities. Revenues thus generated are, according to EWWAC sufficient to
cover cost of fuel for pump engines and minor repair/maintenance work.

4.12        The PCR (para. 9) states that "the (emergency) project was not
designed with the intention of being sustainable".  However, the water supply
component has the potential for sustainability. The project financed drilling
rigs are still in use.  Annual performance of a drilling rig under Ethiopian
conditions can be estimated to reach up to 2,000 m of drilled boreholes. The
economic life of a rig is at least 10 years, with some EWWAC rigs having been
operational for 30 years.
4.13        In conclusion it can be said that due to the good work of EWWAC and
its staff and despite foreign exchange problems hampering imports of fuel aid
spare parts, the project's water supply component has proven to be sustainable.
