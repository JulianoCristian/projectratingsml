proposed program would help the\n            Government to provide crucial relief and rehabilitation\n            services to alleviate the impact of drought and famine on\n            human welfare.  The main objectives include supporting the\n            recovery of peasant crop and livestock production; enabling\n            the Government to cope with the drought situation and relief\n            effort, as well as reducing the fiscal and balance of\n            payments impact of the drought.  To achieve these\n            objectives, the program would assist three key sectors:\n            agriculture, transportation, and water supply.\n            Specifically, the proposed program would fund 50,000 tons of\n            fertilizer and US$2.0 million worth of plant protection\n            chemicals and the same value of veterinary drugs and\n            equipment for boosting 1985 agricultural production by\n            peasant farmers.  It would also provide about 100 four-wheel\n            drive trucks for the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission,\n            for transporting food from main stores to rural distribution\n            centers as well as spare parts for maintaining the public\n            and private truck fleet.  Furthermore, the program would\n            fund water pumps, motors and generators to repair about 170\n            mechanized and 800 hand-operated wells and boreholes in the\n            drought areas; and two drill rigs with ancillary equipment\n            for constructing potable water supplies."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
