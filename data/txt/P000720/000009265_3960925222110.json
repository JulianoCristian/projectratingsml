Some of the key\n            finding were as follows: the Bank took the correct position\n            by keeping the project simple, limiting financing to quick\n            disbursing components, leaving long term problems to be\n            tackled by other projects, and giving institutional aspects\n            only secondary consideration."}, "docdt": "1991-09-03T00:00:00Z"}
