REPORT AND RICOMIQNDATION OF THE PRESIDDNT
TO TH1 ECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR THE
KUAIA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT P1DJ3CT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$16 minlion to help finance a
project for urban transport in the Kuala Lumpur area. The loan vould have
a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7¼X percent.
per annwn.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, dated March 20, 1972 (EAP-31a) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on March 23, 1972. Its major conclusions were
discussed in my report on Loan 810-MA (Second Education Project, Report
No. P-1045O, dated March 16, 1972). No major changes in the economy have
taken place since that time. For ease of reference the economic section
of my Report No. P-1045 is included in Annex II which also includes Basic
Data for Mslaysia.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPHLAT3DNS
3.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's nineteenth to Malaysia, its
third for transport but first for mrban transport. The first transport loan
was made to the Sabah Ports Authority for reconstruction and modernization
of port facilities in Sabah, and the second to the Malayan Railway Adminis-
tration for modernization of the railways in West Malaysia.  Other loans
have been for agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power,water supply,
education and telecommunications. Although in a few oases disbursements
have been delayed, the execution of these projects has generally been satis-
factory. As of April 30, 1972 the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted
to US$275.3 million. In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965 to. the Public
Utilities Board of Singapore (Loan 4O5-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance
the Johore River Water projecty the amount due to the Bank is US$5.7 million.
Annex I contains summary statements of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1972 and notes on project encountering delays in disbursements.
4.        As noted in Annex II, the Malaysian economy has grown at a rate of
about 6.2 percent per annum over the past decade, despite the continued fall
in the price of its principal export, rubber. This has been made possible
by favorable natural resources, a high level of education, and a strong
and dynamic private sector, supported by sound fiscal and monetary policies,
and by generally adequate and properly maintained public services.
5.        In recent years, the uneven distribution of the benefits of growth
between the different races and the different regions of the country, as well
as the rising level of unemployment, have become a natter of increasing concern
to the Goverrnent. 'To alleviate these problems the Goverrnent proposes to
increase public and private inveatmaent and is seeking.ways'of. dealing more



-2-
directly with income disparities.  At the request of the Government, future
Bank missions will look more closely into 'these problems and help the'
Government devise policies and identify projects that would be consistent
with the socio-economic goals 'of Mlaysia.
6.        One of the major problems in carrying out the current Five Year
Plan, besides the formulation of measures to bring about greater income
equality' is the lack of capacity in the public sector'to prepare and
implement a sufficiently large investment program.  The Bank has assisted
the Government in the preparation of projects either through technical
assistance or by acting as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. In
the course of its normal lending operations, the Bank has also helped
strengthen public agencies responsible. for carrying out important parts of
Malaysials investment program. Malaysia, however, will continue to need
such assistance for some time, if she is to succeed in implementing her
economic policies and in making the best use of.her external and domestic
resources. The Bank will, therefore, continue' its assist'nce through its
lending operations and technical assistance and these policies will be
reflected in 'the loans which I hope to bring before you in the next year
or so. These loans would be for projects involving land settlement, agri-
cultural credit, water supply, road transport and family planning.
7.        Izi the past the Bink has provided about 40 percent of total
project aid to Malaysia; bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom,
and loans' from the'Asian' Developinent Bank provided the'rest.  Japan is,
increasing its aid substantially and market loans may become'more important.
Bank lending in the next few years is expected to increase substantially
in line with the increase in Malaysia's total external borrowing.
8.        The proposed loan,as well a's the projected Bank, 4DB and bilateral
lending, is well within Malaysia's debt carrying capacity. Debt service
obligations are expected to remain below'5 percent of export earnings during
the 1970's.
PART III -'THE PROJECT
The Urban Problegs of luala Lumpur and the 11ang Valley
9.        Over 80 percent of the population of West Malaysia, and an even
higher percentage of its economic activities, are concentrated west of the
central mountain ranges, especially in the Xlang Valley around Kuaia Lum,pur
(see map 2).  Population in Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding Klang Valley has
been growing at about 5.5 percent per annum. Besides Kuala Lumpur, the
Klang Valley includes the two new industrial towns'of Petaling Jaya and
Shah Alam, WeUst Malaysia's major port, Port Klang, an international airport
and a substantial portion of the new industrial plants. The locational
advantages of the Klang Valley make it the main natural focus for growth
in the modern -- and urban -- sectors;of the economy.



3-
10.       The continuing growth in population and economic activity in the
Valley, particularly around the Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya area, has been
accompanied by serious problems typical of the urbanization process in
developing countries. Unemployment is high. Housing, particularly for
the poorer classes, is inadequate and badly sited in relation to employment.
Congestion has been exacerbated by a particularly rapid increase in the
numbers of private cars, cycles and scooters. Public transport has so far
failed to provide an attractive alternative. Land use policies have proved
inadequate as a basis for rational urban growth.
II.       In support of Malaysia's attempt to deal with these problems the
Bank has taken two closely inter-related and mutually reinforcing approaches:
(a) assistance in devising an urban development strategy and corresponding
policies and institutions; and (b) identification of a project which would
help resolve an immediate problem by eliminating a major transport bottleneck.
12.       The proposed project originates from the findings of a Bank urban
reconnaissance mission in 1970 and the UNDP-financed General Transport Survey
completed in 1969, for which the Bank acted as Executing Agency. The report
and the reconnaissance mission identified as of high priority the expansion
and improvement of the Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya urban section of the
Federal Highway (see map 3), the main artery linking Kuala Lumpur to Port
Klang. The mission reported that the congestion in this section of the
Federal Highway was beginning to impede the movement of persons and goods
essential for a growing metropolitan area, and that the success of devel-
opment schemes proposed for the region was threatened.
13.       A subsequent Bank project preparation mission confirmed this
conclusion. It emphasized, however, that if the full benefits of the
project were to,be obtained, a series of studies of urban planning
problems needed to be carried out. These dealt with: (a) public transport;
(b) the role of private vehicles; (c) traffic engineering and regulation;
(d) parking and related regulations; (e) consistency between land use and
transportation policies; and (f) the need for an improved city transport
system. Attention was also drawn to the need for consideration of longer
term national urbanization policies, linkages between the growth of Kuala
Lumpur and other smaller urban centers in the Klang Valley, and for the
development of institutions that would formulate and implement such policies.
14.       The Government is now working on plans to promote orderly develop-
ment in the Klang Valley region and to create greater regional balance and
thus avoid an over-concentration of population and economic activity in a
few areas. The latter objective is to be achieved through major regional
development planning exercises for areas outaide the Klang Valley, such as
Penang, Johore and Pahang and perhaps through the establishment of new urban
centers. To improve planning and its implementation in the Klang Valley
area, including Kuala Lumpur, a UNDP-financed Klang Valley Regional Planning
and Development Study is being carried out, with the Bank as Executing Agency.



The study is expected to be completed by March 1973. Besides examining
better ways to coordinate planning and project execaticn, the study will
identify projects essential for the orderly development of the Knang
Valley region.
15.       Other aspects of urban development in the Klang Valley area,
particularly those relating to mass transit, restraint of private vehicles
in inner-city areas and land use regulation, are covered by studies included
in the proposed project. The Malaysian Government has agreed to reriew
these studies and the Klang Valley studies with the Bank. The terms of
reference for the feasibility studies of high priority projects that may be
identified by these studies would also be prepared in-close consultation with
the Bank.
16.       The Bank helped the Government to prepare the terms of reference
for the feasibility study and the detailed engineering of the Federal Highway.
The feasibility study, including preliminary engineering, was completed in
September 1971 with financial assistance from the United Kingdom. The
detailed engineering of the highway began in October 1971 and tender documents
are expected to be completed in October 1972. A Bank mission appraised the
proposed project in November and December 1971 and January 1972 on the basis
of preliminary cost estimates provided by consultants. Since then final cost
estimates based on detailed engineering have been made and the Appraisal Report
and the related documents have been revised accordingly. The Appraisal Report
(PS-lOa) dated May 31, 1972 is being circulated separately.
17.       Negotiations were held in Washington starting May 11, 1972. The
Borrower's negotiating team was led by Mr. Wong Yoke Meng, Under-Secretary
(Finance) of the Treasury.
DescriDtion of the Project
18.       The project consists of
(a)  improvement of about 6 miles of the Federal Highway from
Kuala Lumpur through Petaling Jaya;
(b)  detailed engineering of (a) above;
(c)  studies of the transport problems of metropolitan Kuala
Lumpur, with particular emphasis on measures to improve
public transport, and a feasibility study and preliminary
engineering of complenentary roads to distribute traffic;
(d)  a study of the road maintenance organization of the Public
Works Department (NWD);
(e) detailed engineering of about 137 miles of Federal Route I.
A project summary has been included in Annex III.
19.       The improvement of the urban section of the Federal Highway is
designed to ease the flow of persons and goods within the rapidly developing
metropolitan corridor, which extends for about six miles from the center of



Kuala Lwnpur through the town of Petaling Jaya. It would also improve trans-
port between the metropolitan area and other major development areas (Shah
Alam, Port Klang and Subang Airport) along the 25-mile sec'ion of the Federal
Highway between Kuala Lumpur and Port Ilang.
20.       At present, intersections slow up traffic on the Federal Highway
and make cross-town movement in Petaling Jaya difficult and hazardous. The
construction of interchanges will separate these conflicting movements and
thereby improve traffic capacity and safety. It will also facilitate vehicle
and pedestrian movements from one side of Petaling Jaya to the other. The
interchanges will accommodate all major traffic and will include bus stops
designed to permit safe and convenient service for passengers. This improve-
ment of the highway includes cycle lanes with access at each interchange and
three pedestrian bridges between interchanges. These would improve the
access and safety of motorcyclists, bicyclists (which together form 20 percent
of the traffic of the Federal Highway) and pedestrians as well as improve the
flow of vehicular traffic.
21.       The studies included in the proposed project would examine and
recommend measures to encourage the use of public transport. Particular
emphasis would be given to short-term improvements to incres8e the efficiency
and attractiveness of bus services and to alleviate present problems of bus
operation in metropolitan Kuala Lumpur. The studies also include detailed
consideration of the problems if intra-city transport and in particular a
feasibility study and preliminary engineering of complementary roads to distribute
traffic from the present project into Kuala Lumpur, including bus connections
with the central area.
22.       The proposed project also includes detailed engineering for about
137 miles of the Federal Route I, the main north-south highway in West
Malaysia. The improvement of this route was recommended by the UNDP-financed
General Transport Survey, and a feasibility study financed by UNDP with the
Bank serving as 13kecuting Agency reported favorably. Accordingly, the Govern-
ment has asked the Bank to finance the project which is to be appraised during
this calendar year.
Excecution of the Project
23.       Since the proposed project would be the first highway project to
come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Public Works Department, it was
agreed that it should include a study of the maintenance organization of PWD.
Although so far the West Malaysian road network has been adequately maintained
and properly financed, the maintenance work of FWD needs improvement.
24.       The Federal Public Works Department (FWD) would be responsible
for the improvement of the Federal Highway and for this purpose has already
established a project supervision unit. Although FWD is short of staff,
its personnel are competent, and with the assistance of consultants financed
under the proposed loan are fully capable of carrying out this part of the
project which is expected to be completed by mid-1976.



-6-
25.       The Ministry of Communications would have the major responsibility
for carrying out the studies dealing with urban transport policy. An studies
included in the project are expected to be completed by end 1973.
Cost of the Project
26.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$31.6
million. (For more detailed cost estimates see Annex III.) Its foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$16 million or about 50 percent of
the total cost and would be financed by the proposed loan. Local expend-
iture on the project would be financed by the Government. The cost of
the detailed engineering of the Federal Highway would include retroactive
financing not exceeding US$1 million of expenditures made as of October 15,
1971. The cost of the detailed engineering of the Federal Route I, includes
retroactive financing not exceeding US$400,000 of expenditures as of
March 1, 1972.
Procurement and Disbursement
27.       The construction works of the Federal Highway would be combined
into a single contract because they are concentrated within a small area
and their construction sequences are closely interdependent.  In addition,
a single contractor would be able to utilize his construction equipment
more effectively on various jobs, and problems of divided responsibility
for maintenance and safety of traffic during construction would be avoided.
The contract would be based on unit prices and would be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. It is
expected that a number of local sub-contractors would be used on the construction
of the project. The short list of consultants to carry out the proposed studies
would be agreed upon between the Government and the Bank. Disbursements would
be made against 65 percent of the cost of civil works and 60 percent of the
cost of consultants' services, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component.
Economic Justification
28.       The economic rate of return of the proposed improvements of the
Federal Highway, based on savings in vehicle operating cost and personal time,
is estimated at 37 percent, while on vehicle operating cost savings alone would
be about 22 percent. There are also non-quantifiable benefits such as the
integration of two parts of Petaling Jaya, the increased safety of pedestrians,
cyclists and motorcyclists, and the improvement of access between the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area and other major development areas in the Klang Valley.
The last is essential for continued industrial growth and the expansion of
employment in the Valley.'
29.       The project is not expected to have any  significant adverse effect
on the environment.

PART IV - LThAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORIT!
30.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the pattern normally
used by the Bank for its projects.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
32.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXEUTION
Generally the execution of the projects has been satisfactory
and disbursements have proceeded as expected.  The Closing Date of Loan 434-MA
(Muda Irrigation), however, had to be postponed by about 18 months to
June 30, 1973 to allow for additional works which are expected to improve the
effectiveness of the project.
The Closing Date for Loans 500-MA (Keanubu Irrigation) and 561-MA
(Kuala Lumpur Water Supply) will have to be postponed because of unavoidable
delays in construction.

THE EOONOMY
Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President
to the Executive Directors on a Proposed Loan to
Malaysia for a Second Education Project, dated
March 16, 1972, Report No. P-1054, pp. 2-4
"8.       During the last decade, in spite of adverse political events - such as
the separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the confronta-
tion with Indonesia until 1966, the communal riots in 1969 and the subsequent
suspension of parliamentary government - and a deterioration of the terms of trade,
mainly as a result of the steady fall in the price of rubber, the Malaysian economy
continued on a strong and steady course with real GNP growing at about 6.2 percent
per annum. Dramatic productivity improvement in natural rubber production through
massive replanting in the early sixties was followed by increased exports of timber
and palm oil, bringing down the share of rubber in total export earnings from 48
percent in 1961 to 33 percent in 1971 while maintaining an annual 5.2 percent
growth rate of export earnings throughout the decade. The price of tin, the
second largest export earner, has remained strong.
9.        Malaysia's economic growth has been oriented towards exports of primary
commodities. Manufacturing had a relatively late start, because the payments
position was strong and it was therefore possible to have an open economy.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
Moderate encouragement of import substitution in a context of liberal investment
policies caused industry to grow at about 11 percent a year during the decade,
nearly twice the rate of GNP., but it still reached only 13 percent of West
Malaysia's GDP by 1970.
10.       Political calm has continued for nearly three years since the dis-
turbances of May 1969. However, the debate continues on the disparity between
the economic position of Malays and non-Malays. The tacit compact of the past,
which has prevailed since independence from Great Britain in 1957, and which gave
political dominance to the Malays and economic dominance to the Chinese, is
increasingly being questioned as the basis of national unity. The search for
economic and social policies designed to reduce the economic differences between
the two races is the principal theme of the Second Malaysia Plan for 1971-75 (SMP).
The SMP centers on the New Economic Policy which aims at eradicating poverty and
restructuring society, so that the present identification of race with particular
forms of economic activity will eventually be eliminated, although it does not set
out the specific measures to be taken. The SMP does not place redistribution of
wealth and income above economic growth; instead it sees continued rapid economic
expansion as being necessary to support these changes.
11.       During the Second Malaysia Plan period GNP is expected to grow at
6.8 percent a year. This is reasonable and in line with the annual growth
rates actually achieved during the recent past. The leading growth sectors
are agriculture and manufacturing, with expected annual growth rates of 8.3
percent and 12.5 percent respectively, while the service sectors are expected
to expand at a slower rate than GDP. The export growth target of 4.6 percent
a year assumes a 6 percent annual increase in rubber earnings, 5 percent in
timber, a decline in tin, and rapid growth in other exports. The Plan proposes
a considerable increase in public development expenditures and assumes continued
strong private sector expansion.
12.       The effects which the New Economic Policy will have on the private
sector cannot be forecast until specific proposals have been worked out. In
the past the Government's policies have encouraged free enterprise, and after
the reestablishment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances the Government
took new measures to stimulate private investment. Private investment in 1970
increased spectacularly from 8.3 percent to 11.7 percent of GNP, and some
further expansion took place in 1971.
13.       The public investment target during the Plan period implies a 5.7
percent annual increase from the 1970 level, which is less than the projected
growth of GNP but would constitute a considerable improvement on the performance
of the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70). To offset the continued decline of
private investment'in agricultural estates, the largest portion, 26 percent, of
public development expenditure in the SMW is earmarked for agricultural and
rural development, followed by 22 percent for transport and communications and
15 percent for social services including education; the allocation for education
alone amounts to 7.4 percent.
14.       If the public investment targets are to be achieved the Government
will have to make a determined effort to expand its capacity to prepare and
implement inrLestment projects;. manpower shorta'Kems-if government departments

and agencies were a major reason why the targets of the First Plan were not
fully achieved. The steps taken thus far by the Goverrnment have not signifi-
cantly improved the situation and have been partially offset by the creation
of new agencies. However, the staffing situation should improve gradually
given the new stress within the educational system on technical training.
15.       The SMP aims at an annual increase in employment of 3.2 percent, equal
to the increase of the labor force, compared to an annual rate of 2.6 percent
achieved during 1966-70. Unemployment which in 1970 was officially estimated
to be 7.3 percent of the labor force would thus remain virtually unchanged. It
is concentrated in West Malaysia, and is particularly high amonig new entrants
to the labor force: as much as 20 percent of the population in the 15-24 age
group is unemployed and a growing number of them have completed general secondary
education. However, many of the unemployed come from rural areas and their
education makes it difficult for them to be absorbed in the fast growing urban
industries. Alongside the labor surplus Malaysia thus faces a serious shortage
of skills partly caused by the inappropriateness of the educational system.
16.       Money is not now a serious obstacle to maintaining a satisfactory rate
of real growth. However, public savings are low and this could become a problem
if the Government succeeded in improving its capacity to carry out projects.
The Government has, therefore, introduced additional taxes, the most important
of which is the 5 percent general sales tax introduced in the 1972 budget.
17.       Export earnings will grow at about 4.2 percent a year in the 1971-75
period compared with a 5.6 percent rate achieved in the preceding 5 years. This
is mainly because the secular decline in the price of rubber is likely to con-
tinue, after a temporary recovery from present low levels, and also because the
past rapid expansion of timber exports is likely to slow down. Continued growth
is expected in the export of palm oil and perhaps petroleum. If the Government
succeeds in raising the investment level significantly, imports will probably
grow at about 5.4 percent a year, causing the present surplus on goods and
services account to turn into a small deficit in the mid-seventies.
18.       After taking transfers and unrecorded items into account and assuming
the inflow of private foreign capital will grow in line with private investment,
external capital requirements during the 5MP period in the form of gross official
borrowing are projected at about US$100 million a year compared with little over
half that amount in 1966-70. These requirements would be covered by both pro-
ject and market loans. In the past, the Bank has provided 40 percent of total
project loans to Malaysia. Bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom and
other Commonwealth countries, accounted for another 45 percent and ADB for the
remaining 15 percent. Over the next five years, Japan is expected to be the
largest bilateral donor; a second credit line of Yen 36 billion, more than
double the amount of the first credit line, was signed in early 1972. ADB is
expected to continue expanding its lending. Bank lending is planned to increase
in line with total borrowing.



ANNEX II

19.       The projected levels of capital inflow are well within Malaysia's
debt-carrying capacity. Debt service obligations are at present less than
3 percent of exports and will probably remain below 5 percent during the
seventies. External reserves in mid-1971 were almost US$1 billion equivalent,
more than twice the total official debt outstanding and equivalent to 8 months'
imports."
