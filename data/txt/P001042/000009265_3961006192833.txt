MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECr: Project Completion Report on Guinea
First Agricultural Services Project (Credit 1636-GU9
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Guinea-Furst Agricultural Services
Project (Credit 1636-GUTI) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the
Borrower.
The objective of the project was to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Rural
Development in rural sector planning, project evaluation, and strategy and policy development,
through the establishment of a Bureau for Strategy and Development (BSD) within the Ministry.
The project supported BSD through the provision of technical assistance, facilities and equipment,
and local and foreign training. This effort was initially conceived as part of a broader, production
oriented operation, but was expanded and reconstituted as a separate project. Preparation and
appraisal were limited. Weak technical assistance and BSD management, political interference,
poor financial management, and lack of counterpart resources all contributed to minimal
achievement of project objectives. Institutional development impact is rated as negligible and the
overaUl project outcome as unsatisfactory. Sustainability is considered unlikely.
The Borrower, in its Part II submission, sees the project in a more favorable light.
Viewing it in the perspective of the overall context in which BSD operated, it considers that,
while specific targets of the project were not achieved, the project provided basic facilities and
training to a core of staff who have continued to provide a key input to the Ministry.
The completion report provides an adequate account of project implementation. An
audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUINEA
FIRST AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(CREDIT 1636-GUI}
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First
Agricultural Services Project for which Credit 1636-GUI in the amount of SDR
7,600,000 (US$7.5 million equivalent) was approved on November 26 1985.  The
Credit was closed on June 30 1992 on schedule. A balance of SDR 2,038,238.17 was
canceled from the Credit.
Parts I and III were prepared by a consultant and revised by staff
of the Agriculture Operations Division of the Occidental and Central Africa
Department. Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
Preparation of the PCR was done about nine months after the Credit
was closed. It is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA,
the Borrower and the implementation agency, internal IDA memoranda, reports
prepared by the implementation agency and discussions with representatives of the
Borrower and IDA staff.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Obiectives (Part I, para. 3)
1.          The objective of the project was to improve the capacity of the
Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) in rural sector planning, strategy and policy
formulation  and project  analysis.    This was  to be  achieved  through the
establishment of the Bureau for Strategy and Development (BSD), provision of
technical assistance, and staff training.
Project Design (Part I, para. 4)
2.          Although  the  project  was  consistent  with  the  Government's
macroeconomic and sectoral adjustment programs, the normal stages of the project
cycle were not followed. Identification and preparation were not conducted. In
addition, the project had too many components which the weak local institutions
could not properly manage, and neither had a proper time horizon nor adequate
provisions for manpower training and skills transfer.
Implementation Experience (Part I, para. 5)
3.          The  project  became  effective  on  schedule.    However,  overall
implementation was unsatisfactory and was adversely affected by the inability of
the Government to make timely budget contributions, the tendency of the Ministry
of Rural Development to misuse project funds and assets, the general lack of
collaboration from the departments of the Ministry of Rural Development, and a
poor selection, and unsatisfactory performance of consultants.
Project Results (Part I, para. 6)
4.          Project  results  were  disappointing  given  that  no  significant
institutional building took place and no specific studies, policy or planning
documents were produced.  However, this must be viewed within the context in
which the project was undertaken: the country was coming out of three decades
of socialism characterized by widespread economic mismanagement, weak
institutions and low absorptive capacity. Therefore, one could not expect these
shortcomings to be overcome instantly.
Sustainabilitv (Part I, para. 7)
5.          The project is not sustainable because no significant institutional
building took place and the Government does not have the means to continue
supporting technical assistance costs on its own.
IDA Performance (Part I, para. 8)
6.          The performance of IDA was mixed. The project conception and design
process were not properly managed. Staff continuity in supervision was not
ensured and the lack of Government compliance with key covenants was not dealt
with effectively. More importantly, IDA failed or was slow to detect that the
environment in which the BSD operated had changed after project implementation
started and that its role therefore had to be redefined.



iv
Borrower Performance (Part I, para. 9)
7.          The performance of the Borrower was inadequate. It did not meet its
financial obligations and misused project funds and assets.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.          The main findings and lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
(a)   Project processing should follow the normal stages of the project
cycle, especially in the case of Guinea which was emerging from
years of centralized economic management. This particular project
should have been duly identified, prepared and appraised as a
separate entity. Failure to do so prevented a systematic, useful,
and comprehensive discussion of important issues within IDA, within
the Government, and between the two.
(b)   One issue that could and should have been discussed is whether IDA
has a comparative advantage in the provision of technical assistance
on a credit basis vis-a-vis the grant financing that can be provided
by bilateral donors and UNDP.
(c)   In a situation where institutions are weak, project design should be
kept simple and the number of components limited.
(d)   Institutional building components should have clear objectives in
terms of transferring skills, training programs, performance
yardsticks for consultants and transfer of responsibilities.   In
addition, too much emphasis was placed on overseas training, with no
tangible benefits.
(e)   The expected budgetary contributions from the Government should be
put at a realistic level that is consistent with its resource
availability as ascertained by IDA at the macro-economic and not the
sectoral level. Failure to do so often results in the project not
receiving timely counterpart funding.
(f)   Soon after BSD was created, many of the functions it was supposed to
carry out were performed either by newly launched projects or by
newly staffed departmental services of the agricultural ministry.
The raison d'etre of BSD thus became questionable, and IDA failed to
react promptly in taking corrective measures, such as closing the
project early (which was eventually done) and refocusing project
objectives.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Proiect Identity
Project Name             First Agricultural Services Project
Credit Number            1636-GUI
RVP Unit                 Africa Regional Office
Country                  Republic of Guinea
Sector                   Agriculture
2.    Background
2.01.       In 1985, Guinea had a population of about 5.8 million inhabitants.
Per capita income was about US$300, among the lowest in the developing countries,
life expectancy was only 44 years and infant mortality about 17 percent. About
90 percent of the population had no access to safe water and 80 percent of the
adult population was illiterate.
2.02.       Despite its agricultural, mineral and energy resources which make it
one of the best endowed countries in Africa, Guinea experienced declining
economic performance from independence in 1958 to the early 1980's. A major
reason was the displacement of the private sector by a pervasive network of state
enterprises in all sectors as the Government increasingly followed a centrally-
planned model of economic management. These public institutions proved to be
ineffectual and investments made outside the mining enclave unproductive.
2.03.       In the human and institutional areas, repressive policies sapped
Guinea of its intellectuals and its best entrepreneurs who emigrated in vast
numbers. The legal system was in shambles as arbitrary authority was substituted
for due process. At the central government level, particularly in the technical
ministries, the capacity to plan, undertake studies, develop strategy, implement
and monitor programs and projects was very weak. In addition to the weak human
resource base, there was an acute scarcity of adequate housing facilities, office
space, office equipment, basic supplies and reference materials, all of which had
a detrimental effect on working conditions.
2.04.       Though not yet committed to meaningful economic structural reforms,
the Government recognized in the early 1980's that such a process would require
a strengthening of its capacity for economic management. In 1981, it formally
requested IDA financing for a technical assistance project intended to strengthen
the Ministries of Planning and Statistics, State Control and the Central Bank of
Guinea.
2.05.       The change in Government following the death of President Sekou Toure
in March 1984 resulted in a radical shift in economic orientation as the new
Government was committed to liberalizing the economy and therefore to more far
reaching economic and institutional reforms.
2.06.       The First Agricultural Services Project was conceived and developed
in a way consistent with the decision of the new authorities to undertake a
complete overhaul of the relevant economic management institutions as evidenced
by its chief objective to assist the Government to improve the planning and
management of the rural development sector.



2
3.    Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.01.       Project Obiectives.  The objective of the project was to improve the
capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) in rural sector planning,
strategy and policy formulation and project analysis, through the establishment
of the Bureau for Strategy and Development (BSD), provision of technical
assistance and staff training.
3.02.       Project Description.   The project had ten main components:  (i)
establishment of BSD, the project implementation unit; (ii) strategy and policy
planning and development; (iii) project identification and preparation; (iv)
project monitoring and evaluation; (v) statistics and data collection; (vi)
agricultural research and small-scale irrigation strategy; (vii) logistical
support for new projects; (viii) consultants and studies; (ix) training; and (x)
house and office construction.
3.03.       BSD, an appropriately staffed and equipped core unit, was to serve
as the main advisory body of the MDR. Its five divisions, one administrative and
financial and four technical, were to implement or coordinate the implementation
of the project.
3.04.       The Strategv and Policy Planning and Development component was the
responsibility of the Planning Division of BSD. Its purpose was to define an
agricultural sector strategy and propose policies affecting, inter alia, prices,
marketing, food and export crop production, input distribution, small scale
irrigation, livestock and forestry development and coordinate the preparation and
revision of the agricultural part of the three-year investment program.
3.05.       The Project Identification and Preparation component was under BSD's
Prolects Division with responsibility for economic and financial analysis of
projects for the rolling investment program (para. 3.04), sector investment
program, preparation of summary analysis of all rural development projects as
appropriate, and annual updating of these projects for the three-year rolling
investment program.
3.06.       The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) component, implemented by BSD's
Monitoring and Evaluation Division, was to assist in the establishment of M&E
units within projects, help train the staff of such units, assist the units to
prepare their annual work programs and supervise the execution of such work
programs. This division was also to prepare project completion reports including
an analysis of the impact of the projects on the economy and the concerned sector
or subsector.
3.07.       The Statistics and Data Collection component, run by the Statistics
Division within BSD, was initially intended to define a work program based on
identified data needs and to begin sample surveys within an agreed time frame.
3.08.       The Agricultural  Research  and Small  Scale  Irrigation  Strategy
component was to be implemented by MDR's Research and Rural Engineering
Departments with assistance from the project in the form of provision of an
expatriate researcher and an expatriate rural engineer. The objective was to
help develop long-term strategies and plans for research and small scale
irrigation development.
3.09.       The Logistical Support for New Projects component was to be the
responsibility of BSD's Monitoring and Evaluation Division. The support was to
be in the form of assistance for M&E and missions by various BSD's technical
divisions to on-going projects.
3.10.       The Consultants and Studies component provided for a total of 105
staff-months of consultant time, of which 20 staff-months to prepare a master
plan for the agro-industrial sector, and 30 staff-months for specialist



3
consultants in training (para. 3.11), sociology, fisheries, forestry, irrigation
and other areas.
3.11.       The Training component provided for a full-time trainer for the MDR
and a training consultant who would visit the project each year to prepare and
help implement a program of technical and professional training linked directly
to the work program. All resident specialists were also to participate actively
in the training programs, and to prepare Guinean staff to take over from them
when they leave.
3.12.       The House and Office Construction component was meant to help
alleviate the acute shortage of office and housing facilities in Guinea (para.
2.03).
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01.       Proiect Design. The project was an emanation of IDA's involvement in
technical assistance to MDR through the ONADER component of the Rice Development
project (Cr. 952-GUI, FY80). The preparation report of the second phase of that
project provided for a project (Gueckedou Agricultural Development Project, Cr.
1635-GUI, FY86) with three main components: (i) an expanded rice development
scheme to include other food crops; (ii) an expanded research component; and
(iii) more institutional strengthening. After the death of President Sekou Tour6
during appraisal, and given the subsequent radical change in economic orientation
of the new Government  (para.  2.05),  it was decided to turn the technical
assistance component of the Gueckedou Agricultural Development project into a
free-standing technical assistance project.
4.02.       The project concept was consistent with the economic reform program
then being prepared, to be later financed under a structural adjustment credit
(SAC, Cr. 16590-GUI, FY86). More importantly, it mirrored, although at a more
limited sector level, the Technical Assistance Project for Economic Management
(TAPEM, Cr. 1559-GUI) approved on March 21, 1985. The principal objective of
TAPEM was to improve the quality of the Government's economic management through
a three-year, first-phase program of technical assistance and staff training.
The project had five main components: macroeconomic planning, investment
analysis, preparation of economic data, control of public expenditures and
revenues, and training.
4.03.       The project design was therefore a coherent part of the macroeconomic
and sectoral adjustment programs being undertaken by the Government and the donor
community.   It was an important part of the Government's agricultural sector
strategy whose main objectives at the time were to (i) seek to increase
smallholders' productivity; (ii) develop satisfactory incentives for farmers;
(iii) enhance the Government's capabilities for policy formulation, investment
planning, project identification and preparation; (iv) improve overall
organization of rural development services; and (v) help create effective and
efficient field level support services (extension, research, data collection,
monitoring and evaluation, credit and input supply). Finally, the decision to
focus on one key agency was appropriate given the weak manpower base. The broad
conceptual orientation of the project reflected the constraints and opportunities
in the country.
4.04.       The project as conceived however had a number of shortcomings. First,
it did not follow the normal stages of the project cycle: it was not identified
or prepared as a stand-alone TA project.   From a component of the Gueckedou
project (para. 4.01), its scope grew considerably wider to cover the rural sector
as a whole, not just rice. Further, it wao appraised on short notice without
proper review within IDA. Failure to go through the normal initial stages of the
project cycle such as identification and preparation did not allow for an in-
depth discussion of issues within the Government, within IDA, and between the
Government and IDA. Issues that seem not to have been thoroughly investigated
include detailed training duties for the experts, measures to insure that



4
training actually takes place and that progress can be monitored and measured,
procedures for monitoring the consultants's overall performance, and the
relationship between the project and the central Government services that are
traditionally responsible for many of the functions that were now assigned to the
project, taking into account their relative strengths and weaknesses. Finally,
the important issue of whether technical assistance should be financed by credit,
therefore at a considerable cost to the Government, or by grant financing as
provided by bilateral donors or UNDP was not discussed.
4.05.       Second, the project had too many components (para. 3.02) considering
the weakness of the rural development sector institutions and the lack of
experience of the civil service with, and their reported ambivalence to, the
concept of technical assistance, at least on the scale proposed.
4.06.       Third, the project as adopted failed to incorporate a proper time
horizon. Institutional building, especially in the case of Guinea after long
years of mismanagement under a centrally-planned economy, is a long-term
undertaking that requires a long-term perspective or a phased approach to take
account of the time needed to achieve meaningful reforms in public sector
management.   The Technical Assistance Project for Economic Management (para.
4.02), by introducing the notion of a multi-phased approach, had such a time
perspective.
4.07.       Fourth and finally, given the baseline situation of a weak manpower
resource base, poor data availability and almost total lack of familiarity with
economic reform management that prevailed in Guinea, the introduction of a
radically new approach to economic management required putting perhaps a bit more
emphasis on (i) establishing ground rules with the Government on the methodology
to process, supervise and manage technical assistance by both IDA and the
Government; (ii) clearly defining the consultants' role in establishing or
enhancing the delivery of technical assistance and training; and (iii) defining
pragmatically the broader goal of reducing the dependence of the Government on
external technical assistance. The project could not achieve this.
4.08.       Prolect Organization.   Project organization was simple and well
suited to the situation. Interagency coordination requirements were kept to a
minimum, consistent with the weakness of local institutions. However, while
entrusting the project implementation unit (BSD) with the chief responsibility
of sector planning, project identification and preparation, project supervision
and practically the management of the whole sector, it singularly failed to
define the nature and context of BSD's relationship with the Technical
Departments of the then newly created Ministry of Rural Development and to
indicate how this relationship would evolve over time.
4.09.       It is only mentioned in passing that " ... the Planning Division
within BSD would be responsible for this activity (developing a strategy for the
sector, defining policies, elaborating an investment plan) and would coordinate
with other BSD Divisions and the Technical Departments of MDR in developing the
strategy" (para. 39 of the November 4, 1985 President's Report No. P-0415-). The
only other mention of existing services is in paragraph 49 of the same report
which says: " ...The organizational structure of BSD would take account of the
new ministerial structure and would include staff from the various sub-sectors
to cover all aspects of rural development".
4.10.       The inadequate treatment of this key organizational issue may have
been due to the lack of a normal project initiation procedure (para. 1.22). As
the project was implemented, staff of the Technical Departments came to resent
what they considered as BSD's encroachment on their prerogatives and refused to
collaborate, making the rational management of the sector difficult.
4.11.       Finally, the project was effectively put under the direct authority
of the Minister of Rural Development. This made it more vulnerable to political
pressure and manipulation. Although this organizational arrangement may have



5
appeared appropriate at the time, other formulas that had been used with more
success elsewhere should have been tried. They include the use of a permanent
secretary-type position to coordinate project activities of the creation of a
supervisory body at the level of the office of the president.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01.       Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start-uD. The project was appraised
in October 1984, negotiated on August 1st 1985, approved by the Board and signed
on November 26 and December 27 respectively of the same year. Finally, the
project became effective on July 31, 1986. All these events were broadly on
schedule. The project was closed on the originally planned date of June 30, 1992.
5.02.       Management of Prolect ComDonents. The organizational aspects of the
project were dealt with immediately: BSD was created even before the project
became effective and land allocated to it as agreed. Technical assistance
personnel were selected without much delay through a consulting firm that served
as an umbrella. However, the actual arrival of the technical assistance team in
the field occurred six months after the project was declared effective. The
recruitment of local staff was also done through a different consulting firm
using tests that made staff selection as objective as possible. Office and
housing construction was completed as planned.
5.03.       Overall, however, project implementation was adversely affected by
weak technical assistance, the inability of the Government to make timely budget
contributions as required and by the repeated use of BSD by the Minister to
provide logistical support in an attempt to meet general shortcomings within the
Ministry and at times the Government. Later on, the lack of collaboration of the
Ministry's Technical Departments hindered BSD's work. BSD's management was weak.
Both the Government and the donors (including the World Bank) recognized this
fact and eventually bypassed it.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01.       Project results have not been satisfactory.  One of the key tools for
the planning, implementation and control of project activities, the elaboration
of annual work plans, was not used. The inadequate project performance can be
seen through the review of individual components.
6.02.       The major objective of improving the capacity of MDR in rural sector
planning, strategy and policy formulation and project analysis through the
establishment of BSD does not seem to have been achieved. Financing for BSD was
stopped on September 30 1989, two years and 11 months after project effectiveness
and two years and nine months before the closing date because BSD was found by
both the Government and IDA to be ineffective.
6.03.       Strategy and Policy Planning and Development.  No sector strategic
initiative or specific policy affecting, inter alia, prices, marketing, food and
export crop production, input distribution, livestock and forestry development
seem to have been produced as a result of the project. Further, BSD does not seem
to have provided any impetus in the preparation of a three-year agricultural
investment program as envisaged at appraisal.
6.04.       Prolect Identification and PreDaration.  BSD does not seem to have
identified or prepared any project.  The few studies that BSD claims to have
realized are, on closer analysis, a recycling of existing information or studies.
Donors continued to identify and prepare their own projects, although they
occasionally associated with some BSD staff.
6.05.       Monitorina and Evaluation.  BSD did establish summary data sheets on
about 90 projects and helped organize a national seminar on monitoring and
evaluation. It is not clear, however, that BSD helped establish Monitoring and
Evaluation units within projects, assist these units to prepare annual work
programs and supervise the execution of these programs.



6
6.06.       Statistics and Data Collection. No visible results were achieved for
this component, the funding for which was transferred to a different project
called Permanent Agricultural Statistics Service (PASS) which is jointly financed
by FAO. The PASS is being successfully run with effective assistance from an FAO
consultant.
6.07.       Agricultural  Research  and  Small  Scale  Irrigation.    These  two
activities, not managed by BSD, were financed by French bi-lateral funds and were
under the responsibility of the relevant departments within MDR.   They have
achieved positive results: the Government's policy on research and small scale
irrigation is taking shape and a number of project ideas are being generated. One
small scale irrigation project has been identified and is being processed.
6.08.       Logistical Support for New Projects.  Little specific assistance was
provided to projects under this component.
6.09.       Consultants.  The selection of consultants was not rigorous.  In fact
IDA had expressed reservations on their qualifications and selection process.
At the insistence of the Government, IDA had to compromise its position to avoid
further delay in the effective start of the project. After the project started,
IDA's concerns over the qualifications of the consultants materialized and these
concerns were brought to the attention of the Government in due course to take
corrective measures. The technical assistance experts for agricultural planning,
project preparation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) did not fulfill their
expected attributions. The Financial Controller failed to produce accounts in
a timely manner to facilitate planned project audits --even then, these accounts
were sometimes not sufficiently documented. The M&E specialist felt the need
for, and was authorized to attend prior training in project monitoring and
evaluation procedures (in Benin and Togo); nevertheless, he failed to develop a
business plan for the M&E unit. As a result, all technical assistance contracts
were terminated by October 1989.
6.10.       Studies.  No studies were undertaken that could be attributed to the
project.   The agricultural sector strategy document  (LPDA) was essentially
conceived outside of BSD, although it contributed to its elaboration, like other
services of the Ministry of Agriculture.
6.11.       House and Office Construction.  An office building was erected and
staff houses built as planned. The office structure has become the home of the
Ministry of Agriculture.
6.12.       Pro-ect Impact.  Except for the office building and staff houses, the
project has had a very limited impact, if any, on the agricultural sector and on
institutional building.
6.13.       The major reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of the project
are:
(i)   The weakness  of  the technical  assistance  team.  The personnel
provided were not those proposed in the bid documents and proved to
be incompetent for the most part. This was further complicated by
their late arrival, high turnover, and the problems of availability
of basic amenities in Guinea.
(ii)  Basic flaws in the conception, design and processing  ofthe project
as explained earlier (para. 4.04-4.11).
(iii) The strong and repeated interferences of the Minister of Agriculture
with BSD. The project was the only unit of the Ministry with funds
and equipment.   The project's vehicles and funds were frequently
used outside objectives and the scope of the project.
(iv)  The shortcomings of the project manager were compounded by point
(iii) above.



7
(v)   Failure by IDA and the Government to recognize in time that the
institutional environment in the Ministry of Agriculture had changed
and that, consequently, BSD's mission as originally conceived had to
be redefined. After the ministry's services were staffed, the main
weakness remaining was in the area of planning and policy
definition. It would have been advisable to transfer BSD's other
responsibilities to the operating departments and to keep only those
two.
7.    Prolect Sustainability
7.01.       The project,  as conceived and implemented, was not sustainable.
First, the Government does not have the financial means to support the costs
associated with the program that the project was meant to implement. Second,
training of local staff was not properly done and it is not clear whether they
could carry on the work load of the project. Finally, even the modest amount of
manpower capacity building that took place had been transferred out of the
project unit. In conclusion, the project's impact on institutional development
has been negligible.
8.    IDA's Performance
8.01.       IDA's performance has been mixed. First, as mentioned earlier (para.
4.04), the project cycle was not properly managed which may have prevented an in-
depth investigation of important issues.   Second, although the project was
regularly supervised, there was, at times, no continuity in the staffing of the
supervision missions. This created some confusion for the project unit resulting
in a lack of follow-up on the issues and problems raised. Third, the supervision
missions were slow to react to the lack of performance of the technical
assistance team and the undue interference of Government officials, namely the
Minister of Agriculture (para. 6.13). Fourth, IDA was not forceful enough in
emphasizing compliance with the financial and accounting management as well as
the audit requirements. Finally, IDA was slow to realize that the Ministry of
Agriculture had evolved with the staffing of most its services and that BSD's
mission had to be redefined in light of the new developments.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.01.       The Borrower's performance has been disappointing and inadequate.
The project manager was weak and ineffectual. The Minister interfered constantly
with project's matters by misusing its funds and using its assets, mainly
vehicles, for non-project related activities. Finally, the Government failed to
make timely budget contributions and this had a negative effect on project
implementation.
10.   Pro-ect Relationship
10.01.      The relationship between IDA and the Borrower was often strained
because of the latter's lack of compliance with key project dispositions such as
proper financial management.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01.      The performance of the consultants was unsatisfactory.
The main reasons for this were (i) the lack of proper background of the
consultants who were used. The initial consultants identified in the proposals
were not the same as those sent to the project (para. 6.13 (i)); (ii) the high
turnover of the consultants who were posted to the project; and (iii) the
difficult living conditions prevailing in the country that forced consultants to
initially spend a large part of their time on logistical matters.
12.   Prolect Documentation
12.01.             All project documents (legal agreement, staff appraisal report)



8
were comprehensive and provided a useful framework for IDA and the Borrower
during project implementation. They also provided sufficient flexibility to
project management to allow them to adapt to changing conditions.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUINEA
FIRST AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(CREDIT 1636-GUI}
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.          The need to strengthen capacities in the areas of project and policy
analysis and formulation at the ministerial department responsible for
agriculture became evident soon after the change of regime that took place in
Guinea in 1984. At the request of the Guinean Government, IDA agreed to finance
a project providing institutional support for the then Ministry of Rural
Development (MDR), within the framework of the First Agricultural Services
Program.   The project financed the creation of a Bureau for Strategy and
Development (Bureau de Strat6gie et D6veloppement - BSD].
2.          In their desire to expedite the reinforcement of MDR's capacities,
both parties lost no time in completing the project design, preparation and
negotiation phases, evidencing a disregard for IDA's normal project cycle. The
result of this haste was that several phases were skipped, with the consequent
impairment of the quality of the project documents.   This factor alone was
obviously going to create problems during implementation.
3.          The BSD was created at a time when ministries were seeking and
undergoing a new experience in a sociopolitical environment totally different
from the one they had known for the past 26 years under the preceding regime.
4.          The project did not pay sufficient attention to this aspect, which
in reality demanded a more considered approach, with a view to gradually bringing
about the necessary changes in institutions and attitudes. Unfortunately, the
project was over-ambitious, setting a multitude of objectives to be achieved
through a multitude of components. In addition, the project's financing package
provided for a large contribution of counterpart funds without first having
sufficiently analyzed the Government's capability to make local resources
available.
S.          Despite these weaknesses, and despite the rather average quality of
the technical assistance received by the BSD, certain components did result in
interesting outcomes.
6.          At the institutional level, while not all expectations were realized,
the BSD helped to provide the department with a team of competent local officials
selected on the basis of tests, which proved right from the start to be a well-
matched group. With their experience and varied backgrounds of training, the
team members provided, and are still providing, technical and methodological
support for the various MARA agencies. In particular, DNGR and IRAG were created
with BSD support.
7.          BSD today serves as the ministry's memory and technical secretariat.
Its excellent contribution to the National Agricultural Census through the
Agricultural Statistics Division paved the way for the implementation of the
project's institution of a Permanent Agricultural Statistics Service (PASS),
which has already achieved a commendable level of performance.
8.          The LPDA, despite having been drafted concurrently with certain BSD
activities, is one of the Bureau's best contributions to MARA. This statement
is justified by the fact that it is based on experience acquired at the BSD and
was prepared mainly by BSD staff.
9.          In the area of training, the project had emphasized on-the-job
training, to be supplemented by additional, essentially short-term training



10
assignments overseas. Some initial progress was made with the training program
prepared in 1988, which then came to an end in September 1989.
10.         Professionals  from all  divisions  received  training  in various
disciplines both in Guinea and overseas.  The following are the various training
programs concerned:

The project may take credit for having executed the construction
component as provided in the agreement. The offices now house the ministry.
A start was made on the computerization program with the training of
an initial group of professionals (see preceding table) and the provision (in
1988) of PCs for the following divisions:
No. of PCs
Administrative Division                   2
Agricultural Statistics Division          3

Studies and Project Analysis Division   1
Vehicles and other items of equipment for the BSD were procured at



11
different stages of the project, with a total of 14 vehicles, 3 photocopying
machines, and miscellaneous items of equipment purchased.
11.         These items of equipment, particularly the vehicles, enabled BSD
staff to make field trips in connection with the different studies and project
monitoring and evaluation activities. They were also used now and then for other
operations of the ministry. This is explained by the fact that MDR was suffering
at the time from a general shortage of equipment, the BSD being the only unit
receiving any appreciable financing and possessing equipment suitable for field
trips.
12.         This feature actually represented one of the weaknesses of the BSD,
a de facto pocket of prosperity in an environment of deprivation that could
hardly be ignored.
13.         BSD started operations somewhat behind schedule.   The technical
assistance was not put in place until the last quarter of 1986, and the local
staff were not recruited until January 1987, project effectiveness having
originally been scheduled for early 1986.
14.         This delay made it impossible to carry out certain activities on
time, such as the selection of criteria for new projects to be supported by the
BSD (which should have taken place by June 1986) and the review with IDA of the
agricultural services restructuring program to have been designed by the BSD by
September 1986.
15.         BSD's status as de facto provider of day-to-day technical secretariat
services for the ministry meant that its staff were not always able to keep their
ideas or discussions focused on the aspects of project design, analysis, and
orientation that should have constantly commanded their attention.
16.         At the project  implementation  stage,  certain difficulties  and
weaknesses were encountered, some of the reasons for which are given above.
17.         The Guinean authorities recognize these, and we have learned lessons
from them that will enable us to improve our performance in terms of future
project preparation and implementation.
18.         With respect to IDA's performance,  in addition to the problems
mentioned above in the areas of project design and preparation, the matter of
supervision of the BSD should also be mentioned.
19.         IDA maintained a regular program of supervision.   However, the
frequent changes in supervision teams during the course of the project led to a
lack of continuity and made it difficult to act for the various recommendations
to be implemented. This was obviously not conducive to the production of regular
overall assessments of the project's achievements and weak points.

amounts in SDR (SDR 7,600,000 and 5,561,761.83) and the corresponding
amounts in US Dollars (US$7,500,000 and 7,202,216.85) is due to the
depreciation of the dollar with respect of the SDR over the disbursement
period.
