The project\n            did not achieve its objectives, institutional development\n            was negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, project processing should follow the normal\n            stages of the project cycle. Second, one issue that could\n            and should have been discussed is whether IDA has a\n            comparative advantage in the provision of technical\n            assistance on a credit basis vis-\ufffdvis the grant financing\n            that can be provided by bilateral donors and UNDP. Third, in\n            a situation where institutions are weak, project design\n            should be kept simple and the number of components limited.\n            Fourth, institutional building components should have clear\n            objectives in terms of transferring skills, training\n            programs, performance yardsticks for consultants, and\n            transfer of responsibilities. Finally, the expected\n            budgetary contributions from the Government should be put at\n            a realistic level that is consistent with its resource\n            availability as ascertained by IDA at the macroeconomic and\n            not the sectoral level."}, "docdt": "1994-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
