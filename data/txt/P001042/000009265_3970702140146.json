    will improve capabilities of the Ministry of Rural\n            Development (MRD) in agricultural planning, strategy and\n            policy formulation and project analysis. This objective will\n            be achieved through the establishment of a Strategy and\n            Development Office (Bureau de Strategie et de Developpement,\n            BSD) in MDR, to be staffed with qualified Guinean and\n            internationally recruited personnel. BSD will focus on: (a)\n            the definition of agricultural strategy and policy; (b)\n            elaboration and review of investment plans; (c) monitoring\n            and evaluation of projects and plan objectives; (d) project\n            identification, preparation and analysis; and (e) data\n            collection and analysis. In addition, during the project\n            period when other ministerial services are being reorganized\n            and strengthened, BSD will be responsible for providing\n            logistical and institutional support for start-up activities\n            of new rural development projects and elaborating a long\n            term plan for agricultural research and irrigation\n            development in the country."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
