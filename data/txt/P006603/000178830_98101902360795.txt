SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Chile
Amount:                US$36.0 million
Terms:                Repayment in 15 years, including three years of
grace, at 9.25 percent interest per annum.
Relending Terms:      The Central Bank, acting on the Borrower's behalf,
would rediscount 100 percent of loans made by
participating financial institutions to small farmers
at interest rates of not more than 10.5 percent and
70 percent of other loans at interest rates not more
than 12.5 percent. Interest rates on subloans to
small farmers would not exceed 14 percent; for other
beneficiaries rates would not exceed 16 percent on
the portion (70 percent) which would be rediscounted
by the Central Bank. The interest rate charged by
financial intermediaries to small farmers would be
two percentage points below that charged to other
beneficiaries. Interest charges on all lending under
the project would be computed on outstanding principal
balances adjusted according to the Chilean consumer
price index. Repayment terms for subloans to bene-
ficiaries would be up to 12 years, including grace
periods of up to 4 years.
Prolect Description:  The project's main objectives would be to increase
agricultural output, including production of several
export crops for which Chile enjoys a comparative
advantage, and to help small farmers--mainly benefi-
ciaries of the land reform and "minifundistas"--to
increase their earnings, improve their living conditions
and develop into commercially viable farmers. It would
finance on-farm investment, incremental production
inputs and technical assistance for: (i) approximately
2,570 small farmers who--either individually or as
members of cooperatives--own 12 basic ha of land or
less. A minimum of one third of the project's lending
program would be earmarked for their use; (ii) about 750
medium-sized farmers and ranchers; and (iii) an estimated
90 agroindustrial enterprises. The project faces no
special risks.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$36.0 million to help
finance a second agricultural credit project. The loan would have a term
of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 9.25 percent per
annum. The Central Bank, acting on the Borrower's behalf, would relend the
loan's proceeds in Chilean pesos to participating financial intermediaries at
interest rates, indexed to compensate for inflation, of up to 10.5 percent p.a.
on subloans to small farmers and up to 12.5 percent p.a. on subloans to other
beneficiaries. Central Bank onlending would have terms of up to 12 years,
including up to four years of grace, depending upon the type of investment to
be financed by subloans to ultimate beneficiaries.
PART I - THE ECONOMY _/
2.        A basic economic report (2390-CH) entitled "Chile:  An Economy in
Transition" was issued on June 21, 1979. The following paragraphs are based
on the conclusions contained in this report, on the findings of a brief mission
sent to Santiago in January 1980 and on the preliminary conclusions of a more
comprehensive mission which visited Chile from mid-July through early August
1980 to review the economic situation and prospects. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I.
Evolution of the Economy
3.         In the four decades following the Great Depression, successive
Governments sought to reduce Chile's vulnerability to world market fluctuations,
accelerate economic development and achieve a more equitable distribution of
income. Following a policy of import-substitution, Governments increasingly
intervened in the determination of prices, erected high protective barriers
against foreign competition, offered special tax and other incentives to
investment and entered directly into production and distribution activities
while intervening in the allocation of credit and foreign exchange. Unfor-
tunately the results were not consistent with expectations. The economy often
experienced periods of slow growth, rapid inflation and balance of payments
problems. Chile's foreign debt burden grew, its agricultural and industrial
sectors became inefficient -and its dependence on copper continued.
1/   This section is an updated version of the section on the economy in the
President's Report for the Water Supply Project (No. P-2749-CH), dated
March 26, 1980.



-2-
4.        Despite the overall trend described above, periodic efforts were
made to reform the tax system, dampen inflation, simplify public administration
and otherwise improve the allocation of resources. However, when the present
Government took power in September 1973, inflation was the highest in the
hemisphere, real wages were one-half to one-third below 1969 levels, and net
international reserves were negative by US$230 million. Chile's foreign debt
payments were in arrears, aggregate production had been declining since 1971,
the overall deficit of the Central Government alone exceeded 20 percent of GDP,
the money supply was out of control, the financial system in shambles, and the
exchange rate grossly overvalued.
5.        Since then the Chilean economy has undergone a major transformation.
The Central Government's budget deficit has been eliminated. Virtually all
prices, including interest rates, have been progressively freed; most tax and
subsidy distortions to relative prices have been removed; tariff and non-
tariff import barriers have been virtually eliminated; and the exchange rate was
massively devalued in 1973 and thereafter was periodically adjusted until June
1979. Exchange controls were largely eliminated and foreign investment encouraged.
In addition, major reforms have been introduced in the tax structure, public
sector budgetary process and banking legislation; and most of the enterprises
taken over by the previous government have been returned to the private sector.
Many of these structural reforms were consistent with advice long offered Chile
by the Bank and other international institutions.
6.        The transformation, which amounts to a total restructuring of the
economy, was complicated by difficult short-term conditions. In 1975 real
copper earnings fell 50 percent as world prices dropped to their lowest
real level in two decades. The resource loss to the economy of the copper
price drop was equivalent to about 10 percent of the 1974 GDP. Additional
resources, equivalent to 2.5 percent of GDP, were withdrawn from the economy
in the form of net capital outflows and interest payments to foreign lenders.
Because of the severe foreign exchange crisis and continuing high levels of
inflation, the Government introduced a drastic austerity program in April 1975
and the Chilean economy experienced its worst depression since the 1930s.
Real GDP in 1975 fell more than 11 percent and open unemployment reached
20 percent of the labor force of Greater Santiago. The depression bottomed
out during the first quarter of 1976 and Chile, with its first current account
surplus in twenty years, was able not only to repay its creditors but also to
increase reserves substantially. By 1977, GDP in real terms had returned to
1971-72 levels.
7.        In many respects the economy has responded well to the reforms.
Real economic growth in 1977-1979 was double the 1940-1970 average. The
rate of inflation was brought down from 400 percent in 1973 to 30-40 percent
in recent years. The balance of payments position of Chile has improved
markedly. The value of agricultural and manufactured exports grew more
than sevenfold between 1973 and 1978. By the end of 1979, net international
reserves were just over US$1.5 billion, representing about three months of
imports. By 1978 real wages and salaries had recovered to their 1970 levels
and then rose rapidly as worker productivity increased. This economic turn-
around was accomplished notwithstanding relatively low real copper prices



- 3 -
until mid-1979 and a heavy debt service burden. Despite this progress, the
unemployment rate has remained high and investment has been slow to respond
to the increase in economic activity partly because of high real interest rates.
8.        The hardships caused by the 1975-76 depression were borne by most
Chileans. Lack of data, the complexity of past controls, and the massive
changes in price levels and relative prices make it difficult to reach any
firm conclusions on the impact that these fundamental policy changes have had
on the overall distribution of income in Chile. In any event, it would be
hard to overstate the enormous material sacrifice endured, particularly by
the unemployed.
Population, Unemployment and Social Programs
9.        Chile's population has been growing at about 1.7 percent a year
since 1970, a rate which is considerably below the average for Latin America
and for countries with comparable per capita incomes.
10.       In recent years the average annual unemployment rate for Greater
Santiago has remained between 12 and 14 percent since dropping from 20 percent
during the 1975/76 depression. In June 1980, in spite of rapid job generation
the unemployment rate stood at 11.7 percent. The continued high unemployment
rate reflects a combination of factors including the growth of the potential
workforce, the return of labor force participation rates to more traditional
levels and frictional unemployment caused by rapid structural changes. The
Government has responded to increased unemployment with a series of measures:
an emergency employment program which employed 7 percent of the work force
during the depths of the depression, a program of wage subsidies, reform
of unemployment insurance, and an expanded manpower and training program.
Members of Chile's economic team believe that continued high levels of economic
growth and reduction in the high social security contributions by employers
will bring the unemployment rate down to historical levels (about 6 percent)
within a few more years. The reduced social security contributions have been
offset by increased transfers from the budget, allowing social security
benefits to remain unchanged.
11.       The Government has also undertaken significant changes in Chile's
public social programs. The present Administration views its role as that of
assuring equal opportunity through access to education and health services.
Its strategy is to expand employment and real wages through policies designed
to promote accelerated economic growth. Some past income distribution policies
and programs in Chile such as price controls, public housing, cheap credit,
direct subsidies, tax exemptions and broadly-based social expenditure programs
were often of equal benefit to the urban middle class as they were to the
truly poor. The current Government has tried to make its social programs more
cost effective by more carefully channeling its efforts towards the poorest 20
percent of the population.
12.       Some of the Government's approaches have been innovative.  The new
treatment and rehabilitation centers for severely undernourished children and
the preschool nursery program for the poor are examples of promising new
approaches in nutrition which are gaining worldwide recognition. Fortified



-4-
and protein enriched milk distribution to infants, preschool children and
pregnant and nursing mothers has increased from 21,500 tons in 1973 to 28,700
tons in 1979. Nursery schools integrating nutrition, medical care, and educa-
tion for the most disadvantaged preschool children, begun in 1973, grew to
over 400 schools by end-1979 and served over 47,000 children. Partly as a
result of these programs, the infant mortality rate has fallen from 82 deaths
per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 61 in 1975. The infant mortality rate has
continued to drop in recent years.
13.       Attaining the Government's social sector goals has been made more
difficult by the 1975/76 austerity program and the Government's determination
to reduce the overall size of the public sector. Since 1977 the percent of
total Central Government expenditures devoted to social programs has equaled
or exceeded the high levels recorded during the early 1970s. However, in real
terms these expenditures did not reach the heights of 1972 until 1979. While
the Government's efforts in the social sectors are encouraging, more needs
to be done. The Administration is aware of this and has budgeted a further
real increase of 14 percent in social expenditures for 1980. Moreover, Chile
set up a President's Social Council in late 1979 to coordinate social programs
and their financing in the future.
Economic Developments in 1979
14.       Strong growth in the agricultural, industrial and construction
sectors resulted in an estimated real GDP growth rate of about 8.5 percent
in 1979. This compares favorably with the 7.8 percent recorded in 1978 and
represents the third consecutive year of economic growth well in excess of
historical levels. During 1979 the Government continued to reduce the size of
the public sector and again achieved an overall Central Government surplus.
The surplus, stemming from higher copper revenues and restraint on Government
expenditures, was equivalent to about 5 percent of GDP compared to 2 percent
in 1978. Although the unemployment rate remained high, real wages and salaries
continued to grow at a healthy pace.
15.       Fuel imports accounted for 20 percent of Chile's total imports in
1979.  At present, two-thirds of Chile's energy requirements are met with oil,
about 70 percent of which is imported. The Government expects that at full
development in the early 1980's, the off-shore fields in the Magellan Straits
will enable Chile to produce about one-third of its petroleum needs. Future
expansion of Chile's energy production is hampered by the fact that its major
new sources of energy -- significant deposits of coal and gas as well as hydro-
electric potential -- are largely concentrated in relatively inaccessable
areas of the extreme South, far from the consuming regions. To coordinate its
energy policy better, the Government established a National Energy Commission
in late 1978.  Energy conservation has been encouraged by a firm policy of
applying international prices to all hydrocarbon products.
16.       Chile had an overall balance of payments surplus of US$1.0 billion
in 1979 despite substantial increases in petroleum imports. Exports grew
56 percent in nominal terms (estimated at 12 percent in real terms) owing to
more favorable world prices and to impressive gains in both traditional and
non-traditional exports. Copper prices increased by 45 percent; this accounted
for most of the increased copper receipts. But copper exports constituted
only about half of total exports of goods in 1979. Industrial exports grew



- 5 -
25 percent in volume and by a similar amount in prices. Despite nearly a
doubling in petroleum import payments, total merchandise imports are estimated
to have grown by only 40 percent in dollar terms, largely because other raw
material and capital goods imports grew modestly. The Central Bank has esti-
mated US$1.9 billion in net foreign capital inflows, much of which represented
borrowings by the Chilean private sector.
17.       There was a resurgence of the inflation rate in 1979 despite anti-
inflationary monetary and fiscal policies. The December-December rate was
39 percent as compared to 30 percent in 1978. International inflation,
especially the high prices paid for petroleum imports, was one of the major
factors contributing to the acceleration in inflation. Despite the acceleration
of inflation, commercial bank lending rates to borrowers on 30-day loans have
continued to decline from a real rate of 63 percent per annum in December 1977
to about 20 percent in the first four months of 1980. Moreover, the scarcity
of longer term financing was easing. Reductions in the real interest rates
result from the growing availability of foreign credits and the Government's
policies to lower reserve requirements. The steady decline in real interest
rates and increased availability of long-term funds are beginning to have a
positive impact on the construction industry, which showed signs of strong
recovery in 1979. This should help reduce unemployment, particularly for
unskilled workers.
18.       The Government's exchange rate policies changed on June 30, 1979
when the previous system of daily devaluations announced in advance by the
Central Bank was replaced by a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per U.S.
dollar. In January 1980 the authorities announced that the exchange rate
would remain fixed at 39 pesos indefinitely. In a small open economy like
Chile, this measure--along with a planned fiscal surplus and continued access
to external capital--is expected to bring the inflation- rate in Chile closer
to world levels. Unless inflation is dampened soon, however, this policy
would adversely affect export growth or cause economic deflation. The Govern-
ment is prepared to reexamine its exchange rate policy, should the economic
situation change.
Prospects
19.       It is anticipated that 1980 will be another year of relatively high
economic growth, probably in the 7.0 percent range. Net medium- and long-term
foreign capital inflows are expected to be higher than in 1979 and reserves
are expected to increase by over US$1 billion. There should be some reduction
in the rate of inflation. Increased construction activity and the continued
growth of export industries will probably reduce the rate of unemployment,
although it is not expected to drop to historical levels in the near future.
Over the longer term Chilean economic prospects also remain favorable despite
substantial petroleum imports and continued dependence on commercial loans to
finance the majority of its external capital requirements. It is anticipated
that Chile will grow at six percent in real terms between 1980 and 1985. The
export sectors, traditional and nontraditional, should lead the way, with
gains from both improved prices and increases in export volumes.
20.       In order to sustain growth rates anticipated at nearly double the
historical average, investment will need to increase very substantially from



- 6 -
its current level of about 10-12 percent of GDP to 18 percent or more. It is
expected that private investment will continue to expand with the growth of
confidence in the economy, particularly if real interest rates continue to
fall. There is a similar need to expand public investment. As part of the
current austerity program and the broader desire to reduce the direct economic
role of the State, public investment spending has been cut back. As a result,
Chile's infrastructure base has deteriorated. The Government will need to act
more aggressively to meet the highest priority needs of the public sector.
Finally, the continued growth of strong oligopolistic interests may ultimately
become incongruent with the Government's present liberal, open trade strategy
and endanger the competitiveness and long-term viability of the Chilean
economic system. Non-subsidized assistance to small enterprises and vigorous
enforcement of antitrust regulations could help avoid this possible problem.
21.       Through prudent economic management Chile was able to cope with
hyperinflation, adverse terms of trade, and large debt service payments
during the last half of the seventies. In spite of rising petroleum imports,
Chile's favorable prospects for growth (particularly of exports) and proven
ability to manage its economy so as to meet debt payments, make it creditworthy.
Nevertheless, Chile will continue to require substantial external resources to
finance its future growth. During the early 1980s its current account deficit
will likely average approximately 4.5 percent of GDP. Much of the foreign
borrowing required to finance this deficit is expected to be by the private
sector; the public external debt service ratio is likely to decline from 34
percent in 1978 and 26 percent in 1979 to 15 percent in 1982 and about 11 per-
cent by 1985. For the above reasons, Chile is creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
22.       Among developing countries, Chile is the Bank's oldest borrower.
The Bank's first development loan was extended to Chile in 1948 and, since
then, the Bank has made 24 loans to Chile totalling US$389.5 million, net of
cancellations. The Association has also extended a US$19 million credit to
the country for a road project. Of these operations, 20 Bank loans and the
credit have been fully disbursed; as of June 30, 1980, overall disburse-
ments stood at US$322.1 million. IFC commitments in Chile came to US$21.2
million with US$15 million of this amount committed to copper mining and the
remainder to industry. The Corporation presently holds US$1.2 million of its
Chilean commitments.
23.       Of total Bank and IDA lending to Chile, 40 percent has been for
power, 17 percent for agriculture, 12 percent for mining and 12 percent for
roads. The balance, 19 percent, has been for industry, education, technical
assistance and water supply.
24.       Historically, the volume of Bank lending to Chile has fluctuated
substantially, varying, inter alia, in accordance with the country's economic
performance and the availability of suitable projects. Between 1971 and 1973,
the Bank did not lend to Chile because of the severe deterioration in economic



-7-
and financial management referred to in Part I. On the basis of negotia-
tions substantially completed with the Allende Government, the Bank cautiously
resumed lending in 1974. Specifically, the amount of two existing loans was
increased by US$8.3 million to finance interest and other charges during
construction under the fifth power and second highway maintenance projects.
In addition, a loan of US$5.25 million was made to help finance a technical
assistance project. In the FY75-77 period, the Bank made four loans totalling
US$107.8 million to help finance projects in the agriculture, copper mining
and power sectors. The Bank did not lend to Chile in FY78-79, but it approved
a US$38 million loan for a water supply project in FY80.
25.       Execution of Bank-financed projects in Chile has, on the whole,
been satisfactory. In the case of the three road and education operations
approved in 1970, however, virtually no headway was made in implementation
during the 1971-73 period owing to the high rate of inflation, deteriorating
conditions in the construction industry and a shortage in counterpart funds.
Beginning in 1974, execution of these projects improved markedly and all
three have now been completed. More recently, the copper sector and sixth
power projects approved in FY76 and FY77, respectively, experienced delays
in start up but these difficulties have been largely overcome. Annex II
contains a summary of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC commitments as of
June 30, 1980, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
26.       In addition to the proposed agricultural credit operation, the
Bank is considering a lending program for Chile which blends a high priority
road rehabilitation project with a number of operations which directly
address the needs of the country's poor. The latter include a second water
supply loan, a small- and medium-scale enterprise credit project, an irriga-
tion scheme and an urban development operation. One of these prospective
projects, the road rehabilitation loan, is expected to be ready for the
Executive Directors' consideration in FY81.
27.       By the end of 1979, Chile's public and publicly guaranteed external
debt, both disbursed and undisbursed, equalled US$5,461 million; the Bank
Group's share was 4.3 percent. The Bank Group's share of the 1979 debt
service was 1.7 percent. The Bank's share of total public external debt is
expected to grow to about 5 percent by 1985 when the Bank's share of the
public external debt service would be about 4 percent, reflecting an expected
slowdown in public sector borrowing from other sources.
28.       In the past, both USAID and the IDB have been active in Chile with
each agency providing the country with considerable development assistance.
The IDB had committed US$597.1 million net of grants to Chile through the end
of 1979 focussing on agriculture, industry, power and transportation. USAID's
Chile operations--including about US$80 million in grants--totaled some US$665
million through 1979. While USAID is winding down its operations in Chile,
the IDB plans to continue lending to the country, blending loans for traditional
infrastructure projects with lending for socially-oriented projects, mainly in
rural areas.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General Characteristics
29.       According to the 1975/76 agricultural census, 15.4 million ha or
approximately 20 percent of Chile's total land area is arable cropland or
pasture. Because the extremes of climate in the northern and southern parts
of the country seriously limit farming, nearly 90 percent of the productive
land is located in the central portion of Chile between the Aconcagua Valley
and Puerto Montt, where temperate conditions predominate. While rainfall in
much of the central region is insufficient, soil quality is generally good and
there are about 1.1 million ha of irrigated land.
30.       Agriculture's share of Chile's GDP declined from 11.2 percent in
1960 to about 7 percent in 1970. In response to improved price policies and
to more settled land tenure conditions after 1973, however, agricultural
production grew considerably and its share of GDP had risen to 9.5 percent in
1979. Nonetheless, the sector's importance as a source of employment has
declined steadily from 31 percent of the labor force in 1960 to about 20 per-
cent in 1976.
31.       Despite good resources and favorable climatic conditions, the growth
in agricultural production between 1965 and 1973 was inferior to the increase
in domestic demand for foodstuffs and other agricultural produce. As a result,
agricultural imports accelerated sharply in the early 1970's, with the agricul-
tural trade deficit (excluding forestry products) reaching a record US$478
million in 1973. In that year agricultural imports represented 36 percent of
total imports and absorbed 40 percent of the country's export earnings. The
reasons for agriculture's poor performance included: (i) an inefficient use
of available resources; (ii) a lack of continuity in agricultural policy;
(iii) controls that depressed farmgate prices; (iv) the disruption of the
economy in general in the early 1970s; and (v) a climate of uncertainty caused
by the lengthy agrarian reform process referred to in paras. 33-35.
32.       The Government's policy since 1973 has been to promote the growth
of agricultural production. Much has been accomplished to date, mainly by
freeing producer and factor prices, eliminating trade barriers, rationalizing
exchange rate policies and stabilizing land tenure in the countryside. This has
contributed to a growth in production and a drastic reduction in the agricultural
trade deficit. By 1979, agricultural trade was virtually in balance and, if the
export of forestry products was included, the agricultural trade surplus
approached US$400 million. The proposed project would support further improve-
ments in the sector's performance by increasing the availability of investment
and production credit and by providing additional technical assistance.
The Land Reform
33.       A far-reaching land reform was started in 1962 to improve land distri-
bution and promote its more efficient use. The reform gained momentum in 1965
and was accelerated after 1970. By 1973 some 5,800 properties, totalling almost
900,000 basic ha 1/ of land, had been expropriated representing 60 percent
1/   One basic hectare is equivalent to one irrigated hectare of the best
soils located in the Maipo Valley. It is used as a common index to
express the productive potential of the soils of other regions.



- 9 -
of Chile's best irrigated land, or about 40 percent of all land suitable for
agriculture. This expropriated land was largely assigned to groups which
exploited it communally under the supervision of the Government land reform
agency. Because of the Government's concentration on expropriations, the pace
of the land titling process lagged, particularly during the 1971-73 period,
and by the end of 1973 only about 10,000 families had received titles to
approximately 100,000 basic ha.
34.       As part of its efforts to complete the land reform after 1973, the
Government accelerated the land titling process and by the end of 1979 an
additional 400,000 basic ha of land had been assigned with a 30 year Govern-
ment mortgage to approximately 40,000 beneficiaries. Pending litigation over
irregularities in the expropriation process was completed and approximately
255,000 basic ha that were determined to have been illegally confiscated were
returned to the original owners. Most of the remaining 140,000 basic ha of land,
which was generally of low productivity and not suitable for distribution under
the land reform, was auctioned off to private owners or transferred to non-profit
institutions. The land reform, therefore, added some 50,000 farmers owning 5 to
12 basic ha of land each to Chile's small farmer community, which now totals about
250,000 families.
35.       In 1978 the Government passed legislation removing restrictions on
the sale of land by agrarian reform beneficiaries and on land ownership generally.
Moreover, the Government converted mortgages on properties assigned under the
land reform into long-term real estate tax obligations which, however, do not
constitute liens on the land. This last measure, coupled with much higher
property values in Chile's rural areas, has enhanced the potential access of
land reform beneficiaries to credit since they are now able to offer their
property as collateral for loans. The actions mentioned in this paragraph
will tend to contribute to the efficient and intensive utilization of land
expropriated under the land reform. Together with Chile's free prices and
rational exchange rate policies, they are expected to contribute to increased
production.
Sectoral Institutions
36.       The Government's presence in the sector has been continuously reduced
since 1973. Public agencies have gradually withdrawn from the marketing of
agricultural produce and inputs and direct provision of services in accordance
with the Government's policy to limit its future role to public investment
planning, regulation and enforcement of technical norms and research.
37.       The Ministry of Agriculture--through its Agricultural Planning
Office (ODEPA)--sets sectoral policies, coordinates regional programs, plans
public sector allocations, carries out studies and oversees the agriculture
sector in general. The Ministry and its affiliated agencies have been
reorganized since 1977 in line with many of the recommendations to stream-
line and decentralize activities made in a study financed by the Bank under
the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1119-CH approved on May 8, 1975).



- 10 -
38.       The National Agricultural Development Institute (INDAP), which is
an autonomous agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, was created in 1962 to
promote the economic and social development of the rural poor. Currently it
is responsible for providing credit, technical assistance and training to
small farmers owning 12 basic ha of land or less. The agency has a staff
of about 1,400 working out of 93 field offices. In the past, LNDAP was
not able to serve effectively the small farmers who still required State
assistance. Since 1977, however, the agency's operations have been under
Government review and it has been carrying out an improvement program with
emphasis on upgrading its investment project analysis, the administration of
its technical assistance program, its loan portfolio management and its
accounting system. As a consequence, INDAP's performance has improved markedly
and its loan recovery record for loans made since 1977 has been highly satis-
factory with over 95 percent payment at due dates.
Technical Assistance
39.       As part of its policy to replace public with private services wher-
ever possible, the Government has established a program to promote technical
assistance to farmers by private firms. This private technical assistance
program (ATE) was launched by the Ministry of Agriculture in early 1978.
Under the program, private consulting firms are retained directly by the
farmer but the Government subsidizes 60 percent of the cost, up to US$150 of
their services, to small farmers. The consulting firms prepare investment
plans and aid small farmers in obtaining the necessary credit. In the first
half of the 1979-1980 season, the program reached over 14,000 small farmers,
about 80 percent of whom were land reform beneficiaries. Under the proposed
second credit project, small farmers are expected to receive technical
assistance either from INDAP or the ATE program, depending on the source of
their credit.
Agricultural Credit
40.       Agricultural investment and production credit is provided by
commercial and development banks and INDAP. Because of inflationary expecta-
tions and the recent period of extreme illiquidity, virtually the only medium
and long-term loans available were provided by programs financed by official
international lenders or credits from foreign banks to a few large commercial
farmers. Demand for agricultural investment credit was estimated to be about
US$90 million annually in the 1979-1980 period, of which 35 percent was for
livestock, 25 to 35 percent for fruits and vineyards, 12 to 15 percent for
agroindustries and 20 to 25 percent for annual field crops. Investment credit
demand is projected to grow to US$115 million by 1980 and US$145 million by 1982.
41.       INDAP provides about 90 percent of the credit to small farmers but
the Government is keenly interested in spurring private bank lending to small
farmers in order to help meet the credit needs of this group as efficiently
as possible. In the past, small farmers faced a variety of difficulties in
obtaining credit from commercial banks. Land reform beneficiaries, for
example, could not offer their land as collateral because it was mortgaged to
the Government. "Minifundistas" lacked collateral because of the limited
market value of their land and, more often than not, because they had no



- 11 -
title. Furthermore, commercial bankers often perceived lending to small
farmers as a high risk and costly operation. Finally, small farmers usually
require technical assistance which the private banks are not equipped
to provide.
42.       The Government has taken specific measures to improve the small
farmers' opportunities to obtain credit from commercial banks and further
steps would be taken under the second credit project (paras. 57-58). To help
potential borrowers offer collateral, the mortgage on land distributed under
the agrarian reform was converted into a long-term real estate tax (para. 35),
and the Ministry of Agriculture has intensified its drive to issue titles to
"minifundistas" who acquired land through inheritance, without legal process.
INDAP and the ATE program (para. 39) provide subsidized technical assistance
to small farmers and, in cases where small farmers cannot pay for it, INDAP
furnishes free technical assistance. Finally, to minimize the risk of lending
to small farmers, the Government is planning to establish a small enterprise
guarantee fund.
Past Bank Group Lending
43.       The Bank has made six loans for agriculture and agro-industry to
Chile since 1948, totalling about US$70 million. The earliest operations
(in 1948 and 1951, respectively) financed agricultural machinery and irrigation
improvements at the Rio Elqui. These were followed by a livestock operation
and one for milk and meat processing facilities, both in 1963.
44.       More recently, the Bank financed an Agricultural Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1119-CH, approved on May 8, 1975) which provided short- and
medium-term credit to farmers as well as technical assistance for institution-
building in the public sector. This loan was disbursed in slightly over a year
and more than 70 percent of the credit provided under the project went to small
farmers owning 12 basic ha of land or less. The Project Performance Audit Report
(PPAR) of June 29, 1979 found that the project contributed to the recovery of
the agricultural sector through direct support of production. The Bank's
dialogue with the Government in the context of this loan also helped accelerate
the titling of properties assigned under the land reform and the liberalization
of agricultural prices.
45.       The PPAR noted that, although the agricultural rehabilitation
project was conceived of as an emergency operation, the delay between project
identification and Board presentation (18 months) indicated, as in other
cases, the Bank's limited ability to act quickly in urgent situations. The
PPAR also suggested that INDAP required strengthening and mentions that some
Chilean officials interviewed during the audit expressed reservations regarding
the inclusion in the Bank loan of a consultants' study for reorganization of
public agencies providing services to the agricultural sector and regarding
its high cost (US$394,000). However, as was stated by the Minister of
Agriculture of Chile in his June 4, 1979 letter commenting on the PPAR, the
study made far reaching recommendations which served as the basis for a much
needed reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Region is of the



- 12 -
the -iew that the study (which was requested by the Government) was justified
and that, in view of its wide scope, its cost was not excessive. Finally, as
is noted in para. 38, since 1977 the Government has taken a number of measures
to bring the performance of INDAP--one of the agencies which would participate
in the project recommended in this Report--up to satisfactory levels.
46.       The Bank's most recent agricultural operation in Chile is the
Livestock, Fruits, Vineyards and Agro-Industry Project (Loan 1350-CH, approved
on December 21, 1976) to finance medium- and long-term investment credit for
on-farm development and related agro-industry. Project implementation has
been satisfactory and more than 95 percent of the loan had been disbursed by
the end of June 1980. Twenty percent of the project's US$50 million lending
program was earmarked for "minifundistas," i.e., farmers owning only 5 basic
ha of land or less. This target is being met. In addition, about 11 percent
of project lending has gone to agrarian reform beneficiaries owning between
five and 12 basic ha of land.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
47.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in March 1978
and prepared by ODEPA. A Bank mission appraised the project in June 1979.
Its report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Chile Agricultural Credit
Project II' (2769b-CH dated August 11, 1980) is being distributed separately.
Annex III contains a Supplementary Data Sheet. Negotiations of the loan took
place in Santiago from August 6 to 8, 1980 and the Chilean delegation was
headed by Mr. Sergio Silva, Director of ODEPA.
Project Objectives and Description
48.       The project's main objectives would be to increase agricultural
output--including production of several export crops for which Chile enjoys
a comparative advantage--and to help small farmers, mainly beneficiaries of
the land reform and "minifundistas," to increase their earnings, improve their
living conditions and develop into commercially viable farmers and ranchers.
This would be accomplished by providing investment credit, some short-term
credit and technical assistance to:
(a)  approximately 2,570 small farmers and ranchers who, either
individually or as members of cooperatives, own 12 basic ha of
land or less. Most of these small beneficiaries have never before
had access to investment credit;
(b) about 750 farmers who own more than 12 basic ha and have estab-
lished agricultural operations but need financing for modernization
or expansion; and
(c) an estimated 90 agro-industrial enterprises.
The investments to be financed under the proposed loan would be carried out over
a two and one half year period (1981-83).



- 13 -
49.       Investments in livestock and dairy production are expected to account
for about US$29.2 million, which represents 32.4 percent of project costs.
Subloans for dairy farms and beef ranches would finance the purchase of
equipment, breeding stock and the construction of fencing and the improvement
of pastures. An estimated 820 beneficiaries participating in this component
would be small farmers and ranchers and another 220 would be ranchers with
more than 12 basic hectares. Breeding stock purchases by project beneficiaries
would be limited to 50 percent of subloans. This limit could, however, be
raised in the case of small farmers with the prior approval of ODEPA (paragraph
B.7 of Schedule 4 to the draft Loan Agreement).
50.       The fruits, table grapes and vineyards component would absorb an
estimated US$26.3 million or 29.3 percent of project costs. Soil and climatic
conditions in the Central Region are ideal for producing a wide variety of
fruits (e.g., table grapes, nectarines, and apples) and wines. While cultiva-
tion practices are generally sound, some improved techniques are needed. The
use of fertilizers, pesticides and trellises for grape growing would be
intensified, particularly by small farmers. In addition, higher quality and
better yielding new varieties of fruits would be introduced under the project.
About 1,260 small farmers, including many "minifundistas," are expected to
benefit from this component, together with about 320 medium-sized special-
ized farms. Under this component, about 2,600 jobs would be created owing to
labor intensive crop maintenance, and harvesting.
51.       Investments in field crops and vegetables would account for about
US$21.5 million, or 23.9 percent of project costs. These would help increase
the yields of traditional crops--such as wheat, corn, potatoes, sugarbeets,
rapeseeds and beans--as well as introduce new high value crops such as onions,
asparagus and strawberries. Subloans would finance the acquisition of modern
machinery and the construction of wells and installation of pumps to permit
simple irrigation. Improved seeds and fertilizer purchases would also be
financed under this component. An estimated 490 small and 210 medium-sized
farmers are expected to benefit from this type of investment.
52.       An estimated US$13 million or 14.4 percent of the project's cost
would finance the modernization or expansion of about 90 private or coopera-
tive agro-industries. These would include, inter alia, fruit cold storage
facilities, packing plants, dairy processing and wine production operations,
and cleaning and grading facilities mainly for export products. An estimated
20 percent of the beneficiaries would be small farmers in cooperatives.
Project Implementation
53.       Bank loan funds and Government counterpart contributions would be
on-lent by the Central Bank to participating commercial banks and INDAP.
Subloan repayments received by the Central Bank and not used to repay the Bank
loan or cover operational expenses associated with administering the project
would be relent by the Central Bank for further agricultural lending for a
period of 15 years (Section 3.02 (d) of the draft Loan Agreement).
54.       On-lending arrangements would be covered by subsidiary loan agree-
ments between the Central Bank and each participating institution. The terms
and conditions of these agreements would be satisfactory to the Bank and
the execution of the subsidiary loan agreements with INDAP and at least
one commercial bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Sections
3.02(c) and 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
55.       Subloan applications for on-farm development would be supported
by investment plans, including cash flow projections and an economic justi-
fication of the proposed investments. Farm plans would be prepared with the
assistance of INDAP's extension agents in the case of the poorest small farmers
and with the help of consultants on contract to INDAP for the typical land reform
beneficiary. Alternatively, small farmers could hire private consultants under
the subsidized ATE program (para. 39). The cost of these consultants would be
financed under the subloan. Medium-sized ranchers and agro-industries would use
private consultants whose fees would also be financed from the subloans. Compre-
hensive technical/economic feasibility studies, including market studies, would be
required for agroindustrial investments (paragraph B.2 of Schedule 4 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
56.       ODEPA would provide technical support to the Central Bank in carrying
out the proposed project. Its responsibilities would include: (i) assisting
the Central Bank and participating financial institutions, at their request,
in analyzing subloan applications and farm plans; (ii) supervising the
implementation of investments; and (iii) monitoring, in coordination with the
Central Bank, project execution and evaluating its impact on the sector.
ODEPA's experience with the Bank's two recent agricultural loans would be
particularly helpful in the monitoring and ex-post evaluation of this project.
Lending Terms and Conditions
57.       The proposed project contains a number of features to spur lending to
small farmers. The Central Bank would, for example, earmark a minimum of US$24
million, or one-third of the project's lending program, to farmers owning 12 basic
ha or less (Section 3.02(c) of the draft Loan Agreement). This group includes
"minifundistas" owning less than 5 basic ha of land and agrarian reform bene-
ficiaries with 5 to 12 basic ha. In addition, subloans to small farmers would
cover up to 100 percent of their approved investment plans versus up to 80 per-
cent of the investments of other project beneficiaries (paragraph B.3 of
Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement). To encourage private bank lending
to small farmers, the Central Bank would also rediscount 100 percent of
subloans made to small farmers as compared with only 70 percent rediscounting
on other subloans (paragraph A.1 of Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Finally, the interest rate charged by financial intermediaries to small farmers
would be two percentage points below that charged to other beneficiaries
(paragraph B.5 of Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement). To afford an
early opportunity to monitor progress under the small farmer component of
the project, the Government and the Bank would review the status of small
farmer commitments within one year after the proposed loan's signature (Section
4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).
58.       Because of Chile's traditionally high inflation rates, the outstand-
ing principal amounts of all peso-denominated credits are adjusted at the time
of interest payments in accordance with the Chilean consumer price index. As a
result, interest rates are fully positive. Under the project the Central Bank
would charge participating institutions up to 10.5 percent for on-lending to
small farmers and up to 12.5 percent on all other subloans, calculated on the
readjusted principal. Interest rates on subloans would not exceed 14 percent
for small farmers. Interest rates for other beneficiaries would vary freely on
that portion of the subloan (30 percent) financed by a participating bank, but
would not exceed 16 percent on the remaining portion (70 percent), which would



- 15 -
be rediscounted by the Central Bank. Thus, lending institutions would be
allowed a spread of up to 3.5 points, which is sufficient to cover their
incremental administrative costs and provide a reasonable return. Depending
on the type of investment financed, subloans would have a maximum maturity of
12 years, including grace periods of up to 4 years.
59.       Subloans under the project would not cumulatively exceed, in constant
1980 Chilean pesos, the equivalent of (i) US$100,000 for on-farm investments
by farmers and ranchers; and (ii) US$150,000 for agro-industries (paragraph A.11
of Schedule 4 to the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financin&
60.       Total project cost is estimated at US$90 million, including about
US$12 million in taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are US$36 million,
or about 40 percent of total costs. The proposed Bank loan of US$36 million
would finance the full foreign exchange component. The Government would
provide US$21.6 million (24 percent of total project costs) and participating
institutions would finance US$14.4 million (16 percent). Project beneficiaries
would contribute the remaining US$18 million (20 percent). The Government
would assume the full foreign exchange risk under the proposed loan.
Procurement and Disbursement
61.       A wide range of goods and services would be financed under the
project through an estimated 3,410 subloans. Therefore, the use of inter-
national competitive bidding would not be practicable. Project beneficiaries,
using the proceeds of subloans, would purchase project inputs from established
local agents, who represent a broad spectrum of international and local
suppliers. Local agents for tractors, machinery, fertilizers and chemical
products represent Bank member countries and provide satisfactory services.
62.       Disbursement of the proposed loan would be made against 50 percent
of the subloans made by participating institutions to project beneficiaries,
and is expected to take about 3-1/2 years from early- 1981 to mid-1984.
Economic Benefits and Justification
63.       The project's overall rate of economic return (excluding the agro-
industry component where the rate of return will depend on the characteristics
of individual subprojects) is estimated at 34 percent, varying between 31 per-
cent for livestock investment and 36 percent for crop investment. Sensitivity
tests show that a 20 percent increase in costs and a similar reduction in
benefits would cause economic returns for the project as a whole to drop to
20 percent, which is satisfactory.
64.       Access to credit and technical assistance under the project would bene-
fit about 3,320 small- and medium-sized farmers and, through their families, a
total of about 20,000 people in the rural sector. In addition, the project is
expected to generate 2,600 man years of incremental employment. At full



- 16 -
development, the annual total value of the incremental output generated by the
project would be approximately US$50 million. An estimated 40 percent of this
increased output would be exported--mainly selected fruits, wines and processed
agricultural produce for which Chile enjoys a comparative advantage because of
its soils, Mediterranean climate and ability to harvest these crops during the
northern hemisphere's winter months.
65.       The project's benefits would be particularly significant for an
estimated 1,100 small farmer families whose income is now below the absolute
poverty level, and for another 1,470 families who are below the relative
poverty level. All these beneficiaries own less than 12 basic ha. of land.
At full development, the incomes of these 2,570 project beneficiaries and
their families (some 15,420 people) would rise above the relative poverty
level.
Risks and Environmental Impact
66.       The project does not face any unusual risks.  Adverse environmental
effects are not expected, since the Ministry of Agriculture has an effective
system of licensing and controlling the use of fertilizers and chemicals, and
land conservation and rehabilitation legislation is also satisfactory and
adequately enforced.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
67.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Chile and the Bank,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
68.       The main features of the draft Loan Agreement are referred to in the
text of this report and are listed in Section III. The proposed loan's only
special condition of loan effectiveness would be the signing of subsidiary
loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank by the Central Bank, on the one
hand, and by at least one commercial bank and INDAP, on the other (para. 54).
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
70.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
project.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 11
Loan No. 1200-CH Copper Sector Project; US$27.8 million Loan of March 24,
1976; Effective Date: June 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Project start up was delayed by a major reorganization of CODELCO--
one of the project's two executing agencies. The reorganization was an insti-
tution building measure which the Bank supported.  It was further delayed
by changes in the project's scope which the Government requested in late 1977.
The most important of these was the decision to provide electricity to
CODELCO's El Salvador mine by interconnecting it with the main power grid of
the National Power Company (ENDESA) instead of by rehabilitating the mine's
dilapidated thermal plant as the project originally envisaged. This move made
sense following an ENDESA's decision in 1976 to extend the grid to a point
relatively close to the mine. The Executive Directors agreed to the requested
modifications on a "non objection" basis on September 7, 1978, and at the same
time, the loan's amount was reduced from US$33 million to the present US$27.8
million because the approved changes entailed lower project foreign exchange
costs. The Loan's Closing Date was also extended to December 31, 1980. Since
the project's modification in 1978, its execution has improved considerably.
Mainly because of the long delivery period of specialized equipment provided
under the project, however, the loan will not be fully disbursed by end 1980
and its Closing Date (December 31, 1980) will have to be extended by a year.
Loan No. 1350-CH Livestock, Fruits, Vineyards and Agro-industry Credit
Project; US$25 million Loan of March 17, 1977; Effective
Date: June 15, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Loan disbursements have moved more quickly than expected at the
time of appraisal and as of June 30, 1980 only about US$1.1 million remained
undisbursed. Strong demand for credit amongst medium-sized farmers resulted
in fast disbursements to this group. As expected, subloans to agrarian reform
beneficiaries and "minifundistas" farming five basic ha of land or less have
moved more slowly, mainly because of their more limited absorptive capacity.
Both categories of small farmers have received about a third of loan funds and
the agreed-upon earmarking of 20 percent of project funds to "minifundistas"
is being met. Bank staff are closely monitoring this aspect of performance.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1351-CH Sixth Power Project; US$35 million Loan of February 15, 1977;
Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing Date: June 30,
1981.
After several postponements in the effectiveness deadline, this
loan was declared effective on December 28, 1978. These postponements
were caused by the Government's unwillingness to raise tariffs sufficiently
to enable ENDESA, the National Power Company, to earn the agreed-upon rates
of return in 1977 and 1978. The Government, for its part, maintained that
ENDESA's tariffs were already satisfactory and that its rates of return
appeared low only because the company's asset base was overvalued. To resolve
this valuation issue, the Government retained the services of consultants,
satisfactory to the Bank, to review ENDESA's asset base. Their study, avail-
able in July 1978, indicated that the company's assets were overstated, albeit
by less than the Government had believed. Subsequently, the Bank and the
Government jointly reviewed ENDESA's financial projections and investment pro-
gram. Both sides agreed to a plan of tariff increases and other tax measures
which would assure the company's financial viability and enable it to make a
satisfactory contribution to its investments. Following this agreement, the
loan was declared effective. Because of the delays in effectiveness referred
to above, however, disbursements to date have been low.
Loan No. 1832-CH Water Supply Project; US$38 million Loan of August 15, 1980;
Effective Date:                          Closing Date:  June 30,
1985.
This loan was recently signed.

the Central Bank and INDAP would be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 54);
(b) breeding stock purchases by project beneficiaries would be
limited to 50 percent of their subloans. This limit could
be raised for small farmers with prior approval of ODEPA
(para 49);
(c) subloan repayments not used by the Central Bank to service the
Bank loan or cover its operational expenses associated with the
proposed project would be used for further agricultural lending

ANNEX III
Page 2 of 2
(d) the Central Bank to charge participating financial inter-
mediaries up to 10.5 percent for onlending to small farmers
and up to 12.5 percent on all other subloans. Financial
intermediaries would, in turn, charge up to 14 percent
interest to small farmers and up to 16 percent on the
portion (70 percent) of subloans to other beneficiaries,
which would be rediscounted with the Central Bank (para. 58).
The interest rate charged to small farmers would be two
percentage points below that charged by financial inter-
mediaries to other beneficiaries (para. 57). All interest
rates are fully adjusted for inflation;
(e) subloans by financial intermediaries to small farmers would
cover up to 100 percent of their investment plans as compared
to only up to 80 percent of investment plans submitted by
other beneficiaries. The Central Bank would rediscount
100 percent of subloans made by financial intermediaries to
small farmers and 70 percent of subloans to others (para. 57);
(f) no subloans totalling more than the equivalent, in constant
1980 Chilean pesos, of US$100,000 for on-farm development
and US$150,000 for agro-industrial investments, would be
made to any beneficiary (para. 59); and
(g) a minimum of US$24 million, one-third of the project's lending
program, would be earmarked for small farmers, and the Govern-
ment and the Bank to review jointly the status of commitments
to small farmers within one year after the proposed loan's
signature (para. 57).
