would\n            be to increase agricultural output, including production of\n            several export crops for which Chile enjoys a comparative\n            advantage, and to help small farmers--mainly beneficiaries\n            of the land reform and minifundistas --to increase their\n            earnings, improve their living conditions and develop into\n            commercially viable farmers. It would finance on-farm\n            investment, incremental production inputs and technical\n            assistance for: (i) approximately 2,570 small farmers\n            who--either individually or as members of cooperatives--own\n            12 basic ha of land or less. A minimum of one third of the\n            project's lending program would be earmarked for their\n            use; (ii) about 750 medium-sized farmers and ranchers; and\n            (iii) an estimated 90 agroindustrial enterprises. The\n            project faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
