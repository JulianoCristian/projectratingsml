             PROPOSED SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                          Financing and Program Summary

Borrower:        Government of Ghana

Proposed Amount: SDR60.8 million (US$100 million equivalent) IDA Credit

Terms:           Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period

Description:     The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-6) is the third in a
                 second series of four operations supporting the implementation of the Ghana
                 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) covering the period from
                 2006 to 2009. The design of this series was built on the lessons learnt from
                 previous PRSCs and was coordinated with the other Development Partners that
                 participate in the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) framework. Its focus
                 is in line with the 2005 Africa Action Plan and supports the implementation of
                 the 2007 Country Assistance Strategy.        The proposed PRSC-6 focuses on
                 selected reforms to: (i) accelerate private sector-led growth, (ii) develop human
                 resources, and (iii) promote good governance. While the PRSC-6 support would
                 translate primarily into funding for the GPRS II implementation, particular
                 attention is given to leveraging the poverty emphasis of sector focused operations
                 by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and structure) and
                 addressing the financing implications of some policy actions. The latter includes
                 the extension of capitation grants, the removal of school fees, the deployment of
                 teachers and health care professional to under-served areas, and the
                 implementation of an inclusive health insurance scheme.             In addition, a
                 supplemental to this PRSC protects existing social safety net programs and
                 aims at improving their targeting. The actions that are being considered in
                 this regard include: (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and
                 strengthening a centralized early warning system for food insecurity; (ii)
                 targeting the most vulnerable in food insecure areas through the government's
                 recently established conditional cash transfer program (Livelihood
                 Empowerment Against Poverty ­ LEAP); and (iii) ensuring access to health
                 care services for the poorest of the poor by continuing to provide a percentage
                 of them with a premium exemption for registration in the NHIS. Institutions
                 related to public financial management (PFM) also receive particular attention
                 since a robust PFM is critical to ensure the attainment of the GPRS II objectives.
                 Lastly, attention is given to monitoring poverty outcomes, ensuring that sector
                 programs deliver results in terms of human development indicators. By helping
                 to internalize these monitoring functions, the expectation is that the allocation of
                 resources will increasingly reflect the feedback from these results.

Benefits:        The measures supported by the proposed PRSC-6 are expected to have a positive
                 impact on poverty reduction. These measures include actions to consolidate the
                 government's achievements in human development (education, health, and water
                 and sanitation) and to advance decentralization aiming at improvements in basic
                 service delivery. Actions aimed at facilitating private sector development and



                                          - vi -

                  increasing agricultural productivity would help promote sustained economic
                  growth and exports, while the strengthening of public financial management
                  would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public investments
                  and service delivery.

Risks:            The following risks are identified to the success of the program: (1) further
                  delays in carrying out the needed reforms in the energy sector; (2) the large size
                  of the public sector, which might compromise the sustainability of the current
                  economic expansion by limiting private sector growth and by reducing the scope
                  for fiscal management; (3) a possible disconnect between increased health
                  spending and improved health outcomes; (4) delays in structural reforms aimed
                  at raising productivity throughout the economy; (5) the risk of debt distress
                  resulting from a slowdown in growth, because of either an external shocks (e.g.,
                  a worsening in the terms of trade), a disruption in the domestic economy (e.g., an
                  election induced increase in the public sector deficit) or an increased level of
                  non-concessional borrowing; and (6) remaining fiduciary weaknesses that might
                  limit the impact of the program and lead to only partial funding from
                  development partners.

Risk mitigation:  The concerns about further delays in energy sector reforms are partially mitigated
                  by the recent increase in electricity tariffs, raising end-user tariffs by over 100
                  percent, and the government's decision to earmark a reserve fund in 2007 and
                  2008 dedicated to cover the gap between end-user electricity tariffs and the costs
                  of power generation, transmission and distribution. The risks associated with the
                  large size of the public sector are mitigated by the fact that Ghana is
                  implementing a public sector reform program aimed at rightsizing public sector
                  entities operating in non-essential areas. The risk of widening lags between
                  increased health spending and improvements in health outcomes is mitigated by
                  ongoing improvements in health administration, including the establishment of
                  the national health insurance scheme. The risk of delays in structural reforms is
                  reduced by stronger coordination of ongoing reforms within government. The
                  risk of debt distress resulting from a slowdown in growth in the face of the
                  country's decision to borrow in international capital markets is mitigated by the
                  fact that, given the country's growth (including export growth) prospects and the
                  low level of debt, the nonconcessional borrowing undertaken in the fall of 2007
                  does not fundamentally alter the assessment of the country's debt outlook made
                  earlier in 2007. Lastly, the risk that residual fiduciary weaknesses may lead to
                  the misapplication of public funds is steadily decreasing as a result of the
                  continued progress made in strengthening the framework for public financial
                  management.

1.      This Program Document proposes a single-tranche Sixth Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC-6) for SDR60.8 million (about US$100 million equivalent) to the Republic of
Ghana. The amount of the proposed credit reflects a SDR6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent)
reduction due to less than satisfactory performance in the energy sector trigger, and an additional
SDR6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent) to help the Government protect programs aimed at
mitigating the impact of recent rises in food prices on the consumption level of the poorest. The
reform program supported by the proposed credit builds on Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (GPRS II) and is aligned with the Bank's Africa Action Plan (AAP) and the FY07 Ghana
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). It is the third in a second series of four such operations,
covering the period 2006 to 2009, to support the implementation of selected reforms to promote
private sector-led growth, encourage vigorous human development and strengthen governance.

2.      The proposed credit aims to support the consolidation of the government's
achievements in the provision of services for human development and in public financial
management, while sharpening the focus of the support to growth related areas, namely
energy, private sector development and natural resource management. The PRSC support
would also contribute to guarding government programs aimed at protecting the consumption level of
the poorest in face of the recent acceleration in food price inflation, and sharpening their focus.
These efforts include: (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and strengthening a centralized
early warning system for food insecurity; (ii) targeting the most vulnerable in food insecure areas
through the government's recently established conditional cash transfer program (Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty ­ LEAP); and (iii) ensuring access to health care services for the
poorest of the poor by continuing to provide a percentage of them with a premium exemption for
registration in the NHIS. The PRSC contributes therefore the Government's efforts to ensure
appropriate expenditure levels in the education and health sectors, while helping address some of the
financing implications of enhancing social protection measures, redoubling the emphasis on
achieving greater gender parity in primary school enrolment, improving teacher training and stepping
up malaria control. The PRSC would also focus on cross-cutting issues related to public financial
management, including the implementation of the new public procurement act.

3.      Given its cross-cutting focus, PRSC-6 would help harmonize existing sector focused
operations and leverage their poverty focus by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level
and structure) and by addressing the financing implications of some policy actions (notably the
expansion of capitation grants to students attending public basic education and the removal of
primary and junior secondary school fees, the deployment of teachers and health care professional to
under-served areas, and the implementation of an inclusive national health insurance scheme).

Lastly, attention is given to monitoring poverty outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver
results in terms of human development indicators. By helping to internalize these monitoring
functions, the expectation is that the allocation of resources will increasingly reflect the feedback
from these results.

4.      The design of the proposed operation draws on existing and ongoing work on social and
economic analysis, as well as on recently completed work on public financial management. The
findings of this work validate the policy directions proposed in the GPRS II, and supported by the
proposed PRSC, namely the importance of: (i) prudent management of public finances to ensure
macroeconomic stability for growth and to preserve the funding for the social sectors; (ii) investing
in human capital to mitigate the situation of chronic and persistent poverty among a large number of
households and targeting women and children in the delivery of education and health services
(including nutrition program); (iii) scaling up investments in key infrastructure sectors, notably in
energy and water and sanitation, as well as implementing policy, regulatory and institutional reforms
in public utilities; and (iv) sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for maintaining the long
term trends in growth, urbanization and poverty reduction.

5.      Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance will continue to play an important role in
supporting the implementation of the GPRS, given that the country's own resources fall short
of the levels required for achieving the objectives spelled out in the strategy. The GPRS created
the momentum for a significant group of donors to align their budgetary support under a common
framework, the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS), of which this PRSC-6 is part. As agreed
at the June 2007 Consultative Group (CG) meeting, the MDBS is an important step taken on the
principles of harmonization, providing a framework for policy dialogue and decisions linked to
progress in the implementation of the GPRS II.


   2.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS IN POVERTY
                                             REDUCTION

A.      Recent Economic Developments

6.      Ghana's economic performance continues strong, notwithstanding disruptions in power
supply in the latter part of 2006 that persisted into the first half of 2007. Economic growth
reached 6.3 percent in 2007, slightly below the 6.4 percent real GDP growth level recorded in 2006.
The recent growth performance reflects a skewed sectoral breakdown, however. Output growth has
been concentrated in mining (up 20 percent), in finance, insurance, and real estate (up 15 percent), in
construction (up 11 percent), and in services (up 11 percent on the good performance of wholesale
trade ­ up 25 percent). The performance of these sectors greatly outweighed the output declines in
manufacturing (down 2.3 percent) and electricity and water production (down 15 percent). There
was also the stimulus provided by fiscal policy, with Government services rising by 6 percent, and
yielding an additional 1 percent of real GDP growth.

7.      There are sound economic fundamentals behind the recent growth performance, with
the country ranking among the top ten reformers in the last two Doing Business Reports. There
were reductions reported in the time required to register new businesses and to register property, as
well as in the ease of trading across borders. Access to credit by the private sector was also made
easier, as measured both by the Doing Business report and by the increase in the private sector's
share in total domestic credit. This positive business climate has translated in turn in the strong

performance of exports and in the country's ability to draw on foreign savings, either by accessing
the international capital market, or by attracting external investors to its domestic bond market, and
continuing to receive large remittance inflows from Ghanaians living abroad. Exports are estimated
to have risen by over 10 percent in 2007, buoyed by high commodity prices for gold, as well as the
good performance of cocoa and non-traditional exports. Net capital flows are estimated to have
reached US$2.0 billion by end year, adding to the estimated US$2.3 billion inflow of transfers
(private and official) (Tables 1 and 2).

8.       The good performance of exports and of the net capital inflows have not been enough to
reverse the weakening in the country's external position, however. End-2007 foreign currency
reserves are estimated to have reached 2.9 months of import coverage, maintaining around the same
level of import coverage reached at end-2006. However, since about one-third of the projected end-
year reserves are unused proceeds of the recent Eurobond issue, in the absence of these unused bond
proceeds the import coverage would have fallen to 2.4 months. The weakening in the country's
external position reflects primarily the recent surge in imports, which are estimated to have risen by
about 17 percent on strong increases in oil and non-oil imports. Oil imports have risen in line with
the increase in crude oil prices in international markets, while non-oil imports have increased as a
result of higher consumer demand and rising food prices. The latter explains in turn the need for
supplemental PRSC financing, since additional budget support is necessary to preserve the
Government's planned expenditures to protect the consumption levels of the poorest. Preserving

these programs is important because the overall public sector deficit is projected to reach 10.0
percent of GDP in 2008, up from the already high 9 percent of GDP recorded in 2007. The
additional financing is also important because, in line with these projections, the balance of payments
current account deficit is projected to widen further to 13.5 percent of GDP (including official
transfers) in 2008, up from 11 percent in 2007.

9.        The widening of the current account deficit reflects in part the weakening of the
country's fiscal stance. Since the second half of 2006 government expenditures have risen faster
than revenue collections, leading the overall fiscal deficit to reach 7.5 percent of GDP in 2006 and to
have risen further to an estimated 9.0 percent of GDP in 2007 (Table 3). The main driver of
government spending has been the public sector wage bill, reaching almost 10 percent of GDP as a
result of pay awards that triggered further requests for pay increases within the public sector. Energy
sector subsidies are also one of the factors placing pressure on the budget, as budget subsidies were
needed to bridge the roughly one percent of GDP difference in 2007 between the revenues from end-
user utility tariffs and the actual cost of power generation and distribution. Although externally
financed capital expenditures (from international financial institutions and, more recently, from the
proceeds from the Eurobond) have also contributed to the widening of the budget deficit, these
expenditures contribute to removing bottlenecks in the country's growth path, and their financing
reduce pressures on domestic savings.

10.       The economic developments on the fiscal and external fronts have been reflected on the
interest and exchange rates. Between early September 2007 and mid-March 2008 domestic interest
rates on 91-day treasury bills rose by just over one percentage point, while the exchange rate (cedis
to US dollar) declined during this same period by 5.2 percent (against an already declining US
dollar). The Bank of Ghana's Monetary Policy Committee has responded to these developments in
two separate occasions. First, in mid-November by raising its prime rate to 13.5 percent, up from the
12.5 percent level it had been kept over the previous year, and then again in mid-March by raising
the prime rate by another 75 basis points to 14.25. These changes are important because foreign
investors currently account for between 20 to 25 percent of the domestic bond market, and are more
likely than domestic investors to respond to these developments. Also, rising inflation has recently
become a concern. The 2007 end-year consumer price index (CPI) rose to 12.7, up from 10.9 percent
in 2006, and maintained its upward momentum in January, February and March 2008, reaching 12.8,
13.2 and 13.8 percent, respectively. These price developments reflect supply-side shocks coming
from external developments (e.g., higher crude oil prices, higher imported food prices), and domestic
sources (e.g., higher food prices following the drought and flood in Northern Ghana, adjustments in
utility tariffs), as well as buoyant domestic demand.

11.       Notwithstanding the need to accommodate higher spending on energy sector subsidies,
Government spending maintained its pro-poor orientation in 2007.1                                        Poverty reduction



1 Poverty related expenditures include the following expenditures from the Appropriation Act: (i) Education ­ non-formal
education, pre-school, basic education, technical & vocational education, teacher training, and education management and
supervision, plus a fraction of the expenditures on special education (90%), general administration (50%), etc ; (ii) Health ­
district health services, regional public health expenditures, oncology expenditures, funding for the international red cross, and
health learning materials, plus a fraction of the expenditures on regional health support services (50%), psychiatric hospital
(50%), regional clinical care (50%), health training institutions (70%), institutional care (60%), etc ; (iii) Agriculture ­ crop
services provided through the regional agriculture development units and projects funded by IDA; (iv) Works and Housing ­ the
community water and sanitation, rural housing and rural hydrological drainage; (v) Feeder Roads and Transport ­ feeder roads
and road safety; (vi) Energy ­ rural electrification programs; and (vii) Other ­ national vocational training, social welfare
programs, etc.

expenditures are estimated to have ended 2007 slightly lower than in 2006, reaching 9.4 percent of
GDP compared to the 10.5 percent of GDP recorded in 2006 but up from 8.5 percent reached at end-
2005. At the current levels, poverty reducing expenditures account for just over one-third of overall
expenditures. The budget execution of these poverty reducing expenditures over the first 9 months
of 2007 was very uneven, however (Figure 1). There were higher rates of budget execution in some
programs with large payrolls, such as primary health programs, as well as in priority investment
programs, such as rural water and feeder roads. Spending on basic education programs and poverty
focused agricultural programs lagged behind, however. The budget execution rate in basic education
programs was just under 100 percent, while the execution rates for poverty focused agricultural
programs was just under 75 percent. In the case of basic education programs this is an issue of
concern because payroll expenditures account for a large share of the overall program. Overall low
levels of budget execution suggest that the budget execution of other expenditure items might have
been even lower.

12.      As Ghana turns its attention to implementing the 2008 budget, focus has now shifted to
maintaining the recent performance in revenue collection, to keeping expenditures within the
approved budget ceilings, and to actions aimed at sustaining the stability of the banking system
during this period of rapid credit expansion. The fiscal revenues to GDP ratio rose to just under
22.5 percent in 2007, up from 21.9 percent in 2006, thanks to revenue collection efforts at every front
­ trade taxes, VAT, the NHI levy, and income taxes (IRS). Sustaining these efforts will be important
if the Government expects to attain the 29.0 percent of GDP in fiscal revenues envisioned in the 2008
budget. Also, on February 14 the Bank of Ghana increased the minimum capital requirement for
universal banking to GH¢60 million, up from the current GH¢10 million level. The increase in
minimum capital requirements come into effect immediately only for foreign banks, however.
Ghanaian-owned banks will have until 2012 to meet the new capital requirements.

                                   Box 1: Ghana's Non Concessional Borrowing

 On September 27, 2007, Ghana issued a US$750 million Eurobond on international capital markets at a
 fixed coupon of 8.5 percent with a ten-year bullet repayment of the principal.2 The Government of Ghana
 also signed, on September 25, 2007, a US$292 million loan agreement with the China ExImbank to be used
 toward the construction of a hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam. This loan from the China Eximbank
 carries an average commercial interest rate of 6.1 percent, with a 17-year amortization period, a 5 years grace
 period, and a zero grant element.3

 This development is consistent with the Ghana GPRS II, which had already envisaged that funding from
 domestic and concessional sources of financing would be insufficient to finance the entire development
 plan. Indeed, following the October 2005 Consultative Group (CG) meeting the Government communicated to
 the Bank that it would seek additional financing from non-concessional sources to meet the country's growth
 targets and achieve the MDGs. It indicated that the costs of needed investments in energy and roads could not be
 met from either domestic or concessional resources. This need became more pressing as the energy crisis
 deepened in late-2006 and early 2007. The decline in water levels at the Akosombo dam reduced power supply
 capacity by 25 to 30 percent, making even more urgent the need to scale up investments to restore power supply
 capacity to the levels prior to the crisis and ensure that energy supply would increase in lockstep with projected
 real GDP growth.

 More recently, the Government's intention to access international capital markets was discussed in
 February 2007 and incorporated in the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) completed in
 April 2007. The joint DSA included the government's intention to borrow about US$250 million per year non-
 concessionally between 2007 and 2009, and US$350 million per year thereafter, and concluded that Ghana faced
 as a result a moderate risk of debt distress, albeit on the low side. The main developments since that joint DSA
 was completed are the Government's decision to borrow the envisioned amount from international capital
 markets in one single tranche, rather than spreading it over a three year period, and to sign the financing
 agreement with the China ExImbank. The frontloading of the borrowing can be explained by the fact that there
 are fixed costs in accessing international capital markets, hence these fixed costs would have been higher if funds
 were raised in separate tranches.          Moreover, the financing agreement with the China ExImbank for the
 construction of the hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam is part and parcel of the Government's efforts to
 keep the expansion of low cost electricity generation capacity in line with the country's projected real GDP
 growth.

 A revised joint Bank-IMF DSA is scheduled to be prepared at the time of the IMF's next Article IV
 consultations, and the results should be available by mid-2008. The next joint DSA will be important because
 it will be able to take account of two significant developments. First, the recent front loading of non-concessional
 borrowing, which is likely to have shifted Ghana farther into the moderate risk category. This impact of the
 recent borrowing could be offset however by a second important development ­ the prospect of oil exports.
 Preliminary real GDP and export growth projections, which account for the information available on the
 prospects of crude oil exports beginning in 2010, place Ghana closer to a scenario of low risk of debt distress.4




2The coupon on the bond translates into a reoffer (before management and transaction fees) of 387 basis points over 10-year US
Treasuries, or 326 basis points over the US dollar LIBOR, and a zero grant element.
3Ghana has also signed mixed credit agreements with the Netherland Government, combining commercial bank loans with
official grants. These mixed credit agreements include, for instance, a loan from BMH Bank for the Barekese Water Supply
Project of US$23.5 million equivalent, which was combined with a US$26.6 million equivalent grant from the Netherlands'
Government.

B.       Economic Outlook

13.      The outlook for 2008 is for real GDP growth to reach 6.7 percent, with economic
growth driven by the good performance in the mining sector, high public sector expenditure,
and strong public and private sector investment activity (including new power generation
investments). This outlook is contingent on continued high prices for Ghana's export commodities,
and actions on four fronts: (i) carrying out Government's planned investments in infrastructure,
especially the increase in thermal-electric power generation capacity and the upgrading of the power
transmission system; (ii) sustaining progress on the private sector development (PSD) agenda; (iii)
accelerating overall exports, including by reaching a consensus on a new WTO-compatible trade
agreement with the EU, and by taking steps to manage potential oil revenues; and (iv) taking actions
aimed at enhancing the efficiency of investment and raising productivity throughout the economy.
While cocoa exports have seen an almost 90 percent increase in volume since the beginning of the
decade, it has been the increase in prices for cocoa and gold that have been driving the increase in
exports revenues. The prices for these two commodities have risen considerably from the low levels
earlier in this decade, increasing by almost 90 and 150 percent for cocoa and gold, respectively, over
the last 7 years. Although it appears that the prices for these two commodities might have recently
reached a peak, if they remain at their presently high levels, these exports should continue to ensure
sustained foreign currency inflows for the foreseeable future.

14.      Also, the firm implementation of the planned investments in power generation capacity
is critical to sustain the projected real GDP growth. This outlook assumes that power supplies are
raised above pre-load management already in 2008. This increase in capacity is projected to result
from a combination of improvements in the financial position of the power utility companies,
increased water levels at the Akosombo dam, and new thermal-electric generation capacity, including
those to be installed to tap gas flowing from the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP). Tariffs would
need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect the higher costs of return thermo-electric power generation.

15.      The drive to increase infrastructure investments should be part and parcel of the
actions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of investment and raising productivity throughout
the economy. This is important because at present growth is being driven primarily by factor
accumulation, as reflected in a rising investment to GDP ratio, with increases in productivity having
only a secondary effect. This trend cannot be sustained, however. Growth driven exclusively by
capital accumulation loses momentum because of declining marginal productivity of capital.
Sustained increases in aggregate investment are consistent with long term growth, however, if
coupled with improvements in productivity, since the causality runs from increased productivity to
opportunities for investments that, in turn, lead to higher growth rates.

                                  Box 2: Highlights of the 2008 Budget Proposal

 The theme of the 2008 budget statement is `a brighter future' based on peace, security and democracy. In
 addition, there is the potential of future oil revenues; and the continued strong economic growth, leading to progress
 toward achieving the MDGs, as well as actions aimed at prevailing over the energy crisis and other infrastructure
 bottlenecks. This `brighter future" budget predicated on real GDP growth accelerating to 7.0 percent (17 percent
 growth in nominal terms), translating into 24 percent increase in tax revenues. When extraordinary revenues are added,
 overall domestic revenues are projected to increase to 29.2 percent of GDP, up from an estimated outturn of 22.4
 percent of GDP in 2007. Donor funding for the budget are projected to rise by 20 percent, including a 150 percent
 increase in project grants over the estimated outturn for 2007 and a 40 percent increase in project and program loans.
 The proceeds from divestitures and borrowing are then included under total revenues, providing GH¢276 million (1.7
 percent of GDP) in divestiture receipts5 and GH¢516 million (3.2 percent of GDP) from the proceeds from foreign
 borrowing (adding to over 10 percent of the budget). The greatest revenue innovation is the introduction of a one-
 pesewa per minute excise duty on mobile phone call. The new excise duty replaces the import duties and import VAT
 currently imposed on imported mobile phones, and is designed as one of the sources of funding for the National Youth
 Employment Program (NYEP).

 Total expenditures under the 2008 budget proposal are set to increase by 17 percent, rising by over GH¢1 billion
 (6 percent of GDP) over 2007 projected budget outcome, in part due to exceptional domestic and foreign financed
 capital expenditure. There are some notable expenditure items in the 2008 budget: GH¢365 million for energy
 investments; another GH¢160 million for crude oil purchases (around 1.0 percent of projected 2008 GDP), up from the
 GH¢ 161 million already spend for that purpose in 2007; and GH¢ 1.6 billion for personnel emoluments. While the
 budget proposal brings the ratio of personnel emoluments to GDP down to 9.6 percent, it is important to note that the
 budget projections still imply a 17 percent nominal increase in the public sector payroll over the 2007 budget outturn,
 and a 7 percent real increase. Also, the share of the budget devoted to poverty reduction expenditures is projected to
 decline sharply from planned level of 41 percent in 2006 to 31 percent in 2008. This relative decline in poverty
 reducing expenditures reflects primarily the sharp rise in share of public investments (both foreign and domestically
 financed), which are in the budget proposal set to more than double as a share of GDP, rising from just under 5 percent
 of GDP to over 10 percent. Two other expenditure items that are set to rise are the expenditures of the District
 Assembly Common Fund (DACF) and the interest paid on public debt. The increase in spending of the DACF reflects
 the increase in the Government's contribution to the fund from 5 to 7.5 percent of tax revenues, leading to an additional
 GH¢71 million in expenditures by local governments, while the rise in interest payments on public debt results from the
 rise in the domestic debt stock to GDP to 16 percent by end-2007, up from 17 percent at end 2005.

 Which are the new expenditure programs in the 2008 budget proposal? The bulk of the new expenditures in the
 2008 budget go to the Ministry of Energy, which will receive an additional GH¢495 million (just under 5 percent of
 GDP) over its 2007 budget allocation.6 Also, the Ministry of Health receives an additional GH¢188 million increase, or
 the equivalent to a 33 percent rise over the 2007 budget. The Ministry of Education receives an additional GH¢133
 million, or a 12 percent increase over the 2007 budget, while the Ministry of Transport receives an additional GH¢118
 million, in large part to fund a major initiative to improve feeder roads. Lastly, the Electoral Commission receives an
 additional GH¢4 million, raising its budget for the 2008 election to GH¢36 million.

 Issues to be monitored during the implementation of the 2008 budget include the performance of the economy
 and the realization of the revenue projections. The budget proposal is predicated on the sustained increase in real
 GDP growth, bolstered primarily by high commodity prices (especially gold), the stimulus of government spending,
 and the ongoing construction and banking booms. The revenue projections included in the budget are also very upbeat,
 notwithstanding the revenue shortfalls experienced in 2006 and 2007. Tax revenues are expected to grow by 24 percent
 over 2007 levels (higher therefore than the nominal GDP growth of 17 percent). Also, despite the underperformance of
 official program and project grants in 2006 and 2007, the 2008 budget is predicated on large increases in these revenue
 items.




5Divesture receipts are projected to come primarily from the reduction in State participation in: the Ghana Oil Company (GOIL),
the Ghana Telecom Limited Company (Ghana Telecom), and the Western Telesystems Company (Westel).
6Note that the increase in budget allocation to the Ministry of Energy includes GH¢360 million from the proceeds of the
Eurobonds and from divestitures.

16.       Actions to be considered in enhancing the efficiency of investments include improving
efficiency in the allocation of resources for public investments by:

          Strengthening the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), so that attention
          focuses on aggregate and sectoral budget ceilings. A stronger MTEF would call on sector
          ministries to take responsibility for managing their portfolios within an aggregate fiscal
          strategy and collectively agreed priorities. While the Ghanaian government already has an
          MTEF in place, there appears to be a disconnect between the detailed MTEF activities that
          accompany the budget proposal and the ability to allocate in practice resources to the
          activities identified in the MTEF document. At the aggregate level the MTEF provides
          medium-term information and includes indicative totals for individual sector ministries by
          source of funding. However, the estimates for sector ministries contain information on the
          upcoming budget year only and they do not provide detailed information on indicative
          forward expenditures by activity. At the same time, the sector strategies underpinning the
          MTEF are not clearly set out. As a result, planning of allocations seems to be largely a
          mechanistic process. Non-discretionary expenditure items (primarily, personal emoluments
          and administration) for programs and activities are prioritized separately from those
          expenditures that are more discretionary (primarily, services and investment);7

          Ensuring adequate pricing for the provision of infrastructure services. At present water
          and sanitation services in rural areas are the only public utility services that cover recurrent
          costs through tariff revenues, while capital costs are covered by a combination of community
          contributions (5 percent), contributions from the district assemblies (5 percent), government
          budget allocations and external grants and concessional loans. The tariffs for other services
          (electricity and urban water and sanitation) are not yet set at levels sufficient to cover
          recurrent costs, and only a fraction of their capital costs are covered by grants and
          concessional loans. As a result, these public utility companies operate in chronic deficit,
          impacting the quality of the services provided and their long term sustainability. In the wake
          of another scale up in infrastructure investment attention needs to be given to ensuring that
          the benchmark rates of return that guide the levels for utility tariffs are set at an adequate
          level.

          Screening public investment proposals, requiring that project selection is guided by clearly
          defined priorities, and the preparation of pre-feasibility studies, including the calculation of
          net present social value using either cost-benefits or minimal costs analysis. These steps
          should allow funds to flow on the margin to projects with the highest rate of return or the
          lowest cost of delivery to beneficiaries;

          Broadening oversight over the finances of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and over
          external borrowing by (i) having the State Enterprise Commission (SEC) submit to MoFEP
          quarterly consolidated reports on the financial position of SOEs ­ at present the SEC receives
          only individual SOE reports, but does not consolidate them; and by (ii) updating quarterly the




7 These weaknesses are ultimately a reflection of capacity constraints at the sector ministry level. Whilst there have been
improvements in the process of review at the sector ministry level, analytical capacity constraints mean that many medium-term
sector strategies are not fully costed and realistically incorporated into the forward budget estimates, particularly with multi-year
investment expenditures, and help to strengthen the process of expenditure prioritization. At the same time, in-year reductions in
allocations in one year have an impact on the reliability of the estimates for forward years.

          appendix 17 of the budget statement, providing information on the Government of Ghana's
          guaranteed loans (projects and programs); and

          Making greater use of public-private partnership agreements for large infrastructure
          projects, while protecting public finances by adequately provisioning for the guarantees
          provided. The issuance of public guarantees is particularly important because with the
          completion of HIPC and MDRI there are renewed opportunities for Ghana to borrow from
          international capital markets, especially in an environment of ample external liquidity.
          Although the Ghanaian debt management is considered to have only moderate debt reporting
          problems, improvements will be needed in integrating debt management into the budget and
          increasing controls over borrowing by state-owned enterprises, especially from the domestic
          banking system. Also, there is the need to better track and provision of guarantees, as there
          have been several instances where under-provisioned guarantees have entailed unplanned
          budget expenditures.

17.       Actions to increase the efficiency in the allocation of public investments, including by
opening scope for attracting the private sector into new areas are important because, although
Ghana has made good progress in improving the environment for private sector development, there is
still scope for deepening these reforms. Ghana's current ranking in the Doing Business report (87th)
reflects the balance between high rankings in the time required to register property (26th) and in the
protection of the rights of investors (33rd), as well as low rankings in the time required to register new
businesses (138th), and in the time required to deal with licenses (140th). The closer examination of
individual rankings suggest therefore that there is potential to move up the rankings by deepening
recent reforms, such as in the time required to register new businesses, as well as by tackling new
areas of reform, such as the cost of employing workers and the time required for dealing with
licenses.     The latter is particularly important if Ghana aims at attracting new Foreign Direct
Investments in areas such as energy, mining and telecommunications.

18.       Lastly, the sustainability of real GDP growth is contingent on sustaining and
accelerating overall export growth. Over the last few years the growth of Ghanaian exports have
not kept pace with overall GDP growth, so they are projected to account for around 27 percent of
GDP in 2007 , down from 35 percent in 2000. It is therefore the domestic economy that is currently
fuelling most of the growth, and, given the size of the Ghanaian economy, increasing export growth
and broadening its base are essential for sustaining and accelerating growth. Gold exports have done
particularly well in recent years due to higher world market prices. Also, while the growth of non-
traditional exports has averaged around 15 percent over the last 10 years, many of these exports are
dependent on a WTO-compatible trade agreement that continues providing preferential access to EU
markets.8




8 On December 13, 2007, Ghana and the EU initialed an interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) aimed at avoiding
serious trade disruption between the parties when the preferential trade system of the Cotonou Agreement came to an end on
December 21, 2007.

19.      Crude oil exports provide the best opportunity for accelerating Ghana's exports, even
under the conservatives assumptions used in the Bank's economic projections.9 These projections
indicate that by 2010 Ghana's crude oil exports could reach just under US$2.0 billion, rising to
around US$3.2 billion in 2012 and remaining at that level until 2021 before declining back to US$2.0
billion in 2023 and dwindling down to almost zero by 2030. The fiscal revenues associated with
these crude oil exports are also estimated conservatively at around US$700 million already in 2010,
rising to US$3.0 billion by 2013 before beginning a gradual decline in 2022. These revenues are the
combination of the 5 percent royalty that the Government of Ghana is entitled, plus dividends,
GNPC's share in profits, and a 35 percent income tax on oil producing companies. All these sources
of income to the State account for around 40 percent of crude oil exports and over 50 percent of net
profits from oil exploration. The realization of this scenario requires however that steps be taken to
ensure a transparent and accountable petroleum revenue system. The Government is aware of these
developments and has remained an active participant in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), having organized in late February 2008 the "National Forum on Oil" with the
support of the World Bank and the IMF, along with other development partners (e.g., Norway, the
World Bank; GTZ; USAID; AfDB; the Commonwealth Secretariat and DFID), which discussed,
inter alia, the fiscal management of petroleum revenues and how to include the treatment of
petroleum revenues in its forthcoming Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL).

20.      Assuming that actions aimed at increasing exports and at raising the efficiency of
investments are implemented, the projected growth outlook would be supported by rising
exports and maintaining investment to GDP ratios at present levels.. National savings are
projected to recover to historical levels, meeting over three quarters of the investment needs by 2011.
While the difference between savings and investment ratio suggests a relatively small contribution
from external savings, it is important to note that estimates of public sector savings include official
transfers in the form of grants, as well as HIPC and MDRI debt relief. If one excludes official
transfers, however, the external current account gap would average around 16.0 percent of GDP for
the 2008-10 period, meaning a projected overall external financing requirement during this projection
period averaging US$3.0 billion.               After accounting for donor project and program assistance
(including an annual average of just under US$300 million in HIPC and MDRI debt relief), another
US$700 million on average would be provided by concessional loans, leaving an average financing
gap of around US$2.0 billion for the 2008-10 period, which is expected to be covered by private
transfers (e.g. remittances), additional project financing and additional budget support from
development agencies, as well as non-concessional funds from the capital markets and project
financing from official export credit agencies.

21.      It is because of this positive outlook, the country's strong institutions, and the
supportive business environment that Ghana's policy framework is assessed as adequate for
the purpose of the proposed operation. The IMF's assessment letter (annex 4) commends the
country's authorities for their willingness to balance last year's pre-election fiscal slippages with a
tighter planned budget for 2008, and countervailing monetary policy. The targeted overall fiscal
deficit to GDP ratio in the 2008 budget is 6 percent, down from an estimated 9.0 percent outcome in
2007. To achieve the fiscal target, the IMF notes, additional fiscal measures aimed at containing
further increases in the wage bill and ensuring a closer alignment between end-user electricity tariffs



9These projections are based on information from recent offshore discoveries made by Tullow Oil and Kosmos Energy in mid-
2007 for which there is already 90 percent confidence. Recoverable reserves estimated by Tullow range between 150-200
million barrels (mmbbl) on the low side and 1,300 mmbbl on the high side.

and cost recovery levels are required. To address possible expenditure overruns in both wages and
transfers to state-owned enterprises in the energy sector, the ongoing technical assistance program of
the IMF envisions joint work with the Bank and other development agencies operating in Accra
aimed at strengthening the Government's own efforts to improve public expenditure and financial
management, as well capacity building in areas such as aid coordination, monetary forecasting, debt
management, and statistics.

C.        Poverty Trends and Progress in Social and Human Development

22.       Data from the 2006 Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLLS-5) indicates a continuing
decline in poverty, with the poverty headcount falling to 28.5 percent by 2006, down from 39.5
percent in 1998 (Table 4).10 The 11 percent decline in poverty appears to have been unevenly
distributed across the country, however. Most of the poverty reduction was concentrated in the
Forest region (both urban and rural), while the Northern Savannah region, which was already by far
the poorest of the ecological zones, appears to have been left behind in the national poverty reduction
trend. Even though the poverty headcount index in the Northern Savannah region was smaller in
2006 than in 1998, the national trends in poverty resulted in increasing the share of the poor living in
the rural savannah areas. While the rural savannah areas accounted for only one-fourth of the
population in 2006, it accounted for just over fifty percent of the poor.

23.       The faster decline in poverty headcount in the Forest region does not appear to have
been accompanied by a significant increase in inequality elsewhere in the country. The national
Gini coefficient rose to 0.39, up from 0.38 in 1998 and 0.35 in 1991. While the upper echelons of the
population benefited from very large gains in consumption, and the very poor had lower gains than
the rest of the population, these gains were positive, nevertheless. When examining the growth
incidence curve, one observes that the pattern of gains was equitable from the second to the ninth
decile, suggesting that only those in the top most decile had gained more than the rest of the
population. Every year the share of the population living in poverty was thus reduced by about 1.5
percentage point, on average, meaning that about 2.5 million people were lifted out of poverty thanks
to growth. Moreover, the absolute number of the poor decreased from 7.2 million in 1998 and 6.2
million in 2006.



10 The poverty lines were estimated using the cost of basic needs method in order to pay for a food basket providing 2900
kilocalories per adult equivalent, while also covering the cost of basic non-foods needs. The poverty line was estimated at
900,000 Cedis per adult equivalent per year in constant prices of Accra in January 1999, with appropriate deflators for the other
regions of the country.

24.                      Given Ghana's track record of growth and poverty reduction, projections suggest that
real GDP growth rates equivalent or higher than 5 percent would suffice to allow the country
to meet the MDG goal of halving the 1990 rate of poverty incidence well before the 2015 target
date. It is important to note that these growth projections assume that the pace of urbanization will
continue, yielding a similar reduction in poverty as the one observed during the 1998-2006 period.
As shown in Figure 2, which depicts three projections for poverty reduction, Ghana would achieve
the MDG target of halving poverty earlier than the MDG target date even under a moderate per
capita GDP growth scenario (real GDP growth of 5.0 percent). Under a lower real GDP growth
scenario (average real GDP growth of 3 percent), however, Ghana would fall short of meeting the
MDG poverty target by less than one percent, indicating that there is a premium to preserving GDP
growth rates at close to present levels.

25.                      While the current growth pattern is likely to yield further progress in poverty
reduction, there are reasons to be concerned that this path might be interrupted by the recent
rise in food prices. Over the last few months there has been acceleration in food price inflation,
with increases in some cases above and beyond what would have been expected as a result of regular
seasonal price variations. The sharpest increases have occurred in food items that account for a large
share of the Ghanaian consumer price index. For instance, between January and February 2007 and
the same period in 2008 the price for maize was up by 52.1 percent, millet 17.9 percent and bread
10.0 percent. While rising food prices pose a traditional policy dilemma ­ disadvantaging net food
consumers (the very poorest), but benefiting net food producers, who are more likely to respond by
increasing food supplies, the current developments create an even more complex predicament. The
increase in food price inflation is part of a broader increase in commodity prices, and has, as a result,
led to increases in imported food prices, as well as increases in the prices of agricultural inputs
(notably fertilizers). There is the need therefore for policies aimed both at mitigating the impact of
higher food prices on poorer households, as well helping remove bottlenecks that might impede the
necessary supply response by agriculture producers.




                                                          - 14 -

26.     A response to these developments is important because, all else equal, estimates suggest
that the poverty headcount could increase, even if temporarily, by as much as 5 percent. The
actions that are being considered to protect the consumption levels of the poorest are aimed primarily
at guarding existing social safety net expenditures and improving their targeting. These actions
include: (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and strengthening a centralized early warning
system for food insecurity; (ii) targeting the most vulnerable in food insecure areas under the
government's recently established conditional cash transfer program (Livelihood Empowerment
Against Poverty ­ LEAP); and (iii) ensuring access to health care services for the poorest of the poor
by continuing to provide a percentage of them with a premium exemption for registration in the
NHIS.

27.     These measures aimed at protecting the consumption level of the poorest are
particularly important in the Northern regions of Ghana, which have already been affected by
two shocks in 2007 and 2008 -- a drought and heavy floods. This paragraph describes the social
protection measures that Government has outlined, while other measures are described in the
Government's program in the agricultural development policy credit.          The first step taken by
Government has been to form an inter-ministerial Rapid Response Task Force to monitor the food
security situation, agree on a common targeting framework and coordinate interventions. This inter-
ministerial committee is key to ensure a smooth and well targeted response. Also, as described
above, two initial sets of policy interventions have been agreed upon by Government.             First,
Government intends to change the criteria of the existing conditional cash transfer program (LEAP)
so that its reach is scaled up to 11 new districts. This change in the LEAP program will bring the
overall coverage of the program to 61 districts and an additional 20,000 households protected by the
program. The selection of these new districts would focus on districts with high vulnerability,
particularly in terms of food insecurity. All participating households must agree to keep their
children in school and vaccinated while ensuring that their families are registered in the National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). The rapid assessment presently being undertaken by the World
Food Program will be used to complement the existing targeting method, developed under LEAP.
To ensure that sufficient capacity exists for this scale up, DFID and UNICEF are providing the
program with substantial technical assistance and civil society actors will also be drawn upon to
support the identification of the most vulnerable groups in food insecure districts. The second policy
intervention outlined by Government is to expand the scope of the community-based health and
nutrition services and provide those at risk of malnutrition with a food supplement in the form of a
take home ration. This program, already under implementation in the 19 districts most affected by
the floods, will be scaled up to the remaining districts of the North by the end of 2008 and address
those populations that could be most severely impacted by the price rises ­ namely children under the
age of two and pregnant and lactating women. This scaling up of the program will ensure that
nutritional status and growth rates do not suffer as a consequence of the shock. The Government
estimates that this intervention will reach an additional 66,500 children between the ages of 6 and 23
months and 124,500 pregnant and lactating women. The Government is committed to engaging civil
society actors and community groups to support both of these rapid responses and ensure that the
most vulnerable groups are identified, staff trained in sites for proposed scale up and baselines and
robust monitoring carried out. The third intervention entails expanding the benefits of the NHIS to
better protect women. This intervention is key to ensure that maternal mortality does not increase
further at a time when higher food prices will reduce the income of the poorest and, as a result, limit
access to health care.

   3.      GHANA'S GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (GPRS II)

28.     Ghana launched the preparation of its second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS II) in September 2004, through a consultative process, leading to the submission to
Parliament in October 2005. The full GPRS II was discussed with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in February 2006, and considered by the Boards of these institutions in
June 2006. A Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) for the 2006 Annual Progress Report (APR) on the
implementation of the GPRS II is being distributed alongside this program document.

29.     The GPRS II is guided by the stated objective of achieving middle income status by
2015, entailing a real GDP growth of at least 6 percent per annum. Higher growth rates are expected
to reflect a positive social change and improvements in the quality of life for everyone. The growth
rate targets are defined therefore taking cognizance of the targets set out in the NEPAD agreement
and the MDGs. The GPRS II updates the strategy laid out in the first GPRS in 2003 with a
strengthened focus on growth across three strategic pillars:

      Accelerating private sector led growth and poverty reduction by assisting the private sector
      to grow and generate employment. Achieving these objectives will be aided by actions
      aimed at consolidating the macroeconomic stability achieved during the implementation of
      GPRS I and at enhancing private sector competitiveness. Special attention will be given to the
      pursuit of prudent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies, which are recognized in the
      GPRS II both for the immediate macroeconomic benefits, and for the longer term goals of
      facilitating private access to capital, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. Stable
      exchange rates, single-digit inflation, and lower interest rates are important for fostering a
      supportive investment climate, while sustained growth is the thrust of the strategy for further
      poverty reduction.

      Investing in vigorous human resource development to ensure the development of a
      knowledgeable, well-trained and disciplined labor force.              Areas of focus include: (i)
      education and skill development, (ii) access to health care, malaria control, HIV/AIDS
      prevention and treatment, (iii) access to safe water and adequate sanitation, (iv) housing and
      slum upgrading, and (v) population management.

      Encouraging good governance and civic responsibility by empowering state and non-state
      entities to participate in the development process and collaborate in promoting peace and
      political stability. The overarching objectives are guaranteeing fundamental human rights,
      peace and security to all Ghanaians, and strengthening the decentralization and public sector
      reform with a view to sustaining the rule of law. Some of the pillars for achieving these
      objectives are (i) building an efficient and well-motivated public sector; (ii) improving the
      existing institutional and legislative framework; (iii) integrating traditional authorities into
      formal institutional structures; and (iv) fostering civic responsibility.

30.     The GPRS II is explicit in stating that the envisaged funding is insufficient to finance
the entire development plan. The funding pledged by development partners is therefore expected
to complement the additional external funding recently obtained from international capital markets.
This observation is important because the sustainability of the government's borrowing from
nonconcessional sources is predicated on maintaining macroeconomic stability, underscoring the
need to continuously monitor macroeconomic developments and ensure that public and external debt
remain on a sustainable path.



                                                 - 16 -

31.     The main contribution of the GPRS II is in articulating the country's renewed focus on
growth and the priority attached to structural transformation, especially in agriculture given
its potential role in ensuring pro-poor growth. More work is still needed, however, in translating
this broad policy framework in a strategic, time bound, monitorable set of actions and results. Also,
while the GPRS II seeks to ensure consistency between sector strategies, the treatment of different
sectors and activities in the document itself is uneven, and could better reflect their weights in the
economy, as well as the complexity of the issues involved. More attention could be given in the
document to infrastructure and mining, as well as to important issues in macroeconomic management
and private sector access to finance, which is understood as one of the main constraints to private
sector-led growth. However, as the GPRS II is considered a `living document', the agenda moving
forward appears to be focused on creating an enabling environment for private sector-led growth,
clarifying the role of Government in the economy, and the reduction of regional and socioeconomic
disparities.


                         4.       WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GPRS II

A.      Links to the Country Assistance Strategy

32.     The PRSC is central to the Bank's 2007 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and more
broadly the Africa Action Plan. The 2007 CAS envisions a series of single-tranche Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), providing continued support to a selected set of policies and
reforms articulated in the Government's GPRS II. These PRSCs would in turn complement sector
budget support operations in agriculture, decentralization, social protection, and environment and
natural resource management, as well as investment operations in education, health, private sector
development, energy, roads, telecommunications, water and other infrastructure operations. The
PRSCs also represent the Bank's contribution to the MDBS. Given the PRSCs' cross-cutting focus,
they leverage the poverty emphasis of several sector focused operations, ensuring appropriate
expenditure allocation (level and structure) and addressing some of the financing implications of
proposed policy actions (notably, capitation grants and the removal of school fees, the deployment of
teachers and health care professional to under-served areas, and the implementation of an inclusive
health insurance scheme). Furthermore, the PRSCs encourage institutional development by centering
their support on issues related to budget design and execution, as well as on monitoring poverty
outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver results in terms of human development indicators.
By helping to internalize these monitoring functions, the expectation is that the allocation of
resources will increasingly reflect the feedback from these results.

B.      Results Achieved Under Previous PRSCs

33.     There were several achievements during the implementation of the first five PRSCs,
which are described below according to the component of the program. The first component of
the PRSCs reflects the objective of ensuring progress on macroeconomic stability and pro-poor
growth. Most of the results under this component reflect buoyant growth and poverty reduction, as
well as prudent macroeconomic management during the implementation of GPRS I, yielding
increased availability of credit to the private sector, with the share of private sector in total domestic
credit projected to reach 67 percent in 2007, up from around 47 percent in 2002. There was also a
decline in the time required for business registration, falling to 45 days in 2007, down from 129 days
reported in 2002. While this is a reduction of almost 85 days, the average time to register new
business in Ghana is still among the highest in the region, underscoring the importance of continuing



                                                - 17 -

to make progress on this front. This positive business climate has translated in turn in the strong
performance of exports and in the country's ability to draw on foreign savings, by taping the
international capital market, attracting external investors to its domestic bond market, and continuing
to receive large remittance inflows from Ghanaians living abroad. Lastly, progress was achieved in
the implementation of the petroleum deregulation program, allowing the importation of crude oil and
refined products through competitive tendering under the supervision of an independent regulatory
agency ­ the National Petroleum Tender Board (NPTB). As part of the deregulation process, there
was a re-alignment of domestic petroleum retail prices.

34.      The second component of the program supported by the PRSCs focuses on measures
aimed at assisting Ghana reach key MDG goals by improving service delivery in education,
health, and social protection. Under this component progress is reported in increasing access to
health and education services. The share of supervised maternal deliveries rose to 54 percent by
2005, up from 49 percent in 2002, with particularly marked increases in the deprived regions
(Central, Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions). There was also an increase in the Gross
Primary Enrolment Rate which reached 93.7 percent in the 2006-07 academic year, up from 81
percent in the 2002-03. Finally, there was a further decline in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among
pregnant women, dropping to 2.6 percent in 2007, down from 3.6 percent in 2002.

35.      The third component was based on the fifth pillar of the GPRS I, incorporating actions
designed to strengthen governance and public sector management.                                  Progress under this
component was reported primarily in strengthening public financial management, with improvements
in budget coverage, timelier external auditing of the accounts of the consolidated fund, and in the
implementation of new public procurement and internal audit legislation. The budget coverage was
broadened to include more information on internally generated funds and external grants, including
HIPC and MDRI grants. External audit reports became timelier, with the annual report by the
Accountant General being submitted to Parliament within less of 12 months of the closing of the
accounts. There was also progress in implementing the new public procurement law, with increased
coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the tender review boards, and, under the
auspices of the new internal audit agency law, the number of government ministries, departments and
agencies submitting internal audit reports began rising.

C.       Coordination with Other Development Agencies and the IMF

36.      The PRSC is part of a concerted effort with development agencies grouped around the
Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS).11 The MDBS aims at reducing the Government's
transaction costs in dealing with development assistance by ensuring greater complementarity
between this assistance and the Government's own poverty reduction strategy.12 Over the last four
years development partners have followed through with this commitment by carrying out joint
MDBS/PRSC missions, advancing agreements on policy actions and the timing of assessment
reviews. Over the last four years, these development partners have also agreed with the Government




11In addition to the World Bank, the following development partners participate in the MDBS: the African Development Bank;
Canada; France; Denmark; Japan, the European Union; Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and the United Kingdom. The
United States and the UN agencies participate as observers. A copy of the new draft of the MDBS Framework Memorandum is
attached as Annex 1.

of Ghana on a joint matrix of policy actions to be supported by MDBS, aligning almost all aspects of
their monitoring and evaluation frameworks.13

37.       Also, the present PRSC is being prepared in close coordination with the IMF, following
the agreed institutional division of labor with the IMF taking the lead on macro-economic
issues while the Bank and the other MDBS partners take the lead on structural and social
issues. In a number of areas where the mandates of the two institutions overlap, the work is being
coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. The IMF leads the policy
dialogue on macroeconomic policies, including overall fiscal and monetary policies, while the World
Bank and the other MDBS development partners lead the policy dialogue on economic reforms in
sectors such as infrastructure (which encompasses energy, roads, telecommunications, water and
sanitation); urban and local government; agriculture and rural development; human development;
private sector development; and public sector reform.

D.        Relationship to Other Bank Operations

38.       The 2007 CAS acknowledges that the PRSCs and the two proposed sector-focused DPLs
(Agriculture and Natural Resources Environmental Governance) are key instruments for
providing budget support. Furthermore, the three operations are part and parcel of efforts across all
development agencies to improve the effectiveness of development assistance by reducing the
transaction cost in accessing development support, providing a framework for policy dialogue and
decisions linked to progress in the implementation of the GPRS II. In this context, IDA and other
development agencies have established several sector groups aimed at carrying out the dialogue at
that level, and the two proposed sector-focused DPLs are the Bank's contribution to this effort.
These operations are complemented by the PRSC, which sharpens their focus on the Government's
program outlined in the national budget and, in doing so, aims at elevating critical policy issues to the
Ministry of Finance and, ultimately, the entire Cabinet. To achieve this objective, the sector-focused
operations carryout the sector dialogue, while the PRSCs focus, inter alia, on issues with
macroeconomic and budgetary implications.                       For instance, the PRSC-6 focuses on estimating
benchmarks for agriculture expenditure, and at developing inter-sectoral coordination in environment
and natural resource management, as well as to monitor the budget execution in selected pilot MDAs
(including the budgets for the ministries of Food and Agriculture and Forestry, Lands and Mines).
To respond to the opportunities presented by the rise in food prices to the agricultural sector in
Ghana, the agricultural sector budget support is being provided with an additional amount of SDR6.8
million (US$10 million equivalent). These additional resources will support the Government in
providing a framework to ensure that farmers have the adequate inputs for the planting season, as
well as providing financing for a public works program during the dry season for farmers to rebuild
damaged irrigation systems and thus improve productivity in future years. In addition, several other
investment operations directly complement the PRSCs by providing financial support and technical
assistance in areas ranging from health, private sector development, energy, roads,
telecommunications, water and sanitation, and other infrastructure operations.                                Specific Bank



13The most recent development in the alignment between the MDBS and the PRSC has been the Bank's decision to skip the next
tranche of the MDBS (MDBS 2007), so it could bring to bear the depth of its sectoral expertise to the workings of the MDBS
policy matrix for 2008. It is important to note that with this decision to skip the next installment of the MDBS there would also
be a modification in schedules. The Bank would, under this new schedule, disburse within the year of the assessment, while the
other MDBS agencies would remain operating within the existing schedule, which allows them to inform government about their
contribution to the budget prior to the government's budget proposal being submitted to Parliament. The principles of one
common policy matrix agreed with government, and a joint assessment of this policy matrix remain unchanged, therefore.

interventions include the Ghana Energy Development and Access project (GEDAP ­ US$120
million; FY08-12), the Land Administration project (LAP ­ US$20.5 million; FY03-08), the
Economic Management Capacity Building project (EMCB ­ US$25 million; FY06-11), and the
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise project (MSME ­ US$ 45 million; FY06-10) focusing on
catalytic interventions in some sectors through demonstration effect, project incubation, and training,
along with targeted enabling environment interventions that should help trigger further private sector
development.

E.      Lessons Learned

39.     There are two important lessons to be drawn from the implementation of the PRSCs:
the importance of `ownership' of the reform program for the satisfactory implementation of
the country's poverty reduction strategy, and the very high returns to the Government of
Ghana from the harmonization among development partners around the MDBS framework.
The Government's ownership of the program supported by the PRSCs evolved in three distinct
phases. In the first phase Government led the preparation of the Ghana Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRS), while the development partners seized on this opportunity to draw up
the new instrument for development assistance in Ghana ­ the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support
(MDBS). The second phase involved developing sector strategies aligned with the GPRS that would
provide operational guidance for the implementation of the GPRS, as well as focus on the dialogue
with the development partners. Sector strategies completed during this phase include, inter alia, the
Power Sector Reform Strategy, the Private Sector Development Strategy, the Education Sector
Development Strategy, and the revised Food and Agriculture Sector Development Strategy. The
third phase is ongoing and builds on the two earlier phases. It involves relying on the Ghanaian
Government taking a stronger leadership in the dialogue, drawing on these strategies to define the
content and focus of the policy matrix.

40.     A second lesson has been the acknowledgement of the very high returns from
harmonization among development partners around the MDBS framework. Over the last five
years the structure of the MDBS has evolved to mitigate transaction costs that usually arise in multi-
donor settings. The problems associated with coordination were addressed by delegating the policy
dialogue to sector-specific groups aimed at reaching agreements over a narrower set of issues and
amongst a smaller group of participants. Also, the MDBS reduced the cost of collective action by
devising rules that allowed all the participating agencies to have a role in the decision-making
process, and, in doing so, encouraging these agencies to increase the share of their contribution
coming through the MDBS, rather than large projects and off-budget disbursements. While there
was less success in reaching a settled view on how to reduce so-called measurement costs, several
important developments were made in trying to resolve the measurement problem. These included
the use of means of verification for triggers in the policy matrix (the Progress Assessment
Framework), agreeing with Government on outcome indicators that would provide a clearer
benchmark, the definition of baseline results for expected outcomes of a given policy action and of
policy actions that were more closely linked to specific outcomes.

F.       Analytical Underpinnings

41.      The design of the PRSC-6 draws on existing and ongoing work on social and economic
analysis, as well as on recently completed work on public financial management. The findings
of the recent poverty analysis included in the 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) inform
the policy directions proposed in the GPRS II, and supported by the proposed PRSC, namely the
importance of: (i) prudent management of public finances to ensure macroeconomic stability for
growth and to preserve the funding for the social sectors; (ii) investing in human capital to reduce
chronic and persistent poverty among a large number of households, especially in view of the
ongoing urbanization process, and targeting women and children in the delivery of education and
health services (including nutrition program); (iii) scaling up investments in key infrastructure
sectors, notably in energy and water; and (iv) sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for
maintaining the long term trends in growth, urbanization and poverty reduction.

42.      Analytical work on economic developments includes recent Economic and Sector Work
(ESW) on natural resource management, the electricity and petroleum sectors, youth
employment, urban development, and the CEM, as well as ongoing work on job creation and
skill development and on the investment climate. The work on natural resource management
includes the FY05 country study on Natural Resources Management and Growth Sustainability,
jointly prepared by Ghana's Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER), the UK's
Department for International Development (DFID) and the Bank, as well as the FY06 Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA). The CEA provides practical management and policy solutions to
address natural resources depletion and environment degradation in four sectors driving growth and
poverty reduction in Ghana: agriculture, mining, forestry and wildlife, and urban development.

43.      The proposed PRSC-6 also draws on the FY08 Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM) entitled Ghana: Meeting the Challenge of Accelerated and Shared Growth. The report
focuses on steps to be considered to reach the Government's stated goal of attaining middle-income
status by 2015. It documents how the recent growth acceleration results from the combination of
high commodity prices, improvements in the general economic policy environment, and the
upgrading in the investment climate. These pre-conditions are important because, while past growth
was driven mainly by factor accumulation, more recently there is indication of gradual productivity
increases, including from small, privately owned cocoa farms. The CEM highlights the importance
of sustaining the fundamentals, especially macroeconomic stability, value-for-money and enhancing
efficiency across public sector activities, and targeting specific growth bottlenecks. Prominent
among the latter is the need to scale up investments in key infrastructure, notably energy and water
and sanitations, as well as for accompanying policy, regulatory and institutional reforms in public
utilities, as well as raising productivity, especially in agriculture.

44.      Ongoing and existing analytical work on fiduciary arrangements set out action plans for
improvements in public financial management, providing important input for the design of the
proposed PRSC.          The FY07 and FY08 External Reviews of Public Financial Management
(ERPFM) assessed favorably recent developments in Ghana, underscoring greater aggregate fiscal
discipline and the increased predictability of the budget, while noting the challenges involved in
implementing the new regulatory framework for public financial management ­ the new Financial
Administration Act, the new Public Procurement Act and the new Internal Audit Act ­ and in
integrating public sector staffing and salary decisions into the budget process. The FY08 ERPFM
updates the results of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework.



                                                 - 21 -

These ERPFMs have built on the findings of earlier work on public expenditure management (PEM),
as well as the work of the FY04 CFAA and the FY03 CPAR, that have guided the agenda pursued by
the PRSCs.      These earlier studies reviewed national procedures for budgeting, payroll and
expenditure control, accounting, auditing, and compliance with existing procurement procedures.

           5.      THE PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


A.      Rationale and Objectives

45.     The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-6) is the third in a second
series of four annual operations supporting the implementation of the Ghana Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II), in line with the 2007 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) and the Africa Action Plan (AAP). The proposed PRSC-6 continues to focus on
selected reforms to: (i) accelerate private sector-led growth, (ii) develop human resources, and
(iii) promote good governance. While the PRSC-6 support would translate primarily into
funding for the GPRS II implementation, particular attention is given to leveraging the poverty
emphasis of sector focused operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and
structure) and addressing the financing implications of some policy actions, notably existing
social protection programs aimed at preserving the consumption levels of the poorest. These
programs include: (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and strengthening a centralized early
warning system for food insecurity, (ii) targeting the most vulnerable in food insecure areas under
the government's recently established conditional cash transfer program (Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty ­ LEAP; and (iii) ensuring access to health care services for the
poorest of the poor by continuing to provide a percentage of them with a premium exemption for
registration in the NHIS. Institutions related to public financial management (PFM) also receive
particular attention since robust PFM is critical to ensure the attainment of the GPRS II
objectives. Lastly, attention is given to monitoring poverty outcomes, ensuring that sector
programs deliver results in terms of human development indicators.

46.     The programmatic approach embedded in the PRSC series aims at providing
adaptability for step-by-step institutional reforms, capacity building involving significant
policy content, and an economy-wide scope that goes beyond the scope of individual
projects. This programmatic approach envisioned under the PRSC process is grounded in clear
country commitment and capacity to reform, structured in a series of operations supporting a
medium-term reform program, and disbursed on the basis of completed actions.

B.      Overall Progress in Implementing the Program Supported by PRSC-6

47.     The overall progress in meeting the proposed prior actions for the PRSC-6 has been
broadly satisfactory. Significant progress has been achieved in increasing enrollment at the primary
education level, especially among girls, in increasing the coverage of ITNs, and in increasing
expenditures on public education and health. Also, the country is laying the groundwork for further
improving the business environment, deepening its decentralization efforts and improving its public
financial management systems. However, the financial situation of the power utility companies
(VRA and ECG) was allowed to deteriorate further in the first 9 months of 2007, and only in the
latter part of year did actions begin to be implemented to reverse this situation. These actions were
particularly important in view of the rising crude oil prices and the further delays in completing the

    West Africa Gas Pipeline. The progress report in meeting the proposed prior actions for this
    operation is summarized in Table 5, and then explained in greater detail further below, which also
    outlines recent developments and overall progress in implementing the overall program supported by
    the PRSC-6.

48.      Progress has been broadly satisfactory in meeting all but one of the original triggers for
this operation. As a result, the total amount for this proposed operation reflects a reduction of SDR
6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent) in the original PRSC-6 credit amount, plus a SDR6.8 million
(US$10 million equivalent) addition aimed at helping the Government protect the implementation of
social programs in the face of rising food prices.


49.      Actions already carried out by Government include the following:


Payroll management and control

         Re-centralizing the authority to hire staff into the public service.                             With the
         implementation of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database II (IPPD-2) several MDAs
         were given the responsibility for inputting data into the system, which was operating online
         and accessible to the 8 pilot MDAs (including some MDAs with large payrolls). The IPPD-
         2's authorizing environment proved to be weak, however, because the information inputted
         by the pilot MDAs was not subject to outside verification, leading to a loss of control over
         hiring decisions.

         Carrying out a census (headcount) of public servants to determine actual staff force and
         the number of ghost-workers in the payroll. The final results indicated that at end-2007
         the overall staff force was 455,000 employees, of which about 7,200 employees could not be
         accounted for. Amongst the employees that could not be accounted: 1,018 were employees
         that had already retired but remained on the payroll; 434 were deceased employees that had
         not yet been removed from the payroll; and 450 were employees that had vacated their posts.
         These 1,902 former employees were therefore promptly deleted from the payroll. Amongst
         the remaining 5,362 employees: 2,558 employees had been transferred without their records
         having been updated; 1,624 were on approved leave at the time of the census headcount; and
         1,180 had not yet been located. Further analysis therefore is being made to inform the
         actions regarding these employees.

Energy

         Raising electricity tariffs for non-residential and residential consumers. In May 2007
         the country's independent public utility regulator (PURC) raised tariffs for non-residential
         consumers by around 20 percent, and then again on November 1, 2007, by 35 percent on
         average. Electricity tariffs for residential consumers were raised once only, from November
         1, 2007, and by between 35 and 175 percent, depending on the customer's electricity
         consumption levels. In the process of adjusting tariffs, the tariff band for low consumption
         customers (so called lifeline tariff customers) was widened, lowering their average residential
         tariff increase from 44 to 35 percent.,15 The end-2007 adjustment in electricity tariffs was
         important because estimates suggest that prior to the adjustments electricity tariffs covered



15It is important to note that the gazetted electricity tariff adjustment on November 1, 2007, was in addition to a 20
percent average increase that had already been gazetted in November 1, 2006, but not yet implemented. As a result,
end-user tariffs for low-voltage electricity users (both residential as well as commercial/industrial) are now set at
around US$ cents 17 to 20/kWh -- levels never attained in the past, and which are likely to dampen consumption.
Also, the structure of the new tariffs is becoming more progressive, with an aim of encouraging energy
conservation.

          just over three-quarters of the cost of electricity generation (excluding financial costs).
          However, the delay in completing the West Africa Gas Pipeline and the rising price of the
          crude oil used for thermal-electric power generation, which is estimated to account at present
          for around 50 percent of the country's total power supply, up from just under one-third two
          years ago, continuously shifts the goal of reaching full cost recovery tariffs. For these
          reasons, the Government is considering the measures outline in Box 3 below.

          Providing additional transfers to the power utility companies. Notwithstanding the
          transfers from the budget to the power utility companies made already in 2007, including
          around GH¢100 million in transfers to compensate VRA for the difference between the
          weighted average cost of electricity production in Ghana and bulk power supply provided to
          VALCO in 2006 and the GH¢343 million in equity contribution to compensate for the delay
          in raising electricity tariffs, the financing needs of the power utility companies are projected
          to increase in 2008, especially in a scenario of crude oil prices at US$100 per barrel or more.
          In the 2008 budget the Government allocated US$160 million to help finance crude oil
          imports for its thermal-electric generation plants.



                         Box 3: . Power Sector Reforms Currently Under Preparation

The utility regulator (the Public Utility Regulatory Commission -- PURC) is currently reviewing the
electricity tariffs for non-residential consumers. The Government anticipates that there will be a sharp rise in
electricity tariffs for some non-residential customers that are paying well-below cost recovery rates, particularly the
mining industry. While the exact amount of the adjustment is still to be defined by the PURC, the Government's
objective is that, with this adjustment, tariffs for these costumers will be brought as close as possible to full cost
recovery, significantly reducing the subsidy for crude oil purchases currently provided by the Ministry of Finance to
the power sector.

The Government is also seeking to engage consultants to prepare the power sector Financial Recovery
Program (FRP). The Government is seeking proposals by end-May/early June for consultants to prepare the FRP.
The work of the consultant would include a review of the operational and financial performance of the two main
power utility companies (VRA and ECG); and make recommendations for their financial restructuring and recovery,
as well as propose measures to improve their corporate governance and operational efficiency.


50.       While these actions have contributed toward increasing the revenues of the power
utility companies, there are still several unresolved problems. The power utility companies are
still unable to meet current expenditures from tariff revenues, not least because of the rising crude oil
prices and the delays in completing the West Africa Gas Pipeline. In this context, funding is stil
needed for new investments and maintenance, as well as a resolution to the backlog of past debts that
carries high financial costs. Resolving the problem resulting from the backlog of past debts is
important both because of its spiralling financial costs, as well as the fact that it constrains fiscal
space of these utility companies to carryout the needed investment programs in energy generation,
transmission and distribution. To address these problems, the Government is considering a series of
short term measures, as well as outlining an energy sector financial recovery strategy. In the
immediate short run the Government is considering the following measures: (i) refinancing of VRA's
short term debt with longer term, less expensive funds; (ii) raising the bulk supply electricity tariff
for non-residential consumers consuming over 300 MW per month, so that tariffs for these costumers
will be brought as close as possible to full cost recovery; (iii) ensuring that additional power
generation capacity will come online from 2011 onwards. The financial recovery strategy would
include the following initiatives: (i) setting formal financial and operational performance targets for


                                                       - 29 -

ECG and VRA to ensure their progressive return to commercial viability; and (ii) achieving standard
public utility financial performance targets (e.g. rate of return on assets, internal funding of a part of
their investment program, etc).

51.      Taking action to address these problems is important because Ghana's power sector has
become one of the country's main constraints to attaining higher growth rates, as well as being
a burden on public finances. The prolonged periods of power outages last year are estimated to
have trimmed real GDP growth rates by between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage points. Also, transfers from
the budget to VRA in 2007, in the form of fuel and equipment purchases, are estimated to have
reached GH¢343 million,16 in addition to around GH¢200 million accumulated in arrears to creditors
and suppliers. Despite the substantial increase in electricity tariffs in late 2007, it is expected that
budget transfers to the power sector will still remain significant in 2008 and could reach over
GH¢300 million if crude oil remains at or above US$100 and natural gas remain unavailable.17

52.      There are other reasons why the power sector will continue to pose a critical challenge
on the country's intended path to attain middle income status sometime in the next decade.
Electricity demand growth is robust (over 8 percent p.a.) and due to underinvestment in the past,
there is no reserve margin in the supply system to provide a cushion against either droughts or plant
breakdowns. In a scenario of sustained real GDP growth, power shortages could reappear as soon as
2009, placing a premium on the Government's ability to come to closure on private power projects.
At present, the main difficulty in reaching an agreement with these independent power producers is
the lack of a solvent buyer for the power produced, since neither ECG nor VRA can be considered a
creditworthy counterparty to an agreement. The Government is reluctant however to offer sovereign
guarantees to private project developers. This might prove to be unavoidable. Thus in the absence of
financial closure on new private generation plants and to avoid a return to load shedding, the
Government may little choice but to procure additional generators using public funds.18

Fiscal Responsibility Legislation

53.      The government is also considering introducing fiscal responsibility legislation
encompassing a variety of fiscal rules and administrative/managerial processes aimed at
ensuring better discipline and efficiency at all levels of government. The key elements of this
proposed fiscal responsibility legislation would include: (i) ceilings on public debt or debt service,
expenditure, or budget balances, expressed in actual or cyclically-adjusted terms; and (ii) escape
clauses allowing for deviations from fiscal targets under exceptional circumstances. The purpose of
this legislation is to: (i) set out fiscal targets and fiscal principles for the State; (ii) make it a goal for
the Government to pursue its policy objectives in accordance with those fiscal targets and fiscal
principles; (iii) provide for reports on departures from those fiscal targets and fiscal principles to be
prepared by the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning and outlining possible corrective
measures whenever fiscal targets are missed. The overall purpose of this legislation would be to
underscore Ghana's commitment to fiscal discipline and debt sustainability.




16Estimates from the VRA 2007 draft financial statement.
17These estimates do not allow for a possible worsening of the hydrological conditions in the Volta River basin.
18Time is of the essence in making this decision given the long lead times needed in the supply of power generators,
especially in the prevailing market conditions.

Private Sector Development, Finance, Agriculture and Natural Resource Management

54.     These recent actions on the fiscal and the energy fronts complement the Government's
program for private sector-led growth, vigorous human development and governance and civic
responsibility outlined in the GPRS II. While all the prior actions under the program have been
completed, the implementation of the program has also uncovered many of the challenges that lie
ahead. Maintaining the current economic expansion will require broadening of the country's
economic base and consolidating the country's fiscal position.            Broadening the country's
economic base is important because it is still very narrow, with strong dependence on the
performance of exports of primary commodities, especially cocoa and gold earnings.
Consolidating the fiscal position is essential because, as a small, open economy, Ghana is subject
to external shocks, such as oil price hikes and fluctuations in the prices of primary commodities
that tend to be magnified whenever there are weaknesses in fiscal management. While the
country has made recent efforts to reduce its vulnerability to external shocks through measures to
diversify its export base and strengthen its fiscal management, there is still scope for further
progress on both fronts. In particular, progress is still need in reducing sources of fiscal pressure
resulting from below cost-recovery tariffs in electricity (although the recent tariff increases go a
long way toward mitigating the problem) and in keeping wage bill increases within the budgeted
ceilings.

55.     In 2007, there was progress in the following areas of the program aimed at accelerating
private sector-led growth:

        Reducing the number of days to register business, the time required to move goods
        across borders, the number of days spent on resolving commercial disputes, and in
        increasing ratio between domestic credit to the private sector and GDP. All four
        indicators exceeded their respective targets for 2006, with significant improvements over
        2005 levels. The reduction in the time required to export and import was reduced to 21 and
        42 days, respectively, down from 47 and 55 days in 2005, thanks to customs procedures
        having been simplified and a remote entry system for customs declarations now being fully
        operational. As a result, Ghana moved up in the Bank's ease of doing business ranking,
        rising from 102nd in 2005 to 94th out of 175 countries in 2006 and 87th out of 178 in 2007, and
       has been rated among the top 10 reformers on the ease of doing business for the last two
        years.

       Strengthening the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluate changes in the
       environment for private sector development with a customized ease of doing business
       survey. The methodology for a customized ease of doing business survey was developed
       and applied in a pilot survey to measure progress on private sector development reforms,
       with the measurement focusing on the time required to register new businesses and the time
       required to export and import. The methodology is expected to be revised further and in
       future be applied to all ten indicators of the ease of doing business survey. This survey will
       be carried our regularly and will be fully integrated into the Monitoring and Evaluation
       system of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, Private Sector Development and PSI's
       (MoTIPSD+PSI). Also, information was provided to the effect that the time required to
       register new businesses at the Register's General Department (RGD) has been reduced from
       14 to 10 days, with further substantial reductions expected after the installation of new

        software. The online registration of new businesses should become available in Accra within
        the foreseeable future.

        Finalizing and submitting to Cabinet an irrigation policy document, consistent with the
        Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP). The new irrigation policy
        defines clearer rules for operations and maintenance of irrigation facilities, and enshrines the
        role of water user associations in the management of irrigation schemes, giving them greater
        responsibility and control over the management and maintenance of secondary structures for
        irrigation. As a follow up step, about 280 farmers from 14 irrigation schemes were provided
        with training in Joint Irrigation System Management (JISM). Also, civil works for the
        rehabilitation of irrigation schemes have been completed at: Weija, Aveyime, Afife, Kpando
        Torkor, Sata and Akumadan, Tanoso and Subinja, and Bontanga.

        Improving the predictability of the revenues of the Forestry Commission (FC) by
        removing any legal impediments to revenue collection, enhancing transparency and
        accountability in financial management of the FC. These actions should also increase the
        budget execution of the FC and the collection and distribution of revenue to all stakeholders.
        The former is important because over the last five years the Forestry Commission has
        consistently missed its revenue targets, collecting on average around two-thirds of the
        expected revenues. The under-collection of forestry revenues reflects delays in carrying out
        surveys of the areas eligible for logging, including the demarcation and inventory of trees in
        the areas eligible for new timber utilization contracts (TUCs), which are essential for the
        calculation of the timer right fees (TRF) that will be used for to determine the value of these
        TUCs.

Human Development

56.     Progress was also made under the program for vigorous human development,
reinforcing the gains achieved in previous years in raising primary enrolment, especially in
deprived areas, in improving the implementation of health programs, and in broadening access
to water and sanitation. The actions completed in 2007 aim at addressing the following
challenges. In education there is a need to sustain the recent progress in increasing enrollment
rates and raising the quality of education. In health, the challenges range from increasing funding
and scaling up exiting programs (e.g., malaria rollback, National Health Insurance Scheme,
immunization programs) to stemming the `brain drain' and rebalancing the unequal distribution of
health staff across the country. In water and sanitation, the challenge is to broaden access by making
interventions programmatic rather than piece meal.

57.     Specific actions completed in the human development program during 2007 and early
2008 include the following:

Education

            Sustaining the rise in the national Gross Primary Enrolment Rate (GPER), with the
            GPER increasing to 93.7 percent in the academic year 2006/07, up from 92.1 percent
            in 2005/06 and 87.5 percent in 2004/05, while the national Gender Parity Index (GPI)
            rose to 0.96 in 2006/07, compared to 0.95 in 2005/06 and 0.93 in 2004/05 (Table 6).

     Reducing the number of primary students either dropping out from school or repeating
     grades, with the poll of drop outs and repeater students reaching just below 80,000 over the
     2001-2006 period, down from over 120,000 during 1997 to 2002. The decline in drop out
     and repeater students is due to the overall increase in the average level of income during this
     period, as well as the introduction of capitation grants. While the pool of repeater and drop
     out students at the primary level is still relatively small (less than 3 percent of enrollees),
     more still needs to be done to address the problem. Priority attention needs to be given to
     students with sporadic attendance, at greater risk of dropping out because of low
     achievement, and students reaching those grades with historically high levels of drop outs.
     For instance, tracking surveys indicate the highest rate of drop outs and repeaters (29.8
     percent) in grades 4 and 5, while grades 2 and 3 record the lowest level of drop outs and
     repetition (8.8 percent).

     Increasing the in per student expenditure on public primary education to US$101 in
     2006, up from US$90 in 2005, with per capita expenditures rising by 12 percent, or almost
     twice the rate of the expansion in student enrollment ­ 6.7 percent.

     Increasing the execution rate of budgeted non-salary expenditures to 98 percent in
     2006, up from 92 percent in 2005, ensuring that resources necessary for effective teaching
     and learning are sustained.

     Establishing five Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) to specialize in the training of
     mathematics and science teachers. Five new TTCs were completed in time for the 2007-08
     academic year, providing teachers with the opportunity to upgrade their teaching skills.




                                            - 33 -

Health

         Increasing spending on the item 3 of the Health Budget (services), rising to GH¢ 13
         million in 2006, up from 9 million in 2005 ­ a 45 percent nominal increase and a 34
         percent real increase. This action is important because historically increased spending on
         primary health care has translated primarily in an increase in spending on wages and salaries
         for health care professionals. To reach the MDGs, this increase in spending on wages and
         salaries for health care professionals now needs to be matched by an increase in spending on
         the item three of the health budget, allowing greater availability of vaccines and
         pharmaceutical drugs, especially as Ghana embarks on new and more expensive HIV/AIDS
         treatment strategies (ARV).

         Increasing the utilization of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITNs) by children under 5
         years, rising to 22 percent nationally, up from 3.5 in 2003. As a result, there was a further
         decline in the malaria case fatality to 2.1 percent, down from 2.3 in 2005, 2.5 in 2004, 3.6 in
         2003 and 3.7 percent in 2002. This progress is important because malaria remains the
         leading cause of morbidity in Ghana, accounting for about 40 percent of outpatient
         attendance, and a leading cause of death, especially among children under five years of age
         and pregnant women. Malaria is also more than a health problem because it adversely affects
         productivity throughout the economy, leading to lost workdays due to illness and taxing
         households and medical facilities with the cost of treatment.

         Increasing the number of people registered in the National Health Insurance Scheme
         (NHIS) to 9.8 million (48 percent of the population) in the first 6 months of 2007, up
         from 7.7 million (39 percent of the population) at end-2006..19 Also, the number of
         number of registered NHIS participants with ID cards almost doubled during this same
         period, rising to 6.5 million people (66 percent of those registered) by mid-2007, up from 3.9
         million (51 percent of those registered) at end-2006. Among those registered, the share of
         elderly (70 years and older) and indigents rose during this period from 7.85 to 9.0 percent.

         Stemming the brain drain among health care professional. To address the human
         resource crisis stemming from an increase in demand in health services at a time of shortages
         in health care professionals ­ a problem that has been exacerbated by the brain drain, the
         Government of Ghana has, for the past five years been implementing multiple strategies,
         including expanding the number of health care training institutions, enhancing salaries of
         health professionals and advocating for an ethical approach to international recruitment of
         health staff. There are now 7 new Health Assistant Training Schools (HATS), in addition to
         the already existing number of training schools, and bringing the overall intake of health care
         trainees up to 1,020 from of 444. As a result, 2,316 health care professional that graduated in
         2006 have been deployed throughout the country. The breakdown of graduates is provided in
         Table 7:




19The regional breakdown of the coverage is as follows: Brong Ahafo Region continues to lead with 72 percent
coverage; Northern Region 58 percent; Central Region 55 percent; Ashanti Region 51 percent; Eastern Region 51
percent; Upper West Region 47 percent, and Greater Accra Region, at 24 percent, records the lowest coverage.

       Scaling up the immunization program, eradicating polio and eliminating measles as public
       health problems. Documentation for certification of Ghana as a polio-free country has been
       accepted by the Africa Regional Commission on Polio certification. For the past three years
       measles cases have fallen below 500 and no deaths have been reported for the past four years.

Water and Sanitation

58.    Broadening access to water and sanitation is the most important infrastructure
investment for achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs). There is a direct link
between access to safe water and safe sanitation and health outcomes. The MDGs, which are based
on 1990 figures, call therefore for halving the world's population without access to improved water
by the year 2015, and without sanitation by 2020. In the case of Ghana, this means that about 6
million more people need to gain access to water and 9 million to sanitation. To meet this challenge,
the program supported by the PRSC-6 focused on making the water and sanitation program more
programmatic.    The new focus entailed: (i) approving the new National Water Program; (ii)
developing the 5-year Sector Investment Plan (SIP) for Rural Water; and (iii) taking steps to begin
updating the 5-year investment plan for Urban Water.

59.    The NWP was approved by Cabinet on June 21, 2007, and steps are being taken to
operationalize this policy and use it as a basis for moving towards a more programmatic
approach to planning and implementation. The rural water investment plan has been developed
and approved by the Community Water and Sanitation Association (CWSA) board, and discussed
and agreed between the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing (MWRWH) and the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP). The plan is now to be submitted for Cabinet
approval. Also, a consultant has been selected to prepare the urban water investment plan and the
contract has been signed. It is expected that the work will be completed by February 2008, in time to
inform the 2009 budget preparation process. This ten-year urban investment plan will be used to
derive a five-year medium-term investment plan.            The Government acknowledges that the
implementation of these investment plans for the urban and rural sector will demand strengthening
the capacity in the Water Department of the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing
(MWRWH).

60.    These actions implemented with the support of the PRSC-6 are important because of
the need to increase investments in water and sanitation services. In the urban water supply
system, investments are being made on the Kwanyaku water supply system, which is expected to
increase water output from the present 3 million gallons a day to 6 million gallons a day when
completed and make potable water available to about 700,000 people. In the rural water supply
system the indicators for investment in water facilities have shown a decline recently, interrupting the

steady increase in new investments that occurred during the implementation of the GPRS I. While
the figures for 2007 show a recovery in the number of new investments, with increases in new and
renovated boreholes, and expansions in small towns pipe systems, an increase in investments is
required if the MDGs are to be achieved (Table 8).

Governance, Decentralization and Public Sector Reform

61.     Progress was also satisfactory under the program for good governance and civic
responsibility, with important actions completed in the areas of governance, decentralization,
public sector reform and public financial management over the last few years. This is important
because the GPRS underscores the importance of improving governance and public sector
management for the achievement of the Government's growth and poverty reduction objectives. It
identifies actions aimed at improving the efficiency, transparency and accountability of government
operations, and at refocusing public sector reforms by strengthening public sector management.
While these reforms should, within the next few years, yield considerable results, sustained efforts
are needed in four main areas: (i) opening space for non-state actors to contribute to the development
process; (ii) improving public sector performance, (ii) deepening decentralization efforts; and (iv)
strengthening public financial management processes. Actions completed under the program in 2007
and early 2008 include:

         Completing the Africa Peer Reviewer Mechanism (APRM) on governance. Ghana was
         the first in Africa to undergo the APRM, and this accomplishment has been internationally
         recognized.    While Ghana received a generally positive assessment, the APRM also
         identified the need to address a number of issues to ensure good governance, including
         removing barriers in access to land and justice and the clarification and modernization of the
         role of the chieftaincy.
         Reducing corruption and improving press freedom. Surveys by the Afrobarometer
         indicate that there has been a decline in corruption in the public service, underscoring the
         results of the Transparency International Perception of Corruption Indicator (with Ghana's
         ranking rising from 70th out of 169 countries to 69th out of 180). Meanwhile, Ghana
         continues to improve its ranking in the World Press Freedom Index, rising to the 29th
         position in 2007, ahead of South Africa (43) and Cape Verde (45), and not far behind
         Mauritius and Namibia (both tied in 25th position).

             Box 4: Ghana's Experience with Parliamentary Oversight of Public Accounts

On October 16, 2007, the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) commenced its novel procedure for
oversight of the accounts of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) under the Central Government: public
hearings based on the Auditor General's report spanning 2002 to 2005. These procedures are similar to those
established by the UK Government's Accounts Committee in 1861 to maintain a true and fair state of affairs in each
audited government department. As in the case of the UK committee, the OAC is traditionally chaired by a member
of the Opposition, with a member of the ruling party as the Ranking Member. The work of the Committee is guided
in its work by Articles 103 and 187 of the Constitution, and provisions in Order 151(2) of the Standing Orders of
Parliament. The members examine reports made by the Auditor General, and have the privileges and rights of a
High Court to enforce the attendance of witnesses to be examined under oath and to compel the production of
appropriate documents. The PAC's powers also extend abroad. In its first public hearing, spanning a two week
period, the committee examined the accounts of the Ministry of Tourism, finding several anomalies in the books and
requesting a refund of the unaccountable funds. It was, understandably, seen as a major step forward in terms of
accountability and transparency of public accounts in Ghana. The PAC also believes that implementation of public
hearings will improve efficiency within government. Another major outcome that these public hearings will have on
government will be the demand for improvements in the record keeping systems and administration of government
departments.


          Deepening decentralization efforts, with the cabinet reviewing a Comprehensive
          Decentralization Policy in March 2007 and issuing guidelines for the preparation of
          districts composite budgets to be presented alongside the National budget. The draft
          Comprehensive Decentralization Policy was prepared for wider stakeholder consultation,
          and is designed to deepen political, administrative and fiscal decentralization in Ghana and
          to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the policy of decentralization that takes into
          account people's participation. In this context, the Ministry of Local Government, Rural
          Development and the Environment trained all 138 District Planning Coordinating Units
          (DPCUs) in District Composite Budgeting to equip them with the ability to prepare their
          budgets using the MTEF format for the 2008 fiscal year.

          Increasing the funding from the budget to local governments by raising the share of the
          District Assembly's Common Fund (DACF) in overall tax revenues from 5 to 7.5 percent, as
          well as by reviewing the sharing formula of the DACF, in accordance with the Ghanaian
          Constitution.


Public Financial Management

          Continuing the implementation of BPEMS - the Government's computer-based Budget
          and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS), with the deployment of two
          additional modules (Cash Management and Accounts Receivable), and bringing the
          total number of modules deployed to five. BPEMS is expected to enhance financial
          reporting, budgetary control and reduce transaction processing time.

          Realigning the MDA treasury accounts, with the establishment of the Sub-
          Consolidated Fund Bank Accounts to cover the management of other public funds,
          including Internally Generated Funds (IGF) and Donor Funds. The six MDAs selected
          for the pilot program include the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Sports and
          Science, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ministry of Lands,
          Forestry and Mines, and Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and
          Environment.

         Continuing implementation of the new Public Procurement Act.                  The country's
         procurement procedures were assessed by the Public Procurement Board, using its Public
         Procurement Monitoring and Evaluation survey between late 2006 and early 2007. The
         survey covered 213 procurement entities. The overall picture that emerged from the survey
         was one of increasing knowledge of, and compliance with, the Public Procurement Act of
         2003, meaning that most key indicators show an improvement from 2005 to 2006.

         Making operational the Internal Audit Agency (IAA) in key MDAs, performing basic
         functions provided in the Act 658, which include ensuring financial, managerial and accurate
         operating information that is reliable and timely for MDAs and MMDAs. Internal Audit
         Units (IAUs) are now functioning in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,
         Ministry of Education and the Ghana Education Service, The Ministry of Health and the
         Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture,
         as well as in two MMDAs. The Internal Audit Agency also carried out special audit
         assignments during 2007, with the confirmation of bank account balances of the MDAs and
         MMDAs, and the monitoring of procurement compliance and the facilitation of the audit of
         the Internally Generated Funds (IGFs) of 28 public institutions, including 10 MMDAs.

C.      Proposed PRSC-7 Triggers

62.     The Bank's decision to proceed with the fourth and final operation in the ongoing PRSC
series will be informed by the degree of progress towards, or completion of, a subset of the
indicative "triggers" listed below (Table 9). The choice of triggers for PRSC-7 represents a
continuation of the programmatic framework set out in the series, as well as the program's renewed
focus on the Government's growth acceleration program. In this context, the proposed triggers are
the following:

                            Box 5: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The Government of Ghana developed the GPRS II, on the basis of which the current PRSC series was prepared,
through broad consultations on issues and challenges in promoting growth and reducing poverty. Several
workshops were carried out during the preparation of the GPRS, aiming at: (i) reviewing the draft document for
each thematic area, examining the policy actions needed to achieve the GPRS II goals; (ii) ranking and
prioritizing the proposed set of policy actions according to agreed criteria; and (iii) strengthening policy synergies
between and across sectors by identifying complementarities and overlaps.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The PRSC is part of a concerted effort with development partners grouped around the Multi-Donor Budgetary
Support (MDBS). It aims at reducing the Government's transaction costs in dealing with development assistance
by ensuring greater complementarity between this assistance and the Government's own poverty reduction
strategy. Over the last five years, development partners have followed through with this commitment by carrying
out joint MDBS/PRSC missions, advancing agreements on policy actions and the timing of assessment reviews.
Over the last four years, the development partners also agreed with the Government on a joint matrix of policy
actions to be supported by the MDBS/PRSC, aligning almost all aspects of their monitoring and evaluation
frameworks, except those regarding the use of outcome indicators as a basis for disbursement. The MDBS
endeavors to increasingly focus on the cross-cutting issues, as well as policy actions that either have economy-
wide implications or require collaboration between agencies. The MDBS agreed policy matrix combines policy-
based actions and output/outcome-oriented targets, with a column quantifying (whenever possible) the expected
outcomes. These expected outcome indicators reflect broadly the draft M&E indicators for the GPRS II and help
guide the supervision of the MDBS/PRSC and the policy dialogue that is part and parcel of this supervision.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

The timing and modality of aid is increasingly aligned with the country's needs, although this has meant that not
all development agencies follow the same schedule. While the Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)
disburse within the same year of the assessment, the other MDBS agencies operate on a schedule that allows them
to inform government about their contribution to the budget prior to the government's budget proposal being
submitted to Parliament. The Bank's schedule aims at bringing to bear the depth of its sectoral expertise to the
workings of the MDBS policy matrix, so disbursement are scheduled for the same year of the assessments.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

For the forthcoming operation (MDBS-08/PRSC-7) the proposed conditions for disbursement are limited to ten
critical actions in the implementation of the Government's program. The entire MDBS-PRSC matrix contains at
this moment 32 benchmarks, so as to capture the breath of the dialogue carried out by MDBS-PRSC. The
relatively high number of benchmarks spans many sectors and, in some cases, is very specific and detailed to
assist in monitoring progress on a range of issues.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

The reviews under the MDBS/PRSCs are timed to coincide with the completion of the government's own Annual
Progress Report (APR) of the GPRS II, helping reinforce harmonization with domestic processes and contribute
to greater predictability of financial support. As noted above, the MDBS is making a concerted effort to better
align the budget support provided with the budget cycle. The timing of the operation proposed in this program
document is designed to reinforce the ongoing effort by other MDBS development partners.

                        6.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION



A. PARTICIPATION PROCESS

63.      The design of the programmatic series, including the key reforms supported by the
proposed operation, benefited from broad stakeholder consultations conducted by the
government as part of the preparation of the GPRS II. The GPRS II consultations included: (i)
preliminary stakeholder consultations at Regional and Districts levels; (ii) policy review and hearings
with the budget divisions of each MDAs; (iii) a number of meetings to agree on budget estimates and
costing; and (iv) a National Stakeholders Forum on the final draft of the GPRS II.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS

64.      There are no significant anticipated negative environmental impacts from the activities
supported by the proposed operation and there should be beneficial effects arising from actions
aimed at strengthening the management of forestry resources. The implementation of the Cabinet-
agreed financial and policy framework for the Forestry Commission (FC) would help ensure
predictable funding for core activities of the Forestry Commission, including the demarcation and
inventory of trees in the areas eligible for new timber utilization contracts (TUCs).               The
implementation of this policy and financial framework should also strengthen transparency and
accountability in the collection and distribution of forestry revenues and raise the budget execution of
the Forestry Commission.

65.      It is important to underscore that Ghana is aware of the importance for poverty
reduction of meeting the MDGs of ensuring environmental sustainability. The GPRS II builds
on Ghana's robust environmental institutional framework and considerable capacities to set
environmental management standards. The main frameworks are the 1991 National Environmental
Policy, the 1992 National Environmental Action Plan, and the 1994 Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Act. This framework laws give an adequate reflection of the national environmental
policy objectives, seeking to reconcile economic development and natural resource conservation.
The EPA has since the late 1980s adopted environmental impact assessment as a management tool to
screen undertakings likely to pose adverse impact on the environment. Environmental screening and
assessment became legal in 1999 with the promulgation of the Environmental Assessment
Regulations (Legislative Instrument 1652) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are
recognized and applied to most development projects. Procedures have been established to screen
and evaluate all development projects and programs that have the potential to give rise to significant
social and environmental impacts. Under the country's Environmental Assessment Regulations
(Legislative Instrument 1652), an EIA is mandatory for seventeen types of activities classified as
critical.  These activities include: (i) mining, (ii) petroleum and gas field development and
exploration, (iii) construction of dams, harbors and roads, and (iv) logging and disposal of timber.

66.      The measures supported by the proposed PRSC-6 are expected to have a significant
positive impact on poverty reduction. Specifically, actions to consolidate the government's
achievements in human development (education, health, and water and sanitation) and advance
decentralization would support improvements in basic service delivery.               Actions aimed at
strengthening the business environment through the expansion of energy supply services, the removal



                                               - 42 -

of administrative barriers for business development and the encouragement of sustainable irrigation
would help promote rapid and sustained economic growth and exports. The strengthening of public
financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public
investments and service delivery. Finally, the 2004 PSIA on power sector reform informed the
operation of the potential impact of adjustments in electricity tariffs. Electricity access has increased
significantly in Ghana, reaching almost half of the population. Although electricity prices in Ghana
are lower than in neighbouring countries, the country will face more constraints in the next five years
in keeping prices affordable for poorer and more rural consumers. The study also finds that the
current tariff structure implies a higher unit tariff for consumers with the lowest consumption, and
that metering problems probably lead to an overestimation of the number of consumers being
charged lifeline tariffs. Unsurprisingly, it is estimated that, at a minimum, about 20 percent of the
lifeline `leaks' to the non-poor.

67.      Given how previous PSIAs have help inform the policy dialogue carried out under
preceding MDBS-PRSCs, this program document endeavors to identify themes for the PSIAs
that could be considered in the next MDBS-PRSC series. In environment, forestry and mining the
first steps for a PSIA are already being taken, with in-depth consultations with stakeholders and
workshops carried out as part of program preparation. The aim is to take comments and concerns of
civil society into account in a Risk and Stakeholder Analysis (as a first phase of a PSIA) that will
begin later this year (2008). The ultimate objective is to assess the broader impact of proposed
reforms on vulnerable communities, helping build broader support for the reforms in environment,
forestry and mining. Also, in education it might be worthwhile taking stock of the distributional
consequences of measures to increase access to education (e.g., capitation grants, removal of school
fees), especially to ascertain how these measures have made the distribution of public resources more
pro-poor. It would also be important to identify what other barriers exist to raising access to basic
education by poor families. The latter is particularly important because much of the recent increase
in primary school enrollment reflects areas where quick results could be obtained. Sustaining the
increase in enrollment with a view to achieve the MDG of 100 percent will require reaching out to
groups such as the disabled and children that are already part of the labor force of the informal
economy. In growth and income distribution, it would be important to examine which options could
be considered to ensure that the benefits of growth are distributed evenly across larger shares of the
population, especially those living in Northern Ghana. This work could build on the DFID study on
the drivers of growth in Northern Ghana, and support the Government's initiative to set up the
Northern Ghana Development Fund, bringing to bear international experience on these types of
initiatives, and putting together an appropriate benchmark that supports this idea while ensuring that
it doesn't create excessive distortions.

68.      The Government of Ghana recognizes the need to better comprehend the potential and
likely risks, impact and opportunities of the GPRS on the social and physical environment, so
as to develop corresponding preventive and mitigation/remediation plans.                  The Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) was designed in 2004, and introduced as a process tool to evaluate
the potential environmental (natural resources management linkage), social (poverty indicators,
livelihoods and health impacts and vulnerability impacts on the poor) and institutional (institutional
targeted impacts) effects of the GPRS and any plans or programs that may be derived. Consultations
were carried out with MDAs, CSOs, NGOs and DPs, leading to recommendations aimed at refining
policies, and giving greater focus to environmental issues in articulating strategies for sustainable
development. Specific recommendations included proposed actions on the rural environment, natural
resource management, disaster prevention, and `green' taxes and accounting. The findings from the
SEA are being used for revisions, prioritization and decision-making for the GPRS update at the



                                               - 43 -

national, regional and district levels. In the context, SEAs have been applied in discussing the GPRS
and its poverty reduction-environment linkages with 25 sector MDAs, and at the district level to
appraise the sustainability of District Medium-Term Development Plans (DMTDPs). Attention has
been given to ensuring that decentralization will not overburden local authorities when it comes to the
application of environmental regulations. This has resulted in a greater number of district assemblies
initiating revisions of their plans or planning decisions to reflect and include pro-poor and pro-
environment activities.    These revisions include incorporating interventions that are likely to
contribute to improving people's livelihoods, health and vulnerability levels and institutional
performance; supporting sustainable natural resources management options and enforcing
environmental regulations and standards.

C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

69.      The government's ongoing public financial management reforms address the fiduciary
issues identified in the latest External Review of Public Financial Management (FY08
ERPFM), as well as in the FY04 CFAA and the FY03 CPAR. Cash and commitment controls
have been strengthened, minimizing the risk of budget slippages and the accumulation of arrears.
There is now prompter reconciliation of budgetary and banking accounts: increasing frequency and
timeliness of reporting on budget execution; as well as enhanced oversight from the Auditor
General's Department, with external audit reports submitted to Parliament within less of 12 months
of the closing of the accounts, ensuring that the legal deadline is met and, as a result, more judicious
use of public resources. The budget coverage has also been broadened to include more information
on internally generated funds and donor grants. The enforcement of procurement rules, now with the
approval of the new law, is receiving increasing attention to ensure the efficient use of public funds,
as well as greater transparency and accountability. Further efforts should deliver the expected
outcomes of better value for money, and greater transparency and accountability in the management
of public expenditure. Another important step is continuing to make progress in broadening the
coverage of fiscal reports, incorporating detailed spending by statutory funds in the in-year reporting
cycle. The overall assessment, therefore, is that, while still requiring further upgrade, Ghana's
fiduciary framework is adequate for the implementation of the proposed credit.

70.      The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana in 2003. The
assessment made recommendations that the Bank of Ghana address vulnerabilities in the external
audit, financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control areas. The Ghanaian authorities have
confirmed that all of the proposed measures were implemented.

D. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

71.      Borrower and credit amount. This operation is a single tranche IDA Credit of SDR60.8
million (US$100 million equivalent) that would be made available upon Credit effectiveness, as all
prior actions have been completed prior to Board presentation.

72.      Disbursement arrangements and use of funds. The credit disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The credit amount will be disbursed
into a foreign currency account of the Borrower at Bank of Ghana that forms part of Ghana's official
foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent local currency amount will immediately be transferred to
the Ghana Government Consolidated Account of the Borrower that is used to finance budgeted
expenditures, as the credit is intended to be used to support the general government budge in the
Government's budget management and accounting system. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a
written confirmation that this transfer has been completed within 2 working days, and provide to the


                                                - 44 -

Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank reasonably requests.
Disbursements of the Credit will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to comply with the standard
negative list of excluded items that should not be financed with Bank credit proceeds. In the event
that the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement,
the equivalent amount of credit will be cancelled and the Borrower will be required to refund an
amount equal to the amount of the said payment. The administration of this credit will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. Ongoing discussions with the
Government on the overall reform program being supported by this operation will form the basis for
reporting on substantive policy issues. Fiduciary aspects and risks of this operation are discussed
elsewhere in this document.

73.     The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary assurance:

    · Foreign reserve account. The Government of Ghana will acknowledge receipt to IDA of
        the money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting of this amount in local currency
        to the Ghana Government Consolidated Account.             It is expected that there will be a
        confirmation of receipt from the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
        Planning (MoFEP).

    · Public (government) reports. The Controller and Auditor General Department is required
        by law to produce its annual report to Parliament on the public consolidated accounts within
        6 months of the financial year-end. IDA will have access to those reports.

    · Bank of Ghana. The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Ghana (BoG),
        audited in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the
        International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

74.     The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the receipt and
accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the Borrower. Upon the
Association's request, the Borrower shall: (i) have the account and the recording of amounts of the
Credit into the Borrower's budget management system audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Association, in accordance with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the
Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case not later than four
months after the date of the Association's request for such audit, a certified copy of the audit report
by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested;
and (iii) furnish to the Association such other information concerning the said account and recording
of credit amounts into the budget management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall
have reasonably requested.

E.      SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS

75.     The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) would be responsible for the
overall implementation of the proposed PRSC-6. Bank supervision will be aligned with the
activities of other donors, focusing on the year-long verification process that monitors the
implementation of the policies being supported by the PRSC/MDBS. Bank supervision would also
be aligned with the government's monitoring and evaluation of the GPRS II.

76.     During the period of implementation of the program supported by the proposed PRSC-
6 a series of reports would assist in monitoring progress: (i) quarterly reports by development


                                                - 45 -

partners on disbursements and disbursement projections; (ii) yearly reports on macroeconomic
developments, assessing progress on the implementation of the framework agreed between the
Government, the IMF, the Bank and the MDBS; (iii) monthly reports on budget expenditures with
breakdown by Ministry, Department and Agency with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of
each month, and with the breakdown for Items 1-4 of the Ghanaian budget (personnel,
administration, services, investment); (iv) quarterly reports on domestically financed poverty-related
(including HIPC and MDRI financed) expenditures; (v) joint aide-memoires at the time of joint
review missions on the performance assessment framework; and (vi) a report on progress on the
PRSC-6 policy matrix by no later than the Spring of 2009. In addition, the completion of PRSC-7
actions will be assessed in the context of the GPRS II annual progress report that will document
implementation and outcomes of its reforms.

F.       Risk and Risk Mitigation

77.      There are six main risks associated with the implementation of the reform program
supported by the PRSC-6: (1) Further delays in carrying out the needed reforms in the energy
sector, including tariff adjustments, the removal of transmission bottlenecks, and increasing power
supply capacity. The latter could result from the either the postponement in the completion of the
West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAPG), or lags in aligning electricity tariffs to the higher cost of thermal
power generation and completing investments for new thermal-electric power generation. (2) The
large size of the public sector, which might compromise the sustainability of the current economic
expansion by limiting private sector growth and by reducing the scope for fiscal management. The
latter is particularly important since a large fraction of public expenditures is incompressible in the
short run, such as payroll and pension obligations, creating the appeal of meeting expenditure
obligations through new, including non-concessional, borrowing. (3) A possible disconnect between
increased health spending and improved health due to weaknesses in the health administration. (4)
Delays in structural reforms aimed at raising productivity throughout the economy, which could
compromise long term growth prospects. These include, in addition to energy sector reform,
business environment reforms, the land administration reforms aimed at ensuring greater security of
land tenure, and natural resource management reforms designed to increase transparency in the
allocation of these resources and at ensuring the long term sustainability of natural resource assets.
(5) The risk of debt distress resulting from a slowdown in growth, because of either an external
shocks (e.g., a worsening in the terms of trade), or a disruption in the domestic economy (e.g., an
election induced increase in the public sector deficit) and an increased levels of non-concessional
borrowing. (6) Remaining fiduciary weaknesses that might limit the impact of the program and lead
to only partial funding from development partners.

78.      While the concerns about further delays in energy sector reforms remain significant,
these are partly mitigated by recent Government actions. With respect to the risk of further
delays in carrying out needed reforms in the energy sector, the increase in end-user electricity tariffs
by just under 90 percent on average in November 2007, as well as the government's proposed power
sector financial recovery plan should provide a basis for strengthening the performance of the power
utility companies by improving their operating ratios, reducing their short term debt and lowering
their arrears to suppliers and creditors. The risks associated with the large size of the public sector
are mitigated by a fact that Ghana is implementing a public sector reform program with the support
of the Economic Management Capacity Building project aimed at rightsizing public sector entities
operating in non-essential areas. The risk of widening lags between increased health spending and
health outcomes is mitigated by ongoing improvements in health administration, including the
operations of the recently established national health insurance scheme, as well as the government's


                                                - 46 -

more integrated approach to the delivery of human development services. The risk of delays in
structural reforms is reduced by stronger coordination within government, more frequent use of
evidence-based decision making and the more effective harmonization of aid efforts in the context of
the MDBS.

79.     With respect to the risk of debt distress, this is subject to continuous monitoring by the
Government of Ghana itself, as well as by the Bank and the IMF. A joint World Bank-IMF
Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) mission was recently in Accra (February 27-March 11, 2008)
with the purpose of providing practical technical assistance, including tools and guidance on
designing and implementing an effective MTDS that ensures that financing needs of the government
are met at the lowest possible cost consistent with a prudent degree of risk and with maintaining debt
sustainability. In parallel, a World Bank mission assessed the strengths and weaknesses of Ghana's
debt management operations using the Debt Management Performance Assessment Tool (DeMPA).
DeMPA provides a comprehensive and detailed assessment of debt management institutions and
practices, laying down the basis for an actionable reform program and, ultimately, better coordination
of the full array of TA providers that Ghana may wish to mobilize. These efforts are important
because the non-concessional borrowing undertaken in the fall of 2007 did not fundamentally
alter the moderate risk of debt distress assessment made in joint Bank-IMF DSA undertaken
earlier in 2007. Nevertheless, given the country's growth prospects, including the possibility of
oil exports beginning in already in 2011, and the low initial debt levels, the debt sustainability
indicators could improve in the foreseeable future, allowing the classification to come down to a
low risk of debt distress (see appendix 4). Lastly, fiduciary risks are steadily decreasing as a
result of the continued progress made in strengthening the framework for public financial
management.

           SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC-6)


Mr. Robert Zoellick
President
The World Bank

Dear Mr. Zoellick

                         LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

INTRODUCTION

   1. I am writing to request, on behalf of the Government of Ghana, a sixth Poverty
      Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-) from the International Development
      Association (IDA) to support the programmes and policy measures outlined in
      the Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II). This letter sets
      out the actions that Government will undertake over the medium term to
      implement its development agenda. The attached policy matrix based on the
      GPRS II and developed in collaboration with the World Bank team and other
      development partners under the Multi-Donor Budget Support framework
      summarises the content of this letter.

   2. Also, in view of the recent acceleration in food price inflation, Government is
      seeking further PRSC support to help mitigate the impact of these price
      increases on the consumption of the poorest.        The actions that are being
      considered aim at protecting existing social safety net expenditures and at
      improving their targeting, as well as laying the ground work for a more
      comprehensive response next fiscal year. The actions being considered include:
      (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and strengthening a centralized early
      warning system for food insecurity; (ii) targeting the most vulnerable in food


                                         - 48 -

      insecure areas through the government's recently established conditional cash
      transfer programme (Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty ­ LEAP); and (iii)
      ensuring access to health care services for the poorest of the poor by continuing
      to provide a percentage of them with a premium exemption for registration in
      the NHIS.


1.0  MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

   3. Since 2001 Government has pursued a combination of growth oriented and
      poverty reduction policies to achieve its medium to long-term goals of enhancing
      wealth creation. As a result of the prudent and sound macroeconomic policies
      that have been implemented, the economy has remained robust, despite rising
      crude oil prices in the international market, and the energy crises that hit the
      Ghanaian economy in 2006 and 2007.

   4. Government's macroeconomic policies have continued to favour and sustain the
      macroeconomic stability achieved over the last few years. These show in the
      tolerable levels of inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates, among other
      macro indicators.

1.1 Real GDP Growth

5.    Real GDP growth has increased from 3.7 percent in 2000 to a projected 6.3
   percent in 2007, down slightly from 6.4 percent achieved in 2006. The
   performance in real GDP growth translates to a per capita GDP growth from 1.1
   per cent in 2000 to about 3.7 per cent in 2007.

1.2 Inflation

6.    Consumer price inflation has declined from 40.5 percent at end 2000 to 12.7
   percent as at end 2007, up from 10.5 percent recorded at the end of 2006. The
   disinflation process came under stress especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a
   result of the pass-through of crude oil prices to domestic prices, rising food prices,
   and increases in utility tariffs. This led to the 12.7 percent inflation rate recorded at
   the end of 2007.

1.3 Private Sector Performance

7.    The robust economic activity during the year 2007 was accompanied by strong
   growth in bank credit. For the year to December 2007, banks' credit to the private
   sector grew by 59.8 percent, significantly more rapidly than 42.8 percent recorded
   for the same period in 2006. The rapid expansion in the credit portfolio of banks
   was funded mainly from increases in deposits. Time and savings deposits increased
   by 48.1 percent in 2007, compared with 27.0 percent in 2006.


                                            - 49 -

8.    The distribution of the increase in credit for the year was broad-based. The
   Services sector accounted for 27.5 percent, followed by Commerce (22.3 percent),
   Miscellaneous (18.1 percent), Construction (9.5 percent) and Manufacturing (6.2
   percent).

1.4 Interest Rates

9.    Consequent to the strategy of reducing domestic debt, there has been a marked
   reduction in domestic interest rates, with the benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill rate
   declining from 40 percent in 2000 to 10.6 percent in 2007. All other interest rates
   followed a downward trend during the period.

1.5 External Developments

10.   The external payments position proved resilient in 2007, despite the rising crude
   oil prices. Total exports recorded a 12.6 percent increase over the 2006 level, and
   total imports recorded a 20 percent growth over 2006 largely due to the rise in the
   price of imported crude oil. The current account recorded a deficit equivalent to 11
   percent of GDP, indicating a widening of the deficit from 9.0 percent in 2006. The
   overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$413.11 million, mainly on
   account of capital inflows, including proceeds from the issue of the debut
   sovereign bond on the international capital markets.

1.6 Exchange Rate Developments

11.   Although, the Ghana cedi lost some ground on the foreign exchange market, the
   market conditions were relatively stable throughout 2007. The developments in the
   nominal bilateral exchange rates of the cedi against the three core currencies ­ the
   US dollar, the pound sterling and the euro ­ show that the cedi depreciated
   against each of the currencies by 5.0, 6.9 and 17.5, percent, respectively, in 2007.
   This compares with respective depreciations of 1.1, 14.5 and 12.0 percent in 2006.

1.7 Public Debt

12.   Total public debt at the end of 2007 was 49 percent of GDP down from 51
   percent of GDP recorded in 2006 and 188.6 percent of GDP in 2000. The
   downward trend in the level of public debt is consistent with Government's
   strategy of reducing the rate of growth of the public debt, while meeting
   government financing needs to support the implementation of GPRS 2.
1.8 Fiscal Developments

13.   Despite the good revenue performance in 2007, the fiscal outturn for 2007
   indicates an overall fiscal deficit including divestiture equivalent to 8.1 percent of



                                          - 50 -

    GDP. The higher fiscal deficit was partly due to the need to resolve the energy
    crisis that hit the country from the latter part of 2006 and throughout most of
    2007. Part of the sovereign bond proceeds, equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP, was
    spent on investments to boost up infrastructure in the energy sector. The rising
    expenditure on the purchase of crude oil for energy generation in the face of rising
    crude oil prices also contributed 1.4 percent of GDP to the deficit, while a higher-
    than-budgeted wage bill also contributed about 0.8 percent of GDP.

1.9 Macroeconomic Targets And Measures For 2008

14.    In 2008, Government's strategy is to accelerate the growth agenda outlined in
    GPRS II, which stresses the importance of growth for wealth creation and
    sustainable poverty reduction.

15.    Government will continue with policies that will sustain the gains made in
    macroeconomic stability by ensuring prudent fiscal policy management; a
    monetary policy that is flexible enough to respond to external shocks, promote
    growth and ensure price stability; real interest rates that enhance effective
    mobilization of savings and make credits affordable to the private sector; and
    relatively stable real exchange rates that promote international trade.

16.    Macroeconomic policies for 2008 are designed to raise the current projected
    growth rate of 6.3 percent in 2007 to 7 percent in 2008; to continue targeting a
    single digit inflation; and preserve relative exchange rate stability, in a stable
    macroeconomic environment.

17.    There will be continued effort to enhance fiscal discipline to ensure that budget
    targets are achieved. Attention will be focused on increased revenue mobilisation;
    continued strengthening of public expenditure rationalisation and management,
    including public sector wages; and privatization of SOEs.

18.    Broad economic and financial objectives for 2008 include:
          a real GDP growth of at least 7.0 per cent ;
          an end period inflation rate of between 6.0 and 8.0 per cent;
          an average inflation of 7.0 per cent;
          accumulation of international reserves equivalent to at least three months of
          import cover; and
          an overall budget deficit of 4.0 per cent of GDP

1.10 Medium Term Challenges

19.    The main challenges facing Ghana's macroeconomic objectives are the high oil
    prices in the international market and continued delays in the completion of the
    West Africa Gas Pipeline Project. In addition, other dimensions of the energy crisis



                                           - 51 -

    still linger on, as a result of the shift in the generation mix in favour of thermal
    generation with its associated high costs. The Volta River Authority (VRA) will be
    required to purchase more cargoes of oil to operate its thermal plants in order to
    ensure continuous supply of power.          This has serious consequences for the
    country's fiscal outlook and, indeed, foreign exchange reserves.

 20.   The GPRS II remains the Government's medium term blue print for addressing
    these challenges and reforming the economy for accelerated growth.


THE REFORM PROGRAMME ­ PROGRESS AND MEASURES FOR 2008

2.0   PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS

 21.   GPRS II seeks to systematically address the structural constraints at the policy
    and institutional levels that hamper private sector competitiveness. The policy
    options that are being implemented to address these constraints include the
    following: improving Ghana's access to global and regional markets; enhancing the
    efficiency and accessibility of national markets; enhancing government capacity for
    private sector policy formulation and implementation; facilitating private sector
    access to capital; removing institutional and legal bottlenecks; and improving in the
    provision of public services.

2.1   Improving the Environment for Business

 22.   Government's agenda in 2007 was the continuation of the implementation of the
    Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy with emphasis on: reducing the
    number of days to register a business, reducing the time required to move goods
    across borders, reducing the number of days spent on resolving commercial
    disputes. The time required to export and import was reduced to 21 and 42 days,
    respectively, down from 47 and 55 days in 2005 due in part to the full deployment
    of the electronic clearance system, (the GCNet) at all customs entry/exit points. As
    a result, Ghana moved up in the Bank's ease of doing business ranking, rising from
    102nd in 2005 to 94th out of 175 countries in 2006, with the country being rated for
    the second time among the top 10 reformers on the ease of doing business.

 23.   Government, in its desire to monitor the impact of reforms in the business
    environment is customizing the ease of doing business survey for all 10 indicators.
    A pilot survey to measure progress on the time required to register new businesses
    and the time required to export and import was conducted in 2007. This survey is
    to be integrated into the Monitoring and Evaluation system of the Ministry of
    Trade, Industry, Private Sector Development and PSI's (MoTI,PSD,PSI).




                                          - 52 -

24.   In 2008, Government intends to continue the implementation of the PSD
   strategy with the adoption of a 3-year rolling work plan. Key milestones expected
   to be achieved by end year fall under reforms in trade policy, business registration,
   quality standards, judicial service reforms and investment promotion reforms.

2.2  Financial Sector

25.   Government continues to strengthen the regulatory framework in order to
   increase access and depth of financial services throughout the country. In this
   regard a Banking Amendment Act (Act 673) was passed by Parliament to allow for
   the operation and regulation of offshore banking services in Ghana. The first
   license for the operation of such services has been issued to Barclays Bank. The
   Foreign Exchange Act, allowing foreign investors to participate in the secondary
   capital market was also enacted.

26.   The currency redenomination exercise designed to reduce the transaction cost
   on the use of the cedi was also implemented successfully in 2007. As a result of
   improved climate in the financial sector coupled with robust economic activities,
   banks' credit to the private sector grew by 59.8 percent in 2007, significantly more
   rapid that 42.8 percent recorded in 2006.

27.   To further strengthen the financial sector a number of measures are being
   implemented this year. These include full automation of the Ghana Stock
   Exchange, feasibility studies for the establishment of a Commodities Exchange,
   regulatory framework for over-the-counter or unlisted securities market. In
   addition the following bills will be promulgated ­ Lenders and Borrowers Bill, Non-
   Bank Financial Institutions Bill, Municipal Finance Authority Bill and Bills and
   Cheques Bill. Government commenced the implementation of a major initiative for
   the establishment of a common National Payment System Platform with a
   biometric smartcard as a vehicle for financial inclusion of the unbanked and
   underbanked.

2.3  Expanding the Supply of Energy Services

28.   A significant amount of Government's resources and time in 2007 was spent to
   address the energy crisis that confronted the nation. The shortage of water in the
   Akosombo hydroelectric dam, the delay of operationalisation of the West Africa
   Gas Pipeline Project and rising prices of crude oil combined to strain the resources
   of the country immensely. Government was therefore compelled to implement a
   nation-wide power rationing programme for most part of the year and the
   prolonged outages is estimated to have reduced real GDP growth rate by about 0.5
   to 1.0 percentage points. In the short term Government had to procure emergency
   power plants to address the power shortages, whilst pursuing medium to long term




                                          - 53 -

   measures to ensure that the nation does not relapses into this unfortunate
   situation again.

29.   Government continues to implement measures to ensure the financial viability of
   ECG and VRA. In 2007 an estimated amount of GH¢343 million of subsidy was
   provided to VRA for procurement of fuel and equipment. In May 2007, Government
   publicly restated its commitment to moving to full cost recovery of electricity
   tariffs. In this regard the PURCs November 2006 tariff hikes were no longer
   absorbed by Government, but sequentially passed on to non-residential and
   residential consumers in May and November 2007 respectively. In addition, the
   PURC gazetted new tariffs in November 2007, raising electricity tariffs for
   residential consumers by about 60 to 175 percent depending on consumption level.
   The ever increasing crude oil prices keeps increasing the cost of electricity
   generation and worsening the financial situation of the VRA and ECG. In view of
   these developments, Government is seeking further tariff adjustment by PURC for
   non-residential consumers. This adjustment is expected to be at near cost recovery
   levels and will be implemented in May 2008. Despite these adjustments an amount
   of US$160 million has been provided in the 2008 Budget as transfers to the sector
   for purchase of crude oil and will increase significantly if the price volatility
   continuous.

30.   Significant investments are being made by Government in both ECG and VRA to
   restore their capacity to operate commercially. Out of the Bond proceeds of
   US$750 million, a significant amount of US$572.8 million has been allocated to the
   energy sector ­ VRA US$357.8 million, ECG US$155 million, and construction of Bui
   Dam US$60 million.

31.   Government's utmost priority however, is to ensure the long term viability of
   ECG and VRA and in this regard has decided to develop a Comprehensive Financial
   Recovery Plan for the two institutions. The Plan will, inter alia, seek to improve the
   operating ratios, reduce short term indebtedness, and reduce arrears to suppliers
   and creditors. The Plan will also guide Government to delineate VRA's core and
   non-core assets. The Government is in advanced stage of engaging a consultant to
   develop such a plan. Once the consultant's recommendations are ready,
   Government will review and endorse their implementation by end of 2008.

32.   It is also the intention of Government to publish a new National Energy Policy
   with an action plan and milestones for implementation. It is expected that the
   Policy will outline the formulation of a framework for contracting independent
   power producers (IPPs) in a competitive and transparent manner. A renewable
   energy bill and a regulatory framework for the development of bio-fuels and wood
   fuels will also be developed. The framework and bill will be submitted to Cabinet
   before end 2008 for approval. A National Oil and Gas Master Plan will also be




                                        - 54 -

   developed     after  extensive   consultations  with    all stakeholders,  including
   international experts in the petroleum industry.

33.   Government understands that the regulatory issues in the power sector are
   growing in complexity. The recent developments in the energy sector such as the
   discovery of commercial quantities of crude oil in Ghana, the recent energy crisis,
   and the response by private parties to invest in new generation facilities calls for
   institutional strengthening of the energy sector agencies. Government therefore
   intends to improve the governance and oversight arrangement of all the regulatory
   agencies in the sector to guide and oversee the reforms with the goal of achieving
   better management and efficiency in service delivery.

2.4  Increasing Agricultural Productivity

34.   In its desire to ensure food security for the nation, increase non-traditional
   exports and guarantee farmers' incomes, a new Food and Agriculture Sector
   Development Policy (FASDEP II) and a new Irrigation Policy based on the GPRS II
   have been developed by Government. The FASDEP II seeks to promote agricultural
   modernization, including, storage, processing, input supply, output marketing,
   irrigation, mechanization, technology development, agricultural credit, extension
   services and development of Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs). In view of recent
   developments in food prices world-wide, it has become necessary to fast-track and
   upscale the implementation of the policy in order to cushion the country against
   the adverse effects of the crisis.

35.   Some of the key expected outputs and outcomes by year 2010 are as follows:

  -  Self sufficiency in staple food production (maize, yam, cassava) and production
     of rice and cowpea increased by 10 percent and 5 percent respectively;

  -  Cultivation of 10,000 hectares additional land under irrigation;

  -  Production of agricultural non-traditional exports increased by 100 percent;

  -  50,000 youth farmers trained and provided with farm plots;

  -  Adoption of agricultural technologies increased from 10 percent to 50 percent;
     and

  -  Public-private partnership projects increased by 100 percent.

36.   Government in collaboration with the World Bank and other development
   partners has adopted a three year Development Policy Operation programme to
   support the implementation of the FASDEP II. The first year of the programme will
   focus on completion of sector policies and actions, and improved planning and



                                        - 55 -

   fiscal management. The second and third years will build on policy areas to
   increase public sector efficiency in the delivery of agricultural services, increase the
   participation  of   non-state   actors   in   agricultural  activities,  and    increase
   competiveness of export crops and the productivity of staple crops.

2.5 Improving Natural Resource Management

37.   Ghana's natural resources and the environmental sector are faced with a
   number of challenges which has limited the realisation of their full potentials and
   also threaten sustainable use of the resources. It is estimated that the equivalent
   of 9.6 percent of GDP is lost annually through unsustainable management of the
   country's forests and land resources and through health costs related to water
   supply and sanitation, and indoor and outdoor air pollution. In order to address
   these challenges, Government as a first step approved a financial framework for
   the Forestry Commission to ensure predictable funding, transparency and
   accountability in its operations. Government has also adopted a five year Natural
   Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG) Programme. This programme is
   supported by a Development Policy Operation by the World Bank and other
   development partners

38.   The objective of the NREG is to address governance issues as regards natural
   resources and environment with the overall objective of ensuring sustainable
   economic growth, poverty alleviation, increasing revenues and improving
   environmental protection. Specifically, the programme is expected to:

 -   Increase government revenues in the forestry and mining sectors;
 -   Reduce illegal logging;
 -   Reduce social conflict in the mining sector; and
 -   Reduce risks associated with climate change.

39.   The first year of the programme focuses on a set of policies and reforms in the
   inter-related sectors of forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection
   intended to (a) ensure predictable and sustainable financing of the forest and
   wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector
   revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social issues in
   forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream environment into growth

 3.0 Improving Service Delivery for Human Development

   40.Mr. President, it remains the intention of the Government of Ghana to invest in
      vigorous human resource development as a development goal in its own right
      and also to support the reforms needed to move Ghana forward in its
      development. In support of this objective, Ghana is focusing on education and
      skill development; access to health care, malaria control, HIV/AIDS prevention
      and treatment; access to safe water and adequate sanitation; housing and slum
      upgrading, and population management. Investments in basic social services ­
      education, health, safe drinking water, sanitation and decent housing have seen
      improvement and measures have been introduced to improve efficiency in
      service delivery in these areas.

3.1 Education

   41.Ghana has made good progress towards achieving the education related MDG
      targets, in particular, during the past few years. The abolition of school fees and
      introduction of the capitation grants have made a major difference and have
      created momentum in the education sector. The Education Reforms have been
      launched and implementation started in September 2007. The reforms reflect a
      high level of commitment from Government to improve efficiency and outcomes.
      Curricula and syllabi for all the core courses from basic to senior high school
      level have been developed and distributed to all schools and orientation courses
      on the use of the syllabi have already started.

   42.For the first time, the nationwide School Education Assessment (SEA) was
      successfully administered and analysed by the Ghana Education Service. The
      SEA provides a good tool to measure and improve learning outcomes. In total
      900,000 primary students in grades 2 and 4 were assessed with some
      encouraging results.

   43.Improvements are constantly being made in managing education.               In this
      regard, the Education Bill has been finalized. Management information on
      education has also seen great improvements during the period; for the first time
      Education Management Information System (EMIS) data has been processed in
      the required timeframe and in addition coverage has improved, including
      coverage of the private schools. The development of a forward looking Teacher
      Demand and Supply model has been a major achievement and is proving to be
      an excellent tool for planning purposes.




                                          - 57 -

3.1.1 Increase access to and participation in education and training

  44.Access to primary education continues to improve. Primary Gross Enrolment
     Rates (PGER) was 93.7 percent in 2006/07 academic year, up from 92.1 per
     cent in 2005/06 and 83.7 percent in 2004/05. Primary net enrolment was 81.1
     per cent in 2006/07 against the 2005/06 figure of 69.2 per cent and 59.1 per
     cent in 2004/05.

  45.Government continued to pursue, with great vigour, the flagship programmes of
     Capitation Grants and School Feeding, which have rapidly increased enrolments
     and contributed to retention of pupils. A total of GH¢14.24 million was paid as
     Capitation Grants for pupils in all public basic schools. In addition, Government
     subsidized the conduct of the Basic Education Certificate Examination with
     almost GH¢3.4 million.

  46.To accommodate the rapid increase in enrolments, Government continues to
     invest in the construction of new infrastructure. In 2007, about GH¢6.2 million
     was spent on construction of new classrooms while GH¢5.6 million worth of new
     furniture made up of school desks, teachers' and library tables and chairs were
     supplied to basic schools.

  47.Government intends to continue to improve equity and access to basic
     education, by reducing disparities in education service delivery, increasing
     resources for deprived districts and improving infrastructure in schools. The aim
     is to improve Net Enrolment Ratio at the national level from 78.6 percent to 81.6
     percent and for the deprived districts from 72.7 percent to 77.7 percent in the
     2007/08 academic year.

3.1.2 Bridge gender gap in access to education

  48.Government continued its efforts to bridge gender gaps in public basic schools,
     especially in the 15 districts with the lowest Gender Parity Index (GPI).
     Educational inputs such as stationery, uniforms and protective clothing were
     provided to needy pupils especially girls. Results achieved in 2007 were:

    Level                Baseline                 2006/07
                         2005/06            Actual          Target
    KG                     1.03               0.99           1.00

    Primary                0.95               0.96           0.97

    JSS                    0.88               0.91           0.94




                                         - 58 -

   49.A lot of gains have been made towards making education accessible for both
      boys and girls; and though the MDG target for attaining gender parity by 2005
      was missed, the GPI at the basic education level has improved over the years.
      GPI improvements were limited at the KG and Primary levels, there was
      considerable improvement at the Junior High School level. Trends over the years
      indicate that gender parity is very much attainable by 2015.

   50.Specific measures to achieve gender parity such as the deployment and training
      of female teachers and provision of sanitary facilities, will be implemented
      during the current academic year particularly in areas with low enrolment of
      girls, to enable the achievement of this objective.

3.1.3    Improve quality of teaching and learning

   51.Last year, we reported the attainment of the 2015 target of the pupil: teacher
      ratio of 35:1, however with some disparities between regions and districts. To
      correct these disparities, a number of measures to put teachers in under-served
      areas vis-à-vis the increases in enrolment (such as postings to under-served
      areas and incentive packages) has been implemented. The EMIS Census report
      for 2006/7 indicates that the PTR for deprived districts has been reduced to 36:1
      suggesting that the number of teacher vacancies in deprived districts has been
      achieved.

   52.The District Sponsorship Scheme for teachers continued to be used to secure
      the services of teachers in basic schools. Of the about 9,400 teacher trainees
      enrolled in various training colleges, 9,300 were sponsored by District Assembles
      meaning that once these trainees complete their training they are bonded to
      serve in the sponsoring districts, helping to improve PTR in deprived districts.

   53.A programme of upgrading teacher training colleges throughout the country has
      started as part of the new education reforms programme. This includes
      construction of classrooms and libraries. In addition, construction of science
      laboratories was started in 15 selected training colleges in 2007. Five of these
      were completed. Construction of the remaining 10 is ongoing.

   54.Additionally to attract teachers to remote rural areas, Government spent over
      GH¢4 million on teacher accommodation. One of the main reasons for teachers
      failing to stay in remote areas is thus being addressed.

   55.The National Service Scheme continues to provide teachers to the sector. In
      2007, of the almost 22,000 personnel posted under the Scheme, over 15,000
      were deployed as teachers to schools in remote rural areas.           Over 8,000
      volunteers were also recruited as teachers under the National Volunteer
      Programme to make up for the shortfall in teacher supply.



                                          - 59 -

   56.To improve the quality of teaching and learning for enhanced pupil and student
      achievement, regular testing of learning continued.       For the first time, the
      nationwide School Education Assessment was successfully administered and
      analysed by GES. The SEA provides a good tool to measure and improve
      learning outcomes. In total 900,000 primary students in grades 2 and 4 were
      assessed. The SEA results are currently being analysed by the Ministry.

   57.To meet the extra demands of the rapid increase in enrolments as a result of
      the implementation of capitation grants, expenditures on services were expected
      to increase. When measured, this showed that the per student expenditure in
      public primary education increased to US$101 in 2006, up from US$90 in 2005,
      with per capita expenditures rising by 12 percent, or almost twice the rate of the
      expansion in student enrollment of 6.7 percent.

   58.The execution of budgeted non-salary expenditures rose to 98 percent in 2006
      up from 92 percent in 2005. This ensured that more resources were available
      for effective teaching and learning.

   59.To further improve on the quality of teaching and learning, in-service training on
      the new curriculum for the education reforms will be provided to at least 30
      percent of teachers. Textbooks for the three core subjects will also be supplied
      to all primary schools this year. Government will target the fifty-three deprived
      districts and ensure that every pupil in primary school in these districts receives
      the three core textbooks.

3.1.4 Improve Science and Technology Education

   60.Government is continuing the programme of rehabilitating and equipping the
      fifteen Teacher Training Colleges specializing in the training of Mathematics and
      Science teachers. In 2007, construction and equipping of science laboratories
      was completed in five Teacher Training Colleges. Work on the remaining ten is
      continuing.

   61.The Education Reforms envisages a transformation of technical, vocational and
      agricultural education in terms of quality, quantity and financing.       It is the
      intention of Government to expand the scope of technical and vocational
      education and training to ensure skills development towards higher levels of
      employment, productivity and income.

   62.To this end, a Council has been set up to direct the establishment of a demand-
      driven Technical, Vocational Educational Training (TVET) system.          This will
      include the development of a competency-based curriculum in consultation with
      industry. Government is providing funding for the expansion of infrastructure at



                                         - 60 -

      these institutes. The modalities for an apprenticeship programme for graduates
      of the junior high schools who would not be able to enter the senior high school
      programme are being worked out. A costed plan for TVET as well as a costed
      programme of work for a National Apprenticeship programme will be developed
      for implementation to start this year.

3.2 Health

   63.The current health policy of Ghana, with the theme of creating wealth through
      health developed last year, has been translated into a new 5-Year Programme of
      Work (POW 2007 ­ 2011). The policy emphasizes health promotion and inter-
      sectoral action in addition to scaling up the delivery of health services within an
      overall framework of strengthening the health sector.

3.2.1 Bridge equity gaps in access to health and nutrition services

   64.To meet the equity gaps in access to health and other targets of the GPRS and
      to meet the MDGs, programmes have been implemented over the last five years
      for modernizing health care to improve access, quality, safety, treatment
      outcomes and patient experiences. The past year has seen major efforts going
      into this programme to address some of the challenges being faced by the
      sector in reaching the MDGs. As part of these measures, the High Impact Rapid
      Delivery Programme, introduced as a pilot in four regions, is planned for scaling
      up nationwide this year. The focus of this programme has been on sustaining
      the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) to reach every district,
      improving malaria case management, extending care and support services to
      People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and strengthening programme
      management for guineaworm.

   65.For the Expanded Programme of Immunisation, the intention is to have
      coverage of children fully immunised by age one, exceeding 85 percent in 2008.
      Penta-3 coverage will be used as the proxy indicator for measuring this.

   66.The outcomes of some of the above measures are that Ghana is on course to
      eradicate polio and eliminate measles. Documentation for certification of Ghana
      as a polio-free country has been accepted by the Africa Regional Commission on
      Polio Certification. For the past three years, measles cases have fallen below
      500 and no deaths from measles have been reported for the past four years.

   67.In the case of malaria, Ghana has focused on improved case management in all
      health facilities.  Home-based care is being promoted, with emphasis on
      symptoms detection and early treatment and the use of Insecticide treated nets
      has been intensified.    From various surveys undertaken, it is estimated that
      more than 36 percent of children under five years of age use Insecticide treated



                                          - 61 -

         bed nets. All of these measures have contributed to reducing malaria case
         fatality from 3.7 in 2001 to 2.1 in 2007.

    68.There has been a further decline in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among
         pregnant women, dropping to 2.6 percent in 2007, down from 3.6 percent in
         2003. The interventions being pursued are in the areas of reduction of HIV
         transmissions, providing extended care and providing support services to
         PLWHA. In 2007, 417 Voluntary Counselling and Testing/Prevention of Mother-
         to-Child Transmission (VCT/PMCT) Centres were established in 138 districts.
         The 48 Ante Retroviral Treatment sites are operational and providing services.

    69.Improvements have also been made in about 180 facilities offering
         comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care. Coverage of supervised deliveries20
         increased from 40.3 percent in 2005 to 44.5 percent in 2006 but reduced to
         35.1 percent in 2007. Investigations are on-going to identify reasons underlying
         the drop. Ante-natal coverage of 4 or more visits achieved the target of 90
         percent. Post Natal Care coverage has been around 55 percent for the past
         three years.

    70.Also during the past year, the Regenerative Health and Nutrition Programme
         which seeks to address the health risks arising from changing life-styles of
         Ghanaians, has been focused on sensitization of individuals and communities,
         establishment of agents of change within communities, schools and workplaces
         and the training of a cohort of health promotion experts. An aggressive media
         campaign is being undertaken to ensure that the message of healthy lifestyles
         including healthy eating, improved physical activity and attention to basic
         environmental practices reaches the average Ghanaian.

    71.The health sector also continued to focus on managing its human resources.
         Ghana continues to manage the human resource challenges posed by the brain
         drain. During the past five years, a multi-faceted approach has been taken
         including      expanding         training     institutions, enhancing salaries of health
         professionals and advocating for an ethical approach to international recruitment
         of health staff. For health assistants, intake has been almost tripled through
         establishment of 7 additional Health Assistant Training Schools.                  Other
         interventions include supporting training of medical officers at the Ghana College
         of Physicians and Surgeons. In 2006, 2,316 health personnel were produced
         and deployed throughout the country. The table below shows the comparative
         increase in human resource output between 2005 and 2006.

3.2.2 Ensuring Sustainable Financing Arrangements that Protect the Poor

   72.The aim of Government remains accelerating progress towards the MDGs by
      increasing in absolute terms, the spending on services (item 3 of the budget).
      Over the past year, as salaries and wages of health professionals have been
      adjusted upwards, spending on services has also increased.               Service
      expenditures increased from GH¢ 8.98 million in 2005 to GH¢ 13 million in 2006.
      This represented a 45 percent nominal increase and a 34 percent real increase.
      This, together with a budget execution rate of 71 percent, meant considerably
      more resources for health care delivery.

   73.The total respective shares of the four deprived regions of item 2
      (administration expenditures) and item 3 (services) was 64 percent of the total
      amount disbursed for these items. In addition for year 2006, the district level
      received a total of 46 percent of the health sector budget, above the target of
      42 percent. In 2008, the aim is to reach budget execution rate for services
      greater than 75 percent.

   74.Government plans to align the budget cycle of the Ghana Aids Commission to
      that of its own budget cycle to ensure that planning, budgeting and
      implementation of HIV/AIDS programmes benefit from both Government of
      Ghana funds as well as funds from development partners.        A multi-sectoral
      Annual Programme of Work will be completed and incorporated into the national
      budget.    This will include the HIV/AIDS budget allocations of at least four
      Ministries.

   75.Coverage of the National Health Insurance Scheme has been increasing rapidly.
      From a relatively small beginning in 2005, recording nearly 1.38 million ID card
      holders, the NHIS had by end 2006, registered 7.6 million of whom 3.99 million
      were ID card holders and accessing services under the scheme. By end 2007,
      total registered was 11.28 million with 8.3 million being ID card bearing
      members. The subsidy the NHIS disbursed to schemes in 2007 for exempt
      groups was about 90 million Ghana cedis up from 34.5 million Ghana cedis
      disbursed for exempt groups in 2006. These exemptions cover the indigent,
      persons under 18 years whose parents are registered members, persons aged


                                        - 63 -

      70 years and above, SSNIT pensioners and SSNIT contributors. The NHIS
      definitely is improving access of the population to health care and also ensuring
      sustainable financing arrangements for the poor.


3.3 Social Protection

3.3.1 Special Programmes for the Vulnerable and Excluded

   76.An estimated 28.5 percent of Ghanaians are poor and 14.7 percent are "extreme
      poor" and unable to meet their basic nutritional requirements even if they
      devoted their entire consumption budget to food, and possibly suffer from inter-
      generational poverty. Under the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS), the
      Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme has been launched
      to cushion people from becoming destitute.

   77.The LEAP, together with other poverty reduction interventions is to empower
      the very vulnerable in society by providing for their basic needs and get them
      out of poverty. It focuses on investments in the poor and will dovetail into
      existing poverty reduction programmes, which in the past often left out the very
      poor. By end of 2008, 7,000 extreme poor households will be receiving social
      grants on a regular basis.

   78.In addition, Government is implementing a community-based health and
      nutrition services package for children under the age of two and pregnant and
      lactating women to be delivered under the Government's Child Survival
      Program. This program addresses those populations who could be most severely
      impacted by the predicted food crisis. The program presently is beginning
      operations in the 19 districts in the Northern, Upper West and Upper East
      Regions worst affected by the floods and is planned to be scaled up to the 12
      remaining districts in these regions by the end of 2008.

   79.A supplementary feeding programme is planned as an add-on to ensure that
      malnutrition and growth rates do not suffer as a consequence of the shock.
      Beneficiaries will be those that show signs of malnutrition (estimated to be
      66,501 children between the ages of 6 and 23 months and 124,462 pregnant
      and lactating women) and will be given a take home ration. Government is
      committed to engaging civil society actors and community groups to support
      these rapid responses and ensure that the most vulnerable groups are
      identified, staff trained in sites for proposed scale up and baselines and robust
      monitoring carried out.




                                           - 64 -

  LEAP ­ what it is and how it is expected to function

The LEAP is a pilot programme, to be run over a five-year period. Under LEAP, orphaned and
vulnerable children, people above 65 years who are extremely poor and persons with severe
disabilities with no productive capacity are identified for social grants. The LEAP programme is aimed
at reducing extreme poverty, hunger and starvation among the most severely disabled and
incapacitated persons. It is also meant to empower care givers of orphans, poor mothers and
farmers to acquire skills and resources that would move them out of extreme poverty and break the
intergenerational poverty cycle. LEAP is expected to facilitate access to social services like health and
education and help provide regular meals to the extreme poor including orphans and vulnerable
children aged below 15 years, especially those affected by HIV/AIDS.

A total of GH¢ 2 million has been earmarked to be disbursed to the country's poor. Beneficiary
households would receive GH¢8 where there is one eligible member and for each additional eligible
person in the same house, an additional GH¢2 would be given up to a limit of three people. The
amount would be increased by GH¢3 for four eligible household members and above. Beneficiaries
have to satisfy conditions that include enrolling all children in the house in school and ensure that
they attend classes regularly and do not drop out. They would also have to register with the National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), have all newborn babies registered with the Birth and Deaths
Registry and ensure that no children in the household are trafficked or engaged in child labour. The
programme gives cash to enable beneficiaries spend money on their priority needs and also give
them a sense of responsibility that would boost their self-esteem.

Reactions to the LEAP programme are mixed. While some support it, others see it as a political
gimmick to woo voters. As one supporter puts it, "a responsible State supports the family for it to in
turn take care of the family in order to have a peaceful and progressive society." And as a local
newspaper puts it "Whatever the intentions of government for introducing it and whatever meanings
the opposition are reading into it, the fact remains that, there is extreme poverty among a large
percentage of the Ghanaian population. No doubt, extreme poverty is a major cause, and predictor,
of violence. Poor communities are much more likely to go to war than places where there are more
economic opportunities. This is not only common sense, but has been verified by studies and
statistical analyses". Writing in support of LEAP, the Daily Graphic however "... reminds the
government of the Chinese adage which admonishes that `it is better to help people fish than give
them fish'. The initiative will put smiles on the faces of the extremely poor households but the way
out of their predicament is to empower them to generate their own income outside the `safety net' ".

Funding for the project is from Government with additional support coming from development
partners to build the capacity of those to administer the programme. The Department of Social
Welfare is one of the implementing agencies whose capacity is being built to enable it work
effectively.

3.4 Water and Sanitation

3.4.1 Accelerate the provision of Safe Water

   80.Both the MDGs and GPRS II targets identify access to safe water as a critical
      development goal.      Safe water underpins many of the MDGs and other
      development goals. To achieve the MDG for water of 73 percent coverage,
      Ghana has to provide safe water to about 6 million people and sanitation to 9
      million people by 2015. In support of the MDGs and in line with Ghana's own
      development agenda, Government has developed and launched the National
      Water Policy ­ the framework to guide all developments in the water sector. A
      more programmatic approach is being taken in the planning and implementation
      for both rural and urban water.           In this regard, the Rural Water Sector
      Investment Plan has been completed and is awaiting approval while that for the
      Urban Water Sector is in its final draft stages.

   81.During the past year, Government continued with its programme of providing
      water to both rural and urban users. In the urban water supply system,
      investments are being made on some systems such as the Kwanyaku water
      supply system, which is expected to increase water output from the present 3
      million gallons a day to 6 million gallons a day when completed and make
      potable water available to about 700,000 people. Five other towns will have
      water works completed during the year. Eight water treatment plants will be
      rehabilitated, the Tamale Water Expansion Project and the Accra East-West
      transfer interconnection will be completed, among other projects. Discussions
      are on-going with investors to provide water in selected locations.

   82.For rural water, there was a dip in provision of new infrastructure and in the
      renovation of water facilities in 2006 and 2007, where this had in previous years
      shown a steady increase. The projected provision of boreholes for 2008 shows
      a reversal of this trend. To achieve the target of 57.0 percent access to safe
      water in 2008, almost 2,400 new boreholes will be sunk. In addition, 51 hand-
      dug wells, 84 small town pipe systems, 57 community pipe systems, 3 rain
      catchment systems and 2 spring protection systems will be constructed.

 Guineaworm Eradication

   83.Government's commitment to eradicating guineaworm has never been in
      question; more so now when Ghana appears to be on the brink of reaching this
      desired goal. As a result of concerted efforts being made, guinea worm disease
      in Ghana is now limited mostly to the Northern Region. Government has
      declared Guinea Worm disease a medical emergency requiring immediate
      reporting, prompt action to contain cases, and the provision of free medical care
      to all patients preferably in a public clinic or Case Containment Center.



                                           - 66 -

   84.During the period January-December 2007, a total of 3,358 cases were reported
      representing a 19% decrease over the 4,136 cases reported during the same
      period in 2006.The monthly incidence of guinea worm disease has been
      decreasing since April 2007.

   85.As part of measures to reduce the scourge of guineaworm especially in the
      endemic areas, Government has also commissioned a 45 million euro water
      expansion project for the Tamale Township and surrounding districts. Currently
      ongoing and targeted for completion in August 2008. When completed, the
      three most endemic districts of Tamale, Savelugu and Tolon-Kumbungu will be
      positively affected.




3.4.2 Accelerate the Provision of Adequate Sanitation

   86.On sanitation, the existing environmental sanitation policy is being updated to
      be the basis of a clear national strategy of environmental sanitation. As part of
      this process, the lead Government agencies responsible for the planning and
      coordination of environmental sanitation are developing targets, a strategy and
      an investment plan for improving access to safe sanitation.

 4.0 GOOD GOVERNANCE

   87.During the year under review, the following initiatives were implemented
      showing a deepening of Government's commitment towards good governance

4.1 Attorney General's Department

4.1.1 Improve Governance and Public Accountability

   88.In 2007, Government completed the report on the comparative analysis of the
      United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention
      on Preventing and Combating Corruption and the Ghana anti corruption
      legislative framework. Based on the outcome of this analysis, an action plan has
      been drawn up detailing the key activities to be undertaken to pass legislation to
      meet gaps which were identified to bring the legislation in consonance with
      these International Conventions.

   89.Government plans to enact a (Amendment) Bill to introduce plea bargaining in
      Criminal and Other Offences (Procedure). A Mutual Legal Assistance Bill to
      provide legal assistance to other jurisdictions on mutual basis is being
      considered by Government, principally to deal with criminal matters.

   90.Another legislation being considered is the Economic and Organised Crime Bill to
      widen the scope of the Serious Fraud office and provide for the proceeds of
      crime. The Extradition law is to be revised to make the law on extradition more
      responsive to current requirements. The Anti-Money Laundering Act 2007 (Act
      749) is now in force and the accompanying Regulations will be enacted once the
      Financial Intelligence Centre has been set up. Consideration is being given to
      amend the Whistleblower Act 2006 (Act 720) to broaden the scope of the law
      and plug loopholes. Another law being considered is the Public Officers Liability
      Bill to provide a legal basis for the conduct of public officers in the course of
      their employment.

   91.To promote better transparency and accountability, for the first time, the
      hearings of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament on the Auditor
      General's Report was held in public, which is a further step to deepening good
      governance.

   92.Furthermore in accordance with the Financial Administration Act, preparations
      are ongoing to set up a Financial Administration Court and commence
      prosecuting cases arising from of the report of the Public Accounts Committee.
      In that regard, a Bill to amend the Financial Administration Act 2003 to deal with
      legal anomalies concerned with the establishment of the Court has been passed
      by Parliament.



                                         - 68 -

4.2 Decentralization

4.2.1       Develop and Implement a coherent and comprehensive
Decentralisation Strategy

  93.   In 2007, a review of the decentralization policy was undertaken in
     collaboration with the key stakeholders including development partners and civil
     society organizations. The Policy review sought to achieve coherence by
     addressing inconsistencies resulting from the different sector perspectives on
     the decentralization policy implementation. It also focused on inter-ministerial
     coordination. The policy review is to lead to the preparation of the Strategic
     Decentralization and Local Government Reform Programme in 2008.

  94.One significant achievement during the year was the increase in the District
     Assembly Common Fund from 5 percent to 7.5 percent which is a demonstration
     of government's renewed commitment toward ensuring that decentralized
     agencies are empowered and adequately resourced to implement their own
     programmes and projects.

  95.Another major milestone which was achieved was the approval by Cabinet of
     District Development Fund (DDF). Subsequently the operational manual for the
     DDF has been prepared and the first round of MMDA assessment using the
     Functional Organization Assessment Tool (FOAT) has been completed. The
     establishment of the fund is planned for June 2008. The Administrator of the
     District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) has been instructed to set aside the
     cedi equivalent of $10m from the increase in the DACF as government's
     contribution for setting up the Fund. A Steering Committee to provide overall
     oversight for the implementation of the DDF and the FOAT has also been
     established.

  96.As part of government effort to enhance access to long term capital for
     infrastructural development,     the  Ministry  of   Local  Government,      Rural
     Development and Environment (MLGRDE) in collaboration with MOFEP has
     initiated a process to introduce Municipal Financing. This initiative aims to build
     the capacity and strengthen the financial base of the MMDAs by developing a
     formidable local government credit market. Progress made so far include
     Preparation of drafts of the Local Government Finance Bills and the Municipal
     Finance Authority and inauguration of the Steering Committee for the Municipal
     Financing.

  97.To bring coherence, coordination and focus to the fiscal decentralization efforts,
     Government has developed an Intergovernmental Fiscal Framework with a ten
     year action plan. The framework will also seek to address the issue of revenue



                                       - 69 -

      and expenditure assignments between the national level and the Metropolitan,
      Municipal and District Assemblies. The draft document has been subjected to a
      wider stakeholder consultation and has been submitted to Cabinet for approval.

   98.In 2007 the Local Government Service was officially launched by the President
      as a demonstration of government's commitment to the decentralization
      programme. Subsequently, there has been a scaling up of activities to fully
      integrate staff of the decentralized agencies. A detailed road map towards this
      end has been drawn and training has been provided to ensure that institutional
      capacities are built to facilitate the integration effort.

   99.Additionally, the Legislative Instrument for the integration of the departments
      into the MMDAs has been prepared and submitted to Cabinet. A Scheme of
      Service and Working Conditions of the Local Government Service Secretariat
      have also been completed and a draft organogram for the Local Government
      Service Secretariat has been prepared.

   100. It is expected that all these activities will be scaled up in 2008 to implement
      the decentralisation programme. The Local Government Service will recruit
      qualified personnel to fill the identified vacancies. The implementation of the
      Fiscal Framework will commence. Activities include the analysis of funding to
      District Assemblies and the development of a new accounting manual for District
      Assemblies.

4.3   Public Sector Reform

4.3.1 Increase the Capacity of the Public and Civil Service

   101. Significant progress was achieved in the implementation of the second phase
      of the sequenced prioritized Public sector reform to increase the capacity of the
      public Service for accountable, transparent, timely, efficient and effective
      performance and service delivery.

   102. Notable amongst them is the establishment of the Fair Wages and Salaries
      Commission as part of an integrated effort to reduce inequity, clarify pay
      administration and improve the wage bill predictability. Other activities
      implemented included the agenda on pay reform, including job evaluation and
      grading. In addition data systems are being used to establish a centralised
      human resource data base for recruitment postings and transfer for effective
      human resource management.

   103. A new comprehensive pay reform on the advice of the Fair Wages and
      Salaries Commission is being prepared. The final report is to be submitted for
      consideration of cabinet at the end of July 2008. Government will continue with



                                           - 70 -

      the organisational restructuring and staffing levels.   Additionally a new Civil
      service Law will be submitted to Parliament for consideration.

   104. The development of a new performance management system and a new
      Human Resource policy will be completed in 2008 to ensure that the Civil
      Service becomes more accountable and efficient in delivering timely service to
      the public. Meanwhile a memorandum is to be submitted to Cabinet on a
      Reward Management Package to facilitate the implementation of the new
      Performance Management System.

4.4   Public Financial Management

4.4.1 Improve Public Expenditure Management

   105. Government continued the implementation of its Short and Medium Term
      Action Plan (SMTAP) for Public Financial Management. Progress was made in the
      deployment of two additional modules computer-based Budget and Public
      Expenditure Management System (BPEMS), and bringing the total number of
      modules deployed to five.         There was realignment of the MDA treasury
      accounts, with the establishment of the Sub-Consolidated Fund Bank Accounts
      to cover the management of other public funds, including Internally Generated
      Funds (IGF) and Donor Funds. Implementation of the new Public Procurement
      Act continued with the assessment of the country's procurement procedures by
      the Public Procurement Authority, using the 2006 ­ 2007 Public Procurement
      Monitoring and Evaluation survey.

   106. The Internal Audit Agency (IAA) also became operational in key MDAs -
      Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of Education Science and
      Sports, and the Ghana Education Service, The Ministry of Health and the Ghana
      Health Service, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Food and
      Agriculture, and in two MMDAs. The Units performed basic functions provided in
      the Act 658, which include ensuring financial, managerial and accurate operating
      information that is reliable and timely for MDAs and MMDAs.        The IAA also
      carried out special audit assignments during 2007, with the confirmation of bank
      account balances of the MDAs and MMDAs, and the monitoring of procurement
      compliance and the facilitation of the audit of the Internally Generated Funds
      (IGFs) of 28 public institutions, including 10 MMDAs.

   107. Government will continue to strengthen its Public Financial Management
      through the implementation of SMTAP. Specifically, pay roll management will be
      strengthened by the migration of key subvented agencies (Defence, Police,
      institutions of tertiary education). Further, Government intends to improve
      budget implementation by setting benchmarks and strengthening MDA capacity
      by (i) setting up by end 2008 a budget monitoring system with the view of



                                          - 71 -

  reducing time lag between MDAs requests and CAGD releases to them in 2009,
  and (ii) establishing baseline and targets to reduce discrepancies between
  expenditure request by MDA and their updated procurement plans and cash
  forecasts. This shall be piloted in 5 key MDAs ­ MOH, MOESS, MLGRDE, MLFM,
  and MOFA.

108. The Public Procurement Authority will also continue to ensure that the
  provisions of the Public Procurement Act are fully implemented and applied, by
  using its PPME assessment covering at least 66 percent of entities and 66
  percent of total procurement by value.

  Monitoring and Evaluation

109.     Government continues to strengthen the capacity of NDPC and that of
  MDAs and MMDAs to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the GPRS II at
  all levels. The Annual Progress Report (APR) for 2007 is expected to be
  published by end May. Implementation of the GPRS II Communication Strategy
  is on-going with the preparation and dissemination of a simplified version of the
  GPRS II and of the 2006 APR.

110.     District M&E guidelines have been prepared and distributed to all MMDAs
  and officers from each of the 138 MMDAs were trained to use the guidelines to
  prepare their M&E plans. Subsequently all districts have prepared their
  respective M&E plans which have been reviewed by NDPC. Guidelines for the
  preparation of sector M&E plans have being prepared and used to train MDAs to
  prepare their own M&E plans. The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS 5) was
  completed and published.

111.     For 2008, Government will ensure the preparation of at least six sectoral
  APRs, including water, health, education and agriculture. Further, Government
  will strengthen the National Statistics Database with the approval of National
  Strategy for Development of Statistics. Further a corporate plan will be
  developed for the GSS and a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) will be
  conducted.

CONCLUSION

  112.  Mr. President, our Government has been in power for almost eight years and
    during our tenure, there has been significant improvement in the lives of our
    people. We have laid a solid foundation to propel Ghana to a middle income one
    by 2015. We believe that with continuing support from the World Bank and
    other development partners, Ghana will able to achieve this objective, eventually
    fulfilling our national development aspirations including the MDGs. We would
    have eliminated extreme poverty, ensured sustainable poverty reduction and as
    well, created the conditions for prosperity.

  113.  We thank you for supporting our fledgling democracy to begin to mature and
    it is our hope that Ghana will continue to be the beacon of hope in Sub-Saharan
    Africa.

1. PREAMBLE


1.1 This Framework Memorandum (FM) describes the common framework for the

      implementation of grant and loan agreements through the Multi-Donor Budget Support
      Programme (MDBS) to support the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II)22.

      This FM replaces the previous one between the Government of Ghana (GoG) and

      Development Partners (DPs) signed in Accra on 30 June 2003.


1.2 This FM will be supplemented by individual arrangements between each individual DP and

      the GoG. The contents in the individual funding arrangements take precedence over this

      FM. However, DPs will establish funding arrangements that are compatible with the spirit

      and provision of this FM.


1.3 This FM does not constitute an international treaty and is not intended to create legal

      committments.


1.4 Amendments to this FM can be made by way of an exchange of letters in terms accepted by

      all DPs involved in the MDBS and the GoG.


1.5 When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to follow international

      recommendations and best practices as regards budget support.

2. INTRODUCTION


2.1 The GoG and DPs consider the FM for MDBS as the common basis for support to the

    implementation of GPRS II through the GoG's budget.


2.2 MDBS is open to other DPs who might wish to participate. The decision to participate does

    not imply that all participating DPs will be providing resources in any given year.

    However, it does imply that the spirit of this arrangement will be respected. MDBS

    currently includes the African Development Bank, Canada, Denmark, the European

    Commission, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom,

    and the World Bank.


2.3 The objectives of MDBS are:

     · to provide additional and more predictable budgetary resources to implement GPRS

         II and finance fiscal actions aimed at reducing poverty, reaching the Millennium

         Development Goals (MDGs) and promoting growth;

     · to increase aid effectiveness by harmonising DPs' policies and procedures, by

         minimising transaction costs and by fostering ownership, alignment, management for

         results and mutual accountability;

     · to enhance the performance and accountability of the GoG's public financial

         management (PFM) systems;

     · to facilitate the strengthening of institutional capacity for designing and executing

         development policies;

     · to promote an accelerated implementation of policy reforms and an enhanced

         performance in service delivery in order to reach development objectives;

     · to foster domestic accountability and transparency.




                                           - 90 -

3. UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES


3.1 The GoG and DPs, to the extent compatible with their statutory mandates, consider the

    following to be the underlying principles of MDBS for this FM:

    (i)    Continuing sound macroeconomic policies and management;

    (ii)   Commitment to achieving the GPRS II objectives and MDGs;

    (iii)  Sound budgeting and PFM systems;

    (iv)   Continuing peace and respect for human rights, the rule of law, democratic

           principles, and the independence of the judiciary; and

    (v)    Good governance, accountability of the GoG to the citizenry, and integrity in public

           life, including the active fight against corruption.

    Observance of the underlying principles is considered critical for the implementation of

    this FM.


4.  PROGRESS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK


4.1 A set of growth and poverty reduction objectives, development indicators and policy

    reform measures, drawn from the GPRS II, is mutually accepted by GoG and DPs as the

    Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) and will be used by all signatories of this FM.


4.2 These development indicators and policy reform measures are referred to in this document

    as `targets'. Targets will be result-oriented, time-bound, specific, measurable, realistic,

    within the power of the GoG to achieve, and limited in number. The GoG and DPs will

    decide on the means of verification of the targets, including the necessary documentation.

    The achievement of a subset of the targets, hereafter called `triggers',will determine the

    extent to which the single component or the performance component is disbursed (see

    chapter 6).

.

4.3 DPs and GoG operate a multi-annual rolling PAF. The PAF is named by the year in which

    policy actions that are subject to assessment in the subsequent year are taken. For example,




                                              - 91 -

     if policy actions are to be carried out in `Year n', the PAF will be called `PAF n'. PAF

     targets for the outer years will be indicative.


4.4 DPs and GoG will endeavour to ensure complementarity and coordination between MDBS

     and sector budget support arrangements. While recognizing that these constitute distinct

     processes, the arrangements should be seen as mutually supportive. The MDBS policy

     dialogue will add value to and will be informed by policy dialogues at the sector level,

     including major policy objectives and issues of crosscutting nature or with significant

     macroeconomic and budgetary implications.




5.  DIALOGUE AND REVIEW PROCESS


5.1. The signatories have committed to coordinate reporting, dialogue and review missions.

     Regular dialogue among the signatories to the FM is essential for continued commitment to

     the MDBS.


5.2. The review process for MDBS will be common for all DPs. Participants will meet on a

     decided schedule, aligned with the review process of the GPRS II and the budget cycle.

     The review will be organised and chaired by the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning

     (MoFEP), and include representatives of the GoG and the MDBS partners (including

     observers). Representatives from Parliament may be invited by the GoG to participate or

     observe the review.


5.3. The review process will be guided by the work of sector groups, including the conclusions

     from existing sector-level reviews. It will use information gathered through these and other

     ongoing processes to ensure that DPs do not set up duplicative reviews. It will endeavour to

     minimise additional work.


5.4. The review will include an assessment of overall progress in implementing the GPRS II,

     including macroeconomic performance, as well as progress against the PAF.



                                               - 92 -

5.5. The overall progress in implementing the GPRS II will be assessed on the basis of the

     Annual Progress Report and other existing central documents. The assessment of

     satisfactory macroeconomic performance will be guided by an IMF instrument or

     arrangement. If the GoG is broadly on track in both areas, this `holistic assessment' will be

     considered to be positive.


5.6. In addition, the documentation for the review will include, amongst others, regular reports

     on budget execution and poverty-reducing expenditures; existing PFM reviews, including a

     selected-flows audit; the annual budget statement, and the agreed documentary evidence

     for progress achieved in the PAF.


5.7. In order to ensure a fully informed review, the GoG will submit any outstanding

     documentation to DPs prior to the review.


5.8. The GoG and DPs endeavour to have joint and regular communication with external

    stakeholders at key stages in the MDBS dialogue, including dissemination of the final PAF

    and outcomes of the annual review.


6.  DISBURSEMENT MECHANISM



6.1 The DPs' contribution consists of either a single component or two components (a base and

    a performance component) each year. Decisions on the number of components and the ratio

    between components will be left to the discretion of each DP.



6.2 The decision on the disbursement of the base component will be based on a positive

    holistic assessment (see paragraph 5.4). Neither the base nor the performance component

    will be disbursed if the holistic assessment is deemed unsatisfactory.




                                             - 93 -

6.3 Progress against the triggers will determine the extent to which the single component or the

    performance component is disbursed. When reviewing progress against the triggers, DPs

    may take account of the extent to which the trigger was achieved, the GoG's effort to

    achieve the trigger, any developments outside the control of the GoG that may have

    affected progress, and other key developments in the sector. Disbursement decisions will

    be left to the discretion of each individual DP, however DPs will try to reach a joint

    position.



6.4 In order to increase predictability and alignment with the budget cycle, DPs commit to give

    the GoG advance notice of the indicative MDBS funding for the following year, the

    amount of which will be announced directly following the completion of the respective

   PAF assessment and in time to inform the GoG's formulation of the following year's

   budget. At the same time, DPs commit to provide GoG with planned figures for their

    disbursements in the outer years. The disbursement of both components will ideally be

    made in the first four months of the following fiscal year.



6.5 Instalments will be deposited in a convertible foreign exchange account (the MDBS

    Account) in the name of the Government held at the Bank of Ghana. Within 48 hours, the

    Bank of Ghana will credit the Ghana Cedi equivalent (using the Central Bank (buying)

    exchange rate on the date of `purchase') to the Central Treasury Account for use as budget

    revenue.



6.6 The Bank of Ghana will provide documentary evidence of the amount and date of the

    foreign exchange payment to the respective DP and the Ministry of Finance and Economic

    Planning (MoFEP). MoFEP will acknowledge the amount and date of receipt of the Cedi

   equivalent in its Central Treasury Account, in writing, to the respective DP and to the co-

   chairs of the MDBS group.




                                              - 94 -

7.   AUDIT


7.1 The following audit arrangements will be established:

     · The Ghana Audit Service (GAS) carries out an independent annual external audit of the

         GoG Accounts. The annual audit report by the GAS should be provided to MDBS DPs

         as soon as it becomes available.

     · Further exercises will be carried out to complement GAS' annual audit. These include

         public expenditure tracking surveys, performance audits and GAS audit of selected

         flows (with regards to the latter, MDBS development partners will continue to make

         funding available for the purpose of the annual audit of selected flows which must be

         carried out to international standards). To the extent possible, the timing and content of

         these exercises will be coordinated.



7.2 The audit reports will be discussed as part of the MDBS dialogue.

a.   PROCUREMENT


8.1 The GoG will perform all procurement in accordance with national procurement rules,

guidelines and procedures.


8.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOG


8.1 The GoG, in accordance with its rules, regulations, policies, and procedures, and subject to

     the availability of funds, will:

     · Respect the underlying principles of this FM.

     · Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system that is used to assess progress on the

         implementation of the GPRS II.

     · Implement the GPRS II and ensure that total expenditure and sector allocations

         effectively reflect the GoG's growth and poverty reduction commitment and that the

         budget is comprehensive.




                                              - 95 -

     · Further strengthen PFM systems and processes, including procurement and the

          Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and continue efforts to tackle

          corruption.


9.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DPS


9.1 To the extent possible and consistent with their internal laws, policies, procedures and

     individual bilateral agreements with the GoG, DPs will:

     · Improve aid effectiveness, including the facilitation of greater GoG ownership,

          harmonisation, alignment, result-orientation and mutual accountability.

     · Coordinate the timing of their disbursements with the GoG's budgetary requirements.

     · Work closely with the GoG to coordinate with other dialogue mechanisms and aid

          modalities.


9.2 The DPs will endeavour to follow the principles and procedures enshrined in the FM and

      reflect them in their bilateral funding arrangements with GOG to the maximum extent.

      These arrangements will mainly provide further details on the obligations of each

      participant and the procedures for disbursing funds together with any standard conditions

      for development cooperation that the individual DP may have. The DPs will keep such

      general conditions to a minimum.


10. ANTI-CORRUPTION


10.1. The GoG and DPs concur that corruption undermines good governance and wastes scare

      resources. The GoG and DPs intend to cooperate closely in order to ensure transparency,

      accountability and probity in the use of public resources.




                                               - 96 -

11. CONSULTATIONS AND TERMINATION


11.1 Any differences or controversies that arise in relation to the MDBS should be settled by

     means of dialogue and consultation between DPs and the GoG. The GoG and each DP will

     promptly consult with the other participants whenever a DP proposes to suspend or

     terminate, in whole or in part, its support to the GPRS II through MDBS.


11.2 This FM remains valid unless cancelled or replaced by a new FM.

Growth remains strong although short-term macroeconomic vulnerabilities have increased in
the context of a worsening external environment. Continued fiscal stimulus and strong private
sector demand have led to a weakening in the external current account position, some exchange
rate depreciation and--together with rising oil and utility prices--an increase in headline
inflation to 12.7 percent by end-2007. The authorities' fiscal deficit target of 6 percent of GDP
for 2008 is unlikely to be attained without additional measures. Staff cautions against an
expansion in the fiscal deficit from its level in 2007. Without supporting fiscal policy, monetary
policy will need to carry an increasing burden for bringing inflation back on a path towards its
target range of 6­8 percent for 2008. Structural reform in the utility sector is critical to
safeguard medium-term growth prospects. The risks to external debt distress have increased
somewhat, but remain moderate.

Growth has remained strong but Ghana's external position has weakened and inflation has
risen. Boosted by strong public and private sector demand (fuelled in part by very rapid credit
growth), real GDP growth is estimated to have reached 6½ percent in 2007, despite energy
supply problems in the first half of the year. Surging demand, with increasing imports of
machinery and equipment (in part to address the energy shortage), played a role in widening the
external current account deficit to an estimated 12 percent of GDP in 2007 from about 10 percent
of GDP a year earlier. Strong capital inflows helped international reserves remain at an
equivalent of close to 3 months of imports (2.4 months if the unspent portion of the US$750
million sovereign bond issue were excluded). Headline inflation, which hovered just above 10
percent through October, climbed to 12.7 percent by year-end, compared to the authorities'
inflation target range of 7-9 percent. The rise reflected not only a depreciating exchange rate and
demand pressures, but also significant supply shocks from increases in international oil prices
and adjustments in administrative utility prices. Core inflation, which excludes energy and utility
prices, also rose measurably later in the year after having declined through September. The Bank
of Ghana increased its prime rate by 100 basis points in early November, in response to the
prospects of rising inflation.

The overall fiscal deficit is estimated at about 7½ percent of GDP in 2007, compared to the
authorities' target of 4 percent of GDP and a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP a year earlier.
The deficit reflected expenditures to address the energy crisis, including capital spending, as well
as utility subsidies/transfers (despite substantial increases in electricity and water tariffs in
November); the wage bill was also somewhat above target. Fiscal revenues were strong, thanks
to improved revenue collection. Total gross public debt rose to an estimated 48 percent of GDP
(including recent nonconcessional borrowings from international capital markets and China); the
NPV of external debt rose by about 4 percentage points of GDP, approaching the "warning"
annual debt accumulation limit established in the Bank-Fund external debt sustainability

framework for low-income countries. However, staff considers that the risks to external debt
distress, while increased somewhat, remain moderate, with Ghana's key external debt
sustainability indicators remaining within the thresholds.

For 2008, staff projects a slight increase in real GDP growth to 6.7 percent driven by strong
domestic demand. Staff commends the authorities' goal of reducing the fiscal deficit to 6
percent of GDP in 2008, but projects that the deficit could reach 9 percent of GDP without
further fiscal measures. The increase in spending reflects, inter alia, the implementation of large
infrastructure projects that address long-standing bottlenecks to growth and thus could be
considered both necessary and temporary. But utility price subsidies and transfers are also
projected to increase. Also, shortly after enacting the budget, the government extended a "life-
line" budget subsidy that initially had benefited only the poorest households to cover the
majority of the population, putting additional strains on the budget. A key additional fiscal
measure would be to bring utility prices to full cost recovery levels so as to eliminate associated
budget subsidies (and quasi-fiscal deficits) for the VRA and the ECG, the two state-owned utility
companies. Adhering to wage increases consistent with the 2008 budget will also be critical in
this election year. Putting inflation back on a path toward the authorities' target range of 6­8
percent will require significant monetary tightening, particularly if the fiscal deficit is not
contained. The external current account deficit is projected to widen to 12½ percent of GDP,
while international reserve coverage to decline to below 2 ½ months of imports. Staff considers
that some build up of international reserves would be advisable to cushion against any adverse
external shocks, including a possible deterioration in commodity prices and slowing of private
inflows.

Structural reforms have generally advanced in the past year, although they have slowed in
a few areas. Ghana continued to make good progress in financial sector reforms, public financial
management, and privatization. The banking system appears to be healthy, but it will be
important to continue enhancing regulation and move over time toward risk-based supervision,
particularly in the context of continued very rapid credit growth to enterprises. After a year of
delay, utility prices for industrial users were adjusted upward in both May and November 2007,
when utility prices to households were also substantially increased. However, prices are still far
from full cost recovery levels. In this regard, staff welcomes the government's intention to
prepare financial recovery plans for the two utility companies. Meanwhile, civil service reforms
appear to have stalled.

The recent discovery of oil is likely to improve Ghana's outlook for poverty reduction and
debt sustainability (oil has yet to be declared commercially viable). The Fund strongly supports
the authorities' efforts to design a transparent petroleum revenue management system that also
suits Ghana's development needs, as well as efforts to introduce a fiscal responsibility law that
would incorporate key elements of petroleum management.

Policy dialogue between the authorities and Fund staff has remained active, although
discussions on a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) have not advanced. The 2008 Article IV
consultation mission planned for March/April 2008 will offer an opportunity for further
discussion of the economic outlook, including macroeconomic and balance of payments risks,
the likely impact of the oil discovery, and appropriate policy responses. The Fund provides
capacity building support to the authorities in monetary forecasting, debt management, fiscal
management, and statistics. With DFID co-sponsorship, the Fund has placed an additional staff

           Annex 5: IDA's Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy: The Case of Ghana

                                               I. INTRODUCTION

1.       The purpose of this note is to set out the relevant factors related to Ghana's recent non-
concessional borrowing (a US$750 million Eurobond issue and a US$292 million loan agreement
signed with the China ExImbank), and to recommend an IDA response based on country - and
loan-specific factors outlined in the Board paper on IDA's policy on non-concessional borrowing
(IDA[2006], p. 24).23 The policy on non-concessional borrowing by grant-eligible and MDRI-recipient
countries was requested by IDA deputies in the course of the IDA14 Replenishment discussions and was
adopted by the Board on July 6, 2006. The objective of this policy is to provide IDA with a framework to
deal with situations in which non-concessional loans risk undoing the benefits of IDA grants or debt
relief, contributing to undermine the borrower's debt sustainability prospects. 24

2.       IDA's non-concessional borrowing (NCB) policy was developed to address the risk that
non-concessional loans to grant-eligible and post-MDRI countries may lead to a rapid re-
accumulation of debt and thus undermine borrowers' debt sustainability prospects. The policy is
applicable to Ghana as a post-MDRI country as of FY07. While debt relief increases the apparent
borrowing space and financing options available to post-MDRI countries, it also poses a challenge for
borrowers to manage that borrowing space effectively to increase growth and to meet poverty reduction
targets. The policy is based on a two-pronged approach aimed at both creditors and borrowers. The first
prong aims to enhance creditor coordination around an agreed framework on borrowers' debt
sustainability, while the second prong is aimed at discouraging over-borrowing. In this context, Ghana's
recent non-concessional borrowing needs to be assessed by IDA as to its impact on the country's
repayment capacity, taking into account country-specific and loan-specific factors.

3.       On September 27, 2007, Ghana issued a US$750 million Eurobond on international capital
markets at a fixed coupon of 8.5 percent with a ten-year bullet repayment of the principal.25 The
Government of Ghana also signed, on September 25, 2007, a US$292 million loan agreement with the
China ExImbank to be used toward the construction of a hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam. This
loan from the China Eximbank carries an average commercial interest rate of 6.1 percent, with a 17-year
amortization period, a 5 years grace period, and a zero grant element.26
4.       While there is some evidence of economic merit to Ghana's non-concessional borrowing, the
country's increased access to market financing warrants reconsidering the terms of IDA's
assistance. Sector-specific factors that explain the decision to borrow include: the need to increase public
investments, notably in the energy sector, to sustain economic growth and to make progress toward the
MDGs, as well as the expected economic and financial rates of return from the infrastructure investments
to be financed with this borrowing.            Country-specific factors indicate that Ghana's policies and


23See IDA (2006). IDA Countries and Non-Concessional Debt: Dealing with the `Free-Rider' Problem in IDA14
Grant-Recipient and Post-MDRI Countries, IDA/R2006-0137, July.
24For the purposes of applying this policy, a concessionality benchmark has been set at a 35 percent minimum grant
element. The concessionality benchmark can be higher in cases where there is an IMF arrangement in place. These
estimates apply the joint IMF and World Bank methodology for calculating concessionality using Commercial
Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) as discount rates.
25The coupon on the bond translates into a reoffer (before management and transaction fees) of 387 basis points
over 10-year US Treasuries, or 326 basis points over the US dollar LIBOR, and a zero grant element.
26Ghana has also signed mixed credit agreements with the Netherland Government, combining commercial bank
loans with official grants. These mixed credit agreements include, for instance, a loan from BMH Bank for the
Barekese Water Supply Project of US$23.5 million equivalent, which was combined with a US$26.6 million
equivalent grant from the Netherlands' Government.

institutions are strong for a low-income country and that the country's debt sustainability indicators
suggest a moderate to low risk of debt distress. At the same time, the volumes of borrowing on non-
concessional terms are large, and the expected returns on some of these investments are uncertain.

5.       The joint Bank-IMF DSA of April 2007 had assessed Ghana as having a moderate risk of
debt distress, albeit on the low end of that category. However, because the country was in a borderline
position, Ghana was classified as a "green-light" country for IDA's grant allocation system, and hence
continued receiving credits under standard IDA terms in FY08 (Figure 1).27 A revised joint Bank-IMF
DSA is scheduled to be prepared at the time of the IMF's next Article IV consultations, and the results
should be available by mid-2008. The next joint DSA will be important because it will be able to take
account of two significant developments. First, the recent front loading of non-concessional borrowing,
which is likely to have shifted Ghana farther into the moderate risk category. This impact could be offset
however by the second important development ­ the prospect of oil exports. Preliminary real GDP and
export growth projections, which account for the information available on the prospects of crude oil
exports beginning in 2011, place Ghana in a scenario of lower risk of debt distress.28 Although a revised
joint Bank-Fund DSA will not be available until end-June, there are five Ghana operations going to the
Board in the last quarter of FY08 that represent around 57 percent of Ghana's FY08 IDA allocation.29
This note is being circulated to the Board now therefore in view of management's commitment to inform
Executive Directors of any IDA response prior to requesting approval for new lending.

6.       The note is organized as follows: Section II sets out the terms of lending and the country-
specific and loan-specific factors that inform the recommendation on the appropriate response to the
borrowing. Section III sets out the available options. Section IV sets out the Bank's response and
summarizes the rationale for this response.




27One of the reasons why Ghana was classified as a "green light" country for the purpose of IDA's grant allocation
system in FY08, despite breaching the policy thresholds when the stress tests were applied, was that the stress tests
in Figure 1 were understood as reflecting extreme cases, facing relatively low probabilities.
28It is important to note that while a scenario of oil exports will be included in the next joint DSA it will not be
incorporated in the baseline scenario until oil reserves are declared commercially viable. At present, the oil
companies are providing information about the probability that reserves are commercially viable, and the Bank and
the IMF are working with two scenarios for oil reserves ­ 170 and 500 millions of barrels ­ for which they have,
respectively, 50 and 90 percent confidence.
29Including one regional operation ­ the West Africa Transport and Transit.

                                II.      RATIONALE AND IMPACT OF THE BORROWING

8.       Ghana's rationale for borrowing on non-concessional terms. The Ghana Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy approved by Parliament in September 2005 had already envisaged that funding from
domestic and concessional sources of financing would be insufficient to finance the entire development
plan. Following the October 2005 Consultative Group (CG) meeting, the Government communicated to
the Bank that it would seek additional financing from the market and from other non-concessional sources
to meet the country's growth targets and achieve the MDGs.30 This need for additional funding for public
investments became more pressing as the energy crisis deepened in the second half of 2006 and early
2007. The decline in water levels at the Akosombo dam reduced hydro-electric power generation
capacity by 25 to 30 percent, making even more urgent the need to scale up investments on energy
infrastructure. The aim was to restore power supply capacity to at least the levels prevailing prior to the
2006-2007 crisis, and to ensure that energy supply would increase in lockstep with projected real GDP
growth.

9.       More recently, the Government's intention to access international capital markets was
discussed in February 2007 and incorporated in the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) completed in April 2007. The joint DSA included the government's intention to borrow about
US$250 million per year non-concessionally between 2007 and 2009, and US$350 million per year
thereafter. The main developments since that joint DSA was completed are the Government's decision to
borrow the envisioned amount from international capital markets in one single tranche, rather than
spreading it over a three year period, and to sign the financing agreement with the China ExImbank. The
frontloading of the borrowing can be explained by the fact that there are fixed costs in accessing
international capital markets, hence these fixed costs would have been higher if funds were raised in
separate tranches. Moreover, the financing agreement with the China ExImbank for the construction of
the hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam is part and parcel of the Government's efforts to keep the
expansion of low cost electricity generation capacity in line with the country's projected real GDP
growth.

10.      What are the country's future borrowing plans?                  The Government's non-concessional
borrowing plans are, at present, still those discussed at the time of the April 2007 joint Bank-IMF DSA,
which envisioned annual market access of about 1 percent of GDP for the period 2010-2025. In addition,
there are plans for other project financing by official export credit agencies, albeit not on the scale of the
financing agreement signed with the China ExImbank for the hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam.
A joint World Bank-IMF Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) mission was recently in Accra (February
27-March 11, 2008) with the purpose of providing technical assistance, including tools and guidance on
designing and implementing an effective MTDS that ensures that the financing needs of the government
are met at the lowest possible cost consistent with a prudent degree of risk and with maintaining debt
sustainability. In parallel, a World Bank mission assessed the strengths and weaknesses of Ghana's debt
management operations using the Debt Management Performance Assessment Tool (DeMPA). The
DeMPA provides a comprehensive assessment of debt management institutions and practices, laying
down the basis for an actionable reform program and, ultimately, better coordination of the full array of
Technical Assistance providers that Ghana may wish to mobilize.
11.      How does the country plan to use the proceeds of the Eurobond issue and the China
ExImbank loan? The Eurobond prospectus states that the use of the proceeds will be for infrastructure



30Since that time the Bank has continued to engage the Government on a dialogue about its borrowing plans, and as
recently as November 2007 the Government provided the Bank with a table with information on all its new
borrowing, up to that date, distinguishing between concessional and non-concessional loans, creditor names, interest
charges, maturity and grace periods.


                                                     - 107 -

investments, including, but not limited to, energy and transport. This statement is consistent with the
2007 supplementary budget, which was approved by Parliament once the Ghanaian government had
received authorization to issue the bond. The 2007 supplementary budget allocated about US$357
million from the bond proceeds to energy investments, while another US$13 million were set aside for
road-sector investments. Together these two sets of investments totaled US$ 370 million (2.5 percent of
projected 2007 GDP), or about 50 percent of the proceeds of the bond issue. The China ExImbank loan is
dedicated to finance the construction of the hydroelectric power plant at Bui, with an annual generation of
about 1,000 GWh and a proposed installed capacity of 400 MW.

12.       While the other 50 percent of the Eurobond proceeds are currently being held as
international reserves at the Bank of Ghana, the 2008 budget outlined investment plans aimed at
completing the energy sector investment program.31 The 2008 budget sets aside just over US$360
million for investment plans in the energy sector, including the operationalization of the 125 MW
Osagyefo Power Barge at Effasu-Mangyea, the acquisition of 84 MW Gas Turbine Power Plant from
BHEL in India, and the purchase of a 50MW Gas Turbine Power Plant from Siemens. All these new
thermal power plants are scheduled to begin operations before end-2008, and would complement recently
announced and planned policy actions.

13.       Among the policy actions recently announced was the large adjustment of electricity tariffs
for non-residential and residential consumers, while planned policy actions include the energy
sector financial recovery program designed to allow the country's power utility companies to
return to standard commercial operations. In May 2007 the country's independent public utility
regulator (PURC) raised electricity tariffs for non-residential consumers by around 55 percent, and then
again on November 1, 2007, by 35 percent on average. Electricity tariffs for residential consumers were
raised on November 2007 by between 35 and 175 percent, depending on the customer's electricity
consumption levels.32,33 While this was an important first step in bridging the financial gap of the power
utility companies, the upward trend in crude oil prices in international markets continuously shift the goal
of full cost recovery tariffs. The Government's financial recovery program for these companies envisions
(i) setting formal financial and operational performance targets for ECG & VRA to ensure their
progressive return to commercial viability (ending the need for operating subsidies); and (ii) achieving
standard public utility financial performance.34

13.       What are the expected benefits of these investments? In response to the 2006-07 power
shortages that disrupted the economy and lowered growth, the Government proceeded to acquire long-
overdue additional generation capacity, on a fast-track basis, in line with Ghana's indicative power
generation expansion plan (originally prepared in 2000) that requires Ghana to add at least 200MW of
new thermal generation capacity each year, just to keep up with demand growth and mitigate the



31 Furthermore, the Government's 2008 budget envisions US$75 million in investments in the water and sanitation
sector, and US$200 million in investments in the transport sector. These investment amounts identified in the 2008
budget are in addition to funding already identified from development partners and export credit guarantee agencies.
32 In November 2007, in the process of adjusting tariffs, the tariff band for low consumption customers (so called
lifeline tariff customers) was widened, lowering the average residential tariff increase for low income and middle
income customers from 44 to 35 percent.
33 It is important to note that the average gazetted tariff increase on November 1, 2007, was in addition to the
increase that had already been gazetted in November 1, 2006, but had not yet been implemented. The two tariff
adjustments that came into effect on November 1, 2007, implied residential tariff increases in the 65 to 210 percent
range.
34 To follow upon on the recent electricity tariff increase, the Government is preparing an energy sector financial
recovery program that includes, among other initiatives: (i) an improvement in VRA's and ECG's operating ratios;
(ii) reducing VRA's and ECG's arrears to creditors and suppliers; and (iii) reducing VRA's stock of short term debt.

country's vulnerability to drought-induced power supply disruptions.                    Otherwise power cuts will
reappear, and economic growth will suffer. This is the main justification for the Government's decision
to invest massively in power generation using public funds. In this context, after evaluating several
proposals for a light crude oil (LCO) thermal power plant in Tema, the Government decided to proceed
with the least cost option amongst the proposals available that would ensure that the new thermal power
plant would be operational before mid-2008. There are also three other thermal power plants at different
stages of implementation, which will add an extra 400MW of dual-fueled (natural gas and diesel) capacity
in 2009-10. These projects are being funded with public resources because of difficulties and delays in
coming to closure on agreements with independent private generation producers (IPPs). The latter, is in
part due to Government's reluctance to offer sovereign guarantees to investors that are faced with the lack
of a solvent offtaker for the power generated because of currently low electricity tariff levels in Ghana.35

14.      The Government has also accepted an unsolicited bid from the Sinohydro Corporation of
China to finance and construct a 400MW Bui hydroelectric scheme to be sited on the Volta River
upstream from the Lake Volta reservoir. The China ExImbank is to co-finance the Sinohydro contract,
which is structured as a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract with the Bui Development Authority, a
new statutory body. We do not know at this stage precise terms and conditions of this contract nor the
project-specific rates of return, given that much depends on arrangements to be put in place to mitigate
hydrological risks entailed by this project.36 Any assessment will also need to balance the high initial
capital costs of the project with the fact that the plant will produce electricity for a very long period (40 to
50 years) and use a clean energy source at a unit cost that will be stable (unlike oil) and declining in real
terms, once the debt on the project has been paid off. There might be opportunities to take up a
discussion on the design of the Bui plant in the future either with the authorities or in the context of the
Africa Region's dialogue with the Chinese ExImbank.

15.      How is the government organizing itself to ensure that these investments will yield high
returns, and how is the Bank supporting this effort? The Government of Ghana has established at the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning a Project Finance Analysis (PFA) Unit with responsibility
for analyzing, monitoring and evaluating new investment projects deemed eligible for Government
support.    This unit will also have the responsibility of assisting project sponsors leverage private
financing by assisting them in setting up Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Agreements and Private
Finance Initiatives (PFIs). To realize the Government's plans, DFID is providing support in the area of
project evaluation, and the Bank is providing technical assistance to review and upgrade the current
framework for investment appraisal and PPPs to ensure that Government resources are deployed in the
most optimal manner for achieving the maximum economic benefits. A mission was fielded in December
2007 to: (i) analyze the institutional framework for PPPs in Ghana; (ii) assess the modalities of
implementation of two transport projects currently under consideration as PPPs (Accra-Kumasi tollroad
and the Western Railway By-pass); (iii) review Government's technical capability for project appraisal



35The financial sustainability of the two power sector utilities is being address as part of the forthcoming Ghana
PRSC-7 operation. To follow upon on the recent electricity tariff increase, the Government is preparing an energy
sector financial recovery program that includes, among other initiatives: (i) an improvement in VRA's and ECG's
operating ratios; (ii) reducing VRA's and ECG's arrears to creditors and suppliers; and (iii) reducing VRA's stock of
short term debt.
36There is an 8.0 percent rate of return estimate for the hydro-electric power plant at the Bui dam available that is
based on a run-of-river power dam. It is important to note that estimates of the rates of return for power generation
investments carry a certain degree of uncertainty given that much depends on arrangements to be put in place to
mitigate hydrological risks entailed by this project, and because of difficulties in predicting the revenue stream in the
power sector due to unusually low electricity tariffs. Estimates suggest that end-user electricity tariffs at the end of
2007 covered just over three-quarters of the cost of electricity generation (excluding financial costs).

and evaluation, and (iv) strengthen its capacity to manage and account for contingent liabilities. The
mission agreed with Government to strengthen the PFA unit with additional staff and financial resources
and to seek Cabinet approval of its mandate. It was agreed that the PFA would undertake preparation of a
law which would establish the legal framework for PPP transactions as well as the role of the PFA group
itself. The Bank is organizing a program for Government officials, covering project appraisal, to be
followed by a seminar on international experience of PPPs and project finance for infrastructure
investments, so as to build awareness among key actors. The Bank's support for these activities is
currently being financed out of the existing Economic and Management Capacity Building credit, and
additional resources are being sought from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund to strengthen this program
of technical assistance in the coming years.

16.      What is the impact of this new borrowing on the risk of debt distress? The new borrowing
increases, in the short run, the country's debt service ratio to GDP and to exports by about one-fifth,
raising the debt service ratio to GDP to 2.6 percent and the debt service to export ratio to 7.8 percent, up
from the 2.2 and 6.5 percent, respectively, that had been envisioned in the April 2007 debt sustainability
analysis (DSA).37 With time, these increases in the debt service to GDP ratio and debt service to exports
are expected to decline because of sustained real GDP growth and continued export growth, notably in the
event that oil export revenues begin flowing in 2010.38, This relatively favorable scenario with the new
borrowing is not surprising because the April 2007 DSA prepared jointly by the Bank and the IMF had
already envisioned the possibility of non-concessional borrowing, indicating at that time that Ghana faced
a moderate risk of debt distress, albeit on the low side (Figure 1). In the absence of any increases in
exports due to future oil revenues, the new borrowing would have removed any ambiguity of the current
risk rating, confirming Ghana as a country at moderate risk of debt distress. However, revised real GDP
growth and export projections, which reflect oil and gas discoveries, should help offset this impact on
debt sustainability resulting from the government's recent borrowing decisions. These revised projections
also show that there is the possibility that the country's debt risk classification could shift downward from
moderate to a lower risk of debt distress.

17.      How strong are the country's policies and institutions? Ghana's public financial management
is assessed as being strong; currently meeting 8 of the 16 HIPC public expenditure management
benchmarks, up from 7 benchmarks at the time of the 2004 HIPC AAP assessment, and 1 benchmark in
2001. Areas of specific progress include: (i) broadening the coverage of the budget, (ii) preparing
timelier external and internal audit reports of the consolidated fund account, and (iii) building a strong
foundation for open, competitive and transparent public procurement. The budget coverage has been
broadened to include more information on the allocation of HIPC and MDRI funds, as well as internally
generated funds and donor grants. External audit reports are being expedited and are now submitted
within less than 12 months of the closing of the accounts, and, under the auspices of the new Internal
Audit Agency law, there has been an increase in the number of government ministries, departments and
agencies submitting internal audit reports. Lastly, there has been progress in implementing the new
public procurement law, with increased coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the tender
review boards, leading Ghana to score above average when using the OECD/DAC Methodology for
Assessment of National Procurement Systems.



37The real GDP and export growth rates during the 2008-2026 period, as assumed in the joint April 2007 DSA,
were, respectively, 5.3 and 6.7 percent.
38 These revised projections reflect estimates provided by the IBRD policy division for Oil Gas and Mining
(COCPO) staff and assume that oil exports would begin already in 2010, generating between US$ 950 million and
US$ 2.8 billion in export revenues, depending on the size of the recoverable reserves. Under either of these
scenarios, the price of the barrel of crude oil over the period from 2008 to 2019 is projected to average US$73 in
current US dollars.

                                                 III. OPTIONS

18.     According to the Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy there are several possible responses to
Ghana's decision to borrow on non-concessional terms.39 Each option is elaborated below:

        An exception to the policy. An exception to the policy would result in Ghana's receiving the
same volume of IDA on standard credit terms. Such an exception could be granted after careful
consideration of country-specific and loan-specific factors. Country-specific factors that would mitigate
the additional risks inherent in borrowing non-concessionally include the country's borrowing strategy
and the institutions being set up to guide and monitor the use of these funds. Also, a decision to grant an
exception would reflect recognition that Ghana is a strong performer that has contracted the non-
concessional financing to fund emergency energy sector projects and other infrastructure investments for
which it had no alternative financing sources. The need for urgent investments in the energy sector and
other infrastructure sectors came through clearly in the recently completed Ghana Country Economic
Memorandum. However, despite these country-specific factors, the size of the market-based financing
was significantly greater than the currently planned investments, and the returns to investment are not
unambiguous.

        Reducing IDA volumes. Another possible response to the non-concessional borrowing is a
reduction in IDA volumes. However, the Non-Concessional Borrowing policy paper argues that reducing
IDA volumes to countries that have attained market access may not be an appropriate response. The main
reason is that countries with market access could respond by simply increasing their non-concessional
borrowing either from international capital markets or from other non-traditional bilateral agencies, and
fewer IDA funds would be available for funding expenditures aimed at achieving the MDGs. This kind
of response would also serve to curtail the contribution that is made by IDA's engagement in sectoral
dialogue and would reduce IDA's ability to assist Government in evaluating various investment options.

        Hardening IDA terms. For countries that are starting to gain market access, one response that
IDA could consider would be to adjust IDA's financing terms to essentially "follow the market,"
reflecting countries' increased ability to access the market. Such an approach would be consistent with
IDA's longstanding policy of linking concessionality with countries' access to the market by reserving the
most concessional resources for those countries that cannot afford less subsidized assistance. Any of the
hardening of terms options would preclude Ghana from accessing IDA grants, while still providing scope
for IDA to remain fully engaged in the country. Also, while this response would be a rational response to
Ghana's increased non-concessional borrowing, it would need to be weighed against the impact of the
change in financing terms on Ghana's debt sustainability risks. The following hardened IDA financing
terms are currently available:

                  Blend terms, with 35 years' maturity, a ten-year grace period and current service charges
        (0.75 percent). This option would carry a 57 percent grant element, compared to the standard
        IDA terms which are equivalent to a 60 percent grant element, and thus would have no noticeable
        impact on the country's risk of debt distress. 40

and Post-MDRI Countries. Financial Resource Mobilization Department (FRM), June 19, 2006.
40The grant element percentages shown in this paragraph use a standard 6 percent discount rate and a standard
disbursement profile which is familiar to the Board. Using the relevant discount rates under the NCBP definition of
concessionality, the grant element of the various terms as of April 15, 2008 would be as follows: standard terms
69 percent, blend terms 66 percent, hardened terms 52 percent, hard terms 14 percent. These rates can vary owing to
movements of discount rates and the interest charged on hard term credits.

                  Hardened terms, with 20 years' maturity, a ten-year grace period and current service
         charges (0.75 percent). This option would carry a 40 percent grant element and would worsen the
         country's debt sustainability indicators, although not to the point of breaching the policy
         thresholds.

                  Hard term window, with blend terms plus interest rates set at 200 basis points below the
         IBRD lending rate in fixed-rate terms. This option would carry a grant element of about 8
         percent, and would visibly worsen the country's debt sustainability indicators, although it would
         still not lead the country to breach the indicative policy thresholds for debt sustainability.

19.      What is the impact of these three options for hardening IDA terms on the country's debt
sustainability indicators for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV of the debt-to-export ratio?
Simulation results of the three options outlined above, based on the current debt sustainability analysis,
indicate that Ghana would not be in danger of breaching the policy thresholds under the baseline scenario
under any one of these options. However, the application of the hard term window visibly worsens the
country's debt sustainability indicators, as do hardened terms, albeit to a lesser extent. The option
proposed (IDA blend terms) yields slightly better results, reflecting higher grant elements. The two
conclusions that one might draw from these simulations are that: (i) hardening IDA terms would not be
expected to worsen the country's debt sustainability prospects; and (ii) although the difference between
the two harder term options (hardened terms and hard term window) and IDA's blend terms is not
significant, switching to blend terms would be an appropriate, graduated response, consistent with the
country's increased access to market finance. Also, a slight change in terms, without a reduction in
volume, would signal IDA's intention to remain fully engaged in the relevant sectoral dialogue,
facilitating the provision of assistance to strengthen the project appraisal function within Government.

                                              IV. NEXT STEPS

20.     In light of the discussion above:

    · IDA management will recommend in the MOP for each new IDA operation beginning in
         FY09 that IDA financing be on blend terms.41 This response acknowledges the Government's
         increased access to market finance and its decision to bring forward the amounts of non-
         concessional borrowing that had been identified at the time of the joint Bank-Fund debt
         sustainability analysis in April 2007, as well as the new China ExImbank loan. However, this
         response also recognizes: (i) the country's strong policies and institutions, (ii) the urgent need for
         additional external financing to increase the country's electricity generation capacity, mitigating
         the impact of the energy crisis and sustaining economic growth; (iii) the early discussions with
         the Bank on the country's search for additional finance to support specific infrastructure
         investments; (iv) the benefits of IDA's continued full engagement with this country as it makes
         sectoral policy choices and builds up its own capacity to evaluate the expected returns on its
         public investments.

    · The Bank team will work with the Government of Ghana to develop an investment
         program that addresses the country's infrastructure needs.

    · The Bank team will assist the Government of Ghana in identifying concessional or
         favorable financing sources consistent with the NCB policy, including existing and upcoming
         World Bank group financing instruments.

    · The Bank team will strengthen arrangements and support Ghana's capacity building
         efforts for debt management and reporting.

    · The Bank team will support a robust program of technical assistance in the area of project
         appraisal and public-private partnerships.

    · IDA's response be reassessed by the end of FY09, in light of the government's eventual
         decisions on the use of the remaining financing from the Eurobond issue, and taking into account
         the volume and use of additional non-concessional financing contracted in the intervening
         period.




41This response allows projects currently in advanced stages of preparation to be finalized and negotiated under
standard IDA terms.
