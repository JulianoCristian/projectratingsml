1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

This series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (4-5-6) was designed as an integral part of the
Bank's strategy to support the implementation of Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (GPRS II). Originally designed as a series of four credits, these programmatic
operations were to be implemented over the period 2006 to 2008, and were designed to facilitate
the implementation of cross-cutting reforms aimed at improving the living conditions of the
Ghanaian population by promoting private sector­led growth, vigorous human development, and
strengthening governance and civic responsibility.

PRSC-4-5-6 built upon the satisfactory progress achieved under the first PRSC series),1 which
was designed in support of Ghana's first Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I) introduced in
2003. The GPRS I set poverty reduction goals in alignment with the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and identified measures to increase growth, income, and employment; improve
the delivery of basic social services; enhance governance and public sector management, and
address vulnerability and exclusion. A key foundation of this strategy was the recognition that
there could be no meaningful poverty reduction without a strong economic foundation and
sustained growth. It was in this context that the Bank and Ghana's other key development
partners (DPs) considered that the country's stable democratic governance, improving
investment climate, and progress in achieving the MDGs constituted a good set of fundamentals
on which to build support for the GPRS. The initial series of three PRSCs, designed in 2003,
was the Bank's major contribution to this partnership.
PRSC-1-2-3 were also implemented in the context of a strong macroeconomic performance.
Annual real GDP growth had continued to grow steadily, reaching 6.0 percent in 2005, following
a solid 5.8 percent real GDP growth in 2004, and 5.2 percent in 2003. The fiscal deficit had also
remained low, reaching 4.9 percent of GDP by end-2005, still enabling an increase in the share
of credit allocated to the private sector. Although overall exports increased only modestly as
increases in gold and timber exports were offset by a decline in cocoa exports, and imports
increased by almost 25 percent (largely owing to the 45 percent increase in the price of imported
oil), the resulting increase in the trade deficit was partially offset by increases in official and
private transfers (primarily expatriate remittances) of US$2.0 billion, equivalent to 20 percent of
GDP. Moreover, aggregate investment continued to be strong, with increases in private sector
investment matching the recovery in public sector investment.

Prudent fiscal management also contributed to macroeconomic stability, as central government
expenditures were adjusted downward at year-end to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in
revenues, and made it possible to further reduce the ratio of public expenditure to GDP. In doing
so, it lowered domestic debt service enabling lower domestic interest rates and contributed to
maintaining expenditures within the budget ceiling and exerting a moderating effect on inflation.

 PRSC-1-2-3 were each rated "satisfactory" in terms of Outcome, Bank Performance, and Borrower Performance,
and "moderately satisfactory" in terms of Risk to Development Outcome.


                                                    15
Sound monetary management meant that the exchange rate also had a moderating impact on
inflation, and the decline of domestic interest rates resulting from lower domestic debt stock and
inflation rates enabled credit to the private sector as a share of overall credit to increase to 55
percent by end-2005, up from 50 percent in the 2004. Notwithstanding the need to tighten
expenditures at the end of the year, fiscal management maintained its pro-poor orientation, with
poverty-related expenditures rising to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005, up from 7.7 percent in 2004.

It was in this context of sound macroeconomic management and growth that this second set of
programmatic PRSCs was designed and implemented. PRSC-4-5-6 were designed to support the
implementation of the GPRS II, consistent with the 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the
2005 Africa Action Plan, the 2006 CAS Progress Report (CAS PR), and the 2007 CAS. PRSC-4
was a SDR 97.4 million (US$140 equivalent) operation. PRSC-5 was a somewhat smaller
operation of SDR 72.7 million (US$110 million), as it took into account the implementation of
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in Ghana, with the rationale that debt relief was
                                 2
similar to direct budget support. The PRSC-6 credit totaled SDR60.8 million (US$100 million
equivalent). This development policy assistance was provided, as was the support provided
under PRSC-1-2-3, through the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) framework, a coordinated
approach with Ghana's other key development partners (discussed further in Section 2.2, Major
Factors Affecting Implementation).

1.2       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The GPRS II, which covered the period 2006-09 and that was submitted to Parliament in October
2005 and to the Bank and IMF in February 2006 (and considered by the Boards of both
institutions in June 2006), was based on the stated objective of achieving middle income status
by 2015.3 Achieving middle income status entailed a real GDP growth rate of at least 6 percent
per annum, and these higher growth rates were expected to result in higher positive social change
and improvements in the quality of life for all Ghanaians.

The GPRS II updated the strategy laid out in the GPRS I, with a strengthened focus on private
sector-led growth across three strategic pillars:

      ·   Accelerating private sector led growth and poverty reduction by assisting the private
          sector to grow and generate employment;
      ·   Investing in vigorous human resource development to ensure the development of a
          knowledgeable, well-trained, and disciplined labor force;
      ·   Encouraging good governance and civic responsibility by empowering state and non-
          state entities to participate in the development process and collaborate in promoting peace
          and political stability.
2
  The debt relief provided by the MDRI represented a net financial gain to Ghana in the form of sharply reduced
payments on multilateral obligations.
3
  In the Bank's assessment, the main contribution of the GPRS II was in articulating the country's renewed focus on
growth, and the priority attached to structural transformation, especially in agriculture given its potential role in
ensuring pro-poor growth; however, more work was judged to be needed in ensuring consistency between sector
strategies, giving more even treatment to different sectors and activities; and in translating the broad policy
framework into a strategic, monitorable, and time bound set of actions and results.



                                                        16
The program development objectives of the PRSCs were to support the implementation of the
GPRS II and facilitate the implementation of cross-cutting reforms aimed at improving the living
conditions of the Ghanaian population by promoting private sector-led growth, vigorous human
development, and strengthening governance and civic responsibility. These three components
corresponded directly to the government's growth and poverty reduction agenda and were the
same as those supported by the first series of PRSCs. While PRSC-4-5-6 support primarily
translated into funding for the implementation of the GPRS II, particular attention was given to
policy dialogue and to monitoring resource allocations and outcomes.

Particular attention was given to leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector-focused
operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and structure) and by addressing
some of the financing implications of proposed policy actions (e.g., extension of capitation
grants, removal of school fees, deployment of teachers and health care professionals to under-
served areas, and the implementation of inclusive health insurance schemes). The PRSC-4-5-6
also focused on cross-cutting issues related to private sector development and the strengthening
of institutions, ranging from institutions related to governance, public sector reform,
decentralization and public financial management.

Key Indicators: There were 8 prior actions for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, and 14 prior actions for
PRSC-6. The medium to long term impact of these prior actions was measured, in turn, against
key expected outcome indicators. These key indicators included: (1) indicators on the national
budget, (2) indicators on electricity power supply; (3) indicators on public education services, (4)
indicators on public health services, (5) indicators on private sector development, (6) indicators
on natural resource management and agriculture, (7) an indicator on the coverage of water and
sanitation services, and (8) an indicator on public procurement. As seen in Table 1 below, most
of the key indicators remained unchanged, although some indicators were added over the course
of these three operations to more closely reflect the policy dialogue with the authorities.
Changes in these indicators reflected the annual consensus process for setting the indicators in
the dialogue between the authorities and development partners (DPs) participating in the MDBS.
Additional indicators were therefore inevitable as a result of both the consensus process itself
and attempts to capture new areas of focus in the dialogue.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and
Reasons/Justification

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was not formally revised, but it did become more
tightly focused under PRSC-6, centering on "increase domestically-financed poverty reducing
expenditures."4

1.4        Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

In support of the GPRS II pillar of Accelerating Private Sector-Led Growth, the PRSCs' first
component focused on consolidating macro-economic stability and removing some of the

    As stated in the Implementation Status and Results Reports for PRSC-6.


                                                         17
constraints on the private sector's ability to respond to growth opportunities. To this end, the
following policy areas were supported:

    · Financing Development: This policy area focused on improving private sector growth
      by both reducing public domestic debt in order to increase the credit available to the
      private sector, as well as improving financial intermediation to expand access to credit
      and capital.
    · Private Sector Development and Trade: Measures in this area sought to address the
      high cost business environment by removing the administrative barriers to business
      development that limited the entry of new business and competition within the private
      sector.
    · Energy Sector Reform: This area focused on improving the reliability of the energy
      supply resulting from the deterioration of the power distribution system, the operational
      inefficiencies of the power utility companies, and the slow expansion of low-cost, high
      quality energy supply sources. Reforms in the energy sector were a particularly
      important aspect of this component, as the long-term resolution of Ghana's energy
      problems depended on the actions aimed at ensuring the financial viability of the
      enterprises operating in the sector (mostly state-owned enterprises), increasing private
      sector participation, and securing access to cheaper sources of energy supply.
    · Rural Development and Natural Resource Management: This area focused on
      measures to improve the performance of the rural sector through policy actions aimed at
      strengthening the government's support to agriculture and improving the management of
      natural resources, with a focus on forestry resources.

Under the GPRS II pillar of Human Resource Development, the second component of PRSC-4-
5-6 incorporated measures to assist Ghana to reach the MDG goals by improving service
delivery in the following areas.

   ·   Education: Measures in the area of education focused on increasing access and
       completion of quality basic education, particularly in the three most deprived regions
       (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West), and on improving the efficiency and equity of
       education financing, with greater attention to the poverty impact.
   ·   Health, Malaria Control, and the HIV/AIDS Program: In the health sector, the
       program for improving human service delivery for health centered on (i) bridging the
       equity gaps in the access to health care services in the deprived regions (Northern, Upper
       East, Upper West, and Central), and (ii) ensuring sustainable financing arrangements for
       the health sector to protect the poor. To improve malaria control, key interventions
       focused on improved case management and enhanced multiple preventions. In the area
       of HIV/AIDS, the focus was on maintaining the country's relatively low prevalence rate;
       giving attention to prevention; and providing care and support to persons living with and
       affected by HIV/AIDS.
   ·   Social Protection: The focus in this area was the social protection strategy, which
       emphasized the expansion of the livelihood empowerment against poverty (LEAP) social
       grants; the increase coverage of the national health insurance scheme, as well as several



                                              18
    preventive health programs; the continuation of capitation grants in education; and the
    scaling up of school feeding and child nutrition programs.
·   Water and Sanitation: The key areas of focus were (i) completing the medium-term
    implementation plan for rural water; (ii) ensuring the financial sustainability of the water
    sector; and (iii) clarifying the institutional, legal, and policy framework for sanitation.

The third component of the PRSCs focused on governance and public sector management and
corresponded to the GPRS II pillar of Good Governance and Civic Responsibility. This component
centered on moving forward with a medium-term agenda for public sector reform in the following area:

      ·   Decentralization: This area focused on supporting the Government's program for implementing
          the framework for the decentralized delivery of local public services.
      ·   Public Sector Reform: Public sector reform efforts focused on improving payroll management
          and control and enhancing the public service's delivery capacity.
      ·   Public Financial Management (PFM): The program for strengthening public financial
          management was centered on making the budget an important instrument of economic
          management by making it more comprehensive (e.g., including internally generated and donor
          funds), and then by raising the budget execution rate and broadening the scope of budget reports
          produced by the Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD) at the Ministry of
          Finance and Economic Planning.
      ·   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): The M&E program supported by the PRSCs focused on
          continuing to strengthen M&E capacity and M&E coordination at the national, regional, and
          district levels, and on improving access to information on M&E.

1.5       Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

There were two modifications to the policy areas covered by this program. In addition to supporting the
policy areas outlined above, PRSC-5 also supported the adoption of a National Water Policy, catalyzing
needed funds for investments in urban and rural water delivery systems. Similarly, PRSC-6 ­ in addition
to supporting the policy areas outlined above ­ included support to protect and improve the focus of
existing safety net programs and mitigate the impact of food price increases on the poorest. These efforts
included (i) refining existing targeting mechanisms and strengthening a centralized early warning system
for food insecurity; (ii) targeting the most vulnerable food insecure areas through the government's
recently established conditional cash transfer program (Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty ­
LEAP); and (iii) ensuring access to health care services for the poorest by continuing to provide a with an
exemption from the premium for registration in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

1.6    Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

There were two significant changes in this series of credits. One, the amount of the PRSC-6 credit was
reduced by SDR6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent) owing to Ghana's less than satisfactory
performance on the energy sector trigger, and an additional SDR6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent)
was added to the credit to help the Government scale up programs aimed at mitigating the impact of
recent rises in food prices on the consumption level of the poorest. (Energy sector performance is
discussed further below in Section 2.1, Program Performance).

The second significant change was the dropping of the final credit, PRSC-7. Although this series of
PRSCs was originally designed to consist of four stand-alone operations, the final credit, PRSC-7, was
dropped in early 2009 after severe macroeconomic imbalances developed in late 2008 and the need to
address them frontally (discussed further below in Section 2.1 Program Performance).

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Program Performance

Overview:      Overall the program performance was mixed, with some significant
achievements in governance, growth, public service delivery and poverty reduction blended
into some increase in vulnerabilities due to delays in carrying out energy sector and public
financial management reforms, as well as vulnerabilities associated with rising balance of
payments current account deficits. Although it is complicated to attribute any specific
outcome to development policy operations, the implementation of the latter nevertheless
coincides with a period of rapid developmental progress, as measured by improvements in the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which ranked Ghana 5th among all low-
income countries (75), second in Sub-Saharan Africa and above several middle-income countries
in 2007. Also, between 2001 and 2007, this index went from 3.4 to 4.0. The successful
democratic transition from December 2008 was an important expression of the maturity of
Ghanaian institutions at their highest level. Poverty reduction was also very rapid during the
PRSC period, with annual GDP growth reaching was 1.6 percentage point (5.7 against 4.1)
higher on average over the PRSC period than during the previous six years (1996-2001). The
proportion of people living below the PPPUS$1.25 a day poverty line declined from 39 percent
in 1999 to 29 percent in 2006, and to probably less afterwards given the rapid growth in per
capita consumption recorded over the period 2006-8. At the same time, the very significant
results obtained in terms of growth, poverty reduction, health and education were achieved at the
expense of fiscal sustainability and macro-economic stability, which weakened after 2005.

Component I: Promoting Growth, Income, and Employment: The first component of the
PRSCs reflects the objective of ensuring progress on macroeconomic stability and pro-poor
growth. Progress in this component was mixed: if GDP growth significantly accelerated over
the period, it was both because of a benign external environment and a fiscal stance which
proved ex-post to be unsustainable in spite of the massive debt reliefs of 2005 and 2006 (HIPC
and MDRI). While data is lacking, in the absence of a recent household survey, it is likely that



                                                 22
poverty continued to decline after 2006 (the latest year with data), given continuously high pro-
poor public spending and robust per capita private consumption growth.

Macroeconomic performance: Ghana's macroeconomic growth remained strong throughout this
series of operations, despite disruptions in power supply in the latter part of 2006 and first half of
2007, and sharp increases in international food and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008. Real GDP
growth, reached 6.4 percent in 2006, 5.7 percent in 2007, and rose to a two-decade high of 7.3
percent in 2008.

Accelerated economic growth did however result primarily from higher demand pressures,
stimulated by expansionary fiscal policies, remittance inflows, and positive terms of trade, and
only to a lesser extent from increases in productivity.5 While the doing business indicator
increased,6 the increase was not sufficiently to offset the resource pull away from the
manufacturing tradable sectors. This resource pull away from tradable manufacturing products
is typical of countries affected by the `Dutch disease' syndrome, which is the forerunner to a loss
of economic competitiveness that usually ends in economic stagnation. The concern with a
possible `Dutch disease' syndrome is derived from past experiences from natural resource
exporting countries, where spending out of natural resource wealth increases the demand for
non-tradable, drawing productive resources into that sector. Also consistent with these
developments, the continued high dependence on natural resource, leads to the widening gap in
labor productivity and capitalization between a small number of large firms and the majority of
small and medium, often informal, enterprises, significant factors and goods market
segmentation, a growing share of resources absorbed by non tradable sectors, a persistently weak
manufacturing sector, or increased difficulties to access urban land.

A series of shocks in 2008 revealed and exacerbated the unsustainable nature of the development
path; it also underlined a lack of transparency and executive accountability. Rapid fiscal
expansion in 2008 coincided with a sudden closure of access to international capital markets in
September 2008 and, as a result, the Ghanaian economy was hard hit by the combination of a
widening current account deficit and a contracting capital account surplus. While fiscal
expansion was prolonging trends observed since 2005, see below, it was also the result of a
combination of important exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late 2007 and a
rise in world oil and food prices, prompting the Government to reduce the pass-through to
consumers through higher subsidies. 7 By year end, the current account deficit rose to 18.7
percent of GDP, and the fiscal deficit to 14.5 percent - and probably more once large
expenditures arrears accumulated in 2008 are accounted.

The fiscal situation gradually deteriorated between 2005 and 2008. The fiscal deficit went up
from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to 7.5 percent in 2006, 9.2 percent in 2007, and 14.5 percent in
2008, the result of rapidly growing current and capital expenditures (total public expenditures
went up from 31 percent of GDP in 2005 to 42 percent in 2008, while the recurrent balance

  Following some improvements in ease of doing business rankings in 2006 and 2007, Ghana saw its relative
position deteriorate in 2008. .
7
  Subsidies to the energy sector absorbed 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 1.6 percent in 2007, and 0.9 percent
in 2006.


                                                       23
(total revenue minus recurrent expenditures) went down from 7.1 percent of GDP, in 2005, to 1.1
percent, in 2008. The increase in public expenditures was the result of significant increases in
the wage bill, the expansion in public education and health services to finance progress towards
MDGs, and subsidies to utilities to finance losses in the energy sector. In contrast, the increase
in domestically-financed capital expenditures in 2007 and 2008 was more sudden (+2.6 percent
of GDP between 2006 and 2008), as it was mainly financed via the accession to international
financial markets in 2007.

This highly expansionary fiscal position entailed deterioration in the country's debt position. By
the end of 2008, Ghana's total public debt was an estimated 56.8 percent of GDP, including
external debt equivalent to 29 percent of GDP as a result of Ghana's non-concessional borrowing
in late 2007, in addition to new concessional bilateral financing and new borrowing from IDA
since 2006.8 The pursuit of highly expansionary fiscal policies contributed to rising inflation and
interest rates, as well as to currency pressures. Inflation ­ which had briefly fallen to single
digits in 2006 rose through 2007-08 as a result of global increases in food and fuel prices, strong
domestic demand, and by late-2008, a pass through of currency depreciation. The inflation
reached 12.7 percent by end-2007, up from 10.9 percent in 2006, and rose to 18.1 percent by
end-2008. In reflection of the macroeconomic imbalances and declining foreign exchange
inflows ­ as the global financial crisis led to a fall in remittances and to capital outflows -- the
exchange rate depreciated by about 25 percent against the dollar during 2008.

Meanwhile, the budget maintained its pro-poor orientation in 2007 and 2008. Although poverty
reduction expenditures fell slightly from the 10.5 percent recorded in 2006, to 9.4 percent of
GDP in 2007, this was an improvement over the 8.5 percent reached at end-2005. In 2008,
Ghana retained its overall pro-poor orientation with poverty reducing expenditures still
accounting for 9.2 percent of GDP, approximately one-third of overall budget expenditures, and
attaining a strong increase in per capita terms.9

  Ghana borrowed US$750 millions in 2007 in the form of Eurobonds, of which US$595 millions was disbursed by
January 2009. The proceeds were allocated primarily to support much needed public investments in the electricity
generation and distribution (two areas identified in the 2007 CEM as needing additional investment to sustain
economic growth). In addition, another US$617 million was contracted on nonconcessional terms in 2008.
9
  The sharp increase in public sector salaries, of course, helped the Government to maintain its pro-poor spending as
salary expenditures make up a significant portion of education and health expenditures (more than 90 percent of
health expenditures that go through Ghana's budget, for example, are spent on salaries). In the education sector for
instance, individual remunerations went up annually by 10 percent in real terms over the period 2003-08. Wages
increased even faster in the health sector over the same period.

Energy Sector Reform: Under the 2004 CAS, the energy sector was targeted for substantial
reform as it posed a critical growth bottleneck. Two Bank operations were slated to address the
bottleneck in the energy sector, including the GEDAP (Ghana Energy Development and Access

Project) and the second PRSC series (PRSC-4-5-6).10 Under the PRSCs there was a trigger/prior
action relating to the energy sector under each of the credits. Progress in this policy area was
problematic, however, as the combination of utilities' inadequate cost recovery tariffs with
negative external shocks (rains, oil prices) resulted in substantial losses and additional burden
for public finances during 2006-08. In 2007, electricity shortages significantly affected
economic activity11, but were partially removed afterwards with increased thermal generation
capacity and better rains. Between 2005 and 2008, the proportion of households with access to
electricity increased from 45 to 54 percent.

Under the two Bank operations, reforms in the power sector were expected to occur through two,
inter-related efforts: (i) ensuring the increased efficiency of domestic utility companies ­ the
Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) and the Volta River Authority (VRA) -- by reducing
commercial and system losses through unbundling, improved management, and maintenance
investment; and (ii) the setting up and licensing of an independent operator for the transmission
system that would allow independent power producers to come on line.

Accordingly, PRSC4 supported the settlement of accounts payable to ECG by the water utility
company and government agencies, while PRSC5 supported the earmarking of funds needed for
VRA to subsidize power supply to the aluminum company, VALCO, in the supplemental budget
of 2006. PRSC6 supported actions aimed at restoring ECG and VRA capacities to operate
commercially and cover capital expenditures, but the increase in electricity tariffs in 200712
proved ex-post to be insufficient to offset the negative impact on generation costs of rising oil
prices, declining water reserves, and delays in completing the West African Gas Pipeline. The
severe blackouts of 2006-7 (the result of droughts and poor policies, see Box 1) and the gradual
deterioration in services also made tariffs adjustments increasing challenging politically. As a
result, public subsidies to cover utilities losses mounted, while the Government also continued to
fully finance their investment plans and debt obligations.




10
   It was at the Bank's urging in 2003 that the energy sector was originally included in the PRSC/MDBS policy
matrix, as it was initially opposed by some DPs who argued that the energy sector was not a sufficiently cross-
cutting issue to be included.
11
   It was estimated that the prolonged periods of power outages in 2007 reduced real GDP growth rates by between
0.5 and 1.0 percentage points.
12
   In May 2007, the country's independent public utility regulator (PURC) raised tariffs for non-residential
consumers by around 20 percent, and then again on November 1, 2007, by 35 percent on average. Electricity tariffs
for residential consumers were raised on November 1, 2007, by between 35 and 175 percent, depending on the
customer's electricity consumption levels. In the process of adjusting tariffs, however, the tariff band for low
consumption customers (so called lifeline tariff customers) was widened, lowering the average residential tariff
increase from 44 to 35 percent. In the event, the tariff structure was made more progressive to encourage energy
conservation.

                                 Box 1: Background on the Ghanaian Energy Sector

As noted in the 2008 Ghana Country Economic Memorandum, the Ghanaian energy sector has been characterized
by poor planning, notably: (i) an over- reliance on hydropower, and (ii) an inadequate tariff policy, including tariffs
that were consistently set at levels that did not cover recurrent costs, causing public utility companies to operate in
chronic deficit and requiring associated subsidies. Both of these factors were present in the energy crisis in 2006-
07:

      ·    Over reliance on hydroelectric generation, at the expense of a more cautious management of the water
           levels at the Akosombo dam, resulted in low water levels in the dam during the drought, which led in turn,
           to subsequent shortfalls of an estimated 25 to 30 percent reduction in power supply capacity, necessitating
           the use of more expensive thermal power at a time when global oil prices were rising.
      ·    Subsidies played a role as well. In September 2005, the Government ordered the Volta River Authority
           (VRA) to resume electricity supply to the now state-owned aluminum smelter, the Volta Aluminum
           Company (VALCO) at a price of US$0.027 per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to an average cost of
           around US$ 0.10/ kWh. This placed the financial viability of VRA and, more broadly, the energy sector,
           at risk. Accordingly, as a prior action for the program under PRSC-5, the Government allocated funding
           in its 2006 supplementary budget to compensate the VRA for the difference between the average cost of
           electricity generation and the tariff agreed under the power supply agreement with VALCO.



The Government's failure to meet the energy sector prior action for PRSC-6 led in turn to a
reduction in the credit amount by SDR 6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent at the time). In
2008, ECG and VRA operating ratios improved, on account of declining oil prices13, better rains,
a 40 percent increase in tariffs for large-scale industrial consumers in July of that year, and the
full-year impact of tariff increases of 2007. Nonetheless, significant problems remained in the
energy sector, including slow-to-adjust cost recovery; weak sector planning; oversight and
management; the backlog of debt obligations (between Government, utilities, and the banking
system, including for petroleum product supply); high technical losses in electricity distribution;
and lack of budgetary resources to complete the substantial ongoing committed investments in
the sector. By March 2010, there had been no further adjustment in electricity tariffs despite
significant consumer price inflation and exchange rate depreciation since November 2007.

Financial Sector Developments: Notwithstanding the limited progress in energy sector reforms,
other policy areas under Component 1 were characterized by more success. A number of
measures were successfully introduced to improve the efficiency of the financial sector. The
total share of investment assets managed by regulated private financial institutions was
increased from 25 percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 2006, transferring to the private sector a
greater responsibility for managing these financial assets and, in doing so, helping to mobilize
additional private sector savings for the growth agenda. Also, Parliamentary approval of the
Foreign Exchange Act in 2006, which enabled foreign investors to participate in the secondary
capital market, contributed to deepening capital markets, and the Credit Reporting Act, which
helped reduce the risks of lending and the cost of borrowing. Lastly, Ghana's financial sector
seems to be withstanding the global financial crisis unscathed. Ghana's financial sector (mostly
banks) was not directly affected by the global financial crisis because they were not greatly
exposed to international financial markets on either the asset or liability side,

     Government procured oil directly on behalf of utilities in the first half of 2008 when global prices were peaking.


                                                            27
Private Sector Development and Trade: There was significant progress in this policy area under
this series of PRSCs, with four key indicators showing significant improvements. The share of
private sector in total domestic credit reached 70 percent in 2007 and 83 percent in 2008, up
from around 47 percent in 2002. The simplification of customs procedures and the
operationalization of a remote entry system for customs declarations resulted in a reduction in
the time required to export and import to 19 and 29 days, respectively, in 2008, down from 47
and 55 days in 2005. The number of days required to register a new business fell from 81 days
in 2005 to 33 days in 2008, while the time needed to resolve commercial disputes fell from 80
days in 2007 to 30 in 2008. Consequently, Ghana's standing in the Bank's "ease of doing
business" ranking improved from 82nd out of 155 countries in 2005 to 92th out of 183 countries in
2008. Ghana was also ranked among the top 10 reformers in the ease of doing business for 2006
and 2007. This positive business climate contributed to Ghana's strong export performance and
in the country`s ability to ­ until the global economic crisis intervened -- draw on foreign savings
by tapping the international capital market, attracting external investors to its domestic bond
market, and continuing to receive large remittance inflows from Ghanaians living abroad. This
positive business development has translated, in time, into the strong performance of private
investment and exports, which have increased to 20.5 and 33 percent of GDP at end-2008,
respectively, compared to 18 and 29 percent of GDP at end-2006.

Rural Development and Natural Resource Management: Although agriculture was an important
part of Ghana's economic growth agenda under the GPRS II, progress in this sector was limited,
and can only be measured by the laying of the groundwork for the establishment of the multi-
donor support fund for agriculture, as reflected in the approval of the Food and Agriculture
Sector Development Plan (FASDEP) and by making needed changes to the irrigation policy.
The FASDEP was approved in 2005, and a new irrigation policy, consistent with the new
agricultural development plan, was adopted in 2007. The new policy defined clearer rules for
the operation and maintenance of irrigation facilities, and enshrines the role of water user
associations in the management of irrigation schemes, giving them greater responsibility and
control over the management and maintenance of secondary structures for irrigation. To this
end, approximately 280 farmers from 14 irrigation schemes were provided with training in Joint
Irrigation Management (JISM), and civil works for the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes was
completed at multiple localities. Progress under this element of the PRSCs was intentionally
limited, therefore, as this narrow focus on policies for agricultural development supported a
broader dialogue with the ministry, as recognized by the fact that the Bank joined the special a
multi-donor support fund for agriculture.

Natural resource management under the PRSCs focused, similarly, on a narrow set of new
policies for managing forestry resources, under which increases in forest coverage were
combined with a new Cabinet-approved financial framework for the Forestry Commission (FC)
to ensure: (i) predictable funding for the FC; and (ii) transparency and accountability in the FC's
financial management. The new financial framework for the Forestry Commission aimed at
addressing earlier impediments to the adoption of earlier policies such as the conversion from
timber area leases to timber utilization contracts (TUCs). Delays occurred in carrying out the
inventory of trees in areas eligible for conversion. (These inventories were required to calculate
the timber right fees that would, in turn, be used for determining the value of the TUCs.) These
inventories are time-consuming and expensive to carry out. This made them difficult to carry



                                                28
out, as the Forestry Commission (FC) had lower-than-expected revenues coming from internally
generated funds, as around one half of the FC's internally generated funds were derived from a 3
percent export levy on timber, which the Commission was unable to collect as it was challenged
in court by the timber exporting companies.14 These legal impediments to revenue collection
were removed, and targets were eventually met in this area, allowing the Bank to join other
development partners in developing a separate multi-donor program of general budget support
for natural resource management.
Component 2: Improving Service Delivery for Human Development: The second
component of the program supported by the PRSCs focused on measures aimed at assisting
Ghana reach key MDG goals by improving service delivery in education, health, social
protection, and water and sanitation.

Education: Important progress continued to be made in increasing the access, completion, and
quality of primary education, although issues of quality remain. 15 A large program of
teacher recruitment resulted in an increase in the number of teachers posted in deprived districts,
reducing the number of teacher vacancies by an estimated 40 percent between September 2006
and January 2007, and enabling a number of schools that had closed to be re-opened. The
recruitment drive for teachers in deprived regions did raise issues of the sustainability of the
progress achieved, however. Most of the new recruits came in under the National Youth
Employment Program and were subsequently transferred to the Education budget. Therefore,
sustaining the reduction of teachers vacancies with the drive to increase the number of teachers
posted in deprived requires continued efforts to monitor teacher vacancies in deprived regions
and to adequately fund the education budget with a view to avoid that these numbers creep up
again. Meanwhile, the implementation of district sponsorship schemes for teachers ­ under
which teachers return after training to the districts that sponsored them ­ contributed to a
decrease in primary pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) in poorer districts of two out of three deprived
regions, and reducing PTR regional disparities.

The Gross Primary Enrolment Rate (GPER) continued to rise, as reflected in official statistics,
reaching 95 percent in academic year 2008/09, up from 92.1 percent in 2005/06 and 87.5 percent
in 2004/05, while the net primary enrollment rate went up from 65 to 88 percent during the same
period.16 The national Gender Parity Index (GPI) also showed improvement, rising to 0.96 in

14
   The timber exporting companies challenged in court the government's export levy on timber, and which was used
to help generate funds for the Forestry Commission. As a result, revenues were less than anticipated and the
Forestry Commission had inadequate funds for carrying out the tree inventory in areas eligible for conversion; these
inventories, which are expensive and time-consuming to conduct, were needed to calculate the timber right fees
(TRF) that are used to determine the value of the timber utilization contracts (TUCs) that are part of the
government's policy for managing forestry resources.
15
   As indicated by the fact that the share of students meeting the required grade in the Basic Education Completion
Examination (BECE) varies widely within the country, as well as between genders. Likewise, increased enrollments
place additional demands on the quality of education as newly enrolled students are typically from the deprived
areas and are from poorer families.
16
   As noted in a recent IEG evaluation, a crucial PRSC 4 measure for increasing enrollment was the introduction of
the "capitation grant" to schools and the elimination of all government- and district-controlled fees at primary and
junior secondary level. Though small, these fees posed a real obstacle to enrollment for children from poor families,
with enrollment data pointing to rapid increases after the fees were eliminated in 2005. While the government was
committed to eliminating the fees, the fact that it was a PRSC trigger probably accelerated its implementation, as the
need for PRSC funding pre-empted opposition from the Ministry of Finance. This was a major achievement for the


                                                         29
2006/07, up from 0.95 in 2005/2006 and 0.93 in 2004/05, although this was still below the 1.0
target in the GPRS II. The country appears therefore to be on track to meet the MDG goals of
primary completion and gender parity at school. The number of primary students dropping out of
school or repeating grades also fell during the period covered by the PRSCs, dropping from over
120,000 during 1997 to 2002, to just below 80,000 over the 2001-2006 period, owing to overall
increases in the average level of income and the introduction of capitation grants. Per capita
expenditures on primary education rose by 12 percent in 2006 over 2005, almost twice the 6.7
percent rate of expansion in student enrollment. To ensure that the necessary resources for
effective teaching were available, the execution rate of budgeted non-salary expenditures
increased to 98 percent in 2006, up from 92 percent in 2005. Finally, five Teacher Training
Colleges specializing in the training of mathematics and science teachers were established in
time for the 2007-08 academic year.

Health, Malaria Control, and the HIV/AIDS Program: PRSC-4-5-6 continued the progress
made in the health sector under the first series operations. There was a significant increase (from
9 to 13 million Ghana Cedis) in health care spending on services (item three of the health care
budget) in 2006 over 2005. This 45 percent increase in spending in nominal terms (a 34 percent
increase in real terms) was important because increased spending on health care professionals'
wages and salaries needed to be matched by increased spending on services to enable the greater
availability of vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs if Ghana is to reach the MDGs. Budget
execution also reached high rates, rising to over 80 percent for non-salary expenditures and to
over 100 percent at the district level. Some of this progress can be measured by comparing the
two last demographic and health surveys (DHS) for 2003 and 2008. There was an impressive,
even if belated, improvement in health indicators over this period: (i) the under-5 mortality rate
was reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, (ii) the proportion of malnourished under-5
children was reduced from 18 to 14 percent, and (iii) the proportion of maternal deliveries
supervised by professional medical staff went up from 47 to 59 percent.

Similarly, there was also good progress on reducing the incidence of infectious diseases. The
number of children immunized in 2008 grew by 12,000 over 2007, with 87 percent of children
being immunized. Measles cases fell below 500 for the 2005-07, and no deaths have been
reported for four consecutive years, while Ghana's documentation that the country was polio-
free was accepted by the Africa Regional Commission on Polio certification. Malaria fatalities
continued to decline (to 2.1 percent in 2006, down from 2.3 percent in 2005 and 2.5 percent in
2004, as the use of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITNs) by children under 5 rose to 22 percent
nationally, up from 3.5 percent in 2003. There was also a further decline in the HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate among pregnant women, which dropped to 2.6 percent in 2007, down from 3.6
percent in 2002.)17

While this progress in health indicators happened concomitantly with the continued increase in
coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), it is difficult to determine with a
great degree of confidence the causality chain. The fact is that 55 percent of the population (12

PRSC/Multi-Donor Budget Support process and the Government and also demonstrates how the PRSC can act as a
platform for supporting reform measures that require consensus beyond a specific line ministry.
17
   It is important to note that this decline reflects, part, changes in the UNAIDS methodology for estimating
HIV/AIDS prevalence.


                                                     30
million) was registered in the National Health Insurance Scheme by October 2008, up from 39
percent of the population (7.7 million) at end-2006, and up from 3.6 million at end-2005. Within
the population covered, an estimated 1.2 million people were in the exempt category (i.e.,
children less than 18, pensioners and extreme poor). Similarly, the number of registered NHIS
participants with ID cards almost doubled over the same period, rising to 66 percent of the
population (6.5 million people), up from only 51 percent (3.9 million) of those registered at end-
2006.18 In the meantime, efforts were also made to address the problem of brain drain among
health care professionals, and an additional seven new Health Assistant Training Schools
(HATS) were established, enabling an increase in health care trainees from 444 to 1,020.

Social Protection: Initiatives under social protection initially planned to focus on improving the
targeting of resources for vulnerable group in accordance with the National Social Protection
Strategy (NSPS) published in 2007. As global food prices increased, however, the prime focus
of the social protection strategy shifted under PRSC-6 to offsetting the impact of the price rises
on the poor. Accordingly, the number of households receiving grants under the Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) conditional cash transfer program targeted to the
extreme poor reached more than 8,000 households in 2008,19 up from 2,000 in the regular
program in 2007, although these figures fail to distinguish between regular beneficiaries of the
LEAP program and emergency, sometimes poorly targeted, transfers under the LEAP program.
There was also a scaling up of school feeding programs in 2008, benefiting 987 public schools
with a total number of 477,714 children in all the 170 districts across the country. While it is
still early to assess the full nutritional impact of the program, initial data suggest that it helped
increase enrolment in the schools benefiting from the program, with attendance rising by 19
percent in these schools, against 3 percent elsewhere20.

Water and Sanitation: To broaden access to water and sanitation, one of the most important
infrastructure investments for achieving the MDGs, coverage of water and sanitation was
incorporated into the program supported from PRSC-3 onwards.21 The program supported by
the PRSC-4-5-6 focused on making the water and sanitation policy framework more

18
   Among those registered, the share of elderly (those 70 years and over) and indigents rose from 7.85 percent to 9.0
percent.
24,300 households were registered as regular beneficiaries under the LEAP program by end--October 2009.
Another 6,000 households were benefiting from the LEAP on an emergency basis in response to the 2007-08 floods
in northern Ghana.
20
   Poverty related expenditures include the following expenditures from the Appropriation Act: (i) Education ­ non-
formal education, pre-school, basic education, technical & vocational education, teacher training, and education
management and supervision, plus a fraction of the expenditures on special education (90 percent), general
administration (50 percent), etc ; (ii) Health ­ district health services, regional public health expenditures, oncology
expenditures, funding for the International Red Cross, and health learning materials, plus a fraction of the
expenditures on regional health support services (50 percent), psychiatric hospital (50 percent), regional clinical care
(50 percent), health training institutions (70 percent), institutional care (60 percent), etc ; (iii) Agriculture ­ crop
services provided through the regional agriculture development units and projects funded by IDA; (iv) Works and
Housing ­ the community water and sanitation, rural housing and rural hydrological drainage; (v) Feeder Roads and
Transport ­ feeder roads and road safety; (vi) Energy ­ rural electrification programs; and (vii) Other ­ national
vocational training, social welfare programs, etc.
21
   PRSC-3 introduced a water sector and sanitation strategy after the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
indicated deterioration in infant mortality and under-5 mortality rates between 1997 and 2003. This deterioration
was attributable in part to emerging problems with child malnutrition, as well as to slow progress in increasing
access to safe water sources and to safe sanitation.


                                                          31
programmatic, thus allowing funding from development agencies (which accounts for almost the
totality of the water sector investment in rural areas) to be maintained. To this end, the following
was completed: the National Water Program (NWP) was belatedly approved by Cabinet in 2007;
the 5-year Sector Investment Plan (SIP) for community and small towns' water and sanitation
was updated; the 5-year investment plan for Urban Water was updated; and the National
Sanitation Policy was drafted. Although a water tariff review was completed and new water and
electricity tariffs were announced in 2006, a plan to raise water tariffs on commercial and
industrial users was replaced by a government plan to absorb the higher tariffs. While progress
on the overall planning was limited, the more programmatic approach taken in the water sector
allowed development agencies to increase and/or maintain their contributions to the sector,
leading investments to be made in water supply systems and rural water coverage to increase.
The access rate to safe drinking water increased from 55 percent in 2006 to 76 percent in 2008 in
rural areas. As a result, Ghana is on track to meet the MDG on access to safe water, even if
progress in urban areas is much slower, with a proportion of population with access to safe water
declining from 83 to 79 percent between 2003 and 2008.22 In contrast, Ghana is unlikely to be
able to meet the sanitation MDG. Progress in sanitation has been very slow, with still 82 percent
of the population without access to sanitation facilities in 2008. Lack of progress primarily
reflects lack of public investment. While the capital investments necessary to provide access to
water services are fully subsidized, no subsidies have been contemplated so far for the provision
of sanitation services. This differentiated treatment in the provision of public goods greatly
contributed to the difference in achievement, while in the meantime the urban population and the
demand for sanitation needs has also grown. As the Government plans to promote sanitation
through communication campaigns, it also needs to provide some subsidy for basic capital
investments if Ghana is to improve access to sanitation.

Component 3: Governance, Decentralization, Public Sector Reform, and Public Financial
Management. Under this component gradual progress was made on decentralization and public
sector reform. Significant structural progress was achieved in PFM, yet insufficient to avoid the
very large budget deviations exposed during the 2008 crisis.

Governance: Ghana was the first country in Africa to undergo the Africa Peer Reviewer
Mechanism (APRM) on governance. While the country received a generally positive
assessment, the APRM also noted the need to address a number of issues to ensure good
governance, including removing barriers in access to land and justice, and the clarification and
modernization of the role of the chieftaincy. Surveys by the Afrobarometer indicate that there
has been a decline in public service corruption, and Ghana's ranking in the Transparency
International Perception of Corruption Indicator rose slightly from 70th out of 169 countries to
69th out of 180 in 2007. Ghana's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index also continued to
improve, rising to the 29th position in 2007, ahead of South Africa and Cape Verde, and not far
behind Mauritius and Namibia (both tied for 25th position).

These advances in governance under this second PRSC series reflected several other reforms
efforts that occurred in parallel. First, in the fall of 2008 Parliamentary approval was sought for
the sale of a majority stake in the state-owned telecommunications company (Ghana

22
  The decline in water coverage in urban areas reflects the rapid expansion in urban population during this period,
as well as the slow progress in water sector investment.

Telecommunications), as well as for additional external borrowing that had not been envisioned
at the time of the budget approval.23 Second, renewed attention was given to the enforcement of
the legislation on asset disclosure by high level government officials, which requires that the
President, Vice-President and other senior officials submit a declaration to the Auditor General
before taking office, although the same degree of scrutiny does not appear to have been exercised
at the time when official were leaving office. These procedures were enforced during the
selection of candidates for the December 2008 elections, and the new Government's Cabinet
Ministers have all declared their assets to the Auditor General. Third, there was continued
reduction in the backlog of audited accounts, and the new Government is moving to set up
Internal Audit Units in all MDAs and MMDAs. Fourth, there were follow up actions on these
reports, with the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) active in overseeing the
accounts of MDAs by carrying out public hearings based on the Auditor General's reports
spanning 2002 to 2005. For those accounts where there was found to be wrongdoing, the PAC
submitted their report to the courts for the prosecution led by the Attorney General. In turn,
prosecution started. Yet, the external auditing of the consolidated funds' accounts for the years
2006 and 2007 still awaits their approval by the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee.
Eliminating such backlog would bring back external auditing processes to normalcy.24

Decentralization: The progress in implementation of the government's framework for
decentralized delivery of local public services was piecemeal, relying on separate initiatives
aimed at (i) establishing a mechanisms for District Development Funding (DDF); (ii) designing a
framework for a harmonized capacity building program for local governments, rationalizing the
multiplicity of capacity building projects/programs and ensuring better targeting of these funds;
(iii) preparing composite budget guidelines; and (iv) agreeing on modalities and initiating
development of framework governing intergovernmental fiscal relations, clarifying expenditure
responsibilities and revenue assignments. Also, to strengthen the MMDAs' revenue generating
capabilities the government launched a Municipal Financing and Management Initiative (MFMI)
in 2008 in response to the recommendations of the International Forum on Municipal Finance
and Management held in October 2005. Subsequently a draft Local Government Finance Bill
was submitted to Cabinet and later laid in Parliament for passage into law. The Local
Government Service legislation was adopted by Parliament in mid-2008 aiming at supporting the
devolution of functions and staff to MMDAs. This bill aimed at facilitating the establishment of
a Local Government Finance Authority with a mandate to mobilize resources from both internal
and external sources for MMDAs, and to channel them into productive infrastructure
development and to manage risk. Lastly, there was an across the board increase in local
government funding from the budget by raising the share of the District Assembly's Common
Fund (DACF) in overall tax revenues from 5 to 7.5 percent, as well as by reviewing the sharing
formula of the DACF, in accordance with the Ghanaian Constitution. While these efforts were a
good start to the decentralization agenda, decentralization efforts still need to be deepened in
upcoming years.



23
   It is important to underscore here that advances refer to in this paragraph is the seeking Parliamentary approval for
these deals. This document does not pass judgment on the merits of the deals themselves, not least because the sale
of Ghana Telecommunications is still under scrutiny.
24
   By end-2008, internal audit units had been established in all MDAs and in 268 MMDAs out of 362 (77 percent).


                                                          33
Public Sector Reform: The public sector reform program supported by this second PRSC series
ranged from setting up the institutional arrangements for a new public sector reform strategy to
strengthening payroll management and control. The former included the creation of the Ministry
for Public Sector Reform, the submission of several pieces of legislation to Cabinet and from
there to Parliament, and the launching of a broad outreach program to communicate these
reforms to stakeholders. The latter set of reforms ranged, in turn, from implementing a
comprehensive work plan for the remuneration of senior civil servants to taking steps to setting
up and operationalizing a more modern payroll management and control system that operated
online. The implementation of this second set of reforms was particularly important because
modernizing the payroll system was critical to ensure control over the fastest growing
expenditure item in the budget. The results of the efforts to modernize the payroll system were
limited, however, given the political pressure to increase public sector wages and salaries
following the debt relief provided by HIPC and MDRI. Indeed, despite these reforms, the public
sector wage bill to GDP continued rising, reaching, at end-2008, 11.3 percent of GDP and
accounting for around one quarter of overall expenditures. These end-2008 figures are the result
of the steady rise of the public sector wage bill-to-GDP ratio over the last 20 years, with
particularly sharp increases during the period 2006-08 (Figure 2).25




25
   These increases in the public sector wage bill were reflected in turn in the increases in poverty-reducing
expenditures, since payroll expenditures account for a large share of expenditures on primary health care and on
basic education.

Public Financial Management (PFM): The PRSCs focused on supporting measures aimed at
transforming the budget into a more meaningful tool of economic policy and to increase the
efficiency of budgeted expenditures by enhancing management and information systems and
strengthening public procurement and audit systems.            Two additional modules (Cash
Management and Accounts Receivable) were added under PRSC-5, bringing the total number of
deployed modules to five. However, despite the fact that BPEMS operated in 8 pilot ministries
by the time of the approval of PRSC-6, only a fraction of transactions were processed through it
(e.g., the administrative component of the health budget but not payroll or investment), even
though the system was capable of processing all. Also, a pilot for the Single Treasury Account,
called the consolidated sub-Treasury accounts, was established under PRSC-6. There was more
sustained progress in other areas of public financial management, however. Under the PRSCs,
there was a broadening of the scope of the budget, with greater clarity in the amounts and
allocations of Internally Generated Funds, as well as the inclusion of HIPC and MDRI funds in
the budget and the presentation of the allocations for statutory funds alongside the central
government's budget statement. Meanwhile, the fiscal reports from the Controller and
Accountant General Department (CAGD) of the Ministry of Finance continued to improve in
timing (monthly budget execution reports) and quality (coverage of MDAs and Statutory Funds,
functional classification of expenditures, etc.). Budget execution also became more timely,
including the automatic releases of items 2 (administration) and 3 (services) that began in 2008.

In the area of procurement, actions were taken to comply with the requirements of the new
Public Procurement Act (a PRSC-1-2-3 achievement), including the full establishment of the
Public Procurement Authority (PPA), and the submission of public procurement plans for 22
entities to their respective Entity Tender Committees (ETCs) and to the PPB. Since 2005, the
PPA has focused on enforcing the use of open competition, above a minimum threshold, and on
reviewing authorizing requests from MDAs that want to use less competitive methods. In 2008,
97.6 percent of the procurement contracts for high spending, above the minimum threshold level,
were awarded competitively. 26 In addition, in 95.2 percent and 81.6 percent of the cases the

   The degree of adherence and compliance with public procurement rules is uncertain in the absence of a
monitoring system of procurement by value. In 2007, one fourth of transactions were subject to competitive
bidding, down from one-half in 2006, according to the first two National Procurement Assessment reports from the


                                                      35
information on upcoming tenders and contract awards was made available on the PPA website.
Finally, the procedures for examining award complaints, which had been established in 2007,
continued operating at the Public Procurement Authority. The Government also took steps to
ensure that Procurement Plans were completed and submitted in a timely fashion by including
this as a requirement in the 2008 budget guidelines. Despite some notable improvements, a
number of weaknesses remain in the procurement area, necessitating the new Government to
undertake a number of measures in 2009 to raise the degree of compliance with the respect to the
PPA.27

Finally, Government audit capabilities were strengthened as the Internal Audit Agency (IAA)
was made operational in key MDAs, and Internal Audit Units (IAUs) were made functional in
nine government entities.28 The IAA also carried out special audit assignments during 2007,
including the confirmation of bank account balances of the MDAs and MMDAs, and the
monitoring of procurement compliance and the facilitation of the audit of the internally
generated funds (IGFs) of 28 public institutions, including 10 MDAs. There was also a
continued reduction in the backlog of audited accounts, including follow up public hearings by
the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) based on the Auditor General's reports for
2002 to 2005, and the commencement of prosecution for those accounts showing financial
malfeasance. Progress on building the internal audit capacity in MDAs was mixed, however,
and there are still weaknesses in the timely receipt of reports and follow-up actions, and, as
indicated above, the external auditing of the consolidated funds' accounts for the years 2006 and
2007 still awaits approval by the PAC.29

However, the fast rise in expenditures in 2008 revealed several important weaknesses in Public
Financial Management. Owing to a lack of transparency, some large budgetary deviations from
planned expenditures were not apparent to the public, Parliament, the IFIs, and the DPs.
Additional funds from proceeds from the Eurobond issued in 2007, which had been earmarked in
the 2007 supplementary budget, were deposited at the Bank of Ghana, but continued financing
expenditures for which they had been earmarked into 2008. The pressure for electoral
expenditure lead to budget deviation in 2008 and exposed the remaining weaknesses in the areas
of payroll management and control, as well as the public access to information and Parliament's
oversight of major budget revisions within Ghana's fiscal year, and external audit effectiveness.
Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E): M&E was an original policy area under Component 3. To avoid
repetition, however, M&E progress is discussed below in Section 2.3, Monitoring & Evaluation.
                     Table 2: Progress against Triggers and Proposed Actions


PPB. However, the two estimates are not entirely comparable because the sample for the 2006 assessment is
skewed toward larger public sector entities, more likely to follow competitive processes, while the sample of entities
reviewed in the 2007 assessment contained a large number of entities procuring smaller amounts and therefore
relying disproportionally on price quotation as a procurement method.
27
   Including the establishment of a system to monitor and report on a real time basis the value of most public
procurement transactions.
28
   These entities were the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of Education and the Ghana
Education Service, the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry
of Food and Agriculture, as well as in two MMDAs.
29
   The delays in the PAC approval of external audits are due to the court case against the Auditor General, which, at
the time of the writing of this report, was not yet resolved. The latter reflects in turn weaknesses in the judicial
system in ruling a seemingly straightforward (but highly politicized) case.

2.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Six sets of factors affected the implementation of these operations. They were:

The Government wavered in its committed to the reform program, especially as the 2008
elections drew closer. As with the previous series of operations, the focus on programmatic
lending entailed in the PRSC process needs to be grounded in clear country commitment and
capacity to reform. While the Government's ownership of the programs supported by the PRSC-
4-5-6 was reflected in its alignment with the GPRS II ­ for which the preparation was led by the
Government, the Government understood that the GPRS II was considered as a `living
document', with the agenda moving forward to balance the broad principles enshrined in the
GPRS II and the more immediate Government needs. These circumstances led to commitments
that reflected the borrower's predicaments but that in hindsight were less credible.

The background analysis supporting the reform program was extensive but not always
timely. While this series of operations was expected to be informed by the conclusions and
recommendations of an extensive body of analysis conducted over multiple years (see Table 4
overleaf), in practice these studies were completed after most of the annual agreements reached
under the MDBS/PRSC. Also, the principal authors of the documents limited their responsibility
to completing them, rather than contributing to the policy dialogued carried out under the
MDBS/PRSC. Finally, there was limited effort to align the views of all the development
agencies contributing to the MDBS, so the conclusions of these results were perceived by some
of the participating agencies as the World Bank's views on the subject under study, rather than a
commonly shared view. That said, the PRSCs were still central to the Bank's FY04 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) as well as the FY06 CAS Progress Report (CAS-PR), which



                                                         42
reaffirmed that the strategy laid out in the CAS continued to be relevant to the Bank's program in
Ghana and that the PRSCs would remain an integral part of the Bank's support strategy. 30

Donor coordination. The first GPRS created the momentum for a significant group of Ghana's
development partners to align their assistance through a common framework, beginning in 2003.
The resulting Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) group was established to improve
harmonization among Ghana's key DPs, and provided a framework for policy dialogue and
decisions linked to progress on the implementation of Ghana's poverty reduction efforts (see
Box 2). Under this framework, the DPs carried out joint MDBS/PRSC missions, reached a
collective agreement with the Government of Ghana on a joint matrix of policy actions, and
aligned almost all aspects of their M&E frameworks (except those regarding the use of outcome
indicators as a basis for disbursement). The MDBS endeavored to increasingly focus on the
cross-cutting issues, as well as policy actions that either had economy-wide implications or
required collaboration between Government agencies.

In practice however the transaction costs of operating the MDBS were high. The increasing
number of partners, with competing agendas, made coordination costs high and the existing
structure too rigid and slow in responding to unfolding developments. A simpler, more flexible
approach, which would allow Development Partners to participate in the group without having to
agree to one-size-fits-all' matrix would greatly reduce transaction costs and free more time for
the policy dialogue. The rigidity of the current process driven by the sole bottom-up supply of
triggers and targets by sector working groups could also be reduced through a complementary
top-down approach by allowing the PAF to focus more heavily on cross-cutting issues and make
it thus more strategic. The possibility to re-visit the PAF within a year due to the emergence of
severe shocks (or changing priorities is also to be retained.31

   Namely, the importance of (i) the prudent management of public finances to ensure macroeconomic stability for
growth and to preserve the funding for the social sectors; (ii) investing in human capital to mitigate the situation of
chronic and persistent poverty among a large number of households, especially in view of the ongoing process of
urbanization; (iii) targeting women and children in the delivery of education and health services (including nutrition
programs); and (iv) sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for maintaining the long-term trends in growth,
urbanization, and poverty reduction.
31
   For the first time since 2006, a Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS) retreat was organized to reflect on the
effectiveness of the process. The MDBS retreat involved a series of meetings: meetings with sector working groups,
a 2-day workshop between Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, National Development Planning
Commission and MDBS Development Partners (the retreat proper), and a high-level forum to present and validate
retreat conclusions to policy makers, the press and CSOs. Recommendations included among others (i) the need to
introduce greater flexibility in the PAF to allow for the inclusion of triggers addressing unforeseen shocks to
preserve PAF longer term objectives, (ii) the need to revamp sector working groups through greater participation of
Ministries' Chief Directors, and (iii) the need for more frequent high level dialogue over the year (parallel to the
establishment of an early warning system to monitor progress on the PAF), beyond the formal Consultative Group
meeting.

                   which validated the policy directions proposed in the GPRS I and supported by the PRSCs.
                   Poverty and social impact analyses (PSIAs) conducted by the Government of Ghana and its DPs
                   on: (i) tackling vulnerability and exclusion; (ii) the economic transformation of the agriculture
                   sectors; (iii) power sector reforms and setting electricity tariffs; and (iv) decentralization and
                   pro-poor service delivery.
                   Poverty update for PRSC-5 draws on preliminary results of the 2006 Ghana Living Standards
                   Survey (GLSS-5) and identifies trends in poverty and human development. These findings
                   appear to validate the policy directions outlined in the GPRS II and supported by this series of
                   PRSCs.

There were, nevertheless, aspects of harmonization that positively contributed to the success of
the PRSC-4-5-6 and the Government's poverty reduction efforts in a number of ways (Box 2).
These positive contributions included: increasing the predictability of donor inflows;32 reducing

32
  Between 2003 and 2006 annual Multi-Donor disbursements have been within 5 percent of pledges except for one
year, when it was still within 10 percent. Predictability was further strengthened in 2007 as the MDBS moved to a


                                                        44
the Government's transaction costs of working with multiple donors; improving the coordination
among the DPs33; and increasing the Government's accountability for service delivery The
MDBS framework was an important contributor to the successful implementation of the GPRS I
and an important, albeit less successful, framework for policy dialogue and decisions linked to
the progress in GPRS II implementation. This was possible because, over time, the structure of
the MDBS evolved to increasingly mitigate some of the transaction costs that usually arose in
multi-donor settings. For example, the MDBS reduced the cost of collective action by devising
rules that allowed all the development agencies to increase their share of the contribution coming
through the MDBS, instead of through large projects and off-budget disbursements. Also, a
number of sectoral strategies that were aligned with the GPRS were developed in the context of
the MDBS, including the Private Sector Reform Strategy, the Private Sector Development
Strategy, the Education Sector Development Strategy, and the revised Food and Agriculture
Sector Development Strategy. Since the objective of this post-structural adjustment approach to
financing development was based on improving the quality of high-level dialogue on policy
choice and implementation, further simplifying and flexibilizing the workings of the MDBS will
be an important step in achieving this objective.

The PRSCs were integral to a program with other Bank operations. Other investment
operations acted in parallel with the PRSCs by providing financial and technical assistance in
areas ranging from health, private sector development, energy, roads, telecommunications, water
and sanitation, and other infrastructure operations.34 The complementarity between the PRSC
and these other Bank operations was reflected in the sharing of information between the teams,
as well as the differences in the focus audiences for these operations. While the PRSC focused
on policy actions that required the involvement of either the entire Cabinet or a subset of
ministers, the Investment Operations focused mostly on actions involving one sector minister
and the agencies of a given ministry.




"year-plus-one" basis so that any assistance that was withheld owing to non-compliance takes effect in the financial
year after that in which the break occurs. This strong year-on-year predictability has been a valuable contributor to
strengthening macroeconomic management and fiscal planning.
33
    A recent IEG study of the PRSCs concluded that "Based on the views of donors and Government, the
PRSC/Multi-Donor Budget Support achieves high scores as an instrument for donor harmonization ... Overall, the
depth and quality of donor coordination in Ghana appears to be close to best practice."
34
   These projects included the Education Sector Project (US$78m, FY04) to address and promote equitable access
to, and efficient delivery of, quality services at basic and higher levels; a second MAP for Ghana (US$20m, FY06 to
help address HIV/AIDS; the Public Sector Capacity Building/Private and Financial Sector Development TA
(US$20m, FY06) combine support for public sector reform with private and financial sector development; and a
project providing advisory and business development services for micro, small and medium enterprises through the
IDA-IFCMSME (US$25m., FY05); the Ghana Energy Development and Access project (GEDAP, US$120 million,
FY08-12); the Land Administration project (LAP, $US$20.5 million, FY03-08); the Economic Management
Capacity Building project (EMCB, US$25 million, FY06-11), and the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise project
(MSME, US$45 million, FY06-10).

                       Box 2: Ghana's Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) Program

     Ghana was one of the first countries to participate in the preparation in a joint donor matrix to underpin the
     budget support disbursement of multiple donors, and the MDBS program has been in operation in Ghana
     for six years. The objective of the program is to provide more harmonized assistance to Ghana with a view
     to accelerating implementation of the GPRS. Initially comprised of six bilateral partners (Canada,
     Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), and three multilateral
     partners (the World Bank, European Commission, and the African Development Bank), the MDBS
     subsequently expanded to include France in 2008 and Japan in 2008. The United States and UN agencies
     participate as observers. MDBS DPs have provided general budget support of about US$300m annually to
     assist the Government's efforts in implementing the GPRS. Within the MDBS the PRSCs have accounted
     for 30 to 40 percent of general budget support provided to Ghana in most years.

     A Framework Memorandum, signed in June 2003 between the Government and the DPs and modified in
     2008, sets out the principles of the program. The MDBS includes the identification with the Government of
     a selective joint matrix of policy actions, including triggers and benchmarks, to be supported by DPs,
     aligning their monitoring and evaluation frameworks through a common rolling 3-year Progress
     Assessment Framework (PAF). In order to do so, DPs have established several sector groups to carry out
     the dialogue at that level and inform the MDBS on issues ranging from education and health to energy and
     private sector development to be considered in the PAF. Each year, the bilateral and EU partners agree on
     the arrangements for a base and a performance tranche, while the World Bank's single tranche PRSCs is
     disbursed against the country's performance on agreed prior actions.


While implementation of the MDBS-PRSC program was aided by strong export
commodity prices, it was undermined by loose fiscal policy management and external
events. Favorable commodity prices for Ghana's chief exports, gold and cocoa, combined with
record cocoa crops in 2006, contribute positively to economic growth and macroeconomic
performance. The country exposed its vulnerability and was negatively affected, however, by
several exogenous factors, including the drought in late-2006 and 2007, a sharp global food and
oil price increases in 2008, and the global economic crisis in 2008 and 2009.

The sustainability of the PRSC 4-5-6 outcomes were, as a result, challenged in 2008 by
some risks that eventually materialized. First are the delays in energy sector reforms, a risk
which had been anticipated, as discussed above. While energy sector reform and tariff
adjustments in Ghana have always been problematic, a failure to anticipate the unusual juncture
of drought and high oil prices ­ in combination with inadequate energy policies and the political
sensitivity of raising tariffs -- was not unreasonable. The steep rise in world market prices for
petroleum products, coupled with delays in raising domestic electricity tariffs and the increase
reliance on thermal-electric power generations, left the country vulnerable to an external shock.
Also, the possibility that severe fiscal deficits might arise as a result from the granting of public
sector wage increases in an election year was also not appropriately foreseen. At first glance, the
failure to anticipate this possibility was less reasonable, as Ghana has a long history of
electorally induced financial problems and this possibility had been correctly identified as a risk
in the previous series of operations. 35 The global financial crisis, with the resulting closure of

35
   As the ICR on PRSC-1-2-3 noted, "The risk of electorally-induced economic slippages was correctly identified
[for PRSC-1 and PRSC-2], incorporating the lessons learned from previous election cycles in Ghana" Poor
economic management, --including higher overspending leading to fiscal imbalances and higher inflation and a
slowing in the pace of structural reforms -- preceded the elections in 1992, 1994 and 2000.


                                                          46
international financial markets for Ghana and its impact on commodity prices, could not have
been anticipated, however. The crisis did trigger nevertheless many of the risks identified in Box
3 below, as the slowdown in growth, exposed the country's vulnerabilities due to external
shocks, delays in carrying out needed energy sector reforms and increased public sector
spending.


                               Box 3: Key Risks Identified in PRSC 4-5-6

There were six main risks to the implementation of the reform program supported by these PRSCs:
 Further delays in carrying out the needed reforms in the energy sector, including tariff adjustments, the
    removal of transmission bottlenecks, and increasing power supply capacity.
 The large size of the public sector, which might compromise the sustainability of the economic
    expansion by limiting private sector growth and by reducing the scope for fiscal management.
 A possible disconnect between increased health spending and improved health due to weaknesses in
    the health administration.
 Delays in structural reforms aimed at raising productivity throughout the economy, which could
    compromise long term growth prospects. These included, in addition to energy sector reforms
    identified above, the business environment reforms, the land administration reforms aimed at ensuring
    greater security of land tenure, and natural resource management reforms designed to increase
    transparency in the allocation of these resources and at ensuring the long term sustainability of natural
    resource assets.
 The risk of debt distress resulting from a slowdown in growth, because of either an external shocks
    (e.g., a worsening in the terms of trade), or a disruption in the domestic economy (e.g., an election
    induced increase in the public sector deficit) and an increased levels of non-concessional borrowing.
 Remaining fiduciary weaknesses that might limit the impact of the program and lead to only partial
    funding from development partners.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design: As part of the process of implementing the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS), a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan was adopted with the goal of
facilitating the tracking of progress of policy implementation and effectiveness, as well as to
identify bottlenecks associated with the implementation of the strategies for early resolution. The
output from this M&E effort has been documented and widely disseminated through the Annual
Progress Reports (APRs) of the GPRS. The key elements of the M&E system for the GPRS II
included: (i) developing an institutional arrangements that can support a sustainable monitoring
and evaluation processes; (ii) establishing special indicators to facilitate tracking of the HIPC
and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); (iii) studies to enhance the knowledge and data
base for the conduct of objective impact analysis (i.e. PSIAs); and (iv) ensuring a holistic and
participatory approach to M&E. The M&E system for the PRSC 4-5-6 relied on the broader
M&E system for the GPRS as well as the harmonized MDBS regular monitoring framework.

M&E Implementation: The Government's Annual Progress Report (APR) aimed at providing
the key platform for the M&E of progress towards the GPRS's poverty reduction targets, and
consequently the PRSC 4-5-6 outcomes. APRs were published, albeit with considerable delay,
for three consecutive years of the PRSC-4-5-6, and the breadth of the information reported and




                                                         47
the quality of the assessments has continued to improve. 36 The delays in preparing the APRs
meant, however, that they were completed too late to provide inputs to the yearly MDBS-PRSC
assessment of the GPRS.37 The only positive outcomes that are associated with the annual
APRs, as part of the process of monitoring and evaluating the GPRS II, was that they were
disseminated through workshops organized in all 10 regions to discuss the reports' highlights as
well as to obtain stakeholders' feedback to so to inform decision making. M&E implementation
also occurred through the use of Citizens' Assessment surveys, which provide an opportunity for
citizens to participate in the GPRS II M&E. These were used to complement the quantitative
data collected by the MDAs and the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies
(MMDAs). Two such surveys were conducted under the GPRS I, and the third ­ conducted in
2008 under the GPRS II ­ focused on the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

Other forms of M&E implementation include the establishment of the National Strategy
for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) to develop a formal statistics structure and improve
official statistics so to provide a quantitative basis for informed decision-making. The
development of the NSDS framework utilized inputs from stakeholders in the national statistical
system (data suppliers, statistics producers, statistics users, training institutions, local and
international organizations and development partners) to ensure effectiveness in the
implementation of the strategic plan, and a series of workshops were organized for the MDAs
and Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) strategic plan design team from in 2008 to review, cost, and
finalize the sector and national strategic plans.

Finally, the Government established an Evidence Based Policy Making Programme aimed
at strengthening the government's effectiveness in policy, program and project
implementation. The EBPM commenced in 2007 and in 2008 a series of meetings were held
among key monitoring institutions38 to encourage collaboration and improve the harmonization
of the existing monitoring process. One of the outcomes of the meeting was the adoption of a set
of planning and reporting templates to facilitate M&E across the board.

Nevertheless, after several years of implementing the M&E plan for the GPRS II, the M&E
system continues to be challenged by severe institutional and technical capacity constraints
and fragmented set of uncoordinated information, both at the national and sub-national levels.
The two key institutions in developing this M&E system, the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC) and the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), continue to depend on the
existing systems of MDAs, who are the primary sources of information. These systems which
have been in place over different time spans reflect a variety of approaches to sector specific
monitoring and varying degrees of success.

M&E Utilization: The PRSCs were designed to encourage the utilization of M&E results. By
using human development indicators to monitor the poverty outcomes of sector programs, it was

36
   For example, M&E reporting has expanded to include new areas, such as Information and Communications
Technology; however, as the JSAN on the 2006 APR notes, the reporting system still lacks focus on results in some
of these new areas, as few indicators or outcomes are stated (particularly in the governance area).
37
   The delays in preparing the APRs reflect in turn the lack of synchrony between the reporting cycles of the
Ghanaian ministries, the timing of the MDBS-PRSC assessments, and the preparation of the APRs.
38
   Including the NDPC, MOFEP, the GSS, the Public Procurement Authority, Internal Audit Agency and the Office
of the President.


                                                       48
anticipated that the Government's allocation of resources would increasingly begin to reflect the
feedback provided through this M&E. While this has increasingly been the case, further
progress is still needed on M&E utilization. As noted in the 2008 Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) on the Government's 2006 APR "a more refined M&E framework could contribute
toward bringing existing frameworks (e.g., the Ghana Partnership and Resources Agreement and
the MDBS policy matrix) in line with the GPRS II, and should be a factor in strengthening
evidence-based policy making in Ghana."

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

In response to the economic crisis emerging in late 2008 and the change of government in
February 2009, an Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC) was approved
in May 2009. A stand-alone operation was selected owing to both the country's urgent need for
financial assistance and the focus of the new administration on stabilization issues. This two-
tranche, SDR 193.8 million (US$300 million equivalent) credit was designed to support the
authorities' efforts, in the midst of the ongoing global financial crisis, to bring their fiscal stance
to a sound and sustainable track, and to protect the development objectives set in GPRS II for the
period 2006-2009. While the EGPRC primarily translated into funding for the GPRS II
implementation, particular attention was given to (i) restoring budgetary discipline, (ii) tackling
long-standing public sector and energy issues, and (iii) protecting the poor and the gains from the
      39
past.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives, design, and implementation of these operations was relevant to current country
and global priorities and to the Bank's assistance strategy, as follows.

PRSC Objectives: As discussed in Section 1.2, Original Program Development Objectives
above, the PRSCs' development objectives were relevant as they directly mirrored the objectives
and components in the Government's poverty reduction strategy as laid out in the GPRS II.

PRSC Design: The design of these operations was relevant to Ghana and the GPRS-II. This
series of operations built on the prior set of successful operations (PRSC-1-2-3), and the PRSCs
were central to the Bank's FY04 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ghana, the 2006 CAS-
PR, and the 2007 CAS all of which had a consistent strategy and focus. The Bank's strategy to
progressively increase the share of assistance developed programmatically through the PRSCs
became important to the Bank's FY04-07 CAS and accounted for around 50 percent of overall
Bank lending during the CAS period. The CAS itself was firmly rooted in the Strategic
Framework for IDA in Africa (SFIA) and the West Africa Regional Integration Assistance
Strategy. The CAS was also properly driven by the PRSP and was developed through extensive

39
   The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness in July 2009. The Government plans to complete all second
tranche release actions in Q3 FY10, including large consultations on the oil and gas regulatory and fiscal
frameworks.


                                                      49
consultations with Government, stakeholders, and civil society. As a result, it was closely
aligned with the GPRS program and focus. The CAS' close alignment with the GPRS and
GPRS II was acknowledged in the CAS Progress Report (discussed by the Board in June 2006)
which confirmed that the strategy laid out in 2004 could continue to guide the Bank's program
for Ghana.

As noted previously, the reform program associated with this operation was also relevant to the
borrower's development priorities and circumstances. It was built directly on the Government's
GPRS II, thus establishing some ownership by drawing on the Government's own priorities. By
channeling resources through the budget, the MDBS fostered decision-making by the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning, Cabinet, and Parliament, giving these entities a greater stake in
the pro-poor agenda, sound financial management, and decision-making; thereby enhancing
domestic accountability. In addition, the decisions on which would be the triggers/prior actions
for each operation were made with the Government and drew from the 30 benchmarks that were
identified during the policy dialogue carried out at the sectoral level. The benchmarks/triggers
selected reflected the Government's own policy documents (e.g., GPRS II, sector strategy
documents).

The number of triggers/prior actions was deliberately limited to 8 for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5.
While there were 11 triggers/prior actions for PRSC-6, these were chosen in coordination with
the Government and the entire set of MDBS partners, and their satisfactory implementation
would trigger the disbursements from all MDBS partners. As seen in Table 2 above, the prior
actions show a consistent unfolding of a reform package designed to support the implementation
of the GPRS, and ensuring a high level of continuity from operation to operation.

Program design also incorporated a detailed policy matrix that set forth the government's reform
strategies, progress indicators, and expected outcomes for each of the three operations and which
was developed at the outset of the series of operations. An additional schedule detailed the
relationship between specific PRSC measures and the MDGs and indicated the anticipated PRSC
outcomes that would contribute to meeting the MDGs. The lending mechanism used --
budgetary support through a MDBS framework -- had already demonstrated its effectiveness in
the Ghanaian context under PRSC-1-2-3. The program documents for each credit demonstrated
how program design satisfied the Bank's "Good Practice Principles on Conditionality," and these
credits were also informed by both the general lessons learned from the first series of
operations,40 as well as by the need to address certain delays in meeting the targets for the GPRS
I health indicators.41
PRSC Implementation. Policies supported by PRSC-4 built on reforms implemented under
PRSC-3. The first component of PRSC-4 focused on actions aimed at ensuring progress in
attaining macroeconomic stability. Measures focused on (i) settling ECG accounts receivable

40
   Namely, the importance of Government ownership of the reform program and a recognition of the very high
returns that result from increasing harmonization among Ghana's DP partners around the MDBS framework.
41
   Accordingly, PRSCs 4-5-6 placed greater emphasis on strengthening the links between intervention in the health
and water sectors (in order to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases), as well as the links between health and
nutrition interventions (to reduce infant and under 5 mortality rates, since child malnutrition accounted for up to 60
percent of the child mortality cases.)



                                                         50
from MDAs and the Ghana Water Company (GWC) within 90 days; and (ii) further reducing the
time required to register new businesses. This component also supported measures to improve
the performance of the rural sector through the revision of the government's Food and
Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP). In the area of natural resources
management, attention shifted towards the more pressing issues relating to the management of
forestry resources.

The second component incorporated measures aimed at assisting Ghana reach the MDG goals
by improving service delivery in education and health. The measures to improve service
delivery in education focused on eliminating district-levies and extending capitation grants to all
pupils attending primary and junior secondary public schools. Measures to improve the delivery
of health services centered on bridging the equity gaps in the access to health care serves by
increasing the registry of indigents in the National Health Insurance Scheme and by scaling up
the provision of anti-viral combination therapy (ART) to people with advanced HIV.

The third component of PRSC-4 incorporated measures designed to strengthen governance and
public sector management. These actions included ratifying the United Nations and the African
Union Anti-Corruptions, including HIPC funds with allocations by MDAs in the budget
proposal, and ensuring that the provisions of the Public Procurement Act were implemented and
applied..

Policies supported by PRSC-5 also built on the reform agenda of the previous PRSCs. The first
component of PRSC-5 focused on structural reforms that supported growth and macroeconomic
stability. Measures under this component focused on (i) increasing the share of SSNIT
investment assets managed by regulated private financial institutions; (ii) eearmarking in the
upcoming 2006 supplementary budget the funds necessary to compensate the Volta River
Authority (VRA) for the difference between the weighted average cost of electricity production
in Ghana and bulk power supply agreed in the VRA interim power supply agreement with the
Volta Aluminium Company (VALCO); and (iii) carrying out an inventory of plantation forests,
providing the needed information for at least one auction of timber utilization contracts in 2006.

The second component of PRSC-5 incorporated measures aimed at improving service delivery
in education and health. The measures for improving service delivery in education focused in
the three most deprived regions (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West), while the measures to
improve the delivery of health services centered scaling up expenditures on health to accelerate
progress toward achieving the MDGs. These measures included: (i) reducing the share of
teacher vacancies in deprived districts, and (ii) ensuring that (a) the Government of Ghana
allocation to the health sector was increased to compensate for the reduction in donor
contribution to the health fund; (b) higher rates of budget execution of the non-salary health
budget, and of the district level allocations..

The third component of PRSC-5 incorporated measures designed to strengthen public sector
management. These actions included (i) measures to deepen payroll management and control;
(ii) carrying out a bank accounts restructuring in all MDAs, RCCs, and MMDAs, so that the new
sub consolidated fund bank accounts embraced revenue and expenditure from GoG internally
generated funds, and the funds from external projects that did not require separate bank accounts;

and (iii) having public procurement plans for a sizeable sample of entities submitted to the PPB
soon after the approval of the budget; (iv) having information on upcoming tenders and contract
awards available on the PPB website; and (v) setting up procedures for examining awards
complaints at the PPB.

Policies supported by PRSC-6 further refined the reform agenda of the previous PRSCs. The
first component of PRSC-6 focused on structural reforms that supported private and sustainable
growth. Measures completed under this component focused on (i) developing a customized ease
of doing business survey to measure progress on PSD reforms, including information on the time
required to register new businesses; and (ii) developing a Cabinet agreed financial framework for
the Forestry Commission (FC) to ensured (a) the predictable funding for the FC and (b) the
transparency and accountability in financial management, including budget execution. The
agreed prior action committing government support to the power utility companies, ECG and
VRA, with actions aimed at restoring these companies' capacity to operate commercially, and
carrying out needed investment and meeting working capital needs was never met, however ­ a
sign of the difficulty the country was having in the face of rising crude oil prices in international
markets.

The second component of PRSC-6 incorporated goals for increasing the expansion of primary
education, as well as goals for broadening the use of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITNs) and for
increasing spending in public health. The measures for setting new goals for the provision of
education service included: (i) raising the National Gross Primary Enrolment Rates (GPER) in
Academic Year 2006/07, with no deterioration in national Gender Parity Index (GPI); and (ii) the
increase in the per student expenditure in primary education. The measures in public health
included (i) increasing the utilization of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITNs) by children under 5
years, and (ii) increasing in absolute terms the spending on item three of the health budget
(services).

The third component of PRSC-6 focused on measures designed to strengthen public sector
management. These actions included: (i) the formulation of a comprehensive decentralization
policy; (ii) the realignment of the treasuries at the six pilot MDAs;42 and (iii) continuing to
ensure that the provisions of the Public Procurement Act are fully implemented.

Other IDA lending: Finally, the PRSCs were complemented by the implementation of a series of
specific investment and technical assistance operations, covering the education sector,
HIV/AIDS, public sector reform, and finance and private sector development. In addition,
PRSC-6 was complemented by two sector-focused DPLs (Agriculture and Natural Resources
Environmental Governance), which was the Bank's contribution to the MDBS sector groups that
conducted most of the policy dialogue with the government in these sectors. Non-lending
activities were designed to provide the analytical underpinnings for the PRSCs' support to
strengthening fiduciary arrangements, including ERPFMs, CFAAs, and CPARs.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

42
  The six MDAs that have been selected for the pilot program are: the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Education, Sports and Science, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Ministry of
Lands, Forestry and Mines, and the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Environment.

PDO Achievements: As detailed in Section 2.1 (Program Performance), PRSC-4-5-6 achieved
the following results under each program development objective:

      (i) Accelerating private sector-led growth: This component focused on ensuring solid
      macroeconomic performance; enacting energy sector reforms; improving financing for
      development; eliminating barriers to private sector development and trade; and
      encouraging rural development and natural resource management. Progress towards this
      goal was very strong in the area of financing development and removing barriers to private
      sector development and trade, while progress in the areas of rural development and natural
      resource management focused on laying the groundwork for separate multi-donor budget
      support instruments. Meanwhile the most lasting contribution to energy sector reforms was
      the amendment of the legal framework for the Volta River Authority to allow the setting up
      of an independent operator for the transmission system. Otherwise, progress on energy
      reforms was limited to instances where electricity tariffs were brought closer to cost
      recovery levels, albeit against the backdrop of fast rising petroleum prices in international
      markets, and to ensuring needed budget support to the energy utility companies to offset
      delays in these tariff adjustments. These delays in adjusting tariffs to cost recovery levels
      deepened, however, the financial difficulties of the utility companies, postponing needed
      investments and contributing to the Governments already widening fiscal imbalance.
      These fiscal imbalances left the country very vulnerable to the external shocks that
      happened in 2008 (rising food and petroleum prices, as well as the global financial crisis),
      disrupting macroeconomic management.

       (ii) Improving service delivery for human development: Progress towards the PRSP's
      priority sectors ranged from gains in education sector enrollment, belated improvements in
      health indicators, the extension in social protection, and increased coverage in access to
      safe water in rural areas.43 The PRSCs contributed to these outcomes by enabling the
      Government to increase spending in these areas while (until late-2007 and 2008)
      contributing to maintaining macroeconomic stability.

      (iii) Improving governance, decentralization, and public sector reform: There was more
      progress in public financial management than in governance, decentralization and public
      sector reform. This disparity in achievements was due to the complexity of the reforms in
      these latter areas and likely related to the challenging political economic aspects of the
      reforms. Also, while there were some positive developments in public financial
      management (broadening the scope of the budget, consolidating treasury accounts,
      implementing the new public procurement law, setting up internal audit procedures,
      broadening the tax revenue net, and increasing Parliamentary oversight over public
      accounts), an unfinished agenda was still left behind. For instance, while there was a
      consolidation of sub-treasury accounts began during the PRSC period, the establishment of

43
   Although it is important to note that the contribution of the MDBS-PRSC was primarily in instigating the
Government to adopt a programmatic approach to water sector investment in rural areas, since most of these
investment were funded by contributions from development partners.

the Single Treasury Account (STA) happened only at the time of the EGPRC. Also,
although efforts were made to establish and make operational the Public Procurement
Authority (PPA), the Government is yet to establish a direct link between budget releases
and approved procurement plans that reflect the Appropriations Act.

Notwithstanding the limited progress in some of the PRSC components, it should be noted that
the moderately satisfactory performance of PRSC-4-5 and the Moderately Unsatisfactory
performance of PRSC-6 followed on the satisfactory performance of PRSC-1-2-3, for a
combined total of six years of relatively positive performance in the areas of private sector
development, several of the areas relevant for achieving the MDGs (education, health, social
protection, and water and sanitation), as well as some visible progress in areas of governance and
public financial management. The progress under the PRSCs can be measured through
significant gains across a wide of range of indicators, as shown in Table 5 above, and the fact
that Ghana is on track to achieve the MDGs in income poverty, hunger, primary completion,
gender parity at school and access to water (recent progress recorded in child (MDG4) and
maternal mortality (MDG5), while obviously welcome, is not sufficient to put Ghana on track to
                                        44
meet these MDGs by 2015, however). These outcomes are commendable, and show the real
gains that can be made in poverty reduction if macroeconomic growth is maintained and a
concerted and consistent reform effort is made over an extended number of years.

3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating:

PRSC-4 Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC-5 Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC-6 Moderately Unsatisfactory

While the PRSCs' objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes were relevant to country
circumstances and development priorities and were consistent with Bank strategies and goals,
progress was limited in a number of policy areas. Although GDP growth was consistently high,
severe macroeconomic imbalances emerged in 2008 that threatened some of the poverty
reduction gains made in previous years (discussed below). In 2008 there was limited progress in
PFM matters given the magnitude of the problems that eventually emerged, especially regarding
budget execution. Similarly, while the government did belatedly introduce cost-recovery energy
tariffs and the fragility of the energy supply was addressed by new investments in thermal
capacity, important energy sector reforms remain to be completed.

Gains were made in improving the private sector climate and in the areas of education, some
aspects of health, water, and social protection, as well as progress achieved in governance and
public financial management. Also, the PRSCs played an important role enabling the
government to increase spending on its poverty reduction agenda without cutting other programs
or undermining macroeconomic performance (prior to late 2007 and 2008). The economic
growth that coincided with the PRSCs period also contributed to substantial reductions in

44
   The share of supervised maternal deliveries rose to 57 percent by 2008, up from 47 percent in 2003, with
particularly marked increases in the deprived Northern regions. Meanwhile, under-5 mortality dropped from 111
deaths per 1,000 births in 2003 to 80 in 2008 (source: Demographic and Health surveys 2003 and 2008). There was
also an increase in the Net Primary Enrolment Rate which reached 83 percent in 2007/08, up from 56 percent in
2003/4. Finally, there was a further decline in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among pregnant women, dropping to
2.6 percent in 2007, down from 3.6 percent in 2002.


                                                      59
poverty, and was reinforced by government action to increase the provision of education, health,
social protection and rural water services. Finally, there were some achievements in institutional
strengthening under these operations (discussed below), with the operationalization of new
agencies that had been established in the new legal framework for public financial management
enacted during the first PRSC series (e.g., Public Procurement Authority, Internal Audit
Agency). Notwithstanding these gains, in particular the deterioration in macroeconomic
performance in 2008, the policy weaknesses that were exposed in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis
warrant a moderately satisfactory performance overall for PRSC-4-5-6.

3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty: The program supported by the PRSCs coincided with the period of strong GDP growth
that contributed in turn to the fight against poverty.45 Owing to the time lag between poverty
expenditures and poverty data collection, it is not yet possible to measure to date the contribution
of the PRSC-4-5-6, if any. There was, however, a notable decline in poverty between 1998 and
2006, and Ghana is poised to achieve the MDG of halving extreme poverty ahead of 2015. The
poverty headcount fell to 28.5 percent in 2006, down from 39.5 percent in 1999 (there are no
figures available for 2005). While all major regions recorded reductions in poverty, some did it
more rapidly than others. Most of the poverty reduction occurred in the Forest regions, while the
Northern Savannah region ­ which was already the poorest of the ecological zones ­ accounted
for a growing share of the poor.

Since 2006, various factors could have impacted poverty positively or negatively. Between 2006
and 2008, per capita real consumption grew by almost 30 percent, which, if equally shared across
households, should have generated substantial poverty reduction gains (assuming unchanged
distribution, the headcount index would have approached 20 percent by end-2008). However,
important uncertainties regarding the measurement of private consumption and its distribution
among households and regions, and the fact that some recent shocks might have
disproportionally affected the poor (droughts and floods in the Northern regions, food price
increases in cities) could mean lower actual poverty reduction gains. These factors explain the
emphasis placed on protecting poverty-reducing expenditures and social protection programs
under this second PRSC series, notably under the last operation of this series (PRSC-6) as well
as the EGPRC.

Gender: The PRSCs focused primarily on raising the gender parity index and several measures
pursued under the program supported by the PRSCs had a positive impact on reducing gender
disparities. In the education sector, the national Gender Parity Index (GPI) rose to 0.96 in
2006/07, compared to 0.95 in 2005/06 and 0.93 in 2004/05, while the GPI in deprived districts
45
   "Reductions in poverty are mainly the result of the substantial GDP growth experienced by Ghana over the last
five years, and the PRSC indeed made some important contributions to the country's economic growth agenda. The
macroeconomic stability supported by the early PRSC operations at a critical juncture of Ghana's reform program
was important for this growth path. Energy-related measures taken up under the PRSC were essential for sustaining
macroeconomic stability. The investment climate improved over recent years, and the PRSC made some useful
contributions to this improvement." (IEG case study 4.5)


                                                       60
also increased, rising from 0.93 in 2004/05 to 0.94 in 2006/07. The government also introduced
in the 2007/08 academic year specific measures to help achieve gender parity, such as the
deployment and training of female teachers and provision of sanitary facilities, implemented
during the 2007/08 academic year, particularly in areas with low enrolment of girls.

In the health sector, the percentage of women receiving ante-natal coverage rose to 97.4 in 2008,
up from 88.4 percent in 2006, and exceeding the government's target of 95 percent. The
percentage of women with supervised maternal deliveries also rose to 57 percent in 2008,
compared to 54 percent in 2005. The achievements in 2008 fell short, however, from the
government's target of 60 percent, and also mask wide disparities amongst regions.

In the area of social safety nets, poor mothers were one of the groups targeted by the LEAP
program, which was supported under PRSC-6, while the programs aimed at increasing the
coverage of water and sanitation services in rural areas had an indirect beneficial impact for
women. Since the task of fetching water is primarily a female responsibility, especially in rural
areas, increased coverage of these services frees up women's time for other activities..

Social Development: Social protection measures initially focused on actions supporting the
vulnerable and the excluded (e.g., the homeless, orphans, street children). In addition to
supporting youth employment, this focus shifted to offsetting the impact of increasing food
prices on the poor through the LEAP program and scaling up the school feeding program.
Accordingly, the number of households receiving grants under the Livelihood Empowerment
Against Poverty (LEAP) conditional cash transfer program targeted to the extreme poor reached
more than 8,000 households in 2008,46 up from 2,000 in the regular program in 2007. It is
difficult to determine whether these additional transfers were made to regular LEAP program
beneficiaries and emergency, sometimes poorly targeted, transfers, however. There was also a
scaling up of school feeding programs in 2008, benefiting 987 public schools with a total number
of 477,714 children in all the 170 districts across the country. While it is still early to assess the
full nutritional impact of the program, initial data suggest that it helped increase enrolment in the
schools benefiting from the program, with attendance rising by 19 percent in these schools,
against 3 percent elsewhere.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Instances of institutional strengthening occurred under this series of operations included:

     ·   The Ministry of Finance and Economic planning (MoFEP) has increasingly focused on
         the budget process as a result of the shift to programmatic lending in support of the
         Government's poverty reduction program.47

52
  . 24,300 households were registered as regular beneficiaries under the LEAP program by end--October 2009.
Anotyher 6,000 households were benefiting from the LEAP on an emergency basis in response to the 2007-08
floods in northern Ghana.
47
   As noted in the ICRR on PRSC-1-2-3, an indirect and intangible impact of the MDBS process was the apparent
strengthening of the MoFEP which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the MDBS/PRSC program,


                                                     61
      ·   The IRS has been modernized, enabling the introduction of some tax reforms and the
          development of a tax administrative system. Indeed, as part of the efforts to widen the
          Government's tax net, a Tax Policy Unit (TPU) was also established in the MoFEP, and a
          Revenue Protection Unit (RPU) was created at the Revenue Agencies Governing Board
          (RAGB). Other tax reform proposals are still outstanding, however.
      ·   There was one attempt to strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluate
          changes in the environment for private sector development with the introduction of a
          customized doing business survey.
      ·   A combination of institutional strengthening and procedural improvements has
          strengthened the performance of Ghanaian Customs, leading to a reduction in the time
          needed to export and import, as well as improving the performance of the Register's
          General Department, leading to further reductions in the time needed to register new
          businesses.
      ·   All 138 of District Planning Coordinating Units were trained in District Composite
          Budgeting, giving them the ability to prepare their own budgets in the 2008 fiscal year
          using the MTEF format.
      ·   Building on the passage of the Public Procurement Act (PPA, a PRSC-1-2-3
          achievement), the Public Procurement Authority (PPA) was set up and made operation,
          and there was increasing compliance with the requirements of the PPA.
      ·   The number of training institutions has been increased, including seven new Health
          Assistant Training Schools and five new Teacher Training Colleges.
      ·   Audit capabilities have been strengthened through the establishment of Internal Audit
          Units in all MDAs and in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of
          Education and the Ghana Education Service, the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health
          Service, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, as well as
          in seventy percent of the MMDAs. In addition, the Internal Audit Agency, which was
          newly established under the first series of PRSC operations, strengthened its oversight
          role through special audit assignments in 2007 and the monitoring of procurement
          compliance and the facilitation of the audit of the Internally Generated Funds (IGFs) of
          28 public institutions, including 10 MDAs.

(c)       Other Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

There were several outcomes from the PRSCs that kept the agenda for policy dialogue
continuously evolving:

      ·   The focus on expanding student enrollment at the primary level has placed additional
          demands on improving the quality of education, as newly enrolled students are typically
          from the deprived areas and from poorer families. Thus, while there was an important
          increase in the recruitment of new teachers, as well as efforts to retain existing teachers
          and continuously train teachers, the additional demand coming from new students
          exceeded the supply of teachers that could be made available. These developments led to
          a gradual shift in the policy dialogue, with emphasis increasingly being placed on the


including a shift to a greater emphasis on the national budget process and a greater focus on improving intra-
government coordination and setting priorities.


                                                     62
         importance of improving the quality of education and reducing the number of teacher
         vacancies in deprived regions as an effort to mitigate the skewed distribution of the
         available trained teachers to the disadvantage of deprived districts.
     ·   The increase in the availability of credit through the banking system contributed to
         increase aggregate demand in 2008, so that by the time the PRSC-6 policy agenda was
         outlined the indicator on the increased share of credit to the private sector, that had been
         included in previous operations, had already been dropped. The focus shifted to reducing
         the time required to trade across borders, instead. Although improvements in bank
         supervision were undertaken during this period, actions and outcome indicators in this
         area were not included under the PRSC policy dialogue because this is understood as
         falling under the IMF's mandate.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
     Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is judged as moderate because of the country's demonstrated
political stability. This caveat notwithstanding significant macroeconomic imbalances emerged
in late-2008, Ghana has been taking corrective measures with the support of the Bank and the
IMF. In this context, Ghana is focusing on eliminating Ghana's large fiscal imbalances by 2011-
12, strengthening public financial management, and restoring macroeconomic instability, thereby
removing the key obstacle to growth and poverty reduction. The 2009 budget protects pro-poor
expenditures, and the Government has also stated that a number of social and safety nets will be
strengthened and extended in order to mitigate the impact of slower growth and fiscal tightening
on low income and vulnerable groups.48 Finally, work is proceeding on the development of the
GPRS II successor to cover the period beginning in 2010, with a draft already available.

These factors will all help to minimize the risk to development outcomes. Nonetheless, progress
towards the MDGs will be slowed in the near term as Ghana's economic growth for 2009-10 is
likely to fall below the 6 percent per annum growth rate that is needed if Ghana is to meet the
MDGs by 2015.49 Restoring economic stability will require the adoption of cost-recovery utility
tariffs by end-2009 to support the 2010 budget,50 as well as necessitating the readjustment on a

48
   Current programs include subsidies to low-consumption consumers (so-called "lifeline" tariff customers) for
utility costs; the LEAP cash transfer program; school feeding programs; free maternal care for nearly 500,000
women; grants and subsidies for basic education; and national youth employment programs. New initiatives include
the provision of free school uniforms to about 1.6 million pupils in deprived districts; free exercise books for all
pupils; and an increase in the capitation grant by 50 percent.
49
   Bank estimates indicate that real GDP growth could fall to around 4 percent in 2009-10 as a result of fiscal
stabilization, lower remittances; lower FDI (excluding investments for oil extraction capacity); lower portfolio
investment (in the absence of any new privatization in 2009); and in spite of positive terms of trade (as gold price
prospects remain positive).
50
   According to the IMF, the combination of the depreciating currency, the project global price outlook, and the
projected shift from hydro to more costly thermal power generation will lead to estimated operating shortfalls at the


                                                        63
timely basis in future years, and energy pricing has been a consistent area of weakness in
Ghana's economic history.51 While the start of oil production in 2010/11 will create
opportunities for additional poverty-reducing and growth-promoting investment, it will also
create challenges for macroeconomic management. Moreover, if the country's current fiscal
stance is not corrected, the expected oil revenues will not be sufficient to stabilize the
macroeconomic situation. Finally, unless Ghana takes steps to rationalize public administration
and expand non-oil revenue mobilization, recurrent spending could absorb the fiscal space
created by Ghana's oil income, and impede the growth and poverty reduction needed to reach the
MDGs.52 Consequently, there is a risk that the macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in 2008
could continue to jeopardize the sustainability of the development achievements made under the
PRSC 4-5-6, even though the Government is making efforts to address this risk.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1      Bank Performance

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
          (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating:
PRSC-4: Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC-5: Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC-6: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry is rated as moderately satisfactory for PRSC-4-5
and as moderately unsatisfactory for PRSC-6. As discussed in Section 3.1, (Relevance of
Objectives, Design and Implementation) above, these operations were highly relevant to Bank
and Ghanaian priorities and continued to build on the reform progress achieved under the PRSC-
1-2-3. The program of reforms agreed with the Government was based closely on Ghana's own
priorities and extensive analytical work completed prior to, and during, this series of credits.
Similarly, the triggers/prior actions were also drawn from the Government's own program. The
lending mechanism used was central to the Bank's strategy to Ghana, had already been
employed successfully, and was appropriate to both country circumstances and capabilities.
Also, PRSC-4-5-6 explicitly incorporated the good practice principles on conditionality into
program design and implementation, as well as the lessons learned from the previous series of
operations. Program design could have been improved, however, by linking the result indicators
more closely to the supported policy actions, and by having less variability in the key indicators
used (discussed in Section 1.5 above), as such variability makes operational assessment difficult
on a consistent basis. Meanwhile, the Bank's engagement with the authorities was undermined

power authority of nearly 3 percent of GDP in 2010.) A key condition of the PRGF is the adjustment of electricity
rates to cover operating costs, with cost-recovery maintained through subsequent quarterly reviews.
51
   Indeed, the Government has delayed twice a planned adjustment in electricity tariffs, once in April and again in
December 2009.
52
   The twin fiscal and current account deficits in 2008 were principally financed through the use of privatization
proceeds (Ghana Telecom), the remainder of Eurobonds issued in 2007, foreign currency reserves and domestic
borrowing at short term maturities and from the Bank of Ghana.


                                                        64
by the fact that the TTL was not based in Accra. Also, PRSC-6 quality of entry was undermined
by increasingly identifiable risks, such as delays in energy sector reforms and political pressures
to increase pre-election spending.

More positively, however, the Bank took a lead and very strong role in working with the
Government through the MDBS, and also worked closely and cooperatively with other DPs at
the macro and sectoral level (e.g., the joint Bank-DFID Economic Management Capacity
Building team). Increasingly, the Bank's non-lending services were coordinated with those of
the other DPs to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication. The PRSCs were also
complemented by a series of specific investment and technical assistance operations covering the
education sector, HIV/AIDS, public sector reform, and finance and private sector development.
Finally, there was strong staff continuity from the previous series of operations, including at the
team leader and other technical staff level, thus preserving the "institutional memory" associated
with these operations, as well as the working relationships with the Government and other
budget support donors. 53

As with the previous set of operations, the Bank and the Fund closely coordinated their policy
advice to the Ghanaian authorities and collaborated closely in terms of joint support for the
implementation of the GPRS II (e.g., the joint assessment contained in the 2006 Joint Staff
Advisory Note on the GPRS II). Consistent with standard practice on such operations, the IMF
led the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and monetary policy, while the
Bank led the policy dialogue on economic reforms in sectors such: (i) infrastructure; (ii) local
government development; (iii) agriculture and rural development; (iv) human development; (v)
private sector development; and (vi) public sector reform and public financial management.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating:
PRSC-4: Satisfactory
PRSC-5: Satisfactory
PRSC-6: Unsatisfactory

Bank supervision was satisfactory for PRSC 4 and 5, and unsatisfactory for PRSC-6. The
supervision of PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 took place in the context of the MDBS, as it was aligned
with both the activities of other donors and the Government's M&E of the GPRS II
implementation. Supervision by the Bank and its MDBS partners focused on a year-long
verification process that monitored the implementation of the policies supported by the
PRSC/MDBS and identified how to best measure the completion of the agreed policy actions.
The use of the joint streamlined matrix (which included all Bank prior actions) provided a
common basis for discussion, evaluation of progress, and disbursement; it also facilitated and
strengthened coordination. Supervision of program implementation for PRSC 4 and 5 was
extensive and was carried out on a monthly, quarterly, and annual through a series of reports
completed by the Government and its development partners with responsibility for these reports

53
   There were two TTLs throughout the PRSC 1 to 6 period, with one TTL for PRSC-1 and another one for the other
five operations.


                                                      65
being divided between the Government and its DPs (see Table 7 overleaf). For PRSC 6,
supervision was limited to monitoring of developments in Ghana. IMF inability to visit Accra on
account of Article IV duties made in particular the monitoring of macro-economic developments
increasingly difficult in the second half of 2008, at a time when the global financial crisis was
exerting growing pressures on Ghanaian accounts. During July and November 2008 the Bank
regularly reported on the increasingly worsening macroeconomic performance of the country,
including by issuing a June 2008 ISR alerting about these development, inputting information in
the 2008 Annual Meetings brief and preparing ad hoc reports. Management raised the issue of
the worsening macroeconomic performance with Government officials at the time of the 2008
Annual Meetings and in the field. When the Bank eventually fielded a mission in early
December 2008, the earlier assessment of the macroeconomic performance was confirmed and
even found to be much worse54. The fact that the Government did not win the elections further
delayed early action in response to these imbalances.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated as satisfactory for PRSC 4 and PRSC 5, and moderately
unsatisfactory for PRSC 6. The performance for quality at entry was rated as satisfactory for
PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, and moderately satisfactory for PRSC-6. Also, while the performance for
supervision was rated as satisfactory for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, and unsatisfactory for PRSC-6.
The combination of these ratings justifies therefore an overall rating of moderately satisfactory
for the entire series.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

  The mid-year review of the budget 2009 in August 2009 revealed even larger fiscal gaps in 2008, via the
accumulation of uncovered arrears and off-budget expenditures.

indistinguishable, particularly for DPL operations, a rating and justification is provided only for
Overall Borrower Performance.

Rating:
    PRSC-4 - Moderately Satisfactory
    PRSC-5 - Moderately Satisfactory
    PRSC-6 ­ Moderately Unsatisfactory
Government's overall performance is rated as moderately satisfactory for PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and
PRSC-6. ICRR Guidelines (Appendix A) identify nine criteria for rating Government
performance. Overall Government performance is rated in accordance with the following eight
criteria:

   ·   Government ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives was
       moderate.
   ·   Stakeholders and civil society were consulted at the beginning of the GPRS-I
       development, and again in the formulation of the GPRS-II, but consultations throughout
       the implementation of the program were less frequent. Transparency and the sharing of
       timely information were not a priority.
   ·   The Government had adequate readiness for implementation and capacity but DP
       technical assistance was not as forthcoming.
   ·   Fiduciary requirements were met satisfactorily.
   ·   Most implementation issues were resolved on a timely basis; the main exception were the
       energy sector trigger under PRSC-6 and the implementation of the government's
       computerized financial and accounting system (BPEMS) throughout the series.
   ·   The relationships and coordination with the Bank and other donors through the MDBS
       were positive , although the 2008 global crisis exposed some of the latent tensions that
       had been present since the inception of the MDBS In particular, the crisis exacerbated
       the difference between the Bank's approach of focusing the dialogue with the Ministry of
       Finance on more immediate structural issues, while the approach embraced by other
       development agencies favored a policy dialogue based on outcomes defined several years
       in advance.
   ·   While the GPRS-II continued to provide a comprehensive framework for poverty
       reduction through 2009, the document provided only general guidelines that need to be
       followed up on to be made operational.
   ·   The Government's capability and commitment to effective M&E has steadily improved
       and the information and conclusions reached as a result of this M&E have been
       disseminated widely to the public, donors, and other civil society organizations. Their
       use in assessing progress in the implementation of the GPRS II was minimal, however.

While the Government's macroeconomic performance in 2008 was less-than-satisfactory, there
are three offsetting reasons that justify the moderately satisfactory rating: (i) the Government
showed ownership throughout the implementation of the program; (ii) the GPRS II was an
appropriate strategy for the country's circumstances; and (iii) the design of the program and the
dissemination of its results was appropriately inclusive. Government ownership evolved over


                                                 67
time and became increasingly multi-faceted at the ministerial and sectoral level. In the first
phase, the Government led the preparation of GPRS. In the second phase, the Government
developed sector strategies aligned with the GPRS that would provide operational guidance for
the implementation of the GPRS. Sector strategies completed during this phase include, inter
alia, the Power Sector Reform Strategy, the Private Sector Development Strategy, the Education
Sector Development Strategy, and the revised Food and Agriculture Sector Development
Strategy. In the third phase, the Government exerted stronger leadership in the dialogue with
DPs, drawing on these strategies to define the content and focus of development policy
operations supported by DPs.

The GPRS II was appropriate for the country's circumstances when it was originally designed.
The program maintained continuity with the priorities and programs of the GPRS I, and
introduced a renewed focus on growth that was recognized as necessary if Ghana was to meet
middle income status. This growth focus, and the priority attached to structural transformation
of the economy (especially agriculture), was highly appropriate to ensure pro-poor growth.

The GPRS II was also developed through a transparent and inclusive process that included input
from key stakeholders, including civil society. The program was developed through broad
consultations including preliminary stakeholder consultations at Regional and District levels;
policy review and hearings with the budget divisions of each MDA; a number of meetings to
agree on budget estimates and costing; and a National Stakeholders Forum on the final draft of
the GPRS II.

The GPRS II and its Annual Progress Reports (APRs) provided less strategic guidance as the
implementation of the program evolved, however. A problem that was exacerbated as Ghana
first benefited from the expansion in global liquidity in 2007 and then suffered, as the rest of the
world, from the consequences of its contraction in the second half of 2008. The mitigating factor
was that no individual country could have anticipated the magnitude of these developments ­ a
difficulty that was magnified in the case of Ghana by the proximity of the 2008 presidential
elections.

Finally, the Government disseminated the annual APR findings on GPRS II implementation
progress, inviting stakeholder feedback to inform decision-making of the program through
workshops organized in all the 10 regions of the country. Copies of the APRs were also
distributed to the media, universities, other tertiary institutions, civil society organizations,
community-based organizations, and the private sector. Likewise, the APRs for 2005, 2006, and
2007 (published in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively) were posted on the NDPC website, and
simplified versions were prepared and distributed nationwide to ensure that all Ghanaians, some
of whom might not understand the main report because of the technical language, benefited from
their findings. Nevertheless, severe macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances the materialized in
2008, justifying the moderately satisfactory performance rate assigned to PRSC-6.


6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)




                                                68
The evidence presented in this ICRR indicates that the Ghana PRSCs have a mixed record
in enabling Governments to pursue reform policies. While there were instances that the
PRSCs enabled the Government to pursue reform policies that would otherwise be unaffordable
for the country, such as the extension of capitation grants and the expansion of the national
health insurance scheme, there were other instances where the PRSCs were less successful.
Energy sector reforms are a case in point. Notwithstanding the MDBS efforts, the Government
implemented these reforms when it found fitting to do so. As a result, increases in electricity
tariffs were gazetted but only implemented belatedly and when every other source of funding for
subsidizing consumers had been exhausted. This mix record reflects the fact that PRSCs are
very complex instruments, with many dimensions that need to be considered jointly (e.g., the
fungibility of funds, the centrality of the policy dialogue, the nature of conditionalities, donor
alignment and harmonization). The outcomes associated with PRSCs are, therefore, varied and
difficult to identify from the beginning. There can be many causal chains whose effects take
time to manifest. The intermediate effects are often hard to identify and measure, and may arise
from many different causes. The logic of causation can itself be contested; since the
counterfactuals are difficult and controversial to determine. A case in point is the progress
achieved under the PRSC in health sector reforms. Only with the results of the 2008
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) ­ published in mid 2009 ­ was it possible to measure the
impressive improvement in health indicators achieved over the previous five years. When the
results of the 2008 DHS are compared to the results of the 2003 DHS one observes that: (i) the
under-5 mortality rate was reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, (ii) the proportion of
malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 to 14 percent, and (iii) the proportion of
maternal deliveries supervised by professional medical staff increased from 47 to 59 percent.
Even after one can measure these improvements, it is difficult to identify exactly the causality
chain, however. Were these improvement due to either the increase funding provided to the
health sector or the expansion of the national health insurance scheme, or to both? The reality is
that there is no precise answer to this question ­ something that only underscores the importance
of maintaining the continuity in involvement and the centrality of the policy dialogue.

More broadly, however, the progress in maintaining prudent fiscal management was not
sustained once the Ghanaian government no longer had an IMF-sponsored program. While
containing expansionary fiscal policies (which exposed external vulnerabilities and fueled
inflation) was beyond the efforts of the PRSC-MDBS, and muddled ongoing efforts to improve
Public Financial Management, it does reflect on the quality of the policy dialogue with
Development Partners, especially regarding the transparency of information about public
accounts.

   Ghana PRSC 4-6: Implementation Completion And Results Report

   Comments by Netherlands Embassy, DFID, KfW, Danish Embassy

   General comments:

   1. Overall this is an extensive review of the World Bank's operations and of the situation in
      Ghana, particularly the macroeconomic situation, during 2006-2009. The completion report
      is interesting and provides a useful overview of the scope, objectives and achievements
      attributed to the PRSC 4-6 series in Ghana.

   2. However, the document seems overly optimistic about progress, and about the attribution of
      this progress to the PRSC. Some of the text seems unduly positive, lacking some the depth
      of critical analysis that is characteristic of the World Bank. Discussion of sectors tends to
      consider the actions taken, the achievements, and then the weaknesses, but this latter part is
      thin in some instances.

   3. The quality of the analysis and the lessons learnt would greatly improve if a more critical
      position is taken towards available evidence. For that reason, the major questions remain
      largely unanswered. These are: (i) to what extent has the PRSC (in combination with MDBS)
      enabled government to execute policies that would otherwise have been unaffordable
      (additional financing to increase development potential), and (ii) to what extent the PRSC (in
      combination with MDBS and other instruments) has been able to encourage and challenge
      the Ghana government to take forward complicated and difficult reform areas, like PSR,
      PFM, decentralisation, energy (supporting policy reform)?

   4. These questions should be answered for the period that is covered by the PRSC 4-6. Hence,
      this excludes all reforms starting in 2009 with the new government in place. What is the
      exact timing of this series of PRSCs? There is a lot of discussion of reforms and progress in
      2009.

   5. The fact that several important changes took place in 2009 is relevant for the continuation of
      the PRSC, but it should not compromise a fair look at the genuine achievements of
      PRSC/MDBS in the period 2006-2008, which largely cover the achievements of the second
      Kufuor-mandate. E.g. the fact that the PRSC/MDBS was unable to challenge the macro-
      economic degradation (which was noted as early as 2007), seems to warrant a more in-depth
      discussion on the potential of the instrument.

   6. Looking into the evidence accumulated over this period, support to MDG-progress has been
      relatively successful, albeit not in all areas. However, policy reform has been slow in many
      areas, and reform targets set under the PRSC/MDBS ­ even though they were in general


                                              77
   considered met - have yielded little genuine reform. This is a critically different reading than
   expressed by the Completion and Results Report. Could more progress have been made on
   the reform agenda if there was less politicisation of some issues?

7. It would be interesting to square these findings with a follow up to the ODI evaluation of
   general budget support for the same period. The overall rating of the PRSC 4/5
   (satisfactory) and moderately satisfactory for PRSC 6 ­ it would also be useful to understand
   the overall rating matrix.

8. In terms of data, the document does not specify sources, leading to doubts about data
   validity against other recognised sources. For example, according to the PRSC-document,
   the proportion of supervised deliveries went up from 47 to 59 percent, whereas the APR
   2008 shows a decline between 2005 and 2008 down to 39.3 percent (p. 24). This is due to
   the use of the different definitions of supervised deliveries in this report. The health sector
   has revised the definition it was using earlier, which included Traditional Birth attendants
   (TBAs) hence the higher baseline in this report and the higher achievement. The access rate
   to rural safe drinking water increased from 55 to 76 percent (PRSC), against 53 to 57 percent
   in the APR. Obviously, data reliability is a problem in several respects (definition, sampling,
   recording), and careful reconciliation of sources should therefore be basic operational
   procedure.

9. In terms of PFM, the PEFA documents ­ which draw a great number of critical conclusions
   over exactly the same period ­ are not used, the ERPFM documents seem to be used only to
   the extent that they support the analysis that PFM has improved relatively well (p. 41). The
   discussion on decentralisation ­ a major area for any progress ­ is discussed in a more
   shallow manner (p. 28), similar to the one on Public Sector Reform (e.g. the integrated
   Payroll for Subvented Agencies was typically an area where no progress was made over the
   PRSC period, whereas this is presented as an achievement). A more comprehensive
   judgement would help to strengthen the PRSC/MDBS, especially into the oil era in which
   responsiveness by government may not always remain as strong as today.

10. The lessons learnt section (pp. 54/55) is shallow and does not help PRSC design in the
    future. The overriding conclusion that "the PRSC is a highly viable lending mechanism in
    the right circumstances" is fully tautological. The conclusion that a crisis would warrant a
    change to an emergency procedure is not well corroborated, but basically a restatement of
    the fact that such a decision was taken. It would be interesting to use the peer review by DPs
    to tease out genuine lessons that would help the PRSC to evolve into the oil era in Ghana.
    This could positively affect the process of setting targets and triggers for oil.

11. Though a lot of information is available about cyclical nature of election year overruns in
    Ghana, especially regarding the end of second term of a government, there appeared to have
    been not enough effort to monitor events/spending in 2008. The critique by the World
    Bank of Government moderately satisfactory in this completion report seems at odds with
    sounding harsher on Government performance than it does in the EGPRC programme
    document in review of performance for the same period, where it tended to lay more blame
    on external factors. Such differing positions may tend to affect the credibility of the Bank



                                           78
    among DP and Government partners, as well as the current opposition which had received
    good reviews from the Bank until then.
    Specific comments:

12. P.1 ­ par. 2 ­ omission ­ the GPRS I also included measures for addressing vulnerability and
    exclusion and was one of the five pillars of the strategy.

13. P.8: In 2008, a withholding took place of US$10 million, which was in the meantime offset
    by an additional contribution of US$10 m to counter the food crisis. Given fungibility of
    general budget support, this seems somewhat meaningless. How was the amount to be
    withheld (i.e. $10m) determined? It would be helpful to assess whether such a technical
    move was beneficial to the instrument, whether this was exceptional or accepted as common
    practice, etc.
14. P.8: It is important to note that the World Bank was largely absent from the MDBS
    negotiations which were supposed to feed into PRSC-7, only later taking the decision to
    redraft the EGPRC against new targets.

15. P.9 (Table 3). What is the difference between "original triggers" and "proposed prior
    actions"?

16. P.14 "Overview". Difficult to differentiate here between PRSC 1-2-3 and 4-5-6

17. P.14: The conclusion that overall program performance was solid, should be qualified better,
    since progress was clearly achieved at the expense of increased vulnerability. This is done to
    some extent, but I suggest this is included in the overall conclusion, and presented in bold
    case.

18. P.14-15: Could we explain better that despite the PRSC/MDBS, major macro-economic
    weaknesses did occur, and what conclusions one would draw from it for the continuation of
    the instrument? Could we say something about the role of IMF in the period that it did not
    conduct a programme (2006-2008) and the way PRSC/MDBS did or did not fill in the
    macro-economic agenda?

19. P.15: Reference is made to "Dutch disease", but in a rather superficial way. Obviously, the
    high dependence on commodity export (cocoa, gold) makes Ghana prone to Dutch disease,
    but this paragraph does not really deal with this issue. Since the term Dutch disease is
    leading to quite some confusion among people, it could be removed here without harming
    the key messages of the paragraph.

20. P.15: Reference is made to labour productivity, but little mention is made about the
    development of the formal labour force, a key indicator of macro-economic progress. The
    title of this section does refer to it, and it would indeed be helpful to include this data (with a
    breakdown over sectors).

21. P.17: "consumer price levels ... stabilized". Not really, inflation stabilized.



                                             79
22. P.18+: "Energy". A long section. Some useful detail but not always clear.
23. P.19: "resistance from other development agencies". Is this the right place for such a
    statement? Perhaps in a later section discussion harmonisation issues, with a somewhat
    broader perspective? Is footnote #10 really necessary? There is a lot more history than just
    this.
24. P.21: 4 Par.): In this context ...will start implementing Electricity Sector Financial Rec. Plan:
    Is this really the case, or do we expect that it will happen.

25. P.22: (top section): The following sentence should read: "Ghana's financial sector (mostly
    banks) was NOT directly affected..."

26. P.22: "Rural Development". The progress outlined here sounds quite weak, but the text
    does not really seem to reflect/acknowledge this.

27. P.23+: "Education". This is a very positive assessment, with little critical assessment. Was
    progress really so good? (And are the statistics reliable?)

28. P.24+: "Health". This is a very positive assessment, with little critical assessment. Was
    progress really so good? (And are the statistics reliable?)

29. P.25: "Social Protection". 8,000 households in 2008, but page 44 states 18,000 in 2008.
    There is no acknowledgement that these figures are somewhat uncertain, e.g. "registered"
    versus actually received transfers, or the difference between poorly-targeted emergency
    disbursements and regular LEAP.

30. P.26: "Water". This sector is dominated by donor funding, outside the budget (and PRSC
    funding and probably influence), so likely to be significant PRSC impact?

31. P.26 "Sanitation". The situation in Ghana is appalling. The text does not sound good, but it
    might understate the seriousness of situation? (And including sanitation on p.41 in a
    discussion about "strongest achievement" seems inappropriate.) The Table (p.44) suggests
    increased access to sanitation from 10% to 18%, but this is not mentioned in the text. Is it
    appropriate to use Water Aid data? A key data source on sanitation is the UNICEF/WHO
    joint monitoring programme

    http://www.wssinfo.org/en/welcome.html), which takes all known data along with the
    specific definitions and model estimates by country. These estimates are available every two
    years, the next due out in late March this year for 2008 (current latest is 2006 estimates).
    http://documents.wssinfo.org/?type=country_files shows that for Ghana the current
    estimates for sanitation are: urban 11% in 1990, 15% in 2006; and rural 3% in 1990 to 6% in
    2006. (UN official data shows 6% in 1990 and 10% in 2006.)

32. P.26: par 2 on broadening access to water & sanitation ­ indicates that this is the most
    important infrastructure investment for achieving the MDGs. This is subjective.




                                             80
33. P.26: par 3, part of reason for the decline in proportion of population with access to safe
    water in urban areas, was the slow increase in investments in urban areas juxtaposed with a
    rapidly increasing urban population.

34. P.26: par 4, Data reconciliation needed with page 45 on population without access to
    sanitation was 89%; while on page 45, it is indicated that access to sanitation was 18%
    (meaning those without access in 2008 was 82%).

35. P.26, par 5 Under Component 3, It is not correct that "very large budget deviations were
    exposed during the 2008 crisis". The exposure of these was after the fact, in 2009.

36. P.27: The sale of Ghana Telecom is presented as an advance in governance. However, Is the
    approval by Parliament of the sale of Ghana Telcom an event which reflects progress in
    good governance. Judging the current debates on the opacity of the deal, and the
    conclusions by the Ghana Audit Service, this may have to be qualified.[I think the GT sale
    was not being referred to as an advance in governance but rather as a reflection of reforms
    (seeking Parliamentary approval for the sale) that occurred in parallel].

37. P.27: It is important to clarify the cause of backlog with the PAC, caused by the court case
    against the Auditor General. As a matter of fact, this court case remains unresolved.
    Although it does not impact further processing of the national audits, it does show the
    weakness of the judicial system in ruling in this seemingly straightforward (but indeed highly
    politicised) case.

38. P.27/28: Progress on EITI was typically made outside the PRSC/MDBS framework (as is
    clearly stated by the additional Bank activities in this area). Can we make MDBS/PRSC more
    relevant in this area, and how could we do this? Such a discussion would also inform a wider
    discussion on the role of PRSC/MDBS into the oil era. The report could benefit a lot from
    highlighting lessons learnt.

39. P.27/28 (governance and oil & gas). This sounds remarkably positive, about intentions,
    commitments, and initiating "far reaching" reforms. Is the situation really this positive?



40. In terms of Transparency International scores, Ghana is just running on the spot, reaching
    3.9 in three years in the current decade, but never going beyond it. Moving up one place in
    the rankings is hardly great progress. Also the scores for 2008 and 2009 are available, so
    why use 2007 score?
41. Whilst it is true that Cabinet Ministers declare their assets, nothing seems to be done with
    the information. It is not made public and no one checks that your assets on leaving
    government are broadly commensurate with what you declared on becoming a minister.
42. P.28 par 3 ­ it should read launching of broad `outreach' not reach out

43. P.28 paragraph on decentralization: Some information in the paragraph are slightly
    misleading:


                                           81
       a. it is not the Local Government Service Act that establishes the Local Government
          Finance Authority but the Local Government Finance Bill which is currently under
          review by MLGRD and will be resubmitted to Parliament before recess, ii) The
          Local Government Service Act was not adopted by Parliament in 2008 but in 2003.
          In 2008 Parliament adopted only L.I 1931 that provides for the integration of de-
          concentrated departments and agencies into the RCCs and DAs. As a consequence
          of this the provisions of LGS Act to transfer the staff to the Local Government
          Service can be fulfilled.

44. P. 28 paragraph on public sector reform: the Ministry of Public Sector reform was only
    short-lived as it has not survived the governmental reorganization following the 2008
    parliamentary and presidential elections. These institutional changes should be reflected, as
    part of ensuing actions as is mentioned for other areas.
45. P.29+ "PFM". This section is long, with little critical analysis of 2006-09 progress.
46. P.29, par 1 ­ sentence 2 ­ should read the "effects of modernizing the payroll system" not
    "the efforts to modernize".
47. P.29, par 1 ­ to Ghana International Trade Fair, add "Company".

48. P.30: On procurement, it is important to note that despite improvements, no other World
    Bank programme (except DPLs) use in-country procurement systems as of today.

49. P.32: Reports on fiscal outturns, though posted on the MOFEP website have not been
    regular. If reports are posted regularly on and on time (with 8 weeks lag minimum) it would
    reduce transactions costs for different partners all having to contact MOFEP for this same
    information.

50. P.32: "The Government was highly committed to the reform program." This conclusion
    seems to overstep quite some evidence to the contrary. [Maybe there is further evidence of
    the strong Government commitment not spelt out in this report. An expansion of this
    statement may be necessary].
51. P.32/33: Background analysis was indeed extensive. However, we should also say something
    about the way this information has fed into the PRSC/MDBS processes. To what extent
    were these documents discussed in the MDBS core group (or related forums), and how did
    they impact PAF assessment and negotiations? [This extensive analysis could have been
    made available to the MDBS group during annual reviews, to strengthen the level of
    dialogue]

52. P.34: It would be helpful to have a paragraph on the sector group architecture and the
    relationship between sector groups and the MDBS core group.

53. P.35: The complementarity between PRSC and other Bank operations is hardly addressed.
    However, this issue seems more prominent with increasing sector working group
    involvement in the MDBS (and PRSC?). To understand the relevance of PRSC, this analysis
    could be strengthened (and not be limited to Bank programmes alone in areas with major
    other donor inflows).




                                           82
54. P.35 (Box): There is no technical annex to be agreed on. There is a base and a performance
    component (s. Framework Memorandum May 2008). Base tranche is disbursed on a holistic
    assessment and macroeconomic stability. Performance Component on triggers in the PAF
    which are the prior actions of the WB PAF. It should be mentioned that WB also signed the
    FM.

55. P.35 MDBS. Other reviews have concluded that the MDBS process has insufficient
    dialogue on strategic cross-cutting issues. This is not reflected here ­ the World Bank is
    satisfied with the "quality of high-level dialogue on policy choice and implementation"?
56. P.35 (Box 2). There are more than "several" sector groups, and they do not only inform
    MDBS on issues with macroeconomic and budgetary implications.

57. P.37/38: APRs were supposed to replace any additional DP reporting requirement.
    However, until today, this has not been the case. It would be interesting to provide an
    insight into what the World Bank would expect from such a report, so that it can (partly)
    replace Bank appraisals and assessments. Otherwise, the APR risks to remain an idle PRSP
    (and hence PRSC) requirement.
58. P.38 "M&E". Seeking a "more refined M&E framework" seems quite weak; the quality of
    the underlying statistics seems more fundamental, linked to the critical analysis in the
    previous paragraph about the M&E system.

59. P.38: EGPRC: it is important to note that the second tranche of the emergency tranche was
    not disbursed in 2009, which does question the `emergency nature' of the operation. I
    understand an in-depth analysis is beyond the scope of this document, but the paragraph
    regarding EGPRC does overstep the issue completely.
60. P.46 Is it fair to commend a "consistent reform effort over an extended number of years"?
    Reform has perhaps been "concerted", but has ebbed and flowed, particularly evident by the
    fiscal outcome in 2008.
61. P.49: second bullet: Is the IRS really computerised? There should be a comment that major
    tax reforms are outstanding.

62. P.49: Is there a positive impact of BPEMS?

63. P.51: It would be justified to mention that other DPs are also supporting corrective
    measures in addition to WB and IMF. There will be no "GPRS III". There will be a
    "Medium Term Development Plan", or?
64. Minor point: keep the column widths the same, so that readers can see any differences in the
    text between columns (e.g. Table 2).

65. P.55 DPs particularly questioned the World Bank's engagement with the MDBS process and
    harmonisation with other DPs during their design of the EGPRC. This is what their
    representatives at the Board stressed, but it is not mentioned here.
