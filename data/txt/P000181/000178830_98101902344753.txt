TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Burundi
Amount:               US$7.7 million
Terms:                Standard IDA Terms
Beneficiary:          National Office for Telecommunications (ONATEL)
Relending Terms:      Interest rate of not less than 8.25% per annum with
a repayment period of 20 years including 5 years of grace.
Project          (i)  Purpose:  To assist the Government in implementing
Description:         its 1980-84 investment program for telecommunications,
which aims at improving the quality of existing
telecommunications services while extending the
coverage to areas and segments of the population
presently unserved.
(ii) Components: (a) installation of junction cables in
Bujumbura and improvement and expansion of urban
cable networks in Bujumbura and provincial towns;
(b) installation of new exchanges, and rehabilitation/
expansion of existing ones; (c) installation of 40
public call offices in rural areas; (d) replacement/
expansion of UHF links; (e) replacement and expansion of
telex facilities; (f) purchase of vehicles, tools and
miscellaneous equipment; (g) construction of a warehouse
and other buildings; and (h) technical assistance and
training.
(iii) Benefits: The project would improve the efficiency
of business management and Government administration.
It would stimulate production and marketing activities
in both rural and urban areas, while also extending
the benefits of telephone facilities to broader
segments of the population.
(iv) Risks: The project presents limited risks. The main
risk is that physical implementation of some components
might be delayed. However, as the project comprises
a relatively large number of independent works and
as, were delays to occur, the costs and benefits would
be delayed in roughly the same proportion, the impact
.of delays on the rate of return would not be significant.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$7.7
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Telecommunications Project.
The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the National Office for Tele-
communications (ONATEL) at an interest rate of not less than 8.25% per annum
with a repayment period of 20 years including 5 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The last economic memorandum on Burundi (1838-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on April 25, 1978. An Economic Mission visited
Burundi in November/December 1979 and its report will be distributed in
August 1980. Preliminary conclusions of the Mission are provided below and
updated country data in Annex I.
Background
3.        With an average GNP per capita of about US$140, Burundi is one of
the poorest countries in the world and is designated as "least developed"
by the United Nations. Of a population of about four million, only 90,000
are wage earners; the remainder depend mainly on subsistence agriculture.
The Government is facing several critical problems in its efforts to develop
the economy: the capability to prepare and manage programs and projects is
weak; the agricultural labor force is largely untrained; and population
growth keeps straining Burundi's productive resources, particularly in
agriculture. Despite a stated policy of "spaced births", the problems of
population pressure cannot be solved in the immediate future. A major effort
must be made to increase agricultural productivity. Agricultural yields have
been declining, as more and more marginal land has been brought under cultiva-
tion. The search for more arable land has caused large-scale deforestation,
resulting in a severe lack of firewood in the rural areas and forcing the
development of alternative energy sources.
4.        Improvements to the internal transport system will be of limited
effect unless reliable external links can be established. Shipments of
imports and exports through the principal outlets via Tanzania have tradition-
ally encountered frequent delays due to bottlenecks in the port of Dar-es-
Salaam, underinvestment in the railway link between Tabora and Kigoma on Lake
1/   This part is identical to that in the President's Report for the Second
Education Project (Report No. P-2684-BU) considered by the Executive
Directors on January 29, 1980.

Tanganyika, and losses because of theft. However, some action is being taken
to improve the situation. For example, several donors (Canada, Belgium and
the European Development Fund) are considering financing the rehabilitation
of railway and port infrastructure in Tanzania. The link via Rwanda and
Uganda to the former East African Railways and the port of Mombasa (Kenya) is
becoming increasingly attractive with the continuing improvement in national
highways between Bujumbura and Mombasa.
5.        Recent Economic Developments.  Over the period 1973-78, Burundi's
GDP grew at a rate of only 3.6 percent per annum in real terms compared to the
2.2 percent annual growth of its population. Growth was concentrated mainly
in the capital city, particularly in manufacturing and construction activity.
Food crop production grew significantly more slowly than did population, while
the production of export crops (including coffee, the main source of foreign
exchange earnings) tended to decline.
6.        The overall investment rate of the economy rose considerably in
1977-78, when it accounted for 12.7 percent of GDP, but it is still below
the average for low-income countries. The allocation of investment between
production and infrastructure, one-third and two-thirds, respectively, has
not changed noticeably in recent years. The bulk of investment in the rural
areas has been to a large extent financed by official external aid and has
been allocated mostly to export crops. In 1978, the public sector accounted
for about 94 percent of gross fixed capital formation. This has been accom-
plished largely by government investment in social and transport infra-
structure and by the activities of public corporations. Investment by
private enterprises has been relatively weak, reflecting in part the excess
capacity prevailing in certain industries and the limited financial and
managerial capabilities of most private firms.
7.        Owing to high coffee prices in 1976 and 1977, export earnings, in-
come and Government revenue rose sharply in those years. By the end of 1977,
Burundi had accumulated about US$89 million in net foreign reserves, equiva-
lent to 11 months of imports. The improvement in the terms of trade resulted
in income gains equivalent to an increase of about one-fourth of GDP over
1975. These increases accrued primarily to the Government through higher
export taxes; the rest was shared by the small coffee producers through
increases in producer prices. The increase in Government revenues allowed
substantial increases in current and investment expenditures. In spite of
these, overall budgetary transactions, which had showed a small deficit in
1975, registered a surplus in 1976 and 1977 due to the higher growth of tax
revenues.
8.        In the wake of a 50 percent decline in the average price of coffee
exports, rapid import growth stemming from strong consumer demand, rising
public investment, and significant increases in import prices and costs of
insurance and freight, Burundi lost US$9 million of its reserves during 1978
(despite a large increase in grants and net disbursements of external loans).
By August 1979, net international reserves had fallen to US$40 million,
equivalent to about five months of imports. Faced with a significant decline
in revenues from coffee exports, and with rapidly rising expenditures, after



- 3 -
two years of surpluses, the Government was forced to borrow from the banking
system to finance its overall deficit (2 percent of GDP).
9.        Most recently and as a result of the hostilities in Uganda, Burundi
has encountered severe difficulties in transportation which led to acute
shortages of fuel, cement and certain consumer goods in late 1978 and the
first half of 1979. Since July/August considerable improvement in the overall
supply situation has taken place. Despite this, during 1979 productive sector
activity is estimated to have stagnated and investment declined in real terms.
The shortages which prevailed over the first half of this year, significant
increases in the domestic price of oil products, rapidly rising import prices,
transportation and freight charges as well as continued pressure from the
fiscal deficit have raised the domestic inflation rate to an unprecedented
25-30 percent.
10.       Government Development Strategy.  Since 1977 the Government has
designed a new strategy to achieve social justice, ethnic reconciliation
and improved living conditions in the rural areas. The poll tax, which
was levied on all males, was replaced by compulsory deposits which can be
withdrawn after three years. In addition, the traditional obligation for
small farmers to provide services to landowners in exchange for the right to
cultivate land has been abolished. Likewise, land which was obtained in an
irregular manner for speculative purposes has been returned to the State or to
the farmers who cultivated it. Other aspects of the new policies, which are
embodied in the Third Five-Year Plan (1978-82), are: (a) to emphasize agri-
cultural production to face the increasing needs for food supplies of the
rapidly-growing population; (b) to increase the rate of economic growth
substantially in order to provide greater employment opportunities and more
income to the poorest segments of the population; (c) to raise the investment
rate significantly; (d) to give the Government a more active role in mobilizing
financial and manpower resources and in participating in mixed enterprises in
the commercial and productive sectors; and (e) to foster decentralization of
economic and social activity away from the capital city and achieve a more
balanced geographic distribution through the creation of development poles,
voluntary settlement of the peasant population in villages, and migration from
densely populated areas. To facilitate the implementation of its strategy,
the Government has strengthened the role of planning by elevating the planning
organization to the rank of Ministry and by giving it a key role in the
allocation and monitoring of public investment.
11.       External Assistance and Prospects.  Economic prospects are less
favorable than in recent years as a result of expected declines in coffee
prices. Three major challenges which the Government currently faces are
limiting the loss of reserves, preserving its revenue base, and containing
inflationary pressures. This will require cautious budgetary policies
and a significant reduction of the Government's investment targets for the
remainder of the Third Five-Year Plan. In addition, the producer price for
coffee will have to be reduced in real terms, as the world market price for
this commodity is expected to average in real terms, during 1980-82, only 56
percent of the 1976 level. The Government is currently revising its policies



-4-
in all of these areas. Most recently, it reduced its investment targets for
1980-84 by 40 percent in real terms. Likewise, for the period October 1, 1979
to September 30, 1980, the Government has prepared, with the IMF's assistance,
an economic and financial program whose major objectives are to reduce signi-
ficantly the rate of inflation and to limit the balance of payments deficit.
In conjunction with this program, the IMF authorized last October drawings of
SDR 8.3 million in the form of Trust Fund resources. At the same time, SDR
9.5 million in compensatory financing for the shortfall in coffee exports
experienced in 1978-79 were authorized by the IMF.
12.       If the Government continues to focus on development and strengthens
its administration, it may achieve a steady, albeit slow, improvement in per
capita income. If mining of Burundi's nickel resources proves feasible, the
prospects over the next ten years would be much better. However, the commer-
cial viability of exploiting these deposits has yet to be established.
Regional development in Central Africa will also be important to Burundi's
economy. In September 1976, Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire signed a convention
establishing the "Economic Community of the Countries of the Great Lakes."
The Community, which has its seat in Gisenyi, Rwanda, aims inter alia at
stimulating and intensifying intra-regional trade and cooperation in a wide
range of activities. A major objective of the Community is the electrifica-
tion of the Great Lakes region. The three countries have also agreed to set
up a joint development bank, to exploit methane deposits around Lake Kivu,
and to develop a fishing industry around Lake Tanganyika. They have also
instructed the Secretariat to investigate ways of improving the transport
system around the lakes in order to ease the transport bottlenecks in Burundi
and Rwanda.
13.       Disbursements of long-term loans and capital grants averaged US$34
million per annum during 1977-78, most of it coming from Belgium, the Federal
Republic of Germany, IDA, the UN agencies and the European Development Fund.
In the 1975-78 period, total long-term capital inflows amounted to about
US$110 million, of which US$64 million was in the form of grants. On December
31, 1978, Burundi's external medium- and long-term debt amounted to about
US$63.6 million (excluding undisbursed amounts), of which IDA held 22 percent.
Debt service averaged 3.5 percent of export earnings during 1978. Due to the
large proportion of grants in external assistance, IDA will probably continue
to hold an important proportion of Burundi's outstanding debt. Notwithstand-
ing the low debt service ratio, Burundi is unable to absorb any borrowing on
commercial terms, because of its poverty and the instability of its export
earnings. External aid should therefore be on grant or very concessional
terms and continue to include a substantial share of local cost financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Since IDA lending started in Burundi in 1966, thirteen credits
have been made totalling US$70.2 million; one credit (US$1.1 million)
helped improve water supply to Bujumbura; four credits (US$17.3 million)
were for agriculture (two for coffee production, one for fishing and one
for forestry); three credits (US$19.4 million, including an engineering



-5-
credit of US$400,000) helped start a highway maintenance and improvement
program; a US$10.0 million credit is supporting the improvement of primary
education and a second one of US$15.0 million, signed on April 23, 1980,
will finance vocational and technical training; two credits (US$4.0 million)
were made for technical assistance and the National Economic Development Bank
received a credit of US$3.4 million. The Second Coffee Project and the
Fisheries Project are being cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.0 million) and
the Abu Dhabi Fund (US$1.2 million), respectively. The Second Highway Project
is cofinanced by the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) in
an amount of US$6.0 million. The Forestry Project is cofinanced with a credit
of US$1.2 million equivalent made from the EEC Special Action Account. Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and notes on the execution of
projects and the status of disbursements as of April 30, 1980.
15.       Project performance has been uneven, reflecting the shortage of
local management capacity and technical skills which is likely to remain a
major constraint to development for some time to come. This situation has
particularly delayed the execution of the Fisheries and the Second Coffee
Projects, although the implementation of the Second Coffee Project has
recently improved. Disbursement of the Credit to the National Economic
Development Bank has been lagging because of the general sluggishness of the
industrial sector. On the other hand, implementation of the First Education,
the Second Highway and the Forestry projects is satisfactory.
16.       Future IDA operations in Burundi will continue to focus on agri-
culture and rural development, transportation and education, and to include
provisions for project management and technical assistance. Documents regard-
ing an IDA credit of US$15.0 million for an Urban Development project were distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on June 5, 1980. An agricultural development
project, which aims at improving the living standards of the rural population
in one of the poorest areas of the country, was appraised in March/April 1980.
Further improvements of the road sector are envisaged under a third highway
project, which is expected to be appraised shortly.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
17.       Due to insufficient past allocations of resources to the sector,
basic telecommunications facilities are lacking in many parts of the country,
and, where available, they are inadequate and unreliable. With the telecommuni-
cations services increasingly becoming the least-cost means of communication
for a growing proportion of the population, lack of adequate and good quality
telecommunications services hinders business and commerce, social services,
government administration, and economic development. Up to the end of 1979
telecommunications services in Burundi were the responsibility of the Telecom-
munications Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In
January 1980 the Government established the National Office for Telecommunica-
tions (ONATEL), a Government owned parastatal entity, to operate and manage
the telecommunications sector of Burundi.



-6-
Existing Facilities
18.       The average number of telephones per 100 persons in Burundi is about
0.1, which is amongst the lowest in the world. This compares with an average
of about 0.4 for sub-Saharan Africa; about 0.6 for Asia (excluding Japan); and
about 4.5 for Latin America. Almost 90% of all telephone subscribers are in
the capital city of Bujumbura. The seven provinces outside of Bujumbura have
minimal access to service; there are only 378 subscribers outside the iapital
with the number of subscribers in each province ranging from 10 up to 175.
19.       Countrywide, about 50% of all telephone subscribers are Government
offices; outside Bujumbura, the Government's share rises to 70%. Small tele-
phone exchanges and public call offices are available in 14 small towns
outside Bujumbura and are mainly used by Government officials and merchants.
In most small towns and rural settlements in the country, there is no access
to rapid two-way communications facilities. The telex network is automatic
with about 60 subscribers. Outside Bujumbura, there is only one telex for
public use in each of the 14 small towns.
20.       The quality of telephone communication is generally poor.  Local
telephone service is frequently interrupted by faults on the lines, which are
particularly common during the rainy season, due to the types of cable used
and the inadequate methods of laying them. There is also a high failure rate
on the interurban network.
Demand for Service
21.       No comprehensive study of the existing and potential subscriber
demand has been undertaken to date. Since 1975 the annual growth in number
of subscribers has averaged 5.5% annum. As of December 1979, there were
only 4,888 telephones in Burundi. It is difficult to predict growth outside
Bujumbura because of the lack of data. However, the existence of more than 50
independent licensed HF systems for domestic communications shows a major need
not met by the public system. These networks are owned primarily by commercial,
industrial and religious organizations, many of which provide schools and
health services in rural Burundi. As part of planning for extension of the
telecommunication system to the interior, the Ministry of Communications
contacted the Governors of the 8 provinces. This helped determine a list of
200 potential sites for service, of which the Ministry has initially selected
31. These include 11 communes, 14 commercial centers, 21 schools and 10
missions. In addition, they comprise a wide variety of economic development
activities including coffee and tea plantations, forestry projects, hydro-
electric projects, etc. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the traffic
from these locations will be interurban and 20% local. The amount of inter-
national traffic (telephone and telex), is expected to increase rapidly with
the installation of a new earth satellite station.



- 7-
Sector Objectives and Constraints
22.       The goals established for telecommunications in the current five
year plan include (a) improvement and extension of the telecommunications
system to the interior in order to promote rural, industrial and commercial
development; (b) integration into the communication network of the locations
chosen for agricultural and industrial projects; and (c) increase in external
telecommunications capacity.
23.       The 1980-84 investment program for telecommunications comprises the
following components:
(a) ongoing works, which include (i) rehabilitation and
expansion of Bujumbura's network and some expansion of
the provincial network (expected to be completed in
1982); and (ii) an earth satellite station (cutover
expected at the end of 1980) and an international
switching center (cutover expected in 1982);
(b) the proposed project (see Part IV); and
(c) preliminary works for the future expansion of facilities
from 1985 onwards.
This program is estimated to cost about US$12.5 million with a foreign exchange
component of about US$11 million. The program is designed to meet the most
urgent needs for improvement and expansion of telecommunications services in
Burundi given the anticipated resources of ONATEL.
24.       The main constraints on the establishment of more efficient tele-
communications services have been so far the shortage of continuous long
term financing, inadequate sector organization and management, and a lack of
trained manpower. The Telecommunications Department lacked adequate autonomy
for efficient management and financial and technical planning. No separate
financial statement had ever been established for telecommunications, and as
a result the Department had no clear yardstick to measure its efficiency
nor any incentive to improve it. The establishment of ONATEL as a separate
financially autonomous entity should provide a better institutional framework
to address these issues.
IDA's Strategy in the Sector
25.       IDA first became associated with the telecommunications sector in
Burundi through a sector mission in March 1979. IDA's strategy in the tele-
communications sector is focused on institution building, provision of inde-
pendent technical and economic advice, and transfer of long-term financial
resources to allow better planning and resource utilization.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
26.       The proposed project was appraised in December 1979.  Negotiations
were held in Washington from May 5 to May 9, 1980. The Government delegation
was led by Mr. Habonimana, Director of Treasury Department, Ministry of
Finance.  A detailed description of the project components can be found in
the staff appraisal report (No. 2886-BU) being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the project are highlighted in the
credit and project summary at the beginning of this report, supplemented by
Annex III.
27.       The project is a major component of the 1980-84 investment program
for telecommunications. It would help improve the quality of existing
telecommunications services while extending the coverage to areas and segments
of the population presently unserved.
Project Description
28.       The project would include:
(a) installation of junction cables in Bujumbura and the improvement
and expansion of urban cable networks in Bujumbura and various
provincial towns(a total of 1,050 new main lines would be provided);
(b) installation of a new exchange at Ngagara in the Bujumbura area,
equipped for about 1,200 lines, and of three new provincial

Project Costs and Financing
29.       The estimated cost (net of taxes and import duties) of the project
is about US$9.1 million, with a foreign exchange component of about US$7.7
million.  The proposed IDA credit of US$7.7 mill-;on would finance 100% of
foreign exchange costs, amounting to about 85% of to  ` pro,jc-t costs.  The
remainder (US$1.4 million) would be financed by the  --Trment.  ,D. funds
would be onlent by the Government to ONATEL at an intlre!t rete of noc _ess
than 8.25% per annum with a repayment period of 20 years i uludirg 5 yts7^
of grace (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Development CrediL A-e?mer1t<
Implementation
30.       The National Office for Telecommunications (ONATET) would be respon-
sible for implementation of the project. It would employ engiueering con-
sultants to: (a) prepare the specifications and bidding docdments for the
telephone switching equipment cable networks, microwave VHF/UITF r,id'o equip-
ment, open wire carrier systems and rural network materials; and th) super-
vise installation and acceptance testing of telephone switching an' mcrowave
systems. ONATEL would lay and join the cables and install the subscriber
facilities in the provincial towns; in the metropolitan area, it would be
assisted by the suppliers. ONATEL would supervise the contractor;- wlo would
supply and install the telephone exchangEs as well as microwave ald lKF/T
radio equipment.  Civil works for construction of buildings and access ro
would be carried out by ONATEL.
Institutional Aspects
31.       Established in January 1980, ONATEL is a parastatal agency whose
board is appointed by the Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications
(TPT). The board consists of a chairman and five members representing the
interests of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, TPT, ONATEL staff
and the Association of Traders and Industrialists. The management, budgeting
and control systems inherited from the previous organization (Department of
TPT) need considerable strengthening. To help ONATEL during the initial
phase, the proposed project would include about 86 staff-months of technical
assistance: (i) 48 staff-months of one telecommunications management expert
to act as assistant and advisor to the General Manager; (ii) 24 staff-months
of engineering consultants (para. 30); and (iii) 14 staff-months of a financial
consultant who would assist in the preparation of ONATEL's commercial accounts.
The financial consultant has already been appointed. The signing of a con-
tract, satisfactory to IDA, providing the services of the telecommunications
management expert and engineering consultants would be a condition of effec-
tiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
32.       ONATEL's staff consists of 38 technical and administrative staff,
80technicians and specialized workers, 16 operations and 149 linesmen, cable
jointers and unskilled workers. This staff (293) is sufficient given the
present number of telephones, and with some training would be able to operate
the telecommunications system after the proposed expansion.



- 10 -
33.       In October 1979, TPT opened a telecommunications training school in
Bujumbura. The training program is designed primarily for operators, linesmen,
switching technicians and cable jointers and provides both introductory and
refresher courses. Higher level personnel are not trained in Burundi but are
sent to advanced schools in other African countries (Senegal and Madagascar).
The school of Bujumbura can accommodate about 50 students. It is adequately
staffed. One constraint, however, is the lack of training equipment; the
project would provide funds for this purpose. As the school has no accounting
training, it is proposed that a specific one month course in accounting would
be held each year. Provision would also be made in the project for senior
staff of ONATEL to attend overseas management courses and seminars.
Financial Aspects
34.       The financial performance of ONATEL's telecommunications operations,
based on cash and notional commercial accounts for 1976-79, has been satisfac-
tory both in terms of financial returns and internal cash generation. ONATEL's
financial position is sound and its capital structure is adequate. To ensure
continued financial viability of telecommunications operations, telecommunica-
tions tariffs would be maintained at levels sufficient to achieve a rate of
return of at least 10% on revalued net fixed telecommunications assets in
operation (Section 4.03 of the draft Project Agreement). For the purposes
of rate of return calculations, ONATEL would propose by December 31, 1980 to
IDA a method for revaluation of its fixed assets in accordance with a method
agreed upon with IDA and would not change the method without prior discussions
with the Association (Section 4.06 of the draft Project Agreement). The
Government has also agreed that, prior to the completion of the project,
ONATEL would not undertake any significant capital expenditures other than
those envisaged in the ONATEL Investment Program, unless a financing plan had
been agreed between the Association and ONATEL (Section 4.04 of the draft
Project Agreement).
35.       Tariff levels and structure have not been used in the past as a
means to allocate scarce telecommunications services to the highest priority
uses. As a result, telephone installation and rental charges are relatively
low and there are no differential rates between daytime peak period calls and
off peak night-time and weekend calls over the long distance network. Tariffs
were, however, increased in January 1980 after over ten years of no increases,
and, partly as a result, local call charges are not low by international
standards. In order to rationalize tariff levels and structure, ONATEL would
undertake a tariff review to be completed by July 1, 1981, under terms of
reference acceptable to IDA and would discuss with IDA the implementation
implications of this review by December 31, 1981 (Section 4.03(a) of the
draft Project Agreement).
36.       At present, telephone rentals are billed in advance and call charges
are billed after they have been made. The two-month billing cycle is adequate
for the present and expected levels of activity. Private subscribers can pay
their bills in any post office, and the proceeds are deposited in an ONATEL
bank accounts. Traditionally, the costs of telephone services used by govern-
ment departments and agencies were offset within the various budget allocations;



- 11 -
in future, ONATEL will bill each government department directly. Accounts
receivable as of December 31, 1979 were estimated at about 22% of annual
revenues. To maintain arrears at an acceptable level, the Government has
agreed to take appropriate steps to ensure that its telecommunciations bills
would be paid within four months of the billing date (Section 4.01 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Accounting
37.       ONATEL would maintain its accounts on a commercial basis (Sectior!
4.01 of the draft Project Agreement). The framework of a commercial accounting
system has already been established and the system would be implemented with
the assistance of the financial consultant under the Technical Assistance
program (para. 31).
Audit
38.       ONATEL's accounts and financial statements would be audited each
year by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. The auditors'
report together with certified copies of the financial statements would be
forwarded to the Association within six months of the end of each fiscal year
(Section 4.02 of draft Project Agreement).
Procurement
39.       All equipment to be financed by the proposed IDA credit would be
procured through international competitive bidding, except for the followii.
items costing about US$0.5 million: (a) interworking equipment and rehabil-
itation of the existing Bujumbura exchange; and (b) additional equipment to
increase the capacity of the telex exchange. These items would be procured
through negotiated purchase, which is justified on grounds of standardization,
savings on spare parts, and ease of maintenance; purchase prices would be
subject to IDA approval. Contracts for vehicles and sundry equipment costing
less than US$50,000 and not exceeding a total of US$500,000 would be awarded
on the basis of Government procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
40.       Disbursements of IDA funds would be made on the basis of (a) 100%
of foreign expenditures or 80% of local expenditures on equipment for local
telephone network, exchange equipment for local telephone and long distance
network and telex; (b) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures or 80% of local
expenditures on vehicles, training equipment and civil works; and (c) 100%
of foreign exchange expenditures or 90% of local expenditures on the cost of
technical assistance and training.

Economic Justification, Project Benefits and Risks
41.       Lack of rapid and reliable communications is a major constraint
to the development of the productive sectors in Burundi. In urban areas,
replacement and expansion of telecommunications facilities are needed to meet
at least part of the unsatisfied demand, relieve congestion and, at a minimum,
prevent further deterioration in service quality. In smaller towns and more
remote areas currently unserved, access to telecommnunmications services needs
to be broadened and improved to better serve the development needs of the
rural population.
42.       The proposed project would thus have benefits in terms of both
efficiency and equity. Urban business, service industries and public
administration are highly dependent on telecommunications and would benefit
from provision of additional lines in urban areas and relief of congestion.
Similarly, in rural areas, automation and expansion of local networks, auto-
mation of long distance service, and provision of service through rural long
distance call offices in some of the areas currently unserved would promote
the Government's goals of decentralization, stimulate production and marketing
activities, and encourage development of social services. Provision of public
call offices in both rural and urban areas would broaden the access to
telephone facilities to segments of the population who previously either were
not served or could not afford private facilities. The additional revenues
generated by ONATEL from expanded and automated domestic services and the
international services would enable ONATEL to finance a significant portion of
its own capital expenditure in addition to providing Government with financial
surpluses.
43.       The project's financial rate of return is estimated at 11%, but this
significantly understates the economic benefits from the investment program
because the benefit stream used in the calculation does not include thq con-
sumer surplus to be received by the telephone users. By measuring the consumer
surplus on the basis of prices which the existing subscribers and registered
applicants have demonstrated their willingness to pay, the economic rate of
return is estimated at 20%.
44.       The project presents limited risks.  The main risk is that physical
implementation of some components might be delayed. However, as the project
comprises a relatively large number of independent works, a delay in the
implementation of a few works would not generally prevent the use of other
newly created assets. Furthermore, were delays to occur, the costs and
benefits would be delayed in roughly the same proportion; hence, the impact
on the rate of return would not be significant.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between ONATEL and
the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft
Project Agreement of special interest are referred to in Annex III to this
report. Special conditions of effectiveness are that (i) a contract, satis-
factory to IDA, providing the services of the telecommunications management
expert and engineering consultants, has been signed, and (ii) the subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and ONATEL has been signed (Sections
6.01 and 6.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
48.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 467-BU      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974; Effective Date: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The Highway Maintenance Project is the first phase of a long-term
program to establish an efficient highway maintenance organization. The
project which has been substantially completed consists of the purchase of
maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel and construction materials, the
construction of a workshop and consultant services for technical assistance
and training, a study on the development of the road sector and feasibility
studies. The project is cofinanced by the UNDP (US$1.05 million for technical
assistance), Germany (US$1.33 million for the construction of and technical
assistance to the mechanical workshop in Bujumbura) and Belgium (US$400,000
for local cost financing). All equipment has now been procured and mechanical
road maintenance is well under way. Several manual road maintenance crews
and one mechanized maintenance unit have been established resulting in a sub-
stantial improvement in the quality of road maintenance works. Good progress
has been made in training road maintenance personnel. Completion of the
office building for the Directorate of Roads, which is the only project
component still outstanding, is now scheduled for July 1980.
Credit No. 593-BU      Second Coffee Improvement Project:  US$5.2 million
of December 5, 1975; Effective Date: October 31,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Project is a continuation of the first Coffee Improvement
Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147-BU of April 11, 1969). It is being
co-financed by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.2 million) on a parallel basis and by
Belgium (about US$600,000). The Kuwait Fund finances the construction of
ten coffee washing stations, and Belgium assists in the carrying out of a
coffee research component. The project is designed to support the develop-
ment of coffee and food production by strengthening and expanding extension

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

services and distribution of agricultural inputs; it includes a pilot rural
development program to improve livestock and food crop production. Start
up of the project was slow because of frequent changes in foreign and local
project staff. A new team of foreign experts has been appointed and project
management is now improving. Coffee extension work is showing favorable
results. Husbandry methods practiced by coffee growers continue to improve.
and coffee research activities are making satisfactory progress. Constructlon
of the ten coffee washing stations is expected to be completed by the end of
1980. The pilot foodcrop development programs have been redefined and scaled
down to ensure better control.
Credit No. 613-BU      Technical Assistance Project:  US$1.5 million of
March 19, 1976; Effective date: July 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project provides financing for hiring long term advisers
and short-term consultants to assist in planning, collection of statistics
and project preparation. Several long term advisers (including a senior
economic adviser and a senior statistician in the Ministry of Planning, a
savings bank expert and a metallurgist at the Ministry of Mining) are in post.
Several short-term studies and consultant services relating to the prepars ion
of projects in the agricultural and industrial sectors have been carried
out.
Credit No. 626-BU      Fisheries Development Project; US$6.0 million of
June 11, 1976; Effective Date: February 22, 1977
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project is designed to increase the production of fish through
the provision of training, equipment and materials to fishermen and to improve
the distribution of fish throughout Burundi. The project also includes
financing for the preparation of rural development plans for the coastal
region along Lake Tanganyika and the implementation of pilot development
activities. The project is co-financed by a US$1.2 million loan from the
Abu Dhabi Fund. Project implementation was initially very slow because of
problems encountered in the recruitment of both expatriate technical assis-
tants and their national counterparts and in the procurement of goods. Most
of these constraints have been overcome and the pace of project implementation
has accelerated. Production of fiberglass hulls for fishing boats has begun
and there has been an improvement in the catch rates at some fishing centers.
Problems of shortages of spare parts for the outboard engines are being solved.
Contracts for all the studies have been signed and all of them are underway.
Management performance of the fisheries company has been unsatisfactory and
a new project manager and a new deputy manager have just been appointed.
Financially, the company has working capital problems. These problems were
recently reviewed with the Government and an agreed plan of action for
improving performance was established.

Credit No. 679-BU      Education Project:  US$10.0 million of April 28, 1977;
Effective Date: September 1, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
This project assists the Government in continuing and consolidating
the reform of primary education. It aims at substantially expanding primary
school enrollments and improving the distribution of educational opportunities.
It provides technical and material assistance to the Rural Education Bureau
responsible for the execution of the reform of primary education as well as
for teacher training. As a result of a shortage of cement and fuel caused
by the hostilities in Uganda during the past year project execution has been
delayed by about a year. Recently, however, deliveries of cement and fuel
have resumed. The construction of 12 schools, a teacher training center and
a printshop has been completed. An additional eight schools are nearing
completion and the construction of five new schools started in early 1980.
Credit No. 731-BU      Development Bank Project; US$3.4 million of
September 30, 1977; Effective Date: March 27, 1978
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The project aims at providing funds for investment in medium size
productive entreprises and technical assistance to the National Economic
Development Bank (BNDE). Project execution is slow as a result of limited
activities of Burundi's industrial sector, and about 70% of the Credit amount
remains uncommitted. The newly established Industrial Development Unit of
BNDE which is to promote and appraise industrial projects has now been fully
staffed.
Credit No. 773-BU      Second Highway Project; US$14.0 million of
March 29, 1978; Effective Date: July 27, 1978
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
This project provides for the construction of the Bujumbura-Rugombo
road (65 km), improvement of roads and bridges, technical assistance and
procurement of maintenance equipment. Project implementation, in particular
road construction, was hampered by the lack of cement and fuel supplies during
the first half of 1979. Performance of the supervision consultants for the
road construction and consultants for engineering (road and bridge improvement)
is satisfactory. Two mechanized maintenance units have been set up and have
started the road improvement program. Consultants providing technical assis-
tance to the Ministry of Public Works, Equipment and Housing are in post.

Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This project provides for the further strengthening of the Govern-
ment's planning mechanism and its project preparation and implementation
capacity. It includes continuation of the technical assistance to macro
economic planning at the Ministry of Planning, provision of experts to the
planning divisions of the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry and financing
of feasibility studies. Recruitment of experts is underway and terms of
reference for several feasibility studies are being prepared.
Credit No. 918-BU      Forestry Project; US$4.3 million and US$1.2
million EEC Special Action Credit of June 1,
1979; Effectiveness Date: October 22, 1979;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
This project assists the Government in initiating the first stage
of a long-term program to develop basic forestry services and plantations
supplying fuel wood, building poles and timber to further the Government's
objectives of increasing forest production and establishing long-term wood
production and marketing policies. The project includes the establishment of
rural nurseries in 30 communes, a 2,000 ha eucalyptus plantation and a 5,000
ha pine plantation, technical assistance (provided by France) and financing
of energy studies. The three expatriate technical assistants (project
manager, two silviculturists) are in post; approval has been given for the
appointment and the terms of reference of the different local and expatriate
staff.
Credit No. 976-BU      Second Education Project; US$15.0 million of
April 23, 1980; Terminal Date for Effectiveness:
July 21, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
This project assists the Government in training middle level techni-
cians and skilled workers in industrial trades and secretarial/administrative
skills. It includes the construction, furnishing and equipping of two new
boarding technical schools, a Mechanics Department and a Typist and Bookkeeper
Training Department in two existing schools and staff housing. The Credit is
not yet effective.
