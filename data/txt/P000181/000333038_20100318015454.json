Its components\n            include: (a) installation of junction cables in Bujumbura\n            and improvement and expansion of urban cable networks in\n            Bujumbura and provincial towns; (b) installation of new\n            exchanges, and rehabilitation/expansion of existing ones;\n            (c) installation of 40 public call offices in rural areas;\n            (d) replacement/expansion of UHF links; (e) replacement and\n            expansion of telex facilities; (f) purchase of vehicles,\n            tools and miscellaneous equipment; (g) construction of a\n            warehouse and other buildings; and (h) technical assistance\n            and training.
