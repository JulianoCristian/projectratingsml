will assist the Government in implementing its\n            1980-84 investment program for telecommunications, which\n            aims at improving the quality of existing telecommunications\n            services while extending the coverage to areas and segments\n            of the population presently unserved. Its components\n            include: (a) installation of junction cables in Bujumbura\n            and improvement and expansion of urban cable networks in\n            Bujumbura and provincial towns; (b) installation of new\n            exchanges, and rehabilitation/expansion of existing ones;\n            (c) installation of 40 public call offices in rural areas;\n            (d) replacement/expansion of UHF links; (e) replacement and\n            expansion of telex facilities; (f) purchase of vehicles,\n            tools and miscellaneous equipment; (g) construction of a\n            warehouse and other buildings; and (h) technical assistance\n            and training. Its benefits are that the project would\n            improve the efficiency of business management and Government\n            administration. It will stimulate production and marketing\n            activities in both rural and urban areas, while also\n            extending the benefits of telephone facilities to broader\n            segments of the population."}, "docdt": "1980-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
