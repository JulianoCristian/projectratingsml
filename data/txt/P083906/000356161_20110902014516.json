"Ratings for the Additional Financing for\n            Emergency Customs Modernization and Trade Facilitation\n            Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            highly satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was\n            high; the Bank's performance was highly satisfactory;\n            and the Borrower's performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: donor coordination was\n            rightly given considerable attention, as is warranted in any\n            post-conflict situation where the government severely lacks\n            administrative capacity and strategic priorities may not be\n            clear. The Bank was one among half a dozen major donors to\n            customs. The sequencing of project activities, starting with\n            computerization of the internal transit process, was wise\n            and proved its worth compared with other options. Using\n            United Nations office for Project Services (UNOPS) was\n            warranted, given the thinness of the civil service and its\n            governance weaknesses. This project provided an opportunity\n            to clarify the issue of revenue targets that has arisen here\n            and elsewhere, where the Bank and the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) may have different viewpoints."}, "docdt": "2011-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
