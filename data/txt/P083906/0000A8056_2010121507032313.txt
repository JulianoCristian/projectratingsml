                         The project development objective is to: provide Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRA) emergency assistance to start establishing a more efficient customs and
                         transit regime. The project will achieve this through financing improvements in (a) key customs and related transit infrastructure and communications; and (b)
                         the capacity for customs and transit administration. This will lay the basis for a functioning customs service and facilitation of Afghanistan's international trade.
                         The project will also finance some key emergency assistance for implementing the accompanying overall tax administration business plan.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The developmental outcomes continue to be satisfactory. This evaluation is based on site visits and data analysis carried out by the team and the ACD to assess the status of the
                         PDO indicators.
                         Revenue soared to 766 million USD in 1388 (a 48 percent growth over 1387) of which direct Customs Duties alone were 428 million USD; when imports only increased by 23 percent.
                         The effective collection rate is now 13 percent compared to 9 percent in the previous year. According to the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) methodology of the World Bank, in
                         1388, Afghanistan scores 2.24 and is ranked 143; which is seven places above last year ranking. More specifically on Customs, Afghanistan now ranks 104 before many European

                         indicators is attributable to the project investments, especially the on-going automation of Customs (through ASYCUDA).

                         This is all the more remarkable considering that earlier achievement in terms of inter agency coordination (destined to reduce interference from Border Police into Customs matters,
                         an MOU was signed between Finance and Interior, 2009) has proved to be fragile and which the Border Police did not abide by.
