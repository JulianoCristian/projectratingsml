objective of the\n            Emergency Customs Modernization and Trade Facilitation\n            Project for Afghanistan is to provide the Transitional\n            Government (TISA) with emergency assistance to start\n            establishing a more efficient customs and transit regime.\n            The project will achieve this through financing improvements\n            in: (a) key customs and related transit infrastructure and\n            communications; and (b) the capacity for customs and transit\n            administration. This will lay the basis for a functioning\n            customs service and facilitation of  Afghanistan's\n            international trade. The project will also finance some key\n            emergency assistance for implementing the accompanying\n            overall tax administration business plan.  The project will\n            help provide the financial basis for a functioning Afghan\n            state, by ensuring sustainable government revenue.\n            Facilitating the introduction of modem trade facilitation\n            will remove some of the impediments to enterprise and help\n            create the enabling environment for increased economic\n            activity and inward investment-- increasing the overall\n            revenue base for customs' collections, and yielding\n            annual savings of nearly US$29.6 million to the economy. The\n            project supports the TISA and its objective of developing a\n            unitary state with (a) substantial power and responsibility\n            vested in a central government, and (b) substantial\n            domestically generated resources available to fund the basic\n            functions of  the state. The project will be implemented\n            through a wide range of activities undertaken at locations\n            around the borders of Afghanistan. The project must be\n            considered as high risk in terms of both the present\n            security problems within Afghanistan and the potential\n            resistance to the basic aims and objectives of  the\n            projects. As the project affects a structural change within\n            Government and Afghanistan's external trade system,\n            there is the risk that the implementation of  the project\n            will be resisted by some or all of  the interest groups who\n            may be negatively affected. The potential risks are\n            recognized and mitigated, and implementation will involve\n            the private sector and other interest groups to influence a\n            gradual change from informality to formality and to minimize\n            the economic and social effects when the new regulations and\n            systems are implemented. The credit is expected to be fully\n            disbursed within a 42 month period."}, "docdt": "2003-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
