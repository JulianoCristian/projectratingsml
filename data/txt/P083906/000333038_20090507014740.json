{"cdata!": "The development objectives of the\n            Additional Financing for the Emergency Customs Modernization\n            and Trade Facilitation Project for Afghanistan is to: (i)\n            provide the recipient with emergency assistance in the\n            establishment of a more efficient customs and transit\n            regime; (ii) assist the recipient's efforts to\n            increase, in the short term, through the reduction of\n            customs irregularities and inefficiencies the collecting\n            capacity of the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) and\n            other collection agencies; (iii) assist the recipient's\n            efforts to decrease, in the medium to long term, trade\n            transaction costs through improvements in key customs and\n            related transit infrastructure and communications and\n            improvements in customs and transit administration; and (iv)\n            assist the recipient in laying the basis for a functioning\n            customs service and taking appropriate measures to\n            facilitate its international trade. The additional financing\n            will help finance a funding gap for selected core project\n            activities included in the original project scope. The\n            project has also helped in strengthening the institution\n            through policy changes, streamlining and harmonization of\n            various administrative and customs procedures including\n            development of more than 30 different procedures and\n            regulations, as well as 20 forms and reporting formats,\n            assistance in tariff classification, valuation and transit,\n            and technical advice on trade and transit agreements. The\n            project also helped in establishing the customs training\n            unit. More than 1000 staff has participated in 59 courses on\n            various subjects, organized by the training unit. In\n            addition, to help provide a professional environment for\n            ACD, more than 56 facilities have been rehabilitated,\n            constructed or functionally improved."}, "docdt": "2009-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
