                                 I. BACKGROUNDANDSTRATEGY

                                          A. Afghanistan inTransition

 (i)         Sims Of GrowthAmongst A Fragile Post Conflict Environment

 1           Afghanistan, ravaged by chronic conflict and political instability for the last two decades,
 i s on the sure but slow and challenging path o f reconstruction.                           Despite limited state
 infiastructure, Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) and its successor, the Transitional
 Islamic State o f Afghanistan (TISA), has managed to: restore basic government; reverse the
 humanitarian disaster; draft a new constitution; prepare a National Development Framework, and
 implement it through the National Development Budget.                           TISA i s creating an enabling
 environment for sustainable economic growth.

 2           GDP grew by 28.6 percent during2002/03. Goodrains ledto a resurgence inagricultural
 production which accounts for about 50 percent o f GDP' and supports 85 percent o f the
 population. Afghanistan's            trade also increased. Officially reported imports2 in 2002
 (USS85lmillion) were up 50 percent over 2001. Due to poor reporting and smuggling, actual
 imports could even be higher. Rapid surveys undertaken at the borders in September 2003
 estimate these imports at US$2.4 billion-indicating                    the increased aid and the revival o f
 commercial activity.

 3          Despite these achievements, not all i s well. Growing security threats further fueled by a
 lack o f definitive progress on national reconciliation, a large opium drugbusiness, and the slower
 than expected progress on reconstruction are all threatening to undermine these achievements.
Not the best environment in which to hold the first ever national democratic elections scheduled
 for June 2004. It i s now more than ever, that TISA needs assistance to improve its effectiveness.
 It must be seen rebuilding the country's infiastructure and the lives o f the Afghan people. Not
 only must the future be imagined, it must be built.

 (ii) AnEffectiveGovernmentNeedsRevenues

 4          Financial sustainability i s vital for TISA's effectiveness and Afghanistan's future. The
 national development budget (USS1.7 billion for SY 1382-2003)                       is entirely donor financed-
 and will remain so in the medium term. TISA's ordinary budget (government payrolls,
 operations, and maintenance) i s already projected at USS550million per year and anticipated to
 increase inthe medium term.

 5          TISA's revenues are primarily from two sources-customs and domestic taxation.
 Customs revenues make up 70 percent o f the total revenues. Enhanced revenue mobilization i s
 one o f TISA's highest priorities. TISA's priority i s to improve revenue collection by reforming
 its tax system and customs administration, initially, through "high yielding" measures that can be
 easily administered.

 6          In the short to medium term customs revenues will continue to be the single largest
contributor. TISA hopes to increase revenues from Customs through: (a) better administration

   Based on 1993 estimates.
* Non    Oil imports only. Estimates o f POL imports range from 0.5 to well over 1million tones, and total POL imports,
including products for re-export, could be around 2 million tones (USS0.4 billion-based    on under US$200/tone which
is the average border CIF price).

and collection o f existing customs revenues-better                 valuation, assessment, collection, and less
leakage; and (b) facilitating trade and transit to increase the customs revenue base. The customs
enabling environment, administration, and operations are slowly being rebuilt-but                   are still far
from meeting TISA's expectations o f securing increased revenue, protecting society, and
facilitating trade.

                                B. Current State of CustomsandTransit

(i) CustomsLepislationAndTariff

7         The SY 1361 (1982) Customs Law provides the current legal framework and guidelines
for the establishment o f the Customs Administration. However, this L a w falls short on various
counts and does not establish a sufficiently robust framework for a modern customs
administration and customs revenue control. Despite relatively high tariffs (the highest was 150
percent) in the past the effective tariffs have been low due to the use o f extremely low exchange
rates and lack o f hightariffs on commonly excisable goods.

(ii) CustomsAdministrationAndOperations

8         Development o f Afghan Customs Department (ACD) has been severely constrained by a
lack o f experienced managers, a poorly paid and trained customs administration staff, poor
communications and infrastructure cumbersome and ineffective policies and procedures, the lack
o f an effective central revenue and customs authority, and the usurping o f Customs' role by other
agencies3. Improper valuation and classification, and lack o f effective control on movement o f
goods are a natural results o f this environment which has also led to widespread smuggling
including a substantial trade in contraband and narcotics. Concurrently, a significant proportion
o f the customs revenue collected at the border provinces are not voluntarily remitted to the
Treasury-remittances        to-date have required substantial effort on the behalf o f Ministry o f
Finance (MOF).

9         The present customs clearance system on an average involves 20 different procedures,
and requires some 50 different processing steps. Inaddition to the customs duties and the service
charge for the Pro-forma invoice, issued by the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce (ACOC), there
are some 27 additional taxes and fees collected.                Documentation and other requirements at the
Afghan borders are time consuming and costly: on the Karachi - Torkham - Jalalabad route,
truckers estimate that border clearance takes up to 3 days (2 days is considered normal), and the
documentation charges amount to about US$165/container.

10        The characteristics of border operations are: limited inward transit and related extensive
transshipments;      insufficient control over goods, vehicles,                and passengers; poor space
management; and inter-agency overlaps. At inland cargo clearance facilities, there are difficulties
over: clearance procedures and associated documentation; extensive handling o f goods with
possibly excessive examinations; and duty assessment. Further details on the state o f customs in
Afghanistan are given inAttachment 3.

(iii) CustomsInfrastructureAndCommunications

11        Border facilities are mostly run-down, congested, or in cases, only partially fmctional-
not at all conducive to proper customs operations. Most office and residential buildings are in


 Suchas the Chamber of Commercedoingvaluation for thepurposes ofduty assessment.

Technical Annex: EmergencyCustoms Modernization& Trade FacilitationProject                                          Page3



need o f structural rehabilitation or extension, or both. Almost all border facilities have no external
communication links or IT setups, and have mostly unreliable power supply. Water supply and
sanitation systems are largely inadequate or not present at all.

12         Inadequate physical infrastructure also constrains operations at nearly all Inland
Clearance Depots (ICDs). Some ICDs are also poorly located in congested urban areas and pose
a serious security concern under the present situation. Electricity supply i s mostly unreliable, or
contingent upon supplies from neighboring counties. Water supply and sanitation systems are
poorly equipped and insufficient to cater even for present needs.

13         At present the communications infrastructure betweencustomoffices inKabul (including
the headquarters, airport and the customs house) provincial offices and border posts in non-
existent. All ACD processes (administration and customs declaration) are manual. Attachments
4 and 5 provide a detailed assessment o fthe state o f customs infrastructure and communication.

(iv)       Standard And Oualitv Of Traded Goods

14         Afghanistan's participation in international trade and its ability to attract new investment
flows can be a major contributing factor to its economic growth. Standards are meant to make
trade between countries easier and to ensure product quality and safety.                              However, these
standards often end up being non-tariff barriers if any one o f the trading country i s not equipped
to impose and maintain standards. This i s a basic requirement to participate inthe trading system
and Afghanistan has no related capacity. Therefore, as a priority, Afghanistan's capabilities have
to be established to enforce a certain quality standard o f its traded goods in conjunction with a
system for standards, metrology, testing and quality.

15         The absence o f a standards, metrology testing, and quality (SMTQ) has an even greater
impact on Afghanistan's economy in the context o f its imports.                      Since TISA cannot check the
quality and safety o f its imports, substandard (and often smuggled) products compete with
(legitimately imported) quality products and drive these out o f the market given the absence o f
information to the consumer and the thriving informal markets. This not only hurtsthe consumer
and the economy, it i s also a colossal barrier to formal and legitimate trade.

(v)        Current State OfTransit System

16         Afghanistan has a substantial number o f transit4 alternatives and i s thus not dependent on
any single route. It is, however, faced with substantial problems and high transit-related trade
costs as a result of various in-efficiencies inits present transit system.

17         Transit-transport costs within Afghanistan are high partly due to: (i) very poor             the
condition o f the road network; the short internal hauls on many o f the transit routes; (ii)                         the
insecurity in parts o f the country-imposing                  limitations on operating hours, restricting the
flexibility o f truck operations, and sometimes requiring the use o f convoy systems; and (iii)                       the




  "Transit" is the sumo f all the door-to-door physical, organizational and administrative operations necessary to carry
goods, from their origin overseas to Afghanistan, or vice-versa, or through Afghanistan: air, sea, or land freight,
collection and delivery, handling, financial services (insurance, banking, etc.), import-export procedures, Customs, etc.
For this project, due to nature o f the basic Customs reforms being undertaken by TISA, Customs and Transit are being
treated separately.

Technical Annex: Emergency Customs Modernization& Trade FacilitationProject                                       Page 4




numerous checkpoints' along the routes-costs are raised directly by the multiple fees and taxes,
and indirectly by the delays and uncertainties that the checkpoints impose.

18        The transit system i s disjointed, with transshipment, border formalities, customs
clearance at provincial capitals, and numerous check-posts en route.                        Coordination between
transporters in Afghanistan and transit countries, and between shippers and customs officials i s
poor because o f the lack o fprofessional transit agents and poor communications.

19        Afghan participation in the transit system outside o f Afghanistan i s practically absent.
This has resulted in the very restricted access given to foreign trucks and thus the need for
transshipment at the border. With a few exceptions, all o f Afghanistan's foreign trade i s
transshipped at the border. Transshipment i s time-consuming and costly, both in terms o f direct
charges, such as warehousing and handling, and indirect costs, such as those resulting from loss
and damage o f goods.

20        Afghanistan i s virtually excluded from modern international trade logistics systems. Most
international shipping lines do not allow their containers into the country. It is impossible to
obtain insurance for cargo moved within Afghanistan-with                   a few very costly exceptions. Within
Afghanistan, cargo moves under either owners' risk or carriers' liability (at much higher freight
rates).

21        The countrywide absence o f either a functional insurance or a formal banlung sector also
prevents the development o f a bonding or monetary guarantee system for either vehicles or cargo
intransit. To provide adequate security to Customs, bonding of cargo is effectively being carried
out through "in lieu o f bond" type non-financial mechanisms-which                            provide no financial
recourse in the event o f default. However, even this cannot be considered as standard practice6
and may change without notice and i s specific to a border. All these factors restricts the
opportunities for a streamlined transit systems to allow clearance at final destination rather than at
the nearest regional center.

22        Afghanistan has been a contracting party to the "Convention on International Transport
o f Goods under TIR Carnets" (1975) since September 23, 1982. However, it has never
implemented the TIR procedures, documentation, and liability systems that allow specifically
approved vehicles and operators o f member associations and States to transit seamlessly through
member countries.

23        Overall, despite the low transport costs on the routes o f some o f its transit partners,
Afghanistan faces a transit system which, unless improved, will impose major constraints on the
development o f its foreign trade and thus economic and social development. Further details are
given inAttachment 6.




  Provincial agencies interfere with operations by often imposing informal procedural requirements. This restricts the
freedom of transit and poses a substantial barrier to trade.
  The current Afghan system for transit including bonding securities indocuments or inkind (30% o f goods), may seem
weak, confusing and poorly organized. Afghan administration perceives this differently. This perception is in line with
other aspects o f current Afghan transit logistics-standards do not seem either necessary nor applicable to a pragmatic
social understanding where Afghan cultural factors are predominant and locally understood.

24        Ministry o f Commerce (MOC) i s the main institution dealing with transit and trade
facilitation issues'. MOC i s tasked with developing and implementing policies that facilitate
economic expansion, trade, and foreign investment. It has twelve departments, fifteen subordinate
units, and a 51percent share in 15 Afghan State Owned Enterprises (AS0E)-and                               has specific
departments for border trade, international transit, foreign trade, and transit sub-departments in
border provinces.


(vi)      Current State Of Goods Transport Services In Support Of Transit

25        There are 80,000 registered trucks in Afghanistan with capacities varying from 5 to 50
tons. The road transport industry in Afghanistan i s not too different in ways and means o f
operation when compared to similar industries in Pakistan and India, but very different in
operational means when compared to Iran or to the trucking industries in the CIS countries. The
industryis based on traditional means o f ownership and collateral financing, and on regulations
going back to 1967 (and older). Transport operates in an informal environment-and                            traditional
social pacts ensure that applicable norms are observed and enforced. As a result, the Afghan road
transport industry satisfies the traditional Afghan demand and has little or no participation inthe
internationaldemand for transport, within, and through Afghanistan.

26        The local freight-forwarding industry existed and was very active prior to 1975, but i s
nonexistent today. There are no norms o f accreditation for freight-forwarders and the few
domestic agencies are only acting on commission to secure transport capacity or return-hauls.
However, post 9/11, the international freight-forwarders are operating in Afghanistan, through
foreign operators and financial instruments. There i s practically no domestic participation inthese
operations. These international operations are "facilitated" by the informal border transit
payments and options; the extent o f this facilitation varies from border to border.

27        The "single"         language and use o f local characters, and the non-conformity to
international formats o f all documents i s a substantial barrier to foreign trade. Discharge o f
imported consignments requires about 26 steps and may need a query from the office o f origin.
Afghan transport documentation and procedural requirements may vary intransit provinces-this
inconsistency i s often relatedto local requirements.

28        The Ministryo f Transport (MOT) manages the government-owned vehicle fleet (buses &
trucks) and regulates the private sector transport industry. It has two parallel structures to deal
with government-run and private transport services, with an overarching central hierarchy which
provides oversight and planning for public and private sector operations. Further details are given
inAttachment 7. MOT owns at least 14 of the Afghan State Owned Enterprises (ASOE). More
than half o f these ASOEs compete with the private sector trucking industry.The MOT collects an
estimated USS50 million per year through a transport "commission" (tax) on road transport-it                           i s
not clear if (and how) this, or a part o f this, revenue i s remitted to TISA's central revenue fund.
MOT'S present institutional structure and mandate requires an urgent review to enable it to
develop better policies and implementation capabilities which support TISA's Customs and Trade
Facilitationreforms.




'The1344    (1965) Law on the Basic Administration ofAfghanistanprovidesthat the Ministry of Commerceis
responsiblefor the `subscribing to the development of national income' and `regularizing the imports and exports in
the interests of the national economy'. Underthis law, the Ministry of Finance i s responsible for the `collection and
regulation of the income of the state'.

(vii)     Government Management Of Customs And Transit

29        Presently, government management o f customs and transit enabling environment i s
fragmented amongst the Ministries of, Finance (MOF), Commerce (MOC), Interior(MO1) and
Transport (MOT), and the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce (ACOC),                              creating obvious
inefficiencies in securing customs and trade revenues and in facilitation o f trade and transit.

                C. TISA's CustomsModernizationand Trade FacilitationReforms

(i) ObiectivesOfReform

30        The objectives o f the TISA's Customs modernization, and trade facilitation plan are to
secure revenues, protect society, and facilitate trade and thus economic development and job
creation.

(ii) ProgressOnReforms

31        The Five Year Plan - The Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) in the MOF has
prepared a Five Year Plan (FYP) in July 2003 to achieve TISA's objectives and its focus i s on:
increasing revenue collection; improving clearance times; bringingCustoms tariff, exchange rates
and valuation in line with internationally accepted practices; enabling remittance o f all Customs
revenues collected in the regions to central treasury; improving the key Customs infrastructure to
a standard that allows for proper enforcement o f Customs controls; re-organizing, and re-building
capacity o f the Kabul and Regional Headquarters to hlly control Customs activities; building a
stable and comprehensive legal framework for Customs; and establishing effective enforcement
controls.

32        Restructuring of Kabul Customs Headquarters - ACD i s inthe process o f implementing
civil service reforms approved under the Priority Reform and Restructuring Decree (PRR). Its
PRR proposal was developed in consultation with the Independent Administrative Reform and
Civil Service Commission' (IARCSC).               The ACD was the first department/agency to have its
reform proposals approved by the IARCSC. This i s significant not only for the department, but
for the civil service as a whole. Further details are given inAttachment 8.

33        Revision of           and the New Customs Law -The new Customs tariff regime has been
approved by the cabinet on October 29, 2003 after wide discussion with other government
ministries and the trade. The new tariff structure has four bands (0, 5, 10, 20) and requires
uniform country wide use o f the daily Central Bank exchange rate invaluations and assessments.
It is undergoing the final legal scrutiny by the Ministryo f Law and Justice, before being decreed
by the President. Concurrently, a draft o f the new Customs Law is also under discussion with
MinistryofLawandJustice.

34        Re-stafing and building capacity within the ACD - The Deputy Minister for Customs
and Revenue has been in place since June and has started the process o f intemal selection and
fresh recruitment to re-skill and re-staff the ACD. A new Director General o f Customs was
appointed in the second week o f October to relieve the Deputy Minister o f his dual charge.
Negotiations were held between ACD and the heads o f both Pakistan and Iran Customs to agree


 The IARCSC is the agencyresponsible for approvingPRR proposals, for allocatingfunds from the Civil Service
ReformFundsfor employeestransferredto higherinterimsalary scales (referredto as InterimAdditional Allowances-
IAA) andfor providing some modestsupport for equipment.

Technical Annex: Emergency Custom Modemization & Trade Facilitation Project                         Page I



on a training and capacity building programs for ACD officers-these              arrangements are near
finalization.

35        Re-stafJing and Introduction of revised Customs Clearance Procedures and automation
at Kabul A/P Customs and Kabul ICD - Customs staff in Kabul Airport Customs and Kabul
Customs House has been rationalized-some              transferred and some new staff hired. The retrained
Customs staff i s implementing the new streamlined customs procedures-including              the revised
interim Afghan Customs Clearance Document (a Single Administrative Document), valuation
(with the database supplied by the ACOC), and computerization o f the Customs declaration data.
These procedures are also being rolled-out into the regional Customs head quarters with
assistance from Bearing Point (and funded by USAID).

36        Customs Brokerage Training - Formal customs brokerage i s being developed in the
private sector to over come the conflict-of-interest arising from customs officers acting both as
facilitatorhrokers and then assessors. Inaddition to regular trainings, a self study guide has been
developed and the first batch o f examinations for Customs Brokers i s scheduled for December
2003,

37        Automation of Customs Declaration - ACD has agreed with UNCTAD to start the
phased implementation o f its Automated System for Customs Declaration (ASYCUDA).                    The
benefits o f this include: increased revenue; reduced /simplified number o f documents;
streamlined, transparent procedures; equitable decision making; improved clearance times;
reducedtrade costs; and timely and reliable trade statistics. ACD officials have visited Iran to see
the Iranian ASYCUDA system in operation. The Iranians are prepared to offer technical
assistance and training-including         the donation o f a Persian translation o f the system with
reference tables, tariffs, and reports.

38        MOC to undergo PRR - MOC has started its institutional restructuring process and i s
preparing the first stage application to the IARCSC, as well as formed a PRR worlung group
assisted by USAID, GTZ, and IDA. The Minister o f Commerce has shown commitment to
reform the Ministry and reorient its activities to those o f a state trade regulator and facilitator.
M O C has shown willingness to rationalize the role of state-owned enterprises active in the
customs and related transit environment. Further details are given inAttachment 9.

39        MOC CG Working Groups - MOC has established six working groups on trade and
Investment with the assistance o f Bearing Point (funded by USAID). These working groups are:
Trade Regime and WTO Accession; Administrative Barriers to Trade and Investment; Trade ad
Legal Framework; Export Promotion; Chamber o f Commerce; and Women's Entrepreneurial
Development. These working groups are assisted by USAID and IDA, and are likely to be
assisted by GTZ and DFID.

40        Synergies between MOC and MOF on customs and transit/trade facilitation issues -
MOC and MOF are improving coordination on Customs and transidtrade facilitation issues, and
are also broadening this dialogue to include Ministry o f Interior and Ministry o f Transport, to
clarify roles and responsibilities in support o f the overall Customs modernization and trade
facilitationreform objectives.

(iii) ReformImplementationStrategy

41        Despite these credible efforts, TISA realizes that the reforms remain a Herculean task,
and needs a careful implementation strategy to accelerate the process. Key principles o f this TISA
strategy are as follows.

                   Clarification of, and securing, the enabling environment for customs to achieve
                   its strategic role in the development and reconstruction o f Afghanistan-through
                   appropriate legislation, and an agreement with MOC, MOT, and MOI on
                   respective roles and responsibilities.
                   Better coordination and enhancement o f the donor assistance to help focus the
                   valuable but scattered inputs to implement the Five Year Plan without wasting
                   resources due to overlappinginvolvement.
                   Using the national budget as a tool for implementing the Five Year Plan
                   objectives.
                   Improving the recipient capacity within the ACD and the MOC-focus              on
                   human resource development.
                   Reaching agreement with regional customs administrations (particularly Iran and
                   Pakistan) to assist intraining and assistance on establishing the modem ACD.
                   Providing a suitable work environment for the developing human resource-
                   improve office buildings, provide reliable power and other utilities, improved
                   communications and suitable level o foffice automation.
                   Establishing a central customs training center and a Bureau o f Standards and
                   Metrology with adequately equipped laboratories.
                   Immediately rehabilitating and improving the key busy border facilities and ICDs
                   to not only improve the environment for customs and trade but also improve the
                   relationshipbetween the border provinces and Kabul.

(iv)      TISA's Request To IDA

42        TISA has requested IDA'Shelp in the overall policy and strategic coordination o f the
reform and inimplementing the Five Year Plan objectives including key support inthe following
areas.

43        Customs - Policy and overall strategic framework; performance based Budget
management; customs automation (ASYCUDA); implementation advisors (officers fi-om various
customs services to work with Afghan line-staff); A C D HQrestructuring implementation (PRR
implementation support) and roll-out to regions; infrastructure (regional ICDs and border
facilities, HQoffice, and Regional offices); information and communications infrastructure; and
incremental operating costs duringthe project period.

44        Trade Facilitation - Policy and overall strategic fi-amework for restructuring including
support to M O C PRR; alignment o f national trade documents; transit treaties; Bureau o f
Standards and Metrology (through UNDO); incremental operating costs and some infrastructure
and information and communications support; WTO accession assistance through UNCTAD;
rationalizationo f the role o f MOC's state-owned enterprises; developing the role o f private sector
inmanagement o f transit facilities; benchmarking o f trade and transport logistics costs and time;
and, a review o fMOT'S organizational structure and the transport regulatory environment.

Technical Annex: EmergencyCustoms Modernization & Trade Facilitation Project                            Page 9



45        TISA has also requested IDA to provide emergency finances for implementing some
urgent measures that form part o f its tax administration business plan. This local taxation reform
complements the overall customs and trade facilitation reforms.


                              11.      IDA RESPONSE AND STRATEGY

                      A. IDA'STransitional Support Strategyfor Afghanistan

46        IDA's Transitional Support Strategy presented to the Board in March 2003 focuses on
four areas: improving livelihoods (employment generation, community development, and the
rural economy including water resources management); fiscal strategy, institutions, management
(budget, role o f MOF, revenue and expenditure arrangements, central-local fiscal framework);
governance and public administration reform (role o f state, financial transparency, good
governance o f public administration, civil service reform); and enabling private sector
development (business climate, financial sector, infrastructure, regulation, and trade).

             B. Rationalefor IDA's InvolvementinCustoms andTrade Facilitation

(i)       Global Expertise, "Long-Haul" Partnership, And ProgramLeverage

47        The proposed project contributes to achieving progress on three o f the four focus areas o f
the IDA'STransitional Support Strategy for Afghanistan. Supporting the Customs reforms will
help secure sustainable revenues, improve budget management, increase financial transparency,
implement civil service and public administrationreform, and improve governance. This coupled
with the transit and trade facilitation reforms will help improve the enabling environment for
trade (infrastructure, regulation, rules and procedures) and improve conditions for private sector
development.

48        The Bank has developed considerable expertise in assisting countries to streamline their
customs and transit regimes, and reducing trade costs-at                    present it i s undertahng 80 trade
facilitation projects in developing countries worth US$4,6billion. The Bank i s also a key partner
inthe UNtrade facilitation initiative on land-locked countries. Similar on-going Bank programs
in some o f Afghanistan's neighboring countries can help the development of beneficial regional
and bilateral integrationinitiatives for customs and transit.

49        Through separate projects, IDA i s assisting TISA in: its overall public administration and
civil service reform; its overall fiscal strategy (and i s preparing a first budget support operation
for TISA during this FY); and, in the development o f its emergency communications. These
parallel interventions in related areas, will leverage the IDA'Sassistance through this proposed
project inthe various policy areas, thereby improving the chances o f success.

50        TISA's customs modernization and trade facilitation reform i s seeking a few "quick-
wins" but realistically has a ten year horizon. To complete this reform implementation, TISA
needs a partnership that can provide reliable long-term support and guidance. IDA'S
programmatic focus and ability to do rapid follow-on projects, when lending for key structural
and financial reforms, can help provide the necessary long-term continuity required for this
reform agenda.

(ii) RoleOfOtherDonors

51        MOF/ACD convened and hosted the first donor meeting on Customs in Kabul on
October 18, 2003. This was attended by the Bank, IMF, USAID, DFID, and EC. ACD stressed
the need for improved donor coordination in support of the Five Year Plan to avoid wastage of
resources and to accelerate the implementation of reforms. Details of donors and the areas of the
Five Year Plan they are supporting (including the current known level of funding) are
summarized inAttachment 10. A summary of the main activities beingundertaken by the various
donors incustoms and transit reformi s as follows.

52        DFIDwill provide technical assistanceof the following nature: advisory; training (codes
and practices, ethics, communications skills, effective management); change management
programs; management development (personnel management and administration, selection and
recruitment aligned to payroll, performance management-primarily                 at HQbut later inthe border
provinces); and humanresource and institutionaldevelopment.

53.       USAID will provide technical assistance of the following nature: implementation and
operations (financial controls related to customs collection, valuation and classification,
procedures and documentation-passenger               management, exemptions, and single administrative
declaration document, Customs code-legislation,               rules and orders, procedures, Customs brokers,
right-sizing human resource); and, enforcement (border control and management, curbing drugs,
contrabands, and corruption-through           an arrangementwith UnitedStates Immigration, Narcotics,
and Law Enforcement). In addition to the above, USAID may also finance communications
equipment (as required) intandem with the proposed IDAproject. As part of its on-going support
to TISA on Economic Governance in Afghanistan, USAID i s also supporting MOC in trade
facilitation to: analyze the trade system and assess MOC's capacity building needs; enhance legal
and regulatory framework o f trade; build capacity in international trade; and, enhance trade
environment by reforming trade-related activities. EC will provide technical assistance of the
following nature: transit development (political and diplomatic implications), and transit
facilities-preferably      at the border; and systems and procedures-with                 the aim of "free
movement o f goods within the rules".

54.       IMF will provide technical assistance of the following nature: review and guidance on
overall Customs modernization and associated revenue mobilization plan and proper sequencing
of donor assistance(incoordination with IDA).

                   C. Lessons Learned andReflected inthis Emergency Project

(i) ReinforcingPolicyActions

55.       Bank experience suggests that projects of this nature require coordinated and mutually
reinforcing action in many policy areas. Therefore the proposed project's design will aim to
integrate the efforts of relevant ministries and donors involved in the reform program. At the
same time the project team will try and leverage the outcomes of this project through other IDA
and donor projects in relevant areas. At TISA's request the project will finance some key
emergency assistance for implementing the accompanying overall tax administration business
plan. Improvements on overall local tax administration will cause less reliance on customs
revenue, and will keep cost o f local productionat par with imports.

Technical Annex: Emergency CustomsModernization & Trade Facilitation Project                          Page 11




(ii) PersuasionRatherThanImposition

56.       Although the outside perception can be o f a weak and poorly organized customs and
trade administrative environment, compoundedby poor infrastructure, and overcrowding o f many
facilities, reality i s somewhat different-there          i s a functioning control system, albeit different
from what would be expected in other environments. It is critical to realize that while a social
pact has enabledtrade to flow inan environment o f chronic conflict, it has not adapted well to the
needs o f a modem functioning sovereign state. It lacks the ability to efficiently secure revenue for
TISA, to guarantee against movement o f contraband, or to facilitate modern trade.

57.       It is important that the development strategy should, to ensure ownership and
sustainability, identify and buildupon the strengths o f the Afghan society, while simultaneously
seeking an improved foreign trade environment. Given that new management (often without
previous knowledge o f customs) i s being brought in, many new customs officers will be recruited
and trained, new systems are being introduced with technical advisers, trainers and mentors, this
i s a suitable time to introducenew concepts and standards.

(iii) Including;ThePrivateSectorStakeholders

58.       The trade facilitation work plan for the project will include the principle of influencing a
gradual change from informality to formality in the adoption o f modem options for cross-border
transport operations, bonded systems for freight-in-transit, insurance and financial trade practices;
as well as ensuring creation o f avenues for the private sector so that they have an equal, if not
higher, stake inthe formal system. The political and "informal" realities o f transit in Afghanistan
cannot be ignored. Cooperation o f the private sector duringthe reforms will be a key to success.
The project will need to establish a trade-off between current privileges o f the private sector
under a status o f informality and the potential advantages under a more formal and modem
system o f governance. This in turn will play a key role in eradicating the current informal
smuggling and irregular practices. Involving the private sector is not to be restricted to gaining
their good-will. This has to be supplemented by capacity-building and training targeting Human
Resource development and institutions.

(iv)      FlexibilityInProiect Design

59.       Given the urgent needs in Afghanistan and the fact that TISA's credibility with the
Afghan people i s at stake, the project design is flexible to enable rapid start-up and
implementation,       including provisions for review and retargeting finances as project
implementation proceeds. Issues such as ownership o f border facilities, overlapping and unclear
institutional roles and responsibilities will be dealt with during the project, in parallel with the
rehabilitation of the critical customs and related transit infrastructure. A detailed best-practice
"Customs and Transit enabling environment and objectives matrix" has been prepared and
discussed with TISA that will form the basis o f mapping the existing institutional roles (policy)
and responsibilities (implementation). This will also form the basis for subsequent discussion and
agreement on the revised roles and responsibilities duringthe project. Further details are given in
Attachment 3.


(v)       Use Of UNOPS For RapidProiect Implementation

60.       At this time ACD/MOF (or MOC) does not have the project management capacity to
implement the project. Therefore it has proposed using the United Nations Office for Project

Technical Annex: Emergency CustomsModemization & Trade FacilitationProject                           Page 12




Services (UNOPS) as the implementation consultants. A comparable arrangement i s worlung
successfully inother IDA-financed projects inAfghanistan, where timely delivery i s critical.

(vi)      Monitoring

61.       An essential aspect o f the project relies on the monitoring o f the performance, seen as (i)
an indicator o f project efficiency in terms o f trade facilitation and productivity o f the ACD and
other relevant govemment or other agencies, and private operators, (ii)          a basic calculation method
o f the benefits gained through project implementation, and (iii)            a tool for benchmarking and
establishing regional and international comparisons. Inaddition, the indicators will, as experience
shows under other projects usingthe same methodology, increase ownership over the project, as
they introduce a certain element o f competition.


                                  111.    THE PROPOSEDPROJECT

                                          A. Project Objectives

62.       The project development objective i s to: provide TISA emergency assistance to start
establishing a more efficient customs and transit regime. This will be a first step in support o f
TISA's short term goal to increase the collecting capacity o f customs and to reduce smuggling
and irregular practices, and the medium to long term goal o f decreasingtransaction costs to trade.
The project will achieve this through improvements in: (a) key customs and related transit
infrastructure and communications; and, (b) the capacity for customs and transit administration.
This will lay the basis for a functioning customs service and facilitation o f Afghanistan's
international trade. At the same time there are substantial risks both within and outside the
project's influence that could easily limit outcomes. This is a highriskproject both interms o f the
current security situation in Afghanistan and the potential internal resistance by the current
political and informal "business monopolies".

63.       The project's performance will be measured through progress on the following
indicators: Customs revenue collected; trade volume; total number o f customs declaration; total
number o f customs staff; declaration per staff; transit costs to trade.               A detailed table o f
performance indicators, their monitoring frequency, and source o f data, are provided in
Attachment 11. These performance indicators as measured at national level will establish the
gains in productivity brought inparticular by the project. At the local level, a single indicator at
selected pilot sites (border and inland clearance locations) will provide a simple measurement o f
the time for clearance.

64.       The principle i s to measure the time between arrival and departure, with no consideration
for the different steps involved. All the processes are therefore captured, including those over

Technical Annex: Emergency Customs Modernization & Trade Facilitation Project                         Page 13



which Customs would seemingly have little or no control (for example, time taken by the
immigration authorities to check passports, or time taken by a broker to prepare a declaration).
However, as the result shows the average aggregate time-which                    i s the main concern o f the
industry-improvements          will be reflected inthe average time for clearance. Inaddition, Customs
are expected, during the project, to take facilitation measures which will increase the speed o f
work involving other agents, such as brokers. Experience shows that the administration i s thus
rapidly able to identify the bottlenecks and take remedial action. If delays persist due to the
activity o f other agents and administrationcannot be reduced, the A C D will be ina better position
to seek action at higher government level. This approach, was for the first time used under the
Trade and Transport Facilitation in southeast Europe program (TTFSE), and has proven highly
successful, to the extent that the serious monitoring by the administration o f their performance in
itself led to rapid improvements.

65.       Very little data i s available at this stage in Afghanistan. Some base line data for these
indicators has been assembled, but it i s purely indicative. These performance indicators and the
project outcome monitoring indicators will be reviewed after the project becomes effective and
the project work plan i s being prepared. A plan will be finalized to track the achievement o f these
project performance indicators and the time-bound values (including the revised baseline values)
o f each indicator will be finalized inagreement with TISA.

                                     B. Detailed ProjectDescription

(i)       A Time-Slice OfThe Afghanistan Customs Department's FiveYear Plan

66.       This project is financing a time-slice o f some o f the key elements o f the ACD Five Year
Plan. This is in line with the agreed donor strategy. The strategic implementation needs for these
key elements are more than the available financing. Therefore this project takes a programmatic
approach by sizing the overall requirements for the key elements, where IDA assistance was
sought, and then prioritizing the investments based on agreed criteria.

67.       The total appraised requirements for implementing key elements o f the Five Year Plan
over the next four and a half years, related to the two outcomes being sought by this project, are
US$50.3million. Of this US$38.8million i s required for infrastructure and communications
investments, and the other US$11,5million i s required for capacity building. The proposed IDA
project will invest US$30million over the next three and a half years to start a phased
implementation o f the overall appraised requirement and US$lmillion to support the
accompanying overall tax administration reform. It i s expected that one, or more, o f the other
donors will finance the gap. Should the priorities o f these donors change, IDA can consider
fundingthe gap through a subsequent operation at TISA's request.

68.       The project will assist ACD/MOF: in the constructiodrehabilitation o f physical
infiastructure o f customs and transit; the procurement and installation o f all the ICT sub-
projects-including       design, supervision, and project management; and, provide technical
assistance for ACD restructuring, Customs policy and strategy development, Customs legislation,
ACD budget management, implementation o f border and inland control (including assistance
from regional customs specialists), ACD's ICT project management, ACD assets management,
overall project technical/content quality control and management, and other ad hoc advice (as
required).

69.       At TISA's request, duringnegotiations, the project will also finance some key emergency
assistance for implementing the accompanying overall tax administration business plan. It was

Technical Annex: Emergency CustomsModernization& Trade FacilitationProject                             Page 14




agreed that the unallocated amount o f US$1 million will be allocated to the emergency
implementation o f the tax administration business plan, using the project implementation
arrangements, for the following: automated tax administration system feasibility study; purchase
o f required software (including licensing fees and required hardware); technical assistance for
starting implementation o f the TISA's tax administration business plan; rehabilitation o f three
provincial revenue administration offices; and incremental operating costs.                   The category
reallocation request will be sent to IDA as soon as the surveys have been completed and a
[disbursement] category wise requirement i s known to TISA.

70.       The project will assist MOC: in the rehabilitation o f physical infrastructure in Kabul
related to key departments working on trade facilitation and for developing the Bureau o f
Standards and Metrology-including             design, supervision, and project management; and, will
provide technical assistance for, policy and strategy development for-and                restructuring of-
MOC, alignment o f national trade documents to United Nations Layout Key (UNLK),improving
transit treaties and transport corridor agreements, implementation o f TIR, basic industry
calibration capability-including        some basic laboratory testing facilities for testing o f agro-
industrial products, rationalizing the role o f MOC's ASOEs, developingthe role o f private sector
in trade facilitation, review of MOT'S organization (transport regulatory environment),
benchmarking o f trade logistic costs and time, and other ad hoc advice (as required).



71.       The project will provide overall project implementation support to ACDMOF and MOC.

(ii)      Proiect Costs BYExpenditure Category

72.       Project costs by expenditure category are as follows,




 Expenditure Category                                                Amount US$          I    Percentage

(iii) InvestmentCriteriaAndPriorities

73.       The physical investments will satisfy the following basic criteria.


          (a)    The objectives should be to introduce (i)         decent work conditions, likely to promote
                 job satisfaction, and generate an image o f professionalism and authority; (ii)
                 smooth traffic flows, thus necessitating a rationalization o f the location o f
                 buildings, and, within the facilities, o f the different work units (e.g., placing the
                 examination bays inside the warehouses); and (iii)to ensure that physical
                 infrastructure designs match the revised workflows.
          (b)    With the introduction o f new procedures, there will likely be less physical
                 examinations, thus requiring less space; some clearance may take place at

TechnicalAnnex: EmergencyCustomsModemization& Trade FacilitationProject                        Page 15



                importers' premises. Other than for the essential public needs, bonded warehouses
                should be owned and operated by the private sector (but approved by Customs).
         (c)    Efforts should be made to linkthe documentary flow to the movement o f the goods
                to improve controls. The facilities, whether at the border or inland, should be
                guarded by gate officials, with permanent and adequate control over movements
                into and out o f the area.
         (d)    Typically, clearance facilities should be located close to the final destination place
                where the goods will be used. At the border, the Customs processing facility should
                be as close as possible to the entrance o f the border zone, and, when not possible,
                there should always be a Customs check post at the immediate proximity o f the
                border line (in effect, next to the border police check point).

74.      Immediate priorities for physical improvements incustoms and transit will be as follows.

                Rehabilitate a (temporarily limited) headquarters structure, to install a core
                management team and establish its credibility. This should involve outfitting,
                computer equipment linked into a local network, air conditioning, telephone and/or
                radio equipment.
                Establish at all facilities a gate control shed, with appropriate working conditions,
                and inparticular communications with the local management.
                Start separating the public and users from administrative positions, using counters,
                windows, and establishing secluded areas where the public will not be admitted.
                At borders: (i)separate traffic flows (pedestrians, minivans, and trucks), using
                concrete separators o f the width o f a traffic lane, with traffic marshalling
                preventing vehicles from stopping and jamming the area, and paving o f access
                roads and parking areas; (ii)    establish Customs control booths close to the border
                line, with communications with the central unit; and (iii)         whenever possible,
                introduce signaling directing different traffics to the appropriate lanes.
                At inland facilities, pave the parking lots and access roads, and reorganize the
                examinationbays within the warehouses.
                Rehabilitate the management buildings/sections and create separate areas for the
                public and the staff, with limited interface areas.
                Progressively introduce local computer networks, supported by (i)power
                generators and UPS, (ii)air-conditioning, and (iii)adequate security - for
                progressive automation and ASYCUDA implementation.
                Develop a telecommunications network (i)within the facilities, and (ii)with
                headquarters, and (iii) the local authorities and other agencies (in particular
                                          with
                the police).
                Establish a national Bureau o f Standards and Measures (BSM) with sufficiently
                equipped laboratories.

75.      Immediate priorities for improvements in the capacity for customs and transit
administrationwill be as follows.


         (a)    Provide technical support for overall technical management o f the project.
         (b)    Technical Assistance to support ACD restructuring and overall policy and strategy
                formation.
         (c)    Appoint a budget officer in ACD to prepare, assist in procuring cabinet approval,
                and to monitor the recurrent and development budget.
         (d)    Appoint a customs and transit legislation specialist-preferably           with Iranian
                Customs Service background-to               assist in the final Dari drafting o f the

Technical Annex: EmergencyCustoms Modemization & Trade FacilitationProject                           Page 16




                 improvements to the legislation, rules and procedures, and in seeking approvals
                 from Ministryo f Law and Justice.
                 Start development o f and phased implementation o f ASYCUDA.
                 Start training in (i)computer use, (ii)      management o f control issues, and (iii)
                                                                                                    search
                 techniques (it i s only at this stage that it would be effective to introduce
                 sophisticated search equipment).
                 Provide management support for implementation o f the information and
                 communicationstechnology (ICT) sub-projects.
                 Provide support to establish and operate the Bureauo f Standards and Measures
                 TA to improve and assist in negotiating transit agreements and transit-transport
                 corridor agreements.
                 Assistance to implement the TIR Convention (including restructuring and
                 rebuilding capacity o f the Afghanistan Chamber o f Commerce).
                 Start work on re-aligning trade and transit documents.
                 Start work on private sector cooperation and capacity issues in facilitating transit-
                 transport and trade.
                 Selective technical assistance for MOCrestructuring.

                project's phasedprioritized approach does not in any way imply "unfinished" or
"low quality" facilities; it just means taking on rational physical investments and associated
capacity building requirements in a holistic and prioritized manner, and deferring certain parts
untilfurther financing is available.

(iv)      Retroactive Financing

77.       At TISA's request, the project will retroactively finance sub-project grants, equipment,
consulting services, and incremental operating costs for a total o f US$2.0million (6.5 percent o f
total project cost) for expenditures incurred after September 30, 2003 in accordance with IDA
procurement procedures (through UNOPS) and for the following purposes: rehabilitation and
refurbishment o f ACD Kabul Headquarters including provision o f ICT goods and equipments,
vehicles, technical assistance for ASYCUDA implementation start-up (through UNCTAD), chief
technical advisor for the project (through UNCTAD), project preparation for Bureau o f Standards
and Metrology, institutional survey/mapping o f MOC, other required technical assistance, and
related incrementaloperating costs.

                    C. InstitutionalArrangements and ProjectImplementation

(i) InstitutionalArrangements

78.       The project will be implemented by the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) o f the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) over a period of 42 months. While certain sub-projects have already
started, the overall project implementation i s expected to have started by the end o f February
2004. The project will be completed in August 2007 and the credit will be closed in December
2007. The ACD has proposedusingUnited Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) as the
implementation consultant for the overall project. Project support to Ministry o f Commerce
(MOC) will also be provided through UNOPS under its contract with ACDMOF.

79.       Both, TISA's, and IDA'Sexperience with UNOPS in similar arrangements on other on-
going projects inAfghanistan with Ministries o f Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD),
Public Works (MPW), and Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE) has been
positive. Prior to agreeing to usingUNOPS as an implementation consultant on these projects, the

Technical Annex: Emergency CustomsModemization & Trade Facilitation Project                   Page 17




IDA reviewed and concurred to the use o f the operating guidelines and procedures o f UNOPS
(including financial management and disbursements) for activities executed by them. UNOPS i s
presently successfully helping implement US$68million o f IDA (or IDA administered) financing
to TISA with three ministries (and indirectly one other ministry-Ministry o f Martyrs and
Disabled).

80.       As part o f the project appraisal, the IDA reviewed UNOPS's capacity to undertake this
additional workload. UNOPS Afghanistan has strengthenedits staff since M a y 2003, especially in
financial management, disbursement, procurement and engineering. IDA i s also conducting an
institutional and human capacity review and strategy exercise with UNOPS (Afghanistan) in
December 2003 to help them to better respond to the upcoming implementation and local
capacity buildingchallenges.

81.       The project further proposes engaging (preferably through UNOPS): the services o f the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) through an interagency letter
o f agreement for providing assistance on ASYCUDA development and implementation and on
trade facilitation; and, the services o f United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNDO) for assistance inthe development o f the Bureau o f Standards andMetrology.

82.       UNOPS will assist ACD/MOF in implementing the construction o f physical
infrastructure o f customs and transit, the procurement and installation of all the ICT sub-projects,
and in the rehabilitation o f physical infrastructure in Kabul related to key departments in M O C
working on trade facilitation and for developing the Bureau o f Standards and Metrology-
including design, supervision, and project management. UNOPS will also engage the technical
assistance for overall customs policy and strategic advice, legislation, ACD budgeting, border and
inland control (regional customs specialists), ICT project management, and asset management.
UNOPS will also procure all the vehicles for the project and provide overall project
implementation support to TISA, as well as administrative and implementation support to
U N C T A D and UNIDO.

83.       UNCTAD will provide technical assistance to ACDMOF and M O C for overall
management and quality control o f the project's technical aspects, and to MOC for provision o f
consultants, conduct o f studies, and data collection inthe agreed trade facilitation areas.

84.       UNIDO will provide technical assistance to MOC indevelopingthe Bureau o f Standards,
Legal Metrology (weights and measures), and basic industry calibration capability, and some
basic laboratory testing facilities for testing o f agro-industrial products. This assistance will
include preparing a project proposal, detailing the infrastructure, equipment and technical
assistance and training requirements during project implementation, and assistance during actual
project implementation.

(ii) ProiectWorkPlan

85.       Once the project has become effective and prior to the signing o f any contractual
agreements with UNOPS, and prior to the project launch workshop, TISA (ACDMOF and
MOC) jointly with IDA, and in consultation with UNOPS, UNCTAD, and UNIDO, will prepare
a detailed work plan for the first year and a half, based on a three and half years implementation
horizon. This work plan will form a part o f the UNOPS contract and o f the agreements between
UNOPS and UNCTAD and UNOPS and UNDO.

Technical Annex: EmergencyCustoms Modemization & Trade FacilitationProject                       Page 18




86.       Subsequently annual project work plans (PWP) will be prepared for the remaining two
years. Each annual work plan will be finalized and agreed between the parties at least three
months prior to the completion o f the period o f the last work plan.

(iii) ProiectImplementationManual

87.       A project implementation manual (PIM) will be prepared by UNOPS for the
implementation o f the infrastructure and communications sub-projects and will be approved by
the IDA and TISA. This manual will cover the following areas: project objectives, overall project
management, sub-projects selection criteria, sub-projects design criteria, sub-projects project
cycle and procurement procedures, disbursement and flow o f funds, financial management
procedures including auditing, interagency coordination, local capacity building, sub-projects
supervision,     environmental      and social       safeguards        management (including mine risk
management), and monitoring and evaluation. A draft manual i s under preparation and will be
finalized by February 15,2004.

(iv)      Capacity Building

88.       The capacity o f the Afghan Civil Service in the counterpart agencies (ACD and MOC)
will be developed under the project. The agreement between the implementation consultants and
TISA will include specific provisions on the following: (a) establishing a joint project
management unit with TISA; (b) obligatory requirement to train Afghan civil service
counterparts; and, (c) promoting the Afghan private sector. The Project Implementation Manual
will include details on the modalities to render operational these provisions. As part o f the
performance review o f the implementation consultants (agreed inthe contract) TISA will include
parameters to measure the progress on the transfer of the operational responsibility o f the project
to the TISA counterpart staff.

(v)       Procurement

89.       All procurements under this project will be undertaken by UnitedNations Agencies. UN
Agencies can use their own procurement documents but must follow the IDA'SProcurement
Guidelines and Guidelines for Selection and Employment o f Consultants for all works, goods,
and consulting services procured under this project. Detailed procurement arrangements for this
project are described inAttachment 1.

90.       The first two works sub-projects less than US$300,000 (with at least one o f these three
being less than US$30,000 in value) and, all works sub-projects greater than US$300,000 in
value, will be subject to IDA'Sprior review. The first two contracts for goods through NCB and
all contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$200,000 or more irrespective o f
procedures, and all procurement through direct contracting will be subject to IDA'Sprior review.
Consulting services contracts estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more for firms and US$50,000 or
more for individual consultants, and any selection o f consultants, on a Single-Source Selection
basis will be subject to IDA'Sprior review and approval.

91.       UNOPS will submit quarterly Procurement Status Reports to the concerned ministries
and to IDA within two weeks o f the next quarter inthe format which will be provided by IDA.

Technical Annex: Emergency Customs Modemization & Trade Facilitation Project                     Page 19




(vi)      Disbursement and Financial Management

92.       The overall responsibility o f financial management and, disbursement lies with TISA.
However, considering that the project is proposed to be implemented through UNagencies, who
will make use o f the blanket withdrawal facility available to UN agencies, hence it will be the
responsibility o f the UN Agency (ies) to undertake disbursement functions and to comply with
the necessary accounting and other fiduciary controls. The use o f the Blanket Withdrawal
procedure, however, does not preclude MOF from disputing direct disbursement requests made
by the UN agency to IDA, at any given time. An assessment o f Financial Management,
Disbursement and Audit arrangements was undertaken and the arrangements envisaged for the
project are detailed inAttachment 2.

93.       As implementation o f each project is also an opportunity of capacity enhancement, it is
important that MOF remains involved in the financial management o f the Project, accordingly it
will be the responsibility o f MOF, through its Grant Management Unit (GMU), to undertake the
necessary reporting to IDA. To facilitate the work o f the GMUinthis regard, the UNagency will
report to GMUon all the activities undertaken. The details o f timing and the formats o f the report
will be included in the contract with the UN agency. The UN agency will also put in place a
coordinator who will be responsible for coordination with the GMU before the project becomes
effective.

94.       Under this project, GMU's involvement i s restricted as it i s not likely to undertake day to
day accounting. However, it is important that MOF undertakes an "assessment o f GMU's
workload and its capacities to ensure that adequate staff i s available to manage its responsibilities
effectively.

95.       Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the Ministry o f Finance. Inparticular,
the Grant Management Unit (GMU), with support from the Financial Management Agent, will
prepare consolidated Project financial statements for all sources and uses o f Project funds. MOF-
GMUwill retainthe rightto sign and submit withdrawal applications to IDA.

96.       Customs Financial Management - The project recognizes that financial management o f
revenues collectedby Customs i s pivotal to the interests o f TISA and the success o f this proposed
intervention. IDA has carried out an initial review o f the current processes in Kabul which has
indicated the weaknesses in the system, specifically at the provinces and the MOF level and has
made suggestions for improvement (refer to Attachment 14). These were discussed with the
Deputy Minister o f Finance for Customs and Revenue, who briefed IDA that improvements in
this area are beingcarried out by M/s BearingPoint (with USAIDfunding) not only inKabul are
but also in the border provinces. He however requested that, inthe coming months, IDA should
carry out similar exercises in all locations where customs was operating, and present himwith an
independent report. The project will continue with these reviews and closely coordinate with
USAID/Bearing Point. The project will be financing the automation o f customs processing which
will also contribute to improved financial controls. USAID has also indicatedthat funds could be
made available for any Financial Management improvements inthe future.

(vii)     Environmental And Social Safeguards

97.       The project is not expected to have significant negative environmental or social impacts
either individual or cumulative. The infi-astructure improvement and development activities will
comprise buildingssuch as customs facilities and warehouses, as well as parking areas for trucks.
No gas stations, or vehicle repair and service facilities, will be financed under this project.

TechnicalAnnex: EmergencyCustoms Modernization& Trade FacilitationProject                          Page20




Activities to be undertaken under this project are not likely to involve any land acquisition or
have adverse social impacts. No involuntary resettlement i s anticipated-there                   are no
encroachments or squatters on the sub-projects sites.

98.      Due to the assessed insignificant negative environmental and social impacts o f the
proposed project, none o f the safeguard policies are triggered, and it i s rated as an Environmental
Category C project.

99.      Environmental Impacts - All physical infrastructure sub-projects are planned on existing
Government land already available and in-use for similar activities (tax offices, truck parks,
customs houses, check-posts, warehouses, transit facilities). No gas stations, or vehicle repair and
service facilities will be financed under the project. In some cases, the project will help in
improving customs and transit facilities in remote locations and in de-emphasizing the urban
locations, as part o f the government strategy to get the clients (traders and transporters), and their
goods (warehouses) and equipment (trucks and trailers), out o f the urban congestion. This will
contribute to improve urban environments in addition to decreasing the security threat posed by
such vulnerable targets being inlocations where human densities are relatively higher.

 100.    Land Acquisition And Resettlement - In terms o f the Environmental and Social
Safeguards Framework (ESSF) agreed between TISA and IDA this project has been categorized
as S-3-projects    not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse social
impact. Most o f these customs and related transit facilities-especially the border posts-are
located in extremely remote places, with the exception o f some o f the customs houses which
currently are located either in urban or peri-urban locations. In all such cases, alternate
government owned locations are already available outside the urban centers and are often not in-
use because o f the inhospitable environs-lack          o f water and electricity, poor living conditions,
inappropriate or run-down service infrastructure, and no communications. Because o f the
provincial "controls" on customs and transit, all related facilities tend to be well guarded with
entry restricted to officials and clients, and have no encroachments or squatters. However the
project's implementation manual (PIM) to be prepared by UNOPS will include a free-standing
guideline on land acquisition, and will include a process framework for managing any unforeseen
land acquisition o f any type, voluntary or involuntary. If minor pieces o f land are needed in
connection with construction, they can only be obtained through voluntary donations (local
authorities do not have the funds to purchase land). The sub-project planning/appraisal format in
the PIM will include a check-list recording any amount o f land donated, that the land i s free o f
squatters or other encumbrances, and written proof that the land i s provided as voluntary
donation. Confirmation o f voluntary surrender will be a criterion on the proposal review list and
by supervised by the implementation consultants. Supervision missions will verify that these
guidelines are being followed.

101.     Indirect Social Benefits - To enhance immediate indirect social benefits o f the project, the
project implementation team through the PIM will endeavor to maximize employment generation
through the use o f labor based construction techniques to the extent possible. The project i s
expected to improve the transparency and legitimacy o f customs, transit, and trade operations-
benefiting the trade stakeholders (both large and small, rich and poor). Secondary and tertiary
effects could include, increased security to legitimate small and medium tradershading
enterprises, contributing to overall poverty alleviation.

102.     Mine Risk Management - Sub-projects will not be implemented without appropriate
mine-risk management.         Current practices for mine risk management (evolved during field
implementation) in Afghanistan have been robust. A procedure for Mine Risk Management in

TechnicalAnnex: Emergency Customs Modemization& Trade Facilitation Project                            Page 21



IDA FinancedProjects has been approved by the Bank. This procedure-included                    inthe PIM-
will be followed. All risk assessment and clearance tasks shall be implemented in coordination
with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).

103.     MOF Capacity for treatment of Environmental and Social Safeguards - Post conflict
reconstruction and related required institution building in Afghanistan has been a slow and
difficult task-given     the depth o f destruction wreaked by 20 plus years o f chronic conflict and
instability. The key fact that i s relevant for proper treatment o f safeguards in Afghanistan i s that
de facto there i s (even now, almost 2years hence) very little government implementation capacity.
Thus the approach adopted by this project is to require the use o f the overall policy framework
that sets down criteria, and by incorporating compliance with this framework into the terms o f
reference o f the implementation consultants (UNOPS) who will be managing the implementation
o f the various activities.

104.     In all construction activities funded under this project, the implementation consultants
(UNOPS), for the Ministry o f Finance (MoF)/Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD), will
ensure that the overall Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF)-which
provides general policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the
implementation-for       IDA supported emergency reconstruction operations inAfghanistan, along
with the agreed procedures for mine risk management in IDA funded projects inAfghanistan, is
followed.

105.     Consistent with the provisions o f the ESSF, a focal point will be established within ACD
to deal with any potential safeguard issues, as part o f the overall supervision o f the
implementation consultant's activities. IDA missions will be very frequent for this project,
probably on a monthly basis for the first year. They will routinely include a safeguard specialist
(i,e., at least 2 times per year), and safeguard performance will be assessed during annual
programmingreviews at the country team level.

(viii)   Project Readiness For Implementation

106.     Rehabilitation/Construction of Customs/Transit Facilities and ICT - The following
priorities have been agreed with ACD/MOF.

    Phase                         Border or Inland                   1 Locations
    I                           IIBorder                             1 TorKham, SpinBoldak, Islam Qalla,
                                                                       Milach, Hairatan
                                  Inland                               Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat

107.     The rehabilitation and refurbishment o f the Kabul A C D Headquarters has been started by
UNOPS (with prior agreement o f ACD/MOF and IDA). The total cost for this (including
infrastructure and ICT) will be approximately US$0.8million, and completion i s expected in six
months. All Phase Isites except SpinBoldak have been surveyed, and physical civil works on
each turnkey sub-project site can commence within 2-3 months o fproject effectiveness. Work has
been started by UNOPS on detailed survey and preparatiodapproval o f final design and tender
documents for the Phase Isites inconsultation with ACD/MOF.

108.     Customs Automation - The preliminary feasibility study o f for ASYCUDA has been
carried out and a detailed implementation plan prepared. This has included a series of workshops
conducted by ASYCUDA specialist with ACDMOF.                            MOC, and traders.     This study has
concluded that ASYCUDA could be implemented very rapidly if the expected Iranian

Technical Annex: Emergency Customs Modernization & Trade FacilitationProject                  Page 22



cooperation is forthcoming. The on-going Bearing Point implemented reforms will significantly
reduce the development phase - in fact the project critical path will probably be constrained by
the re-construction o f the physical infrastructure.

109.      Technical Assistance -UNCTAD has already carried out initial assessment to design the
technical assistance to be provided and can commence work as soon as the Project work plan has
been agreed. Agreements have been reached with both Iran and Pakistan customs authorities for
provision o f assistance to ACD including the provision o f long term technical specialists. UNDO
has also expressed willingness to mobilize as soon as the project financing i s secure.

110.      Project disbursements to UNOPS in the first 6 to 8 months are expected to be
U S $ lSmillion. Over the same period approximately US$Smillion will be committed through
UNOPS and an estimated US$2,3million will be actually paid out to vendors by June 2004
(US$0.9million for ICT, US$0.25million for vehicles, US$0.75million for civil works through
sub-grants, US$0.3million in consultants' services, and US$O.lmillion in incremental operating
costs).

                            D. ProjectJustification andEconomicBenefits

111.      The viability o f the project has been appraised on the basis o f both conventional
economic costs and benefits and in terms o f its contribution to TISA's overall r e f o m strategy.
Economic analysis alone cannot encompass the potential benefits that the project have, in
reinforcing and widening the authority o f the Afghan government across the country.




(i) EnhancedGovernmentRevenue

112.      The overall result o f the project should be substantially increased government revenue-
it will help provide the financial basis for a functioning Afghan state, by ensuring sustainable
government revenue, through:

          (a) Improved and enhanced collection of customs duties, which are a relatively efficient
              means o f collecting such revenues. These are usually the major source o f government
              revenue for countries in which most activities are conducted in the informal sector,
              and where taxes on incomes, whether individual or corporate, are difficult to assess
              and collect.
          (b) Laying the foundations for the emergence o f an efficient and effective customs
              service. This can both widen the revenue net, by bringingmore o f the total trade into
              the official channels, and improve revenue collection.
          (c) Facilitating the transfer o f customs revenues from the provincial level to the central
              government

(ii)      Enhanced Trade and Economic Activity

113.      The project, by facilitating the introduction o f modem customs and trade regimes will
remove some o f the impediments to enterprise and help create the enabling environment for
increased economic activity and inward investment. Increased customs revenue is the first
fundamental objective o f the project, followed by the creation o f an enabling environment for
increased trade as the second basic objective. Inaddition, a more efficient and effective customs

Technical Annex: Emergency Customs Modemization & Trade FacilitationProject                    Page 23




service, with greater institutional capacity, could become an important frontline organization in
the govemment's efforts to control the flow o frestricted or prohibited goods.

(iii) EnhancedTransitFacilitation

114.      Improved procedures and a more efficient customs service within Afghanistan could
substantially reduce trade costs ifaccompanied by the streamlining o f the entire transit systems to
allow a freer flow o f vehicles and reduced restrictions on trade. Afghanistan i s potentially a key
link in transit routes from Central Asia to the Gulf and Arabian Sea. The development o f such
routes could generate transit earnings for Afghanistan but their real value may be the leverage
that they will provide innegotiatingthe terms and conditions for Afghanistan's own intemational
transit.

(iv)      Overall Economic Benefits

115.      The potential benefits from the project, if it i s successful in streamlining customs and
transit procedures and systems, are very large inrelation to the expected costs:

                   Truck time savings                     US$ 7.5 million
                   Cargo time savings                     US$ 1.6 million
                   Cargo loss reduction                   US$14.0 million
                   Cargo handling cost reduction US$6.5 million
                   Total benefits                         US29.6 million

116.      These benefits may be underestimated, as they, assume an underestimated value o f cargo
time, do not include imports on the Chaman to Kandahar route, and do not include the value o f
the reduced management time o f importers. Even if the project achieves only 50 percent o f its
modest targets, the project will still generate a substantial economic rate o f retum, on the basis o f
these narrowly defined benefits. If the wider implications o f increased customs revenues to the
foundations o f the state are included, the overall economic and social returns would be very much
higher.

(v)       ImplicationsFor Revenue Collection

117.      As the project will provide support for the development o f the customs service and
infrastructure, as well as overall policy development within the Ministries o f Finance and
Commerce, improved revenue collection by central administration remains an important
immediate and medium term objective. Based on the rather crude trade volume figures available,
and the draft revisedtariff structure, the total value o f imported commodities per year currently is
in the order of US$2-3billion and the un-weighted average yearly tariff collected would be
US$230million. However, to maximize duty collection in the medium term, it will also be
essential to covert unofficial trade into official trade through improved compliance. Much o f this
depends upon buildingcapacities within the MOF/ACDand MOC.

118.      Further details on the project's justification and economic benefits are given in
Attachment 12 and details on domestic revenue mobilization inAttachment 13.

                                       E. SustainabilityandRisks

119.      The project supports the TISA and its objective o f developing an unitary state with (a)
substantial power and responsibility vested in a central government, and (b) substantial

Technical Annex: EmergencyCustoms Modemization& Trade FacilitationProject                                Page24




domestically generated resources available to fund the basic functions o f the state. The project
will be implementedthrough a wide range o f activities undertaken at locations around the borders
o f Afghanistan. The project must be considered as highrisk in terms o f both the present security
problems within Afghanistan and the potential resistance to the basic aims and objectives o f the
projects. The project has been designed to minimize the potential risks and to mitigate the adverse
consequences.

(i) SecurityRiskManagement

120.      The overall security situation o f Afghanistan i s far fiom stable and some o f the main
Customs' posts are located in areas o f high insecurity. The project cannot pretend to be able to
control this risk but it i s designed to try and ensure that certain risks are managed to improve the
sustainability o f the project.


                                  Table 3: SecurityRiskManagement
               Risk                                                 RiskManagement
 Insecurity prevents the          The project will select the more secure locations for the first phase o f

 project                          security during construction.
                                  Subsequentphases o f constructioniimplementation will depend on the security
                                  positionon the maintrade routes.

 Assets are destroyed, once       Theproject will coordinate withthe local"Provincial ReconstructionTeams"
 provided. The ICT facilities,    (PRTs), constituted by the coalition forces, which are there to provide a secure
 including the VSAT and           and enabling environment for reconstructioninthe various regions o f
 Microwave links, could           Afghanistan, both during and after construction. The Project will also
 become potential targets,        coordinate with the newlytrained borderlcustoms police o fthe Ministry o f
 especially outside o f Kabul.    Interior as they become ready to mobilize at the border posts.



121.      Ultimately, however, it has to be accepted that outlying facilities o f the Central
Government, such as Customs' posts, may be targets o f disaffected groups and the only lasting
solution will be the overall reduction o f insecurity within Afghanistan.

(ii) OutcomeRiskManagement

122.      The successful implementation o f the project's objectives will almost inevitably impact
upon a wide range o f interest groups, for example:
    0     Increasing customs revenue collection by central government will diminishthe resources
          o f the provincial beneficiaries o f the present system.

    0     Increasing the efficiency o f the customs service and reducing the discretionary aspects o f
          the present system will result inprivate traders paying higher levels o f customs duties.

    0     Extending the coverage o f the formal trade sector may negatively impact those traders
          presently working through the informal system.

    0     Streamlining transit procedures may reduce multiple cargo handling and transit costs, but
          may also reduce employment at border crossings.

Technical Annex: Emergency CustomsModemization & Trade Facilitation Project                             Page 25




123.      The project i s designed to bring about a structural change within Government and
Afghanistan's external trade system. There i s the risk, therefore, that the implementation o f the
project will be resistedby some or all o f the interest groups who may be negatively affected. The
potential risks are recognized and implementation will involve the private sector and other
interest groups to influence a gradual change fkom informality to formality and to minimize the
economic and social effects when the new regulations and systems are implemented. Basic to the
design philosophy i s the attempt to change potential zero-sum situations into win-win solutions,
Table 4.

                                  Table 4: Outcome RiskManagement
                    Risk                                                 RiskManagement
 Increased smuggling and loss o f            Increasedcustoms efficiency and transparency will lower trade
 revenue                                     costs and reduce the incentive to avoid the official system.
                                             Improved customs controls and extended spatial effectiveness
                                             will increase the costs o fthe unofficial system

 Resistance by the major vested              Provide alternative opportunities for financial gain through
 interests at the provincial level           private participationinthe management and ownership o f
                                             warehousing and transit facilities

 Resistance by Afghan truckers to            Renegotiation with transit neighbors to increase the level o f
 through transit                             reciprocalaccess. Increasing overall economic activity will
                                             provide alternative transport demands

                                             improved salaries


124.      However, it has to be accepted that the project may not be able to compensate all possible
interest groups, and some resistance to the changes may be expected. The results o f a successful
outcome to the project are central to TISA's overall objectives, and thus there i s likely determined
efforts to overcome such resistance including, perhaps, specific employment policies at some of
the border crossing points.


(iii) ImplementationRiskManagement


125.      This would be a difficult project to implement even without the security issues in many
o f the border areas. The project combines investment in infrastructure along with policy reform,
major changes in work methods, many activities, two ministries and multiple donor agencies.
Project supervision costs will needto be higher than the IDA average, especially duringthe initial
period. Inaddition, the project implementation arrangements have been designed to minimize the
immediately identifiable risks.

will include the progress on the annual project work plan and overall progress on the project

         Sub-project grants will finance the construction /rehabilitation o f physical infrastructure
o f customs and transit for ACDMOF, and the rehabilitation o f MOC's physical infrastructure in
Kabul related to its working on trade facilitation and to develop the Bureau o f Standards and
Metrology. These works will primarily consist o f rehabilitatiodconstruction o f office buildings,
dormitories, warehouses, pavementdroads, inspection sheds, water supply and drainage,
generator sheds, guard towers, fences and boundary walls, weigh-bridges installation points,
lighting for boundary walls and parking. The subprojects are expected to range between:
US$lO,OOO and US$300,000 for the small repairs/construction works; and, more than
US$300,000 and US$1.5 million for the larger rehabilitatiodconstruction works. A few sub-
projects may cost up to US$3 million.

Direct Contracting or Solicitation of Price Quotations UB0.9million) - Subprojects less than
US$30,000 invalue can conduct procurement by soliciting quotations from at least three qualified
local contractors or by direct contract with a qualifiedlocal contractor.

National Competitive Bidding (US$3.0 million) - Subprojects ranging in value between
US$30,000 and US$300,000 will be implemented by contractors selected through the National

International Competitive Bidding (US$l0.0 million) -Since qualified contractors for works
exceeding US$ 3000,000 are not available in Afghanistan, contractors, will be selected through
the Modified ICB method, as per paragraphs 2.63 and 2.64 o f the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines. The bidding documents will require bidders to satisfy the appropriately determined
minimum qualification requirements in terms o f their experience as prime contractor in similar
works, annual volume o f turnover, and liquidassets. Sub-projects estimated to cost $1million or
more would be subject to pre-qualification.

        The biddingdocuments in each sub-project will stipulate that labor based techniques be
given preference during construction, except where delivery deadlines or other special

D.       UNOPSas the primeImplementationConsultant

         The project will be implemented by the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) o f the
Ministry o f Finance (MOF) usingUnited Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) as the
implementation consultant for the overall project. Project support to Ministry of Commerce
(MOC) will also be provided through UNOPS under its contract with ACDMOF. UNOPS has
been selected by ACDMOF as it implementation consultant based on the following
considerations.

         UNOPS i s already operational all over Afghanistan and has a proven record o f rapid
         implementation and positive management o f security issues duringimplementation .
         Being a UN Agency the Bank can easily arrange direct disbursement to UNOPS with
         TISA's      concurrence hence removing impediments              that often thwarts project
         implementation insuchpost-conflict environments.
         TISA can focus on the reformprocess rather than on project management.
         The financing mechanism does not circumvent TISA's budget mechanism and TISA i s
         the direct ClientIEmployer.
         Binding financial arrangements are put in place and sustainable funding commitment
        helps TISA better plan and implementreforms.
        Bank has the right to review all procurement and financial management procedures.
        Resources and overheads are shared between the various sub-project level activities;
        hence preventing duplicated effort or expenditure and diversion into non-productive
        activities.
        Continuity o f implementation arrangements i s achieved through use o f a single agency
        which contributes to overall cost efficiency, security o f project staff, development o f
        Local PS capacity through harmonization o f biddingdocuments, etc.
        Local, and foreign, private sectors are not excluded as UNOPS implements the
        subprojects and procures works, goods, and services through them.
        UNOPS can implement various parts o f the project across ministries that do not possess
        multiple implementing agencies.

        Based on the above advantages, the project supports using UNOPS as the implementation
consultant for the overall project. UNOPS will also engage: the services o f the United Nations

Attachment 1: ProcurementArrangements                                                            Page32




Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)' for providing assistance on ASYCUDA
development and implementation and on trade facilitation; and, the services o f United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)" for assistance in the development o f the Bureau
o f Standards and Measures.

          UNCTAD has a proven track record o f being a one-stop institution for capacity building
activities relating to trade facilitation and i s the parent organization under which the Automated
System for Customs Declaration (ASYCUDA) was developed and still operates. UNCTAD i s
involved in 300 technical assistance projects in over 100 countries. Its Trade Logistics Branch
(TLB) deals with: transport and logistics issues, including the Advance Cargo Information
System (ACIS)         program; trade facilitation issues, including Customs issues through
(ASYCUDA); and, trade and transport-related legal issues. The Trade Logistics Branch counts on
about 25 staff members, including project-dedicated staff, with a mix o f professional skills
covering the following fields: transport and logistics, including terminal operations; transport
software development and implementation; Customs reform and modernization; Customs
software development and implementation; trade facilitation measures (institutional, legal,
administrative and operational); transit agreement negotiations and implementation. This staff
includes well-prepared engineers, economists, lawyers, Customs officers, system analysts and
software developers, who provide substantive backstopping in the execution o f technical
assistance projects worldwide.

          UNCTAD supplies ASYCUDA free o f cost, assistance with its country implementation.
ASYCUDA i s currently successfully implementedin 84 countries-the           best installations, such as
those in the Philippines and Romania, are highly rated. Iran i s also using a Persian version o f
ASYCUDA that were developed with assistance from UNCTAD/ASYCUDA. Due to the
overwhelming similarity between Persian and Dari languages, TISA has requested that the
Iranianversion o f ASYCUDA be adapted for use inAfghanistan.

          UNDO has been involved in assisting developing countries to establish capacity in the
area o f standards, metrology, testing and quality (SMTQ) for close to three decades. In
implementing UNDO'S core mandate o f supporting industrialization, the starting point for
strengthening developing country manufacturing capacity, i s to be aware o f global and national
standards, have adequate metrology (measurement capability) and access to testing facilities. As a
result, in numerous parts o f the developing world, the standards institutions, metrology and
testing facilities have either been started by UNIDO or received UNDO assistance in capacity
development.

          UNOPS will enter into an interagency letter o f agreement with UNCTAD and UNDO
prior to signingthe overall contract with ACDMOF and after the agreement i s reached upon the
work plan (PWP) as described in the Technical Annex. The Bank will clear both interagency
letter o f agreements between UNOPS and UNCTAD and between UNOPS and UNDO prior to
the same being finalized and signed. ACD/MOF will sign an agreement will UNOPS only after
the Work Plan(PWP) for the project has beendeveloped andthe interagency letters o f agreement
have been signed, and after receiving the Bank's clearance.

J.      OverallProcurementRiskAssessment

        Despite the UNOPS procuring on behalfo f TISA, the procurement riskwas appraised as
highdue to the post-conflict environment, the geographically remote and dispersednature o fthe
works, and the decentralized implementation. Therefore, frequent procurement review missions
are proposed (once every four months) duringthe project implementation.

    FINANCIALMANAGEMENT,DISBURSEMENT,AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS


Country Issues

The World Bank has gained significant experience and understanding o f the financial
management issues in Afghanistan from implementing several projects over the past year. The
overall assessment is that though the country's financial management system i s not fully
functional, especially to manage donor projects, appropriate mitigation measures in general and
project specific, are being taken for this project. This will ensure financial accountability for
project funds. Inan effort to strengthen key institutions, the World Bank i s financing a Financial
Management Agent to assist the Ministry o f Finance and an Audit Agent to assist the Control and
Audit Office.     And the Da Afghanistan Bank is assisted by a team o f consultants funded by
USAID as well as a team o f advisors under the IndianAid Mission Program.

Strengths

The commitment o f TISA towards accountability and transparency in its operations is one o f the
greatest strength, as it provides confidence to the Bank management ensuring accountability and
transparency in utilization of funds. The institutional mitigation measures referred to above
reflect this commitment and will help inproper accounting and auditing o f financial transactions.
Engaging of a UNagency (most likely UNOPS), will further facilitate reporting according to the
bank's requirements. It will also facilitate the process o f disbursement to the suppliers and
contractors.

Weaknesses

One o f the strength o f the project, i.e. engaging UNOPS, also becomes the weakness of the
project, as it reduces the scope o f capacity enhancement o f the concerned departments inthe areas
o f disbursement, accounting and reporting. However, as a mitigating measure, it is recommended
that the Grant Management Unit (GMU) be made responsible for reporting. However as UNOPS
will be undertaking the activities and also malung payments, it will be its responsibility to
provide, in a timely manner, a detail report as required by the World Bank to GMU, Ministry o f
Finance. After the necessary review and approval GMU will forward the same to the World
Bank. This measure will further enhance participation as well as ownership in the project at the
MOF level.

FundsFlow

The funds will flow from the World Bank account directly to UNOPS accounts under the blanket
withdrawal facility. Under this arrangement an advance is provided to the agency, with a report
on a quarterly basis on its usage and a forecast o f expenditures to be incurred in the next period.
UNOPS will utilize the services o f UNDO and UNCTAD through a standard UN inter-agency
agreement letter and pay them as well. All procurement will be carried out by UNagencies.

Retroactive Financing

At TISA's request, the projectwill retroactively finance sub-project grants, equipment, consulting
services, and incremental operating costs for ACD o f US$2.0 million (6.5 percent o f total project

Attachment2: FinancialManagement,Disbursement,& Audit Arrangements                            Page 37



cost) for expenditures incurred after September 30,2003 in accordance with Bank's procurement
procedures (through UNOPS).          In any case, as per the Bank's guidelines on emergency
operations, any project expenditure paid prior to thefour months to the credit signing date, and
more than 20% of the credit amount cannot be claimed as retroactive finance. The retroactive
finance can be claimed only after the credit becomes effective. The claim will be admissible for
the following purposes: rehabilitation and refurbishment o f A C D Kabul Headquarters including
provision o f ICT goods and equipments, vehicles, technical assistance for ASYCUDA
implementation start-up (through UNCTAD), chief technical advisor for the project (through
UNCTAD),       project preparation for Bureau o f Standards and Metrology, institutional
survey/mapping o f MOC, required ad hoc technical assistance, and related incremental operating
costs. UNOPS will utilize monies from the existing funds available with it under the on-going
projects, and recover these costs from its first payment request under this project.

UNOPS will maintain a proper accounting system o f all expenditures incurred in the above
manner along with all the supporting documents for enabling IDA to verify these expenses.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

The Project will follow standard government financial management policies and procedures,
including using the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management Agent to record
Project expenditures. UNOPS will ensure that the quarterly reporting that it will undertake to
MOF will facilitate integration o f expenditures incurred, into the Government accounts. The
formats, o f these reports will be incorporated inthe contract agreement o f UNOPS.

Project accounts will be consolidated centrally inthe Ministry o f Finance, inparticular, its GMU,
with support from the Financial Management Agent, and consolidated Project financial
statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f Project funds.

GMU which is ultimately responsible for accounting, has been managing a number o f
Grandcredit projects for the last 9-10 months and has sufficient experience to handle such
accounting and reporting responsibilities. It has also developed certain procedures and systems,
that are very much inplace to ensure a systematic process of disbursement. As mentioned above,
there are certain weaknesses inaccounting o f expenditures on a day to day basis and, these need
to be worked on by the FM agent on a priority basis. Having said that, it may be added as
UNOPS i s likely to incur all expenditures it will be the responsibility o f the concerned agency to
ensure accounting o f all the expenditures, with proper fiduciary controls.

Staffing

Considering that the project i s being implemented by UNOPS, major responsibility o f
implementationlies with them. The major function o f GMUwill be to review, approve and send
quarterly FMRs to IDA. Hence no immediate additional staff requirements at GMU level are
envisaged as the responsibilities o f the project can be managed with the present staff position. At
the same time, it i s recognized that the overall capacities at the GMU are under pressure and
hence close monitoring will be necessary to ensure that it continues to manage these
responsibilities adequately. Accordingly, it i s recommended that MOF undertake assessment o f
GMU's workload and capacities to ensure that adequate staff is available to manage its
responsibilities effectively.

At the project level, the Customs Department falls under the Finance ministry, where GMU is
located, any requirements o f FM at the project level, will be easily taken care o f by GMU.

Attachment2: FinancialManagement,Disbursement, & Audit Arrangements                             Page38



Hence, no additional finance staff position i s being recommended under the project for the time
being. This can be reviewed as project implementationprogresses and specific needs materialize.

Audit Arrangements

The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with support from the Audit
Agent, under terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association.       The annual Project financial
statement to the Association would include a summary o f funds received(showing funds received
from all sources), a summary o f expenditures shown under the main Project components/
activities, and by main categories o f expenditures.    It should also disclose statement o f financial
affairs at the end o f the year and all major accounting policies used in preparing the statement.
The audit o f the Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f the
accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for
transactions; and (c) the eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing.        The
annual Project financial statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit
Agent, would be submitted within 6 months o f the close o f the fiscal year, i.e. by September 22
o f each year.   The following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit Reports Compliance
System (ARCS):

           ResponsibleAgency                      Audit                        Auditors
                   MOF              SOE, Project Accounts and             Auditor General
                                    Special Account

Reporting; and Monitoring

GMU will be provided, in a timely manner, the quarterly report in an acceptable format on
UNOPS expenditures. GMU, under the charge o f MOF, will review the same. UNOPS will    .
facilitate GMU in this review. After the report i s approved by MOF, it will form the basis o f
consolidation, if required, along with any expenditure incurred from the special account and
under direct payment mode, to prepare Financial Management Reports (FMRs).The Quarterly
FMRs will be submittedby the Grant Management Unit, to IDA. showing: (i) and uses    sources
o f funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii)      status o f procurement activities;
and (iii)physical progress. These FMRs will be submitted to the Association within 45 days o f
the end o f the quarter. Guidelines for borrowers on Financial Monitoring Reports on World
Bank-Financedprojects are available at the World Bank offices.




One o f the major FM risks o f the project is that GMU still does not have a proper accounting
system to record transactions on a day to day basis. It i s undertaking accounting only at the year-
end. The MOF with the support o f FM agent needs to look into this aspect on priority basis and
ensure that a regular accounting system i s in place before GMU starts undertaking expenditures
on a day to day basis under this project.

Other risks which could affect the FM performance o f the project i s the poor, or lack of,
coordination between GMU and UNOPS. Hence, UNOPS must have in place before the project
becomes effective, a person who will be directly responsible for coordinationwith GMU.

If the above mitigating measures are taken, the risk factor would be reduced from high to
medium. Regular monitoring of FM risks, particularly in relation to GMU's performance and
capacities, will further reduce this risk.

Financing Percentage.        Since collection o f tax revenue has just begun and i s sporadic,
disbursement percentages have been set at 100%with the understanding, however, that MOF will
submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis.        The tax structure o f the govemment will
be reviewed periodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages
need to be set and financing percentages amended accordingly.

Disbursement Method.         Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with
full documentation or against statements o fexpenditures as appropriate).

Blanket Withdrawal Method: As project activities will be executed by UNOPS, the Blanket
Withdrawal applicationprocedure can be followed, thereby enabling direct disbursements to UN
Agencies. On this basis, the UNAgency will be given an advance, and thereafter, will report to
IDA on a quarterly basis on the use o f funds, and the estimated forecast for the next six months,
to seek direct disbursements. Although reporting will be to IDA and disbursements will be made
directly to UNOPS bank account, UNOPS will be required to keep the line ministry informed at
all times on financial progress o f the project. There will be only one blanket withdrawal
application nominating UNOPS as the implementation consultantheneficiary. UNOPS will pay
UNDO and UNCTAD (the two other UN agencies involved). The use o f Blanket Withdrawal
procedure, does not preclude the line ministry from disputing direct disbursement requests made
by the UNAgencies to IDA.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). SOE thresholds are applicable for procurementmade,
outside o f the UNAgencies contracts. Since only UNagencies will handle procurements, for all
contracts with UNAgencies, reimbursements thresholds and reporting requirements as specified
inthe specific contracts, will apply.

Special Account. Should there be a need for a Special Account at any given time during the life
o f the project, the MOF would write to IDA and make a request. The Special Account will be
opened and maintained in D a Afghanistan Bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association; and would be operated by MOF-GMU in accordance with the Association's
operational policies. Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account would not exceed U S $ l
million.

Attachment2: FinancialManagement, Disbursement,& Audit Arrangements                        Page40




Minimum application size. In the case of Blanket withdrawal applications, this minimum
application size does not apply.      Applications for replenishment to the Special Account, if
required, will be submitted (1) monthly, regardless o f amount, or (2) when the Special Account
balance i s reduced by 40%, whichever comes first. The minimumapplication size for withdrawal
applications for reimbursement, direct payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is
20% o fthe Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account.

Authority to withdraw Grant funds. MOF-GMU will retain the right to sign and submit
withdrawal applications to the Association.

Action Plan

IDA has reviewed the operating procedures, including financial management procedures, of
UNOPS, and found them to be satisfactory. However, UNOPS must contract a coordinator for
all FMmatters dealing with GMU before the project becomes effective. Other items included in
the Action Plan are review capacities o f GMU as compared to the work load, and to ensure that
GMUhas adequate staff to effectively manage its responsibilities. It will also ensure that GMU
starts proper accounting on a day to day basis for all its expenditures.

Supervision Plan

From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive supervision. The focus
duringsupervision will be on the internal control arrangements o f the selected UNAgencies for
their internal functioning o f accounting, financial reporting and auditing. IDA will review these
criteria in order to ensure that they are in compliance with the operating guidelines reviewed and
accepted by IDA at the time o f the implementing agency's signing o f the contract with the
selected UNAgency.

A. Executive Summary

The mission visited Kabul airport and the major customs facilities in Afghanistan, including the
inland clearance facilities at Herat and Jalalabad and the border facilities at Islam Qalla (Iran) and
Torkham (Palustan)".       The characteristics o f border operations seem to be: (i)   Limited inward
transit and related extensive transshipments; (ii)     Insufficient control over goods, vehicles, and
passengers; (iii)   Poor space management; and (iv) Inter-agency overlap. At inland facilities, the
difficulties are: (i)Excessive clearance procedures and associated documentation; (ii)       Extensive
handling o f goods with possibly excessive examination; (iii)     Poor duty assessment. Everywhere,
infrastructure and equipment are insufficient. The central Customs administration suffers from:
(i)Absence ofcore management; (ii)Lackofcommunications; and(iii)                  Insufficient technical
skills.

Although the outside perception can be o f a weak and poorly organized administrative
environment, infrastructure, and overcrowding at facilities, reality may be somewhat different.
Despite some divergent views expressed during the interviews performance within the Customs
Department appears satisfactory, both in terms o f workload conducted and time for release.
There is functional control system. This control system i s often localized in nature and socially
oriented.    Although such a system may lead to an assured delivery o f cargo, it does not
necessarily secure revenue collection for the state nor does it foster or facilitate trade activity and
growth.

17Other site visits includedthe Mazar-i-Sharif region and borders with Uzbekistan.

Attachment 3: CustomsModemizationStrategy                                                           Page42




Even though westem standards are not necessarily applied, or applicable, in an environment
where the local culture i s a predominant factor, it i s important to devise strategy that
simultaneously introduces internationally accepted norms and procedures, and builds upon the
strengths o f the Afghan society. Only such strategy can help prepare Afghan Customs to meet
21st Century challenges, while ensuring ownership sustainability, and an improved foreign trade
environment.

B. Major findingsfromCustomsAssessment

(i) BorderIssues

a. Transshipment & Supewision - Cargo i s transshipped from the entering foreign trucks onto
Afghan vehicles."     The notable exceptions are (i)    Torkham, where Pakistani trucks are allowed to
proceed to Jalalabad, (ii)   Hairatan, where Uzbek trucks are allowed to the Mazar-i-Sharif region,
and (iii) to a limited extent, Islam Qalla, where Iranian trucks carrying foodstuffs and POL can
proceed to Herat (representing 1- 2 percent o f the traffic). All other cargo i s unloaded from the
incoming truck, and reloaded back-to-back onto Afghan trucks. The mission didnot observe any
Customs supervision during this labor intensive transshipment operation. Supervision becomes
difficult due to the position o f the vehicles, the large number o f trucks being simultaneously
~nloaded'~,and reloading outside the border zone.

b. Border to Inland Transit - After transshipment, border to inland transit i s managed under a
"Transit Document [pre-declaration notification] ", an "Ilm-o-Khabr [consignment note], and a
"Bar-Nama [bill o f lading] are the only documentation accompanying goods to the point o f
destination, with no insurance coverage. The system i s secured by: (i)convoying between
Torkham and Jalalabad, (ii)      retention and presentation o f the vehicle documents by the drivers
when reporting at the destination, and (iii)       approval given to a limited number o f drivers and
trucking companies, with clear instructions that failure to report cargo would result in
cancellation of the approval.

c. Proliferation of Passenger TrafJic -Border crossing at Islam Qalla and Torkham is intense.
Over 500 passengers cross every day into Afghanistan at Torkham,20(inaddition to an average o f
300 trucks and other commercial vehicles.21 There is unceasing shuttle traffic across the border.
At Islam Qalla, local residents are also allowed to cross the border line to visits shops located on
the Iranian side. (Passengers are allowed to bring back up to 30 kg o f duty free goods, mostly
foodstuffs, but the means to prevent abuse are limited.) There i s no separation betweenthe traffic
flows, and it i s extremely difficult for an outside observer to distinguishbetween shuttle trade,
border shopping, and commercial traffic.           Further confusion i s created by a multiplicity of
Customs workers (basically labor) unloading goods, and no uniformed enforcement authorities

  Consideringthe structure of trade, commercial vehicle statistics combine trucks (international and
Afghan specifications), andvans and shuttle minibuses with commercial loads.

19IslamQalla receives on average 250 trucks approximately per day.


2oEstimationbased on the average numberof coaches- no private vehicles are normally allowed to cross
the border.
*`According  to an initial survey carried out by UNOPS inSeptember 2003. Torkham would appear to
represent 70 percent inweight o f all imports into Afghanistan.

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                           Page43



with irregular presenceto direct the passenger to the Customs hall. The mission observedthat the
exit gate was not always guarded, and sporadic documentary checks were carried out on exiting
cargo. As there is no correspondencebetween the Iranian vehicles enteringAfghanistan, and the
inbound Afghan trucks leaving the border zone.                In the absence of clear monitoring of
transshipments, good could easily escape Customs control. At Torkham, a further difficulty
could arise ifthe plans o f the Ministerof Tourism to turn the current Customs building(owned by
that Ministry) into a hotel were to be realized. This would attract ancillary activities inside the
border zone that do not belong there.

d. Smuggling & Re-exports - Estimates are that up to 50 percent of all imports into Afghanistan
are smuggled. Another concern for regionalrelations i s the volume of goods which transit across
Pakistan into Afghanistan, only to be smuggledbackto Pakistan. Furthermore, those items on the
negative Pak list transit through Iran, only to be re-exported to Pakistan. The porosity o f the
border with Pakistan - and Turkmenistan - further aggravates the situation.                    Customs, the
relevant agency to prevent smuggling, have limited powers of enforcement, and no role inborder
patrolling.

e. Warehousing at Borders - There are numerous warehouses at the borders, mostly owned by
the Ministry o f Commerce, (MOC) that function under a somewhat informal22bonding system.
Inthe border zone at Islam Qalla, the mission observed large amounts of goods stored in the
open. The warehousesthemselves, while possibly insufficiently secured, are usually well kept. It
is, however, difficult to match a specific lot with the corresponding do~umentation.~~Altogether,
a rationalization o f goods inside the warehouses would free a significant amount of spacez4,and
facilitate inventory controls.

J Institutional Overlapping & Fragmentation of Functions - Several agencies operate at the
border. Inaddition to Customs, there are Afghan National Security forces and the border police.
The MOC too owns facilities, and carries out its own controls, for instance, at Hairatan, on the
Uzbek border, the unloading of trains i s carried out under the supervision o f MOC officials.
Basic Customs activities, such as the limitedborder-to-border transit across Afghanistan, are also
regulated by MOC. At some border crossings, the Ministry of Culture carries out an inspectionof
books owned by passengers (library control)25. At occasion, the multiplicity o f agencies,
combined with the traffic mayhem, has resulted in inter-agency conflict. In some instances, the
police has barred access to the border area to Customs officials, on grounds that they did not
possessproper identification.




22The systemis actually a vestige ofthe Soviet era-MOC/SOEs providewarehouse bondliability,
whereas SOEsItransporters provide movementbonding liability.

23There is however a local identification system: A slip, indicating the consignee, is affixed to most
parcels.

24Such freed up space couldbe usedfor accommodating some o f the goods stored inthe open, ifrequired,
since the open storage adds to facility congestion and has greater chances o f cargo slipping through
unnoticed.

25Inmany countries, allthese activities wouldbe delegatedto Customs, under the authority ofthe relevant
administration.

 Attachment 3: CustomsModernization Strategy                                                      Page44



 (ii) InlandClearance

a. Documents - Goods are cleared according to an import program and a kind o f declaration.
Imports must be licensed by MOC. Other documents to be produced include the transit form, and
the bill o f lading or CMR. A more formalized declaration was introduced at Kabul Customs
(airport and inland clearance facility), in an effort to prepare for the introduction o f the Single
Administrative Document.26 At most clearance facilities, there i s a good manual cargo reception
 system (based on a register where particulars o f all shipments are entered), but discharge o f
arriving transit cargo only takes place ifthe office o f origin sends a query or a consolidated list o f
all transits initiated during the month (Islam Qalla). As there are no licensed Customs brokers
operating inAfghanistan, some Customs offices have a help desk, where officials assist importers
in filling declarations. While this is a real service provided to the trade, it may also generate
conflicts o f interest, as the same officers are likely to later check the declarations.

b. ClearanceProcedure - At the Herat inland clearance facility, all arriving goods are unloaded
into a temporary warehouse, under reasonable Customs supervision. They are then transferred to
an inspection bay, where extensive weighing and numbering takes place, together with sampling
for certain categories o f imports such as medicine. After examination, goods are returned to the
warehouse until their subsequent release, following payment o f duty. At Mazar-i-Sharif,
approximately one third o f every shipment i s unloaded and retained in the warehouses,
presumably as a guarantee that duty will be paid.

c. Classijkation & Assessment - Assessment o f duty relies on tariff classification and valuation.
These two activities are performed by the Chamber o f Commerce, based on documentation
provided by the importers. While Customs do not currently have the capacity to carry out these
core Customs activities, the classification o f goods without any physical inspection is not
satisfactory, and can lead to severe misclassification, error or ffaud. Valuation i s done on the
basis o f an invoice, compared against a data base o f minimum price lists. At Kabul airport,
ACOC has provided Customs with an electronic version o f that data base. For importers who
elect to clear the goods without referring to ACOC for certification o f the value, the relevant duty
i s increased by 25%.

(iii) HeadauartersFunctions

There i s practically no capacity within Customs headquarters to manage administration, apart
from a clearly committed and well-selected Deputy Minister o f Finance, currently in charge o f
the Department. This makes it even more difficult to ensure a consistent and reliable application
o f Customs procedures, and to apply a minimal level o f control to ensure prompt remittance to
the central govemment o f import duties. Basic shortcomings include the following:

     -   The necessary technical skills in specialized areas (valuation, classification, procedures)
     are apparently not available. Basic training should be provided rapidly, replicated with field
     training, and corresponding administrative capacity introduced to handle these modern
     instruments.




26 The use of the SAD i s a necessary pre-condition for computerization o f clearance. The introduction of
the Afghan Customs Declaration was considered a f i s t step, although the document (i) includes 17
                                                                                         only
fields compared to the SAD'S 52, (ii) not aligned to the UN layout key, and (iii) not appear to
                                        is                                             does
follow international coding standards.

Attachment 3: Customs Modernization Strategy                                                   Page45



     -   Although plans were made under the current five year plan for a comprehensive
     headquarters structure, it i s highly unlikely that all units would be staffed in the near future
     with competent and skilled staff. A contingency organization should, therefore, rapidly be
     put in place, to support the progressive implementation o f the development plan, and make
     the best use o f the extensive technical assistance currently provided to the Department.

     -   Senior Customs management has limited control over field operations, due to poor
     communications, distances, and in some areas, the political situation.          It is, therefore,
     essential that an information system, combined with telecommunications, also be rapidly put
     inplace.

(iv)     Strengths

The above overall assessment i s somehow mitigated by a number o f strengths not immediately
visible to outside observers, but identifiable within Customs:          (i)Productivity interms of
workload per staff i s satisfactory; (ii)  Control mechanisms over consignments operate well; and
(iii) characteristicsoftheAfghansocietyofferalternativestosomeimportedadministrative
     The
standards, while providing better ownership over the reformprocess.

a. Performance - One rough indicator o f productivity i s the total number o f declarations
processedin one year per staff. Although inmost locations there i s no Customs declaration inthe
modem sense, an extrapolationbased on the total number o f vehicles entering the country would
indicate an equivalent o f 100,000 declarations per year. Compared to the staff (1,100 officers),
this would give a ratio o f 91, well above the average o f Central Asian Republics. However, this
figure should be used with extreme caution.

Observation at the borders and inland clearance facilities, albeit limited, indicated 2 to 3 day
clearance delay.

Corruption may have been curbed as within Customs recently, 35 officials were dismissed, and
another 65 re-assigned to other duties, indicating a strong commitment to fight rampant corrupt
practices. Consistent information suggests that bribes are mostly asked for facilitation, which
would be reduced by streamlining o f procedures. There i s evidence that the highest bribes are
collected by enforcement agencies other than Customs.

b. Control - Although there are numerous breaks in the audit trail, and documentary processes
are embryonic, it is very likely that officials keep movement o f goods under tight control. There
are no reports o f cargo missing in transit, other than cases o f hi-jacking which are beyond the
control o f Customs. While the retention o f vehicle documents may prove awkward insome cases,
the system i s effective. Officials responsible for warehouse control know, in the absence o f any
apparent inventory control, the location and status o f the goods they are responsible for.
Importers never complain about missing cargo or pilferage. This would point to parallel methods
o f control, which are well accepted.

c. Sociological Dimension - The mission i s inno position to carry out an anthropological study
o f Afghan society, but it comes out clearly that strong family ties and consensually reached
decisions by tribal leadership plays major roles in establishing an effective chain o f command.
To ensure ownership and reasonable sustainability o f the Customs reform plan, these social
strengths should be factored in, to introduce modem standards. There i s an urgent need to train
the youth to manage this change process; and simultaneously achieve goals like devolution in
power structure.

Attachment 3: CustomsModemization Strategy                                                             Page46



C. A Possible Development Strategy to Operationalizethe Five-year Plan

The country strategy aims at reducing the dependency on Customs revenue within the next five
years, to reach a more realistic 70 - 30 split between intemal taxes and Customs duties, while still
increasing revenue collections from Customs. The authorities are considering joining Customs
and the tax administration into a united revenue agency (URA), or merging the two under the
Ministry of Finance. Another objective is to develop transit activities. These goals will require
changes in the legislation and the introduction o f modem standards, supported by appropriate
technology and equipment.        Improved and streamlined procedures, a clarification o f inter-
departmental relations, and reinforced human resources, will contribute to the result. Such a plan
requires a strong and professional Customs administration. The following points show the areas
where efforts should be focused inthe initial phases.

(i) ManagementObiectives

It is important to understand the existing system, its local divergences, and build upon its
strengths. T o do this, a core o f headquarters managers, possibly recruited externally, should take
over the Department. This management team would need an orientation course in a neighboring
country.   They would rapidly (i)      carry out a personal assessment of the administration, (ii)
determine clear short term objectives, and (iii)       establish and maintain contacts with the field.
Limited IT support would already be necessary at this stage. A phased strategy should be
followed, with distinct short and medium term objectives.

a. Immediate Objectives - These should include specific organizational and revenue-related
objectives, as shown inthe table below:



 Examples of   I     Ensure the dissemination o f information; Start buildingownership.
                                                                              -
 short term       0  Carry out field visits to provide assistance, not to control; Provide incentives, review
 objectives -       infrastructure and prepare quick solutions for immediate visible improvements.
 Organization

 Examples o f    0   Improve the documentary control systemto make it more visible: Introduce a
 short term         correlation between arriving foreign trucks and their Afghan equivalent; measure time
 objectives -       for processing; assess the workload o f different workstations.
 Revenue             Validate the activity o f Customs laborers through spot checks and audits.
                     Assess the valuation system, estimate revenue shortage due to under-valuation,
                    identify major importers, customize procedures for these.



b. Medium-term Objectives- Ina secondphase, the management team would first specialize,
then draw a medium term strategy. As day to day operations are crucial, the team should
specialize in(i)Organization and Administration, (ii)      Procedures, and (iii)    Operations. Some
examples o f steps requiredinthese sectors are provided inTable -below.

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                            Page47




  Organization          Begin to organize a staff managementpolicy: Computerization o f staff records;
  and                 Preparation o f a salary policy and a career profile; Organization o frecruitment based
  administration      o n a multi-annual budget projection; Initiate staff and skills assessment.
                        Inparallel, organize headquarters: Rehabilitate amanagement floor; Introduce
                      mentoring; Establish, define, and maintaincontacts with the private sector at policy
                      making level.
                        Prepare a skeleton IT unit.

  Procedures            Review existing procedures and roll-out satisfactory local initiatives
                        Prepare the introductiono f Customs brokers, review help desk procedures

  Operations            Prepare a matrix o f legislation by main objectives and identify conflicts, overlaps,
                      or inconsistencies; design a basic flow chart o fnetworks and interactions, within the
                      admmistration and outside.
                        Identify weaknesses, internal and external.
                        Design a communication strategy.



c. Parallel Replication at Customs Houses - As this process would be going on, the team would
also identify field correspondents who would replicate this approach at Customs house level. The
Headquarters structure would simultaneously be expanded to cover the areas identified as the
weakest, and most likely to generate rapidly improved revenue collection.

(ii) DevelopmentStrategy

The objective would be to identify the main objectives that Customs want to adopt for the next
five to ten years. A mission statement should be drafted. It should include the role o f Customs,
and how and when its different components would be achieved.

a. TheDifferent Roles of Customs - It is desirable for Afghanistan Customs to gradually assume
a more than purely revenue orientedrole. Improved customs effectiveness would rely on it being
conferred a preventive and enforcement role, and for it to ultimately become a specialized
enforcement agency.

b. Chain of development into a Specialized Enforcement Agency - Experience in other countries
traces the evolution o f many customs administrations from a purely revenue oriented origin to a
enforcement agency role. The nature, scope and logical chain o f customs operations demand
following development modelhhain to be adopted:

    Customs administrations begin with a purely revenue oriented role. However, unlike other
    revenue administrations, Customs guarantee the payment o f duty by withholding the goods.
    That relation i s essential. Customs must control goods inmovement, and intercept goods that
    are not immediately reported. This has a number o f consequences: Customs must identify the
    goods; ensure delivery; obtain payment; detect offences; and prosecute offenders.
    Customs services thus deploy preventive and enforcement wings. The role o f the preventive
    service is to ensure that all goods are delivered to assessors. The assessment branch ensures
    that goods are only released if they are in accordance with the existing legislation (tariff and
    other laws).   The enforcement service detects goods that were not submitted to Customs
    control.
0   In some countries, preventive and enforcement duties are performed by other agencies.
    While this may work if there is good collaboration, it i s often not the case (competition,

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                       Page48



    superiority, different priorities). As a rule, if another agency is capable o f identifying goods,
    it means its members have a Customs function. They should then come under the Customs
    umbrella.
    Should Customs take over other activities? Collecting excise and VAT on imports essentially
    involves, at no extra cost, an additional revenue line on the declaration if codification is
    standardized. The next step could be to collect domestic excise, as the collection mechanism
    i s basically the same.
    As Customs see all movements o f goods, it can also act on non-revenue matters. This is
    becoming an essential role o f Customs in Western countries to Control standards, protect the
    national heritage, play a role insecurity, fight illicit smugglingo f narcotics and, detect illegal
    immigrants and emigrants.
    In turn this requires: (i) delegation from other agencies and cross-designation; (ii)       training;
    and (iii)  an enabling legislation.
    Customs needthe powers o f investigation and intervention. Typically, ina transit country, or
    in a country with difficult to control borders, Customs should have the power to operate (i)
    outside approved Customs areas, (ii) the territory, and (iii) the border line.
                                           within                          along
    Ultimately, Customs become a specialized enforcement agency.

c. The integration of Customs with tax administrations - There i s an on-going debate in many
countries on the mergerhntegration o f Customs and Tax administrations (a frequent occurrence in
Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, and many Latin American countries). Table below
assesses the pros and cons o f the with and without merger options.

 Infavor of the merger:                         Against the merger:
      Economies of scale;                       0     Customs do less and less revenue work and
      Close relationbetween smuggling and             increasingly non-revenue related    - including
      fiscal fraud;                                   enforcement and criminal investigations     -
 0    Customs valuation impact on VAT                 activities, work inphyto-sanitary and
      collection;                                     veterinary fields;
 0    Audit methods used for the VAT            0     Customs control i s physical (and justifies
      increasingly try to focus on when the           control over excise goods), unlike tax audits;
      event took place, like Customs            0     Customs services are not linked to the
      checks;                                         residence o f the taxpayer, but to the location o f
 0    Merger allows an organization by                the goods;
      categories o f taxpayer.                        There are very wide differences incorporate
                                                      culture betweenthe Customs and tax
                                                      administrations.



There will always be a limit to integration. IT and HR could be integrated, but an integrated IT
would essentially provide a networking solution as opposed to a fully integrated fiscal system.
Many merger experiences have failed such as in Argentina, merger worked to some extent, in
Canada, but there was already a kind o f merger philosophy there as it tried to merge its Army,
Navy, and Air Force, some years ago. Even in Canada, though, the specificity was kept o f each
administration. As a rule o f thumb, mergers work essentially in an environment where Customs
have no or very limited powers o f enforcement. For example, attempts to more closely integrate
Customs with the tax administration in France have always failed because Customs are, in effect,
closer to the other law enforcement agencies, and have little incommon with inlandrevenue.

Attachment 3: CustomsModemization Strategy                                                   Page49



This strategy would need to be approved and formalized, by the govemment together with
budgetary support. A long term strategy should be designed to overcome possible objections.
For example, the Ministryof Interior may object to wide powers o f enforcement. Customs must
then insist on participating in anti-smuggling operations, and gradually demonstrate its
effectiveness.

d. Institutional Financing Arrangements - Customs can be funded through a varying mix o f the
following sources:

    Budget allocation
    Declaration processing fee. The WTO agreement authorizes the collection o f a declaration
    fee, as long as it does not become an "invisible" duty. It should, therefore, be a flat fee, and
    correspond to the approximate cost o f providing a service to users.         According to an
    interpretation o f the WTO agreement, this fee would be usedto maintain the computer system
    used for clearing the goods. The cost o f processing a declaration i s approximately the same
    irrespective o f the value o f the goods. This fee should be entirely re-allocated to Customs,
    and a Government commitment to this effect shouldbe sought.
    Overtime and special clearance fees.       In many countries, it is accepted that after-hours
    clearance, or clearance on the premises o f the importers, comprises a service that should be
    paid for. However, the tendency inWestern countries i s to move away from this system.
    Proceeds offines and seizures. Inmany countries, Customs i s allowed to retain a part o f this
    revenue, and a fraction i s used to reward detecting officers. While rewards should not be
    considered a major part o f the remuneration, they should (i)   provide an incentive, and (ii)
    show recognition for results. Another part o f the pooled funds could be used to reward non-
    operational staff for their professionalism.

(iii) Re-centeringofCustoms

There are many activities currently carried out by Customs which do not belong to this
department, and may eventually lead to a conflict o f interest.

a. Reassignment & Separation of Help Desk Staff-         As a brokerage profession emerges, staff
from the help desks would be gradually either re-assigned to other positions, or taken over by
brokerage firms. However, there will always remain a need for assistance to the public within
Customs. Inparticular, with the computerization o f clearance, kiosks where occasional importers
who do not have on-line access to the system can key-in their declarations will be necessary. (It
i s essential that staff assigned to these assistance activities are in no way involved in the
subsequent control o f the declarations they have helpedto prepare.)

b.   Gradual Reassignment of Laborers - There is a considerable workforce o f "Customs
laborers" responsible for unloading trucks and presenting the goods to inspectors.*'         This i s
usually a function performed by brokers. Although the present arrangement provides numerous
opportunities o f employment, it i s likely to be gradually phased out, considering the eventual
disappearance o f transshipment as through transit develops, and the introduction o f mechanical
handling equipment. As this i s a sensitive area, a very carefully planned strategy would have to
be devised, possibly including:




27 Approximately 1,000 at IslamQalla.

Attachment 3: Customs Modernization Strategy                                                Page50




0       Partial privatization o f handling activities: The laborers would be approved by Customs,
        butwould set their own fees, etc.;
        Establishment o f handling entities;

        Consolidationo f warehousing and transshipment;
        Provision o f new services (e.g.,       sale o f documents, intermediation, guarding of
        consignments).

(iv)      Staff Policy and Training

To builda professional cadre, with adequate skills, two conditions are needed: (a) A satisfactory
environment with adequate safeguards, and (b) access to training.         The extensive amount of
technical assistance currently provided to Customs must be managed to ensure that it
complements without saturating the development strategy. Some other measures that could be
adopted to improve staff motivation and efficiency include:

a. Improving the Working Environment & Public Image - Experience shows that Customs
officers all over the world suffer from a siege complex. Job satisfaction is a primary guarantee of
integrity. Staff must be recognized within their administration and by the outside for their
performance and service to society. This implies that there should be no subordination to other
agencies, institutional or operational, and that the different publics Customs deal with are aware
o f the role o f the Department. Inaddition, Customs should operate ina decent environment. This
should start with headquarters, and gradually be extended to field locations. (Caution should be
exerted to not over-equip the administration, as hardware and equipment are only tools, and do
not replace common sense.)

Customs Ranks and Uniforms Customs officers should be clearly recognizable, have a proper
uniform with appropriate ranking insignia.

b. Dealing with Corruption - All over the world, Customs tend to be more corrupt than other
agencies, because Customs officers have discreet and immediate control over tangible wealth.
Good work environment, supported by a strong team spirit, are important elements. Breaking the
discreet contact with the trade i s another. Interestingly, the World Customs Organizations Arusha
declaration only mentions adequate salaries as the ante-penultimate measure to be taken.

Other more imaginative ways o f dealing with petty corruption could also be adopted, drawing
from the experience o f other countries, such as the consolidation o f payments approach. Two
such experiences are described below:


        In a neighboring country, boarding an international flight at the airport was next to
        impossible, unless payments were repeatedly made at security checkpoints, Customs and
        immigration controls, and check-in counters. Although not massive in price, these bribes
        were rapidly discouraging foreigners to visit the country. The authorities then decided to
        establish a VIP circuit, at a cost o f US$50, which ensured a reliable and fast boarding
        procedure. The fee corresponded approximately to half the amount o f bribes that were
        asked for in the past. It was distributed among all the staff, according to a scale that
        included individual performance. Gradually, bribes also ceased from travelers who didnot
        apply for the VIP stream.

Attachment 3: Customs ModemizationStrategy                                                   Page51




0       Inanother country, as trucks exited the port area, there were numerous checkpoints where
        small bribes were asked from drivers. The Port authority carried out a survey, ascertained
        the total amount o f money requested from drivers, and offered the different agencies to
        collect it upfront and re-distribute it to the administrations, as long as the money went to
        the field staff. Checkpoints disappeared overnight, and were replaced by more efficient
        and targeted roadside checks.

c. Technical Training h Locally Innovated Systems - Technical training i s necessary, as the
skills o f many Afghan Customs personnel are limited. Although basic skills in technical areas
can be acquired in a standardized manner, the local culture must be taken into account when
delivering courses. It i s important not to discourage the staff by giving the impression that (i)
new procedures are artificial, suited best to the Western environment, and may not work in the
local surroundings, (ii)   objectives are unattainable, and (iii)standards are forcibly imported.
While some documents and procedures (SAD, HS, WTO valuation code) are international and
should be adopted in any case, it i s not always the case for processing chains. Staff should be
encouraged to design their own operational systems.

d. Training in Neighboring Countries - Inthis respect, mentoring or tutoring arrangements with
adjacent counties are probably more efficient, and less costly, than conventional technical
assistance.    Although the standards may not be up to Westem best practice, they already
constitute a progress over the present situation. Experience also shows that staff from a weak
environment, when abroad, (i)     tend to recommend best rather than corrupt practice, even when
they experience them in their own country, (ii)understand better the local situation, and (iii)
avoid the discouraging patronizationthat occasionally occurs with internationalexperts.

e. Performance-based Staf$ng - Staffing, although largely constrained by current social factors,
should be realistically assessed based uponjob performance indicators. Attachment 6a provides
an example o f national and site indicators that can be used to assess workload. Although many
other elements should be considered before determining the staffing level at a specific location,
overall consistency should be sought, as experience suggests that over-staffing limits
productivity.

(v)      Legislation

a. Drafting of the Customs Code - It i s essential that the new Customs code provides Customs
with the ability to gradually take over the different activities envisaged under the development
strategy. Even if these activities cannot be undertaken immediately, they should be factored in
under the law. The opportunities to modify the Customs law are limited intime, and international
experience shows that it i s extremely difficult to bring substantial modifications to Customs
operations once legislation has been passed. This is particularly the case for enforcement-related
activities.

b. Objectives Matrix - The table in Attachment 3b describes, as an example and in a non
comprehensive manner, the main activities that could be envisaged in Customs in a Western
environment. To ensure connections and interactionwith other agencies, it would be necessary to
identify the different laws and regulations that affect these activities.         Harmonization and
complementarities could then be sought.          This matrix would also be useful to design the
networkmg solution to be adoptedbetween the different players.

c. Sub-legislation (procedures & practices)       -  An often encountered error is to wait for the
legislation to be voted upon before any work i s done on second and third degree regulations. As

Attachment 3: CustomsModemization Strategy                                                      Page52



most provisions o f the law are likely to be enacted, especially when consisting o f international
standards, as i s the case for valuation, subsidiary regulations should be prepared as early as
possible, to enable prompt introduction.



(vi)     Infrastructure and Equipment

There i s currently very limited, if any, office and telecommunications equipment, let alone search
tools and computers. Infrastructure varies from adequate but run-down to seriously deficient (see
Attachment 4 for details). Inaddition, some facilities are poorly located: in Jalalabad, the inland
clearance facility i s in the middle o f the bazaar!. Parking lots and many thoroughfares are not
paved, generating clouds o f dust in summer, and numerous puddles inthe rainy season. Furniture
i s often damaged. There i s little filing space, although archives are well kept. However, again,
the immediate perception should be announced, at least to some extent, since:               (i)Search
equipment i s only as good as the staff who use it. Therefore, extensive training i s necessary, not
only in the technical handling o f the equipment, but also in the principles o f search; (ii)    Local
inventiveness can efficiently handle traffic, even in the worse conditions; (iii)     In a culture that
relies less on written formats, other methods o f referencing have appeared; and (iv) Managerial
pro-activity at times supplements weak infrastructure.

a. General Objectives & Requirements for Infrastructure Investments - Plans for investment
should therefore be carefully organized and phased, taking into account the following:


          Priorities: The objectives should be to introduce (i)     decent work conditions, likely to
          promote job satisfaction, and generate an image o f professionalism and authority; and
          (ii) trafficflows,thusnecessitatingarationalizationofthelocationofbuildings,
              smooth
          and, within the facilities, o f the different work units (e.g., placing the examination bays
          inside the warehouses).
          Dejnition of the work process: With the introduction o f new procedures, there will
          likely be less physical examinations, thus requiring less space; some clearance may take
          place at importers' premises; and also at bonded warehouses should be owned and
          operated by the private sector but approved by Customs.
          Improved control:      Efforts should be made to link the documentary flow to the
          movement o f the goods.       The facilities, whether at the border or inland, should be
          guarded by gate officials, with permanent and adequate control over movements into and
          out o f the area.
          Satisfactory location: Typically, clearance facilities should be located close to the final
          destination place where the goods will be used. At the border, the Customs processing
          facility should be as close as possible to the entrance o f the border zone, and, when not
          possible, there should always be a Customs check post at the immediate proximity o f the
          border line ineffect, next to the border police check point.

b. TheInfrastructure Development Action Planfor Afghan Customs - Inthe Afghan context, the
following action plan i s therefore suggested:


          Rehabilitate a (temporarily limited) headquarters structure, to install a core management
          team and establish its credibility. This should involve outfitting, computer equipment
          linked into a local network, air conditioning, telephone and/or radio equipment.

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                         Page53



           Establishat all facilities a gate control shed, with appropriate working conditions, and, in
           particular communications with the local management.
           Start separating the public and users from administrative positions, using counters,
           windows, and establishing secluded areas where the public i s prohibited.
           At borders: (i)  Separate traffic flows (pedestrians, minivans, and trucks), using concrete
           separators o f the width o f a traffic lane, to prevent vehicles from stopping and jamming
           the area; (ii)Establish Customs control booths close to the border line, with
           communications with the central unit; and (iii)     Whenever possible, introduce signals to
           direct traffic to appropriate lanes.
           At inland facilities, pave the parking lots and access roads, and reorganize the
           examination bays within the warehouses.

           Rehabilitate the management buildings/sections and create separate areas for the public
           and the staff, with limitedinterface areas.
          Progressively introduce local computer networks, supported by (i)        power generators and
          UPS, (ii)  air-conditioning, and (iii) adequate security.
          Develop a telecommunications network (i)within the facilities, and (ii)with
          headquarters, and (iii) the local authorities and other agencies (in particular the
                                     with
          police).
           Start training in (i)  computer use, (ii)management o f control issues, and (iii)        search
           techniques (it i s only at this stage that it would be effective to introduce sophisticated
           search equipment).

As facilities improve, a bonus for the local staff could be envisaged, further building up
ownership over the reforms.

(vii)     Preventive and EnforcementWork

Modem Customs administration can only operate if they have the ability to investigate cases o f
smuggling. As the role o f Customs i s primarily to ensure compliance for imported goods with
national regulations (including, but not limited to, the Customs tariff), it i s important that
Customs should (i)     ensure that all goods are reported to Customs when they cross the border, and
(ii) goodsthatwerenotreportedtoCustomscanbefoundwithintheterritory. Inaddition,
    that
trade facilitation measures imply more relaxed upfront control, thus requiring a "safety net"
provided by inland enforcement. As discussed above, these activities are sometimes handled by
Ministryo fInteriorofficials, butthis is not satisfactory, as itrequires a technology backupthat is
not necessarily available to the police.28 It i s therefore better ifCustoms cany out preventive and
enforcement activities themselves.

The scope o f these activities varies: (i)      Post-release audits, which are not investigations, are
carried out by Customs, sometimes in conjunction with tax authorities; (ii)Investigations are
usually based on information, or the analysis o f import patterns, and require access to many


28Insome countries, anti-smuggling activities are definedunder the penalcode, andare enforcedbythe
police. While this is possible inan environment where smuggling is easy to define (Le,, weapons and
narcotics), ina modemeconomy, smuggling is multi-faceted, and the identification o f smuggled goods i s
not effectively performedby a non-specialized agency. Smuggling is therefore better handled under the
Customs law, ifonly because prosecution and penalties are usually based o n a multiple o f the market value,
which i s better assessedby Customs.

Attachment 3: CustomsModemization Strategy                                                   Page54



sources o f information, as well as sometimes tough enforcement; (iii)Preventive duties consist in
(a) ensuring that nothing crosses the border unreported, and (b) verifying the status o f goods and
vehicles circulating within the territory when there is an indication that they may have been
imported.

Inan environment such as in Afghanistan, where security is often problematic, these activities
can be dangerous, and require trained and well equipped personnel. Customs may not have the
necessary organization to carry them out on their own, but it i s essential that they should be
associated to other agencies' patrolling duties.

The introductiono f an enforcement strategy could be based on the following outline:


   0  Establishment o f a specialized unit inheadquarters, managingcontrol squads;

   0  Installation o f a basic command center;

   0  Equipment (vehicles and communications) o f a few squads, with accompanying training;

      Patrols along the main transit itineraries;

   0  Secondment o f Customs enforcement officers to border patrols;

      Specialization o f an investigations and intelligenceunit;
      Development o f the preventive and enforcement wing o f Customs.

Attachment 3d. describes in more detail an implementation strategy for the Preventive and
Enforcement sector.

 Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                         Page55



                                             Appendix3a

                Macro Performance Indicators-Development Obiective Achievements

This category o f indicators is designed to provide (i)a management tool, (ii)a basis for
comparisons and (iii)     a way o f measuring productivity gains. Like any indicator, the following
 are average values, and should be used with circumspection. Most values are abstract, and do not
reflect the real situation at a specific work position, but provide a benchmark for subsequent
review o f the work process.

(i) BasicDefinitions

a. Revenue Collected - The revenue collected is the total revenue taken by Customs, irrespective
o f the budget line to which it i s credited, and because the indicator shows how much the
organization contributes to the State budget:
        Customs duties,
       VAT collected on imports,
        Excise (collected on imports, and inland excise duties when these are also collected by
     Customs),
       All other fees collected by Customs onbehalfo fany other administration,
       Proceeds o f sale o f confiscated goods, when such sales are conducted by Customs,          29

       Re-assessments o f duty subsequent to post release reviews, investigations, or Court
     decisions (these should be indicated for the year when they are actually paid), and,
       Fines and penalties, when they are actuallypaid. Evenwhen some o f the proceeds o f the
     fine are allocated directly to Customs, they shouldbe considered as revenue collected.

b. Customs Staff- Customs staff means all the employees on the payroll o f Customs, and those
not on the payroll o f Customs who are working full-time for Customs e.g., drivers or supporting
personnel.     When staff are not working full-time e.g., cleaning personnel, they should be
prorated: the total number o f working hours divided by the legal annual working hours for an
individual equals one full-time employee.

c. Total Customs Cost - This i s the total cost to the State for running the Customs service. It
consists o f the budget o f the department, including: salaries (paid to all those working in
Customs); overtime; bonuses and rewards, paid out o f the budget (including rewards paid out o f
the proceeds o f fines and sale of confiscated goods because they are captured under component a.
above); Runningcosts; and, Sums directly taken out o f fines and used for maintenance and small
repairs. It does not include capital investment, because such expenditure is usually spread over
several years, and its benefits may only appear inthe medium or long term place inFN. (A
specific indicator could be derived to assess the marginal efficiency o f capital expenditure.)




29There may be a slight distortion here, because it can be argued that, even though Customs did not make
the sale, it provided the merchandise, and therefore the revenue, so it should be credited with the budget
revenue. However, there is a cost to (i)  keeping the goods, and (ii)  organizing their sale, so if Customs
were to dispose o f confiscated goods, they may still not be able to generate the economies o f scale
produced by a specialized agency.

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                                     Page56



d. Salaries - This is a sub-set o f c. above. It includes all payments made to persons working in
or for Customs. When rewards are paid out o f the proceeds o f fines, they should be included (the
total fine is creditedto the budget, and the corresponding reward i s included inthe salaries paid).
Salaries should also include overtime paid by the trade to Customs for services provided outside
working hours (such as clearance at night or duringweek ends), because work duringthose hours
also generates revenue.

e. Trade volume - This i s the volume o f recorded foreign trade, imports and exports, according
to balance o f trade statistical methodology.

J Annual number of declarations - This is an aggregate figure including import and export
declarations. The figure only consists o f declaration numbers, irrespective o f the number o f items
each declaration includes. Although this may introduce a slight distortion, it i s assumed that, at
national level, one- and multi- number declarations will balance off, in terms o f numbers and
workload. As an example, an oil tanker with only one item on the declaration may represent
more processing work than a "groupage" with 99 items on the declaration.. Transit and manifest
documents are not included, because they eventually lead to a declaration (except in border to
border transit, which again introduces a minor distortion), and their processing i s generally
included inclearance. Declarations re-processed innational or regional headquarters (e.g., inward
processing, or post release audits) should not be included.

(ii) Indicators

The table below lists possible indicators that can be used to monitor project performance. These
are classified into two broadheads, i.e., indicators o f efficiency and workload.

 Indicators    Indicator 1. Revenue  Shows the cost/effectiveness o f staff. When staffing changes, it shows the
 of            collected/ Customs    marginal efficiency o f additional staff. The evolution o f this indicator will also
 Efficiency    staff                 reflect changes inthe work environment (for example, the number o f working
                                     hours set down by law), and will be affected by changes inthe duty structure and
                                     the pattemof foreign trade.

               Indicator 2. Total    Shows the global costleffectiveness o f the department. It can be affected in the
               Customsservice cost   same way as the above indicator.
               /Revenue collected

               Indicator 3. Salaries Shows more specifically the work input o f the organization. When compared
               /Revenue collected    with indicator 2 above, it indicates the part o f fixed and incremental costs.

 Indicators    Indicator 4. Trade    This figure reflects crudely the cost to the economy o f imports and exports. It
 oworkload
   f           volume / Customs      cannot be used independently, because some expensive commodities require the
               staff                 same processing as cheap goods. It can however help insetting a national
                                     standard and be used to compare the situation at similar Customs houses.
                                     Italso gives an ideao fthe gap between salaries paid to Customs officials, and the
                                     amount o f tangible wealth which they handle.

               Indicator 5. Annual   This indicator requires particular attention. Although it gives the overall work
               number of             output o f the administration (Le., the number o f declarations cleared), the local
               declarations /        situations may vary very significantly. A border station, essentially dealing with
               Customs staff         transit traffic, will process very few declarations, but may still have a heavy
                                     workload. Comparisons are therefore easier to establish between inland
                                     clearance stations, but, again, the type o f goods that are cleared at a particular
                                     location may require different forms o f processing, and lead to differing

Attachment 3: Customs Modemization Strategy                                                Page57



(iii)    Possible Use o f Indicator Data

a. Overall assessment of performance - Indicator 1. gives a general view. When indicators 2.
and 3. are compared, they give an indication o f the relative efficiency o f staff compared to
equipment.    They also give a general correlation between staff and other running costs, and
therefore enable the corresponding budgeting when additional staff is hired. This indicators
highlyvariable, so it shouldbe comparedto the workload indicators (4 and 5).

b. Comparisons - All figures are calculated at national level, andtake into account work unitsfor
which direct outputs are difficult to measure. For example, headquarters make policy decisions
which impact departmental efficiency, but cannot be immediately quantified.         However, the
national level provides a benchmark, albeit an arbitrary one. Ifthe same calculations are made at
regional and local level, they will point to certain possible trends such as: (i)the evolution o f
efficiency at policy making level (by calculating the difference between national and local
figures), (ii)differences in productivity between two stations, and (iii) exogenous local factors
about which management may not be aware.

c. Staff assessment - As administrations gradually introduce an annual staff assessment system,
the indicators can be used - with extreme caution - to compare individual performance to
standards calculated at national, regional, and local level.

d. Stafing and policy decisions by management - The decision to reorganize or establish new
work units can be evaluated by taking into account workload and performance values collected at
other positions. As an example, the necessary staffing would be (partially) calculated according
to national criteria, with possible local adjustments.

e. Public relations - An important aspect o f the work o f modern administrations i s to publicize,
its performance both within the Government and to the public.

                              Assessment o f TISA's Draft Customs Code

A. Summary

The law i s clear, based on the EuropeanUnion code, and embodies many modem features, which
include:    Valuation code aligned to WTO principles; post-release checks; the possibility for
selective examinations electronic filing; Customs brokers; deferred payment and implicit
possibility o f electronic payment. However, a number o f provisions are either missing, or could
be stated ina more precise manner.

B. DetailedAnalysis

Subject to a more detailed analysis, the following areas may require further clarification: (i)  Area
o f competence o f Customs; (ii)   System o f proof; (iii) o f investigation, search, and arrest;
                                                           Powers
and (iv) Procedures and operations.


(i)      Competence o f the Customs administration

a. Territorial Competence-Article 2 ii.provides for operations on foreign territory. It establishes
grounds for shared border facilities, but does not (i)   mention the reciprocalpossibility for foreign
Customs authorities to operate on Afghan territory, (ii)      envisage that co-located border stations
would require an intemational agreement extra-territorializingthe foreign territory on which they
are located, so that the domestic legislation (which extends beyond Customs law) can be applied,
for example, arrest and detention o f an offender in a co-located border facility conceded on
foreign territory when that individual i s a national o f the neighboring country. Also, applicability
o f other laws, such as traffic rules, between the facility and the Afghan border.

Articles 4 and 5 define the territorial competence o f Customs, but limit it to approved border
crossings and designated inland locations (although article 13-6 and 13-7 envisage mobile
preventive and enforcement activities along undefined roads and at the premises o f importers). It
would, therefore, be simpler to state that Customs have the power to operate throughout the
Customs territory. Article 4 describes in vague terms the Customs territory (the reference to
territorial waters, unless it concerns the Amu Daria river, i s superfluous); it does not establish a
special border zone (strip o f territory that extends inland from the border, and where Customs
officers have extended powers o f search and control).         It does not define the border line, or
exclusions (or forms o f relative exclusion) from the Customs territory (free zones), and does not
mention intemational airports, which are implicitly approved crossing points, but where right o f
access o f Customs officers must be stipulated. There are no provisions relative to the right o f
access o f Customs officers to postal sorting offices, although it is implicitly mentioned under
article 5 1-2.

b. Operational Competence- As a rule, Customs shouldbe responsible for control over (i)         goods
and vehicles crossing, having crossed, or about to cross, the border, and (ii)   individuals related to
the above; Customs should also be the only agency allowed to perform checks when related to the
movement o f goods. However, article 13-a) appears to restrict Customs powers to the control o f
goods at approved crossings, or along specific roads (see also 13-6), and it i s not clear if other
agencies have similar powers. A provision according to which Customs are the sole agency
responsible for the control over goods imported, exported, or in transit, and individuals and
vehicles wholwhich carry them, may prove useful to avoid possible conflict o f authority based

Attachment 3: CustomsModemization Strategy                                                          Page 61



notably on an over-extensive interpretation o f article 9. Furthermore, it should be explicitly
stated that Customs may perform compliance checks throughout the territory, and have the power
to stop and search vehicles.

(ii) SystemofProof

Customs laws often rely on some form o f reversal o f the burden o f proof. This i s the case for
valuation, but i s often extended to other activities. For example, when individuals carry goods
within the border zone, Customs officers should have the power to request evidence that these
goods were regularly acquired on the domestic market, or were lawfully imported. In some
countries (France), there i s a list o f items which must always be accompanied by evidence o f
lawful detention. In the absence o f such evidence, the goods are considered smuggled. These
provisions prove in particular extremely effective against smugglingo f narcotics, as evidence o f
legal detention cannot, usually, be provided.

Articles 272 and 273 describe the procedure for documenting violations, but do not establish the
legal standing o f evidence thus collected. A distinction between factual evidence documented in
a statement signed by two Customs officers (which can only be disputed by administering the
proof that the evidence was incorrect), and admission o f guilt (which can always be retracted)
may prove useful inCourt proceedings.

(iii) PowersofCustomsOfficers

Article 12 o f the draft law i s very general, and combines several distinct concepts: (i)       uniforms
and firearms, and (ii) obligations (limited to ethics and confidentiality). Article 13-6 mentions the
obligation to present identity cards, but there i s no definition o f these cards. It i s not clear what i s
the status o f Customs officers (there i s a comment in the draft test concerning the possibility o f
them not being civil servants). There i s no provision for an oath taken on commissioning. The
provisions about firearms are vague. Powers o f search and arrest are not defined (neither i s the
possibility to submit a suspect to a body or in-cavity search).           The possibility o f searching
premises does not appear to exist. In the current text, this would lead to handing over to the
police all serious enforcement activities.

(iv)    Procedures and Operations

The law seems to institute a monopoly for clearance by Customs brokers (article 16): This may
not be consistent with international practice, where an importer always has the choice between
self-declaration, or usingthe services o f a broker.
    e   There i s a reference inarticle 18 to a "Customs board" which i s not defined inthe law.
        There i s no provision for a declaration processing fee, although this i s a convenient way
        o f fundingthe maintenance o f computer systems.
        There i s no apparent provision for statute o f limitation.
    e   Exemptions and end-use verification are too broadly defined.
    0   There should be a mechanism for dealing outside the Court system with other than
        smuggling Customs offences.

                The Customs Preventive and EnforcementApproach inAfghanistan


(i) InternationalBackground

The Afghan Customs Administration i s moving to a new approach to its activities, much more
objective-driven and dynamic than in the past.          It is based on an internationally observed
evolution:


0     The revenue collecting role o f Customs, although fundamental, will evolve, due to (i)
      reduction o f duties (regional free trade agreements, WTO rules, EU accession), (ii)the
      introduction o f VAT, which implies radically different organization and methods o f work,
      (iii) increasedinvolvementinintellectualpropertyissues,and(iv)anessentialroleinthe
           an
      protection o f the environment, notably through the application o f international conventions;
      Customs are increasingly involved intrade and transport facilitation (just-in-time inventory,
      increased border traffic, international competition);

      Customs have a unique observation ability to monitor movements o f persons, goods, and
      means o f transport, and that capacity should also be put to use in a whole range o f non-
      revenue related activities, including the fight against smuggling, illegal immigration, and
      organized crime;

      There i s a strong distinction between verification of compliance for commercial traffic, and
      the detection o f smuggling and other offences, but the overlaps in terms o f detection
      techniques and skills are such that the same institution can effectively combat both types o f
      irregularities.

(ii)    Objectives o f the Present Preventive & EnforcementPlan

The present plan aims at:


      The measurement o f compliance and facilitation o f legitimate trade through the
      introduction o f (i) selectivity for the verification o f commercial imports, and (ii)
                                                                                           targeting
      o f suspicious individuals and means o f transport, thereby enabling non-Customs traffic to
      cross the borders unimpeded;
      The introduction o f a modem investigations service destined to (i)       collect and process
      intelligence, (ii) feed selectivity and targeting databases with updated information, (iii)
      carry out investigations and document and prosecute offences, and (iv) support post-release
      checks and audits;
      The introduction o f a preventive and enforcement (P&E) service which will patrol the
      borders and main domestic routes, will support the investigations branch, and will carry out
      spot, random and/or targeted checks, on passengers and goods entering the country.

(iii) SupportPlan

The plan will require support from various donors, preferably from countries that have
demonstrated a strong capability for processing Customs-oriented intelligence information, and
have developed a preventive service inan environment comparable to Afghanistan. Inaddition, it

Attachment 3: Customs ModemizationStrategy                                                             Page63



requires further streamlining and more effective targeting o f key issues, as described in the
sections to follow.

 a. Needfor Improved Compliance Checks & Better Enforcement - Revenue collection mustbe
 complemented by improved compliance checks, and facilitation should be balanced with better
 enforcement throughout the territory, at a time when the very concept o f border i s less
 geographic than functional i.e., the border i s where and when importers and travelers have
 satisfied all obligations related to finally entering the country - for example an inland clearance
 station, or bonded warehouse.

 b. Increased Institutional Scope & Territorial Control - The following checks and verifications
 should therefore be performed, on a selective andor targeted basis, all over the territory:


0      Customs should have the ability to check vehicles in transit to establish that they comply
       with international rules, and that goods are not leaked onto the domestic market. When
       goods that were obviously smuggled are found within the country, this becomes a Customs
       offence.

0      The area o f activity o f Customs i s not only the actual approved border crossing. Smugglers
       can also cross the border line in the interval between two border stations (the "green
       border"). Customs may authorize crossing the border at certain points where it does not
       maintain a permanent presence, but must be able to intercept and identify goods brought in
       contravention o f existing laws.
       It will be increasingly difficult - and ineffective -to try to inspect everything, either at the
       borders or at inland f a ~ i l i t i e s .Modem Customs must use selectivity tools, based on risk
                                                 ~ ~
       analysis, intelligence sources, and sharing o f data with other agencies and institution^.^'
       Simplified procedures, as recommended by the WCO Kyoto Convention and EUstandards,
       provide for clearance outside Customs facilities. These must be supported by the ability to
       carry out checks, audits, and sometimes searches, inimporters' premises. Such verifications
       are either established by law, or pre-accepted by importers who wish to benefit from
       streamlined clearance procedures. It must be accepted that (i)in no country will all the
       irregularities be detected or prevented, and (ii)international experience shows that
       comprehensive checks are the worst way o f ensuring compliance.

 c. Counteracting & Confronting Non-revenue Criminality - In the course o f these activities,
 Customs can encounter other, non-revenue types o f criminality, either when goods are imported,
 or by subsequently reviewing past activities, such as the following:


      Illegal immigration is better detected when vehicle and container checks are determined by
      preparatory targeting and analysis o f documents and intelligence sources. In addition, an
      indicationo f illegal traffic can be obtained through the analysis o f previous movements.




31 Duplicated controls carried out successively     bythe police andCustoms on the same vehicle, as is often
the case now, are not only a waste o f resources, but also prove even more ineffective when they become
systematic.

32 Domestic and foreign.

Attachment 3: Customs ModernizationStrategy                                                              Page64



0      Customs all over the world play a major role in the fight against drugs smuggling, partly
       through controlled delivery mechanisms, monitoring o f commercial shipments, and their
       institutional responsibility for carrying out search and rummage;

0      Concern for environmental issues i s increasing, and Customs play a fundamental part in
       identifying and interceptingtraffic o f endangered species (Washington Convention), radio-
       active material, or dangerous and/or polluting items.

Although addressing this type o f criminality i s essentially the role o f the police, Customs should
contribute to the defense o f society and be able to process its sources o f data, initiate
investigations, and participate in subsequent inquiries and legal proceedings. In an environment
o f increasing menaces, the role o f Customs as a full-fledged law enforcement agency i s far from
negligible.

 d. Customs Preferred Role & Enforcement Functions - To participate in these State objectives,
 Customs must be part o f a new organization o f responsibilities and competences. For Customs, it
 means:
       Expediting genuine trade while developing tools for targeting and selecting suspicious
       movements, with no interference from other agencies;
       Ensuring compliance through: (i)a radical re-deployment of staff and resources, as
       envisaged under Customs development strategy, (ii)              introduction o f mobile enforcement
       teams as part of a full-fledged preventive service, at borders as well as the inlandp (ii)             a
       strong capacity to share and process intelligence, obtain - and pay for - information from
       informers, and use commercial data available to Customs or the tax administration for
       detecting other irregularities (such as VAT frauds);
       The possibility to carry out, under specific conditions, controlled deliveries and manage
       undercover operations;

       Cross designation o f police and Customs officials to carry out up-front coordinated checks;
       and

       Wide inter-agency cooperation, destined to use the best resource when and where it i s
       available.

(e) Possible Bottlenecks in the Implementation of the Plan - Until recently, the evolution o f
Customs in some countries has been different from the strategy outlined above. This i s because:
(i)thetraditionalroleofCustomsinsocialist, andother, countrieswaslimitedtotravelersand
exchanges involving state enterprises; (ii)      free movement o f goods outside approved points o f
clearance was restricted, and by default very often considered as contraband, so the detection o f
smuggling required limited skills; (iii)either vested interests or matters o f national security
encouraged govemments to entrust border control issues to agencies supposedly more loyal than
Customs; and (iv) inthe meanwhile, Customs acquired a reputation o f corruption and malpractice
that made that agency untrustworthy. Although throughout the world Customs i s considered a
law enforcement agency, in Afghanistan resistance i s expected to this evolution. The Afghan
Customs Administration has indicated its clear commitment to change through its reform


33For example, staff at border stations incharge of initial verifications should be part o f district squads,
rotating according to traffic needsbetween border stations, and carrying out targeted verifications, either at
the border crossings, along the green border, or along the major roads. Many o f these controls canbe
carried out incoordination with other law enforcement agencies, but Customs should also have the ability
to operate autonomously.

Attachment 3: CustomsModernizationStrategy                                                   Page65



strategy, and i s intent on playing the role o f a modern agency, fully aware o f its responsibilities
towards national objectives and i s confident inits ability to deliver.

0    Needfor Phased Implementation - This plan will, therefore, require the phased introduction
o f reforms, involving legislation, organizational strengthening and training, incentives structures,
and procurement o f essential equipment. This should be phased inthe followingmanner:

0      Necessary supporting legislation, sub-legislation, guidelines, and definitions;

0      A new and flexible organizational layout, accompanied by specific training, including in
       matters not immediately identified as linked to Customs (basic immigration, phyto-sanitary,
       standards, and environmentalrules, destined to create awareness o f these issues);

0      Cross-training between agencies, to encourage all staff to make effective use o f resources
       available inother departments;
       A compensation, rewards, and career perspective, package; and
       The necessary equipment to gradually build up a preventive and enforcement wing in the
       Afghan Customs Administration.

                 INFORMATION& COMMUNICATIONTECHNOLOGY (ICT)


           A.         Background,ExistingICT Infrastructure& RecentDevelopments

(i)      Current Status o f AfghanistanTelecommunications Infrastructure


     0   Afghanistan has an inadequate national telecommunications infrastructure. The Ministry
         o f Communications (MOCmm) operates a limited digital service mainly in Kabul, Herat
         and Mazar-i-Sharif, where recent national and international satellite links have been
         established. A fixed line digital switch comprising o f 12,000 lines has recently been
         installed in Kabul which has 7,000 active lines. Similarly Herat has a 7,500 fixed line
         digital switch, while Mazar has a capacity o f 4,000 lines. Work i s inprogress to connect
         five main cities o f Afghanistan using Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) which
         will give the MOCmmlimitedtransmission backbone to connect all its digital circuits.
     0   There are two Global Standard for Mobile (GSM) service providers operating in the
         country, namely Afghanistan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC) and Roshan.
         However, their services are limited to only Kabul, Herat and Mazar. Their networks are
         already saturated and cannot meet the growing demand.
     0   The inadequate communications infrastructure i s a major limiting factor in overall
         government operations. The effect i s much greater on the Afghanistan Customs
         Department (ACD), where flow o f information i s absolutely necessary for efficient
         operations.

(ii)     Government & Bank Strategy inthe ICT Sector


     0   As part o f the draft national ICT policy, the MOCmm has identified the expansion and
         improved functioning o f the government's own communications network, as a major
         priority for communications development over the next year.
     0   There i s an approved IDA credit - the Emergency Communications Development Project
         -designed to improve delivery of communications services to the Government and people
         o f Afghanistan. The project has three major components, covering: (a) expanding and
         integrating the existing Emergency Government Communications Network (GCN), (b)
         MOCmm's institutional capacity buildingand (c) postal sector reform. Inthe first phase
         o f the GCN component, the MOCMM will expand the existing GCN to include an
         additional 12 ministries which are located in Kabul, including Ministry o f Finance. The
         second phase will include expanding the GCN to 14 provincial capitals.           The ICT
         services provided to provinces, inparticular provincial capitals, include connection to the
         Mustojiats and Customs inaddition to other important government offices.
     0   It is expected that the private sector will eventually take a lead role to provide the
         requiredtelecommunications infrastructure and related services.

(iii)    Current State o f ICT Infrastructure including Computerization at the ACD


     0   The mission visited Customs headquarters in Kabul, Kabul international airport, custom
        houses (ICDs) in Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat and Mazar, and the border posts at Torkham,
         Islam Qalla and Hairatan. The team also carried out detailed infrastructure surveys and

Attachment 5: Information& CommunicationTechnology                                             Page 78




        needs assessment of custom facilities duringthese visits, includingfor ICT elements such
         as electricity, telecommunications, and computerization.
     0   At present the communications infrastructure between custom offices inKabul (including
         the headquarters, Kabul airport and the ICD), provincial offices and border posts i s non-
         existent. The present limited GSM cellular services and digital lines being operated by
         the MOCmmare inadequateto fulfill the communicationneeds o fthe ACD.
     0   All ACD processesare manual. USAIDis runninga capacity buildingprogram, including
         for automation, through a team of Bearing Point consultants working with ACD. The
         program consists of assisting ACD in Kabul to automate some o f the processes and
         develop an ACCD (Afghanistan Codified Customs Declaration), which has been
         implemented inKabul but not in the outlying regions of Afghanistan. This project will
         be in a position to benefit from new legislation, a new HS tariff, a trader identity
         numbering scheme (TIN), valuation and classification reforms and from a scheme to
         license professional Customs Brokers. These Bearing Point outputs will be converted
         into the format required for the ASYCUDA system.
     0   Power supply i s available at most ICD locations, including Kabul, Herat, Mazar,
         Jalalabad and Kandahar. However, there are some locations, including the border posts,
         where the electricity is neither stable nor reliable, and i s contingent upon supplies from
         neighboringcountries.


B.       Proposed Project's ICT Objective & Strategy

(i) ICTObjective

The objective of the proposed project ICT works is to create an enabling environment for
efficient working of the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD).

(ii) TheICTStrategy

Modem communication systems and transformation o f manual processes to an automated
platform are essential for efficient management of customs operation in Afghanistan. Access to
adequate communication systems and effective use o f ICTs globally has shown increased
revenues, improved delivery o f services, and an overall significant improvement in customs
operations. The project's ICT modernization strategy shall focus on:

a. Modernizing Communications - A strong and reliable communications network comprising of
Voice, Data and Video (at later stage) would be an important contributor in the successful
implementation of the proposed Afghanistan Customs Modernization project. It i s proposed that
a robust communications network be established using VSAT - SCPC (Single Carrier Per
Channel) links to connect custom offices and border posts around the country. To accomplish
this task a phased approach is recommended. This approach is in line with MOCmm's overall
telecommunicationpolicy framework.

b. Automating Processes- ACD's current manual processes not only lead to departmental in-
efficiencies hampering trade, transport and transit activities but also result in substantial revenue
loss for the TISA. I t is imperative that these manual processes be migrated to an automated
customs system incorporating features like systems administration, national configuration, tariff
and master file maintenance, cargo manifest handling, declaration processing and accounting.
MOF has decided to implement ASYCUDA++ developed by UNCTAD for this purpose. The
Bank project will support the computerization, automation and ASYCUDA adoption processes

 Attachment 5: Information & CommunicationTechnology                                         Page 79



through: financing IT infrastructure; strengthening power supply and backup arrangements; and
providing technical assistance for computerization, automation and ASYCUDA implementation.

 c. Merits of Adopting ASYCUDA - Some o f the advantage o f implementing ASYCUDA++
include the following:

It is built on customs best practices around the world and has been successfully implementedin
more than 80 countries,
One o f Afghanistan's major trade partners, Iran, i s already usingit and importantly has agreed to
provide the Persian version o f the software to Afghanistan and also assistance in implementing
ASYCUDA++.
Furthermore, the accounting and declaration data from ASYCUDA, if made available to both the
Governmental and regional authorities, has the potential to build a degree o f trust and
transparency into the system. This could contribute to the development o f and agreement over a
fair and equitable system o f revenue sharing Moreover, the use o f duty deferment accounts could
enable goods to be releasedunder bond allowing the revenue to be collectedcentrally.
From the systems architecture point o f view, ASYCUDA uses distributed server environment
which i s independent o f round the clock linkages/connections - and i s thus fully functional off
line.

d. Rationale o f Bank Involvement inCustoms ICT improvements - Bank involvement is needed
inthe light o fthe following factors:

         TISA has specifically requested Bank's assistance insetting up a robust ICT network for
         ACD.
         ICT improvements will support IDA'STransitional Support Strategy's objectives related
         to fiscal strategy, institutions and management and governance and public administration
         reforms. The project i s completely in line with the ACD's Five Year plan and will assist
         the Ministry o f Finance achieve its objectives as laid out inthe plan.
         Other donors are already involved in building basic capacity in computing skills and
         automation.        The Bank project I C T works will built on the work already done, by
         providing the requiredinfrastructure, equipment and technical assistance.
         There i s an immediate need to setup an adequate communication infrastructure followed
         by a planned and comprehensive automation strategy including implementation of
         ASYCUDA.
         The Bank i s already engaged with the TISA in the area o f communications, for instance,
         Emergency Communications Development Project has been approved by the board. The
         proposed project ICT strategy i s consistent with the overall telecommunications sector
         strategy. BothBank projects are likely to have a mutually complementary outcome inthe
         communications sector.

         ProposedICTElements

The proposed ICT improvements include: (i)installation and commissioning o f a reliable
communications network to connect custom offices in Kabul, custom houses in the provincial
capitals and border posts, (ii)provisioning o f adequate power supply system to support
automation and communications infrastructure (iii)automation i.e., computerization including
implementationo f ASYCUDA++ and capacity buildingo f custom staff in basic computing skills
as well as specialized software training inASYCUDA++.

(i) ACDCommunicationsNetwork


     0  Phase one would be a pilot installationo f VSAT (SCPC) hub site at customs headquarters
        inKabuland connectingKabulairport andICDusingradiolinks.
     0  Phase two would involve connecting provincial custom houses (ICDs) with headquarters
        in Kabul again using VSAT (SCPC) links and in phase three all border posts will be
        connectedto headquarters inKabul.
     0  VSAT - SCPC technology has been recommended to connect custom offices and border
        posts across Afghanistan after a careful review o f all other technologies available,
        especially the Microwave links. The installation o f Microwave links to connect border
        posts with provincial capitals and usingexisting MOCMMVSAT links would have saved
        ACD substantial monthly recurrent bandwidth costs. However, given the mountainous
        terrain and distances between provincial capitals and border posts, installation o f
        Microwave links would not only require heavy initial investment but will also be a
        challenge to maintain, mainly because a number o f "repeaters" are required which will
        create numerous point-of-failures,
     0  VHF and HF radio technologies will also be implemented to facilitate voice
        communicationswithin ACD.

(ii) ACD'sPowerInfrastructure

Adequate power infrastructure i s required to support the proposed automation and
communications network o f ACD. The project works will thus include the installation and
commissioning o f Generators, Solar panels, UPS and Voltage stabilizers for all locations. A
situation and needs assessment o f the present power supply arrangements i s provided in Table 1
below.

(iii)    Automation of ACD - Computerization including office equipment and implementation
         o f ASYCUDA, Transit Systemand Capacity Building

Thiswill entail the following equipment and technical assistance:


     0   IT equipment, including PCs, printers, scanners, servers, etc., at the Kabul ACD and
         training facility, Kabul airport, Kabul ICD and training facility, 4 regional ICDs and at 8
         border posts.
     0   Installation of ASYCUDA and capacity buildingkaining both in terms of operating and
         maintaining ASYCUDA and related systems. This will require continuous training of the
         customs staff both in basic computing skills as well as in ASYCUDA++.              USAID
         through the Bearing point has prepared a good ground in this area by identifying about
         twenty Afghan staff fluent in English with some basic computing slulls.             These
         individuals are presently under training.    These local staff can act as change agents
         duringthe project implementationand can also helptrain others inthe ACD.
     0   A permanent well equippedtraining roomwill be setup as part of this project at the ACD
         headquarters in Kabul which will be used to deliver regular IT training classes to the
         staff. Moreover, the training facility planned at the Kabul ICD will also impart IT
         education to customs officers from boththe center andthe regions.


D.       InstitutionnelArrangements & ProjectImplementation

(i) Automation&ICTImplementation

a. Management Staffing at the ACD - It i s recommended that an experienced IT ProjectManager
(PM) be appointed to implement the ICT works of the Afghanistan Customs Modernization
project. The P M will be responsible for: (a) successful implementationof all elements o f the ICT
project including commissioning o f the communications infrastructure, setting up the ACD
LAN"           and ASYCUDA++ installation, (b) IT training for the ACD staff both in basic
computing skills as well as specialized ASYCUDA training in coordination with the UNCTAD
team, (c) formulating an IT team to operate and maintain the ICT infrastructure, (d) single point
of contact for all ICT related issues inthe project. The ideal candidate for this position would be
an Afghan who could then occupy the job of Director IT, as proposed inACD's Five Year Plan.
However, given the scarcity of trained local resource persons in Afghanistan, it may not be
possible to hire a local. Inthe scenario of hiringa foreign consultant, it would beprudent to have
an Afghan Deputy Project Manager (DPM), who would work with the P M on the ICT project
closely from the start and will be in a position to take over the responsibilities as soon as the
project i s completed.

b. Strengthening WOPSICT Management Capacity - UNOPS is likely to be the implementing
agency for the implementation of the project, including its ICT works, on behalf of the
MOF/ACD. Duringthe appraisal, the team met with UNOPS' Procurement and ICT officers to
assess organizational capabilities required to implement the ICT works. Although UNOPS in
Kabul has been involved in implementation o f two Bank projects with significant reconstruction
work, so far they have not been engaged in any major ICT project implementation. Therefore, it
i s recommended that they strengthen their ICT implementation and project management team
basedinKabul for successful completion of the project.

UNOPS' ICT project team should comprise of a Project Manager with at least ten years of
experience in implementation of similar IT projects and an ICT Specialist fully conversant with

Attachment 5: Information & Communication Technology                                            Page 82



VSAT and radio technologies, LAN/WAN infrastructure based on TCP/IP, VHF and HF radio
operations, hardware sizing, network security etc.

(ii) ASYCUDAImplementation

The implementation strategy for ASYCUDA i s again a phased one, where a pilot site will be
selected first and will be thoroughly tested before rollouts to other locations. The pilot site
ideally would be the customs headquarters, Kabul airport and the I C D at Kabul. For the Transit
system implementation Jalalabad - Torkhum - Kabul corridor would be a good pilot site which
would be in line with the overall project phasing. Please refer to Appendix 12a for a detailed
ASYCUDA++ implementationplan as well as related costs.

(iii) Sustainability&Risks


     0   Even with minimal or no I C T infrastructure, Afghanistan customs still manages to
         contribute about eighty percent interms o f revenue to the central government. Improved
         I C T infrastructure and automated processes are likely to contribute to increased revenue
         collection, provided these are optimally and efficiently operated and maintained.
     0   Technical sustainability will be enhanced through continuous training and transfer o f
         technology for implementing the proposed works. A detailed technology transfer plan
         for all I C T elements will be prepared and the progress will be monitoredregularly by the
         Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager o f the ACD.
         It is assumed that with implementation o f the project, ACD will be able to generate
         enough fimds/revenue to sustain its VSAT links and be able to pay for the monthly
         bandwidth costs.
         Given the scarcity o f human resources, Ministry o f Finance and A C D will formulate a
         plan with Kabul university to bring in students during summer holidays as interns, who
         can then become prospective employees. This could partly help mitigate the capacity
         constraints o f ACD inthe successful implementationo f the ICT works.
         The ICT project i s potentially at risk from the general security situation in Afghanistan.
         ICT installations includingVSAT and Microwave links could become potential targets of
         attacks, especially outside o f Kabul. However, like most o f the current reconstruction
         and development efforts, the long term sustainability o f the project i s likely to be tied to
         the general security situation inthe country.

(iv)     Procurement Methods

a. Procurement of Goods - The procurement o f goods will be done through turnkey contracts
for the provision, and maintenance o f the communications network ,office equipment including
computers, printers etc. and power equipment. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and
National/Intemational Shopping            (Isms)    will be used.MOF has decided to single-source
ASYCUDA software application to automate ACD's business processes.

b. Consulting Services and Training - Consultancy services will be contracted following
procedures in accordance with the relevant Bank's Procurement Guidelines and as detailed in
Attachment 1 (Procurement Arrangements).

(i) TheMacroEconomy

The population o f Afghanistan is estimated at 22 million and GDP is estimated at US$4 billion
(US$186 per capita). The value of official exports over this period was low at just US$lOO
million although re-exports smuggled through to Pakistan in particular i s valued at US$2.1
billion. The import of goods and non factor services over the same period equals US$3.6 billion.
(IMF, 2003)

GrowthinGDP during2002/03 was 28.6% primarily due to resurgence inagricultural production
as agriculture supports about 85 percent of the total population and accounts for about 50 percent
o f GDP.34Agricultural production in 2002 i s estimated to be approximately 82 percent higher
than in2001.35 Although, a few large state-ownedindustriesare operational, including cotton gins
and granaries, the economy i s dominated by small-scale production and informal sector trading,
includingsuch activities as handicraft manufacture, sewing, metal working, and machine repair
(World Bank, Trade and Regional Cooperation betweenAfghanistan and its Neighbors, 2003).


(ii) TradeFlows2000

Presently, there is very few data on Afghanistan's foreign trade flows and even fewer are fully
reliable. The breakdown in the statistical service and basic government data collection is
exacerbatedby (a) partial control of trade and customs by regional authorities, and (b) extensive
informal international trade in both imports and particularly exports. For example, some recent
work on the petroleum sector indicates that estimates of domestic imports range fromjust under
0.5 million tons to well over one million tons36,and total imports, including products for re-
export, may approach two million tons.

It is known, at a qualitative level, that Afghanistan's total trade is substantially higher than the
official statistics suggest. It is also known that a large proportion o f commercial imports are
subsequently re-exported unofficially to Pakistan, profiting from Pakistan's restrictive trade
regime and hightariff rates. To remedy the absence of trade statistics, in2001UNDP mounted a
survey around the borders o f Afghanistan, counting the number o f vehicles entering/exiting
Afghanistan and extrapolating trade flows from these transport estimates. The results are shown
inTable 1below.

Counting vehicles for a few days i s a rather crude way o f estimating trade and there seems to be
some inconsistency between the total level o f imports and the re-exports to Pakistan. The volume
o f goods imported for re-export should correspond with the value o f goods re-exported. 20
percent seems a rather high figure for value added within Afghanistan, as indicated by Table 2,
based on the UNDP/WB study o f 2000.

                             Table 2: Total Trade (US$ million) 2000

                 Domestic                        396                   130

The estimates were made before the change inregime. A new trade survey, again based on truck
counts around the borders, i s planned for November, 2003.

A recent limitedtraffic study at most o f the main Border Posts, inconnection with the survey of
customs' infrastructure, counted the following daily flows o f commercial cargo vehicles (the

(iv)      Assumutions for Trade Estimates

Developing estimates o f present trade values and volumes, in a scenario where very little reliable
data i s available, requires making some broad and rather elementary assumptions, such as:

The vehicle counts at the border points provide reasonably reliable estimates o f annual average
traffic flows;
Vehicle payloads o f 1 ton for a light vehicle, 12.5 tons for a two-axle medium truck and 30 tons
for a heavy truck are reasonable approximations to reality;
Total aid traffic amounts to about 500,000 tons, mainly routedthrough Pakistan
Assumed average import values are:

              Pakistanroute:      US$ 400/ton (mixed cargo)
              Iranroute:          US$lOOO/ton (consumer goods and fuel)
              Torghundi:          US$ 300/ton (primarily oil and gas)
              Sher Khan:          US$lOOO/ton(machineqdequipment)
              Aquina:             US$ 300/ton (primarily oil)
              Hairatan:           US$ 300/ton (primarily oil, grain, fertilizer)



(v)       Estimation o f Afghanistan's Trade inVolume & Value Terms

Based on these assumptions, the total tonnage and value o f Afghanistan's imports can be
estimated, though the margin o f error may be substantial (Table 4).

                           Table 4. Afghanistan's Import Traffic, 2003
                                Total          Imports(million tons)        Value    Imports

Torkham- Jalalabad               800         3.35     0.50      2.85         400      1.140

Torghundi- Herat                  90         0.38               0.38         300      0.113
Sher Khan - Kunduz                55         0.23               0.23         1000     0.227
Aquina-Mazar                      37         0.19               0.19         300      0.058
Hairatan- Mazar                   74         0.33               0.33         300      0.098
Total                            1231        5.20     0.50      4.70                  2.360

Overall commercial imports are estimated as about US$ 2.4 billion, double the level o f imports
estimated for 2001. Given the substantial increase in aid and the revival o f commercial activity,
since the change inregime a rapid growth in imports was expected. This is broadly equivalent to
the relative changes recorded in the Comtrade statistics. The Comtrade statistics do not fully
cover all the official trade but Table 5 shows that trade from many more o f Afghanistan reporting
partners increased (35 countries) than declined (11 countries) and that many o f the growth rates
were dramatic. In total, the Comtrade statistics showed a near doubling o f Afghan imports in
2002. However, only 46 countries, from a possible 250, reported on their trade with Afghanistan
in2002 and, therefore, the numberscan onlybe consideredindicative.

Afghanistan i s surrounded by countries with similar productionprofiles. Therefore, expanding the
volume and value o f exports will require an aggressive policy o f economic and agricultural
diversification over the short to medium term. On the import side, it i s vital for Afghanistan to (i)
enhance the cost efficiency o f import through investment in customs administration and transit
facilities (ii)to reduce levels o f smuggling and illicit trading activities and (iii) collect customs
                                                                                    to
revenues. Revenue collection i s particularly important to allow the Government to fund its
recurrent expenditures.

(vii)     Afphan Transit Routes

Afghanistan has tradehansit routes with five o f its six neighbors; China i s the only neighbor
without a significant direct trade route. The routes vary considerable inthe type o f transit system
and facilities.

a)        Pakistan -    Transit through Pakistan i s still governed by the 1965 Transit Agreement
which defines the routes and the transport arrangements: rail transport to the railheads at
Peshawar and Quetta (now the rail goes to Chaman), and then road transport, by both Afghan and
Pakistani trucks. However, the transit arrangements have been modified substantially in recent
years:


     0    Pakistan has imposed a negative list o f commodities which cannot be shipped through
          Pakistan, inan attempt to reduce trade diversion.
     0    Pakistan Railways i s unable to provide the service required and bonded road transport
          fkom Karachi has been allowed for non-commercial cargo, using the National Logistics
          Cell (NLC) or its sub-contractors.
     0    The transporters' unions have required the use o f national transport on the Chaman -
          Kandahar route. Consequently, all cargo i s transshipped at the border, from Pakistani to
          Afghan trucks, and then moved to Kandahar for clearance.

Attachment 6: Trade& Transit                                                                       Page 95



Transit along the Peshawar - Torkham - Kabul route still follows the arrangements established in
the 1965 Agreement. Afghan and Pakistani trucks move from the border to customs clearance at
Jalalabad usingan ad-hoc security system based on the deposit o f the vehicle documents.

The costs on the routes are summarized in Table 8. There i s very little difference between the
costs by road and rail, despite the very long distances. Road freight rates in Pakistan are among
the lowest inthe world3*

The transit costs withinAfghanistan are very highinrelationto those inPakistan, bearing inmind
that the costs in Pakistan include the port charges and a very much longer line-haul distance
(Karachi -Peshawar, 1730km: Peshawar -Kabul, 300km). Transit times to Kabul average about
14 days by road and 20 days by rail    +road.   Transit times to Kandahar are one to two days faster.

b)         Iran -The Iranianroute i s used for both petroleum imports, consumer goods from Dubai
and commodities on the Pakistan negative list. The primary route i s presently from the port o f
Bandar Abbas to Islam Qalla, though a new route i s being developed from the port o f Chabahar,
through Zaranj, to Delaram on the Herat - Kandahar highway. A transit treaty exists between
Afghanistan and Iran, allowing free transit within each country but the treaty does not appear to
function and almost all cargo i s transshipped from Iranian to Afghan trucks at the border4', and
then moved about 120kms for customs clearance at Herat. The costs, quoted for the route, are
higher than those on the Palustan route (Tables 8 & 9).

Iran has adopted international standards for its road transport sector and vehicle payloads are
restricted to a maximum o f 22 tons. The cost differences are even higher for bagged cargo and
fully loaded40ft containers. Inaddition to the roadroute, some Afghan traffic, mainly aid cargo,
uses the rail route through Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Tennefiairatan. Despite the
change o f gauge, at the Iran-Turkmenborder, the rail route works reasonably well.



38A recent World Bank study found long distance rates to be about US$ 0.7/ton-h

39Transporters quote the same roadrates to both Kabul and Kandahar, despite the very large difference in
distance. Theyjustify the higher unit costs to Kandahar on the basis o fpoor road conditions and route
insecurity.

40A very small number o f vehicles (perhaps 2% - 3%), carrying highly perishable goods, are allowed direct
transit to Herat.

e)        Turkmenistan - There are two transit entry points from Turkmenistan which are used
primarily for the import o f fuel and gas, though there i s also reported to be some transit traffic
from Pakistan to Turkmenistan. The trade corridors with Turkmenistaninclude:
          - Torghundi:  a road-rail inter-change facility with Turkmen railways. Imports are moved
            byroadto Herat for customs clearance.
          - Aqina Mary: a road route with poor road conditions on either side o f the border. Some
            Afghan trucks are allowed to operate into Turkmenistan to pick up cargo. Imports are
            cleared at Mazar-i-Sharif.

Afghanistan proposes to join TRACECA, connecting Central Asia to Europe through the Black
Sea ports. Torghundi would be one possible entry for trade usingthe TRACECA routes.

d)        Uzbekistan - Duringthe 1970s, the Soviet rail system to Europe was the main Afghan
transit route for commercial cargo with goods shippedbetween the Afghan river ports and the rail
connection at Termez. The Soviet rail network has been broken up into national railways but the
system continues to operate efficiently and it remains the preferred transit mode for most o f
Central Asia. A railh-oad bridge was constructed by the Russians and the railhead moved from
Termez to the Afghan town o f Hairatan and a modem rail-road interchange facility constructed.
The terminal remains intact and appears invery good condition.

The rail route i s used for the movement o f fuel and relief supplies, from Europe as well as
countries such as Kazakistan, and basic commodities such as grain, cement and fertilizer. Road
transport i s also used to transport cargo into Afghanistan and at least four Afghan companies have
permits to cross into Uzbekistan.        The status o f the route for the commercial movements i s
opaque and i s largely influenced by personal connections with important people on both sides o f
the border.     Cargo imported through Hairatan i s cleared at Mazar-i-Sharif.        Uzbekistan i s
interested inusingroads innorthem Afghanistan as part o f a new transit route to the Iranianports
and a transit agreement i s under consideration.

e)        Tajikistan - There are reports that the route i s officially closed, but some cargo,
particularly vehicles and construction equipment, i s still being imported. At present, barges are
used to transport cargo across the river to Sher Khan, but plans have been announced for the
construction o f a bridge and river port facilities.       Goods imported through Sher Khan are
processed and inspected by customs at Kunduz, for onwards clearance at the Mazar ICD.
Tajilustan i s interested in diversifying its transit routes and gaining access to Karachi. A draft
transit treaty with Afghanistan i s under negotiation.


(iv)     Evaluationo f Afghanistan's Transit and Trade Facilitation Systems

Afghanistan has a substantial number o f transit altematives and is thus not dependent on any
single route. It is, however, faced with substantial problems and hightransit-related trade costs:

Attachment 6: Trade& Transit                                                                  Page97




a)       Cargo Transshipment - With limited exception o f some direct road transport from
Karachi to Kabul, all o f Afghanistan's foreign trade i s transshipped.         Often the cargo is
transshipped from one truck to another truck at the border, and then offloaded into warehousing at
the nearest regional center and then loaded again for transport to the final destination.
Transshipment i s time-consuming and costly both in terms o f direct (handling charges) and
indirect costs (loss and damage).

b)       Container Restriction - Modem international trade logistics, for non-bulk cargo, i s now
largely based on containers and inter-modal transport. Afghanistan i s presently excluded from
these systems as the international shipping lines do not allow their containers into the country. If
cargo i s transported by container, the containers have to be purchased from the shipping line.
Containers are mostly un-stuffed at either the port or atinear the border. Most o f the cargo,
subjected to multiple handling, i s thus breakbulkcargo, and most vulnerable to handling loss and
damage.

c)       Lack of Insurance - It i s impossible to obtain insurance for cargo moved within
Afghanistan41. Insurance cover can be obtained up to the border but thereafter the cargo moves
under either owners' riskor carriers' liability, at much higher freight rates. The absence o f either
an insurance sector or functioning formal banking sector also prevents the development o f a
bonding or monetary guarantee system for either vehicles or cargo in transit, thereby restricting
the opportunities for streamlined transit systems to allow clearance at final destination rather than
at the nearest regional center.

d)      Limited Afghan Participation - Except for participation on the Kabul - Torkham -
Peshawar route, Afghan participation in the transit system outside o f Afghanistan i s confined to
limited activity into Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This lack o f participation has resulted in the
very restricted access given to foreign trucks and thus the need for transshipment at the border.
Reciprocal access rather than reciprocal non-access would result inan substantial improvement to
the overall transit system.

e)      High Transit Costs within Afghanistan - Transit -transport costs within Afghanistan are
highbut are within Afghan power to control/reduce. These costs are the result of:

         very poor condition o f the road network - rehabilitation i s underway on several sections,
         but it will be a number o f years before the rehabilitation o f main road network is
         completed;
         short internal hauls on many of the transit routes - the breaks in the transport system at
         the borders result inrelatively short-hauls which are always expensive;
         insecurity in parts o f the country - this imposes limitations on operating hours,
        restrictions on the flexibility o f truck operations, and sometimes convoy systems;
    0   numerous checkpoints along the routes - costs are raised directly by the multiple fees and
        taxes, and indirectly by the delays and uncertainties that the checkpoints impose.

"9      Poor Communication Systems - The transit system i s disjointed with transshipment,
border formalities, customs clearance at provincial capitals, and numerous check-posts en route.
Coordination between transporters inAfghanistan and transit countries, and between shippers and

41One transporter managed eventually to obtain some cover orhigh value cargo from Lloyds London, at
high cost and long delay.

Attachment 6: Trade & Transit                                                                  Page98



customs officials i s poor because o f the lack o f professional transit agents and poor
communications.

Overall, despite the low transport costs on the routes o f some o f its transit partners, Afghanistan
faces a transit system which, unless improved, will impose major constraints on the development
o f its foreign trade and thus economic and social development. Some o f these constraints can be
relaxedby actions within the control o f the Government o f Afghanistan while others will require
joint action with its partner states. This project will assist the Government to resolve some o f the
major internal issues and will also fund assistance to help Afghanistan prepare proposals which
will both improve the transit system and benefit its transit partners. Further details are provided
inAttachment 6 onthe trade andtransport facilitationproject component.


(v)       Developing Afghanistan's InternalTransit System-A Needs Assessment

While the project's detailed strategy on trade and transport facilitation i s provided in Attachment
6, this section provides an outline needs assessment for improving Afghanistan's internal transit
system. It must be remembered that not all constraints in the development o f a more effective
transit system, as identifiedbelow, can be addressed by this or any single project.

a)        Improve Security - This i s fundamental for the revival o f Afghanistan and the
improvement o f the transit system. Better security would help to: (i)   encourage foreign truckers to
make direct deliveries and thus reduce transshipment; (ii)reduce costs on some routes where
trucks operate under convoy conditions; (iii)    remove the prohibition on the entry o f shipping line
containers, or at least reduce the level o f container deposits.

b)        Complete Road and Communications Rehabilitation - Better roads and communications
will reduce costs, improve transit times and improve customer service. The Government will need
to ensure that, once the roads are rehabilitated, the improved standards are sustained. This will
require systems for both maintenance funding and maintenance delivery. Decisions will also
have to be taken regarding vehicle standards and permissible vehicle and axle-loads. At present,
no standards or load limits are enforced and very heavy vehicle loading contributes to the very
low freight rates in much o f the country. The Government will need to assess the optimum
balance between the advantages o f low road freight rates, the costs o froad damage and poor road
safety standards, and the acceptability o f Afghan trucks inneighboring countries.

c)        Streamline Border Procedures - A high priority should be the streamlining o f border
crossing formalities and the reduction to a single document. This would reduce the high
documentation and time costs at the borders. Establishing a single document, conforming to
international conventions with multi language instructions in regional languages, would also
facilitate Afghanistan's potential role as a transit link for Central Asia.

d)        Re-establish Formal Financial and Insurance Systems - Without the ability to provide
transit bonds and insurances, Afghanistan will be restricted to rudimentary transit systems such as
convoys or duty deposits. The re-establishment o f financial institutions should have very high
priority. Insurance for goods and containers would allow significant transport cost savings.

e)        Implement a National Customs and Transit System - Present arrangements combine
both national and regional rules and regulations. While primarily a fiscal issue, it has transit
ramifications and reduces service quality. The regional rules lack consistency and predictability
and there appears to be a considerable measure o f discretion involved in some o f the
arrangements. Government should introduce a uniform national system which allows the shipper

Attachment6: Trade & Transit                                                                  Page99



to select whether to clear cargo at the nearest provincial capital or at the final destination. This
should be accompanied by the provision o f the legal framework for the freight forwarding and
customs clearing which would, inter alia, establish the qualifications, experience and resources
required for a C/F license. To help integrate Afghanistan into world trade and relax the
restrictions appliedto containers, international C/F companies should be encouraged.

J7       Provide for Direct Transit - While reciprocal open access should be sought,
transshipment to Afghan trucks at the border for short distance trips to regional clearance centers
has a net negative impact to the economy. Afghan Truckers may gain, but their gains will be
more than offset by the costs to the shipper.

g)       Reduce Checkpoints and En-route Inspections - Fuel tankers are stopped 16 or 17 times
on a round trip between either Herat or Hairatan and Kabul and have to pay at least that number
o f taxes and fees. Trucks are stopped 4 or 5 times on the road from Torkham to Kabul. The
individual fees may be small but they delay the vehicles, provide the opportunity for informal
payments and introduce uncertainty. These checking-posts shouldbe removed and a single transit
fee charged at the border.

h)       SimpliJL the Transport Commission - Presently, a transport commission i s charged
according to distance, route, weight and commodity, which generally amounts to roughly 2-3% o f
the cargo value. This provides the Transport Ministry with the power to inspect cargo. The tax
should be simplified and based simply on weight and distance (possibly also the number o f axles
on the truck), which would allow monitoring at a border weighbridge.

(vi)     Developing Afghanistan's External Transit System-A Needs Assessment

Developing and implementing an action program with transit partners i s more difficult than
taking unilateral action on internal constraints. The actions to benefit the landlocked country are
often resisted by vested interests.     There i s scope for agreement which would benefit both
Afghanistan and its transit partners but agreement on revisions to the present transit arrangements
might be problematic. Fortunately, Afghanistan's transit neighbors also wish to transit
Afghanistan on new trade corridors and this may permit more flexible negotiating positions in
order to achieve change for mutual benefit. The following actions could be envisaged:

a)       Re-activating the Rail Route to Europe - The rail system, through Russia, to Europe still
provides a reliable and cost-effective route and dominates CAR'Sexternal transport. It would also
provide a cost-effective routing for Afghan trade with Europe through Russia andor the
TRACECA routes. A formal working agreement needs to be reached with Uzbelustan to allow
direct delivery and dispatch o f all categories of cargo to/from Hairatan, across the Friendship
Bridge. Afghanistan should also try to participate in discussions to establish through rates on the
rail network to replace the aggregation o f individual national tariffs. Improved transit facilitation
would increase traffic on Uzbek Railways and provide the environment for facilitating Uzbek
transit traffic through Afghanistan.

b)       Streamlining Transit through Pakistan - The Karachi routes offer the lowest costs to the
sea for much o f Afghanistan as well as Tajilustan and Uzbelustan. The basic arrangements were
established in 1965 and need to be revised to reflect the changes in the transport sector. Three
actions would substantially reduce costs andor enhance the effectivenesdqualityo f the route:
         Remove the negative list o f goods: it reduces transit through Karachi route, and there i s
         little evidence that the policy i s achieving its objectives. The policy might be modifiedto
         require shipment incustoms sealed containers.

Attachment6: Trade & Transit                                                                 Page 100



     0  Allow direct road transit for all goods: Pakistan's roads have improved and the
        performance o f Palustan Railways has declined. The transit system would be
         substantially enhanced by extending direct road transit to all goods, accompanied by an
        extension o f the bond systemon the basis o f transporter, shipper or consignment.
     0  Increase Afghan participation: Afghan trucking companies should be allowed to compete
        more fully in the sector. Ideally there should be free flow o f Afghan trucks to Karachi
        and free flow o f Pakistan trucks to final destinations within Afghanistan with transit fees
        established on the size o f truck and the distance traveled. An interim arrangement might
        be based on a quota system o f transit permits.

If Palustan wants to develop its tradehansit routes to Central Asia, it will need direct transit
through Afghanistan, and reciprocal access to Karachiwill almost certainly be needed.

c)      Streamlining Transit through Iran - The Government o f Iran i s promoting the use o f its
ports for both Afghanistan and the CAR. There are many reports that Iran discriminates against
foreign trucks in favor o f its national operators. There may be in substance in these complaints
but there are also very large differences in the technical standards and vehicle/axle weights
allowed in Iran and in Afghanistan.          Until Afghanistan's trucking sector re-equips with
international standard vehicles, it may be difficult to negotiate full reciprocal access. There may
be greater potential for negotiating access on specific corridors, in retum for allowing access for
Iranian trucks:

              The construction o f the Bafq-Mashad rail link will substantially reduce rail distances
              and make rail a competitive mode for Afghan traffic to Bandar Abbas. Unless the
              Iranian rail system i s extended to the border, Afghanistan should try to negotiate a
              specific corridor agreement for Afghan and perhaps Uzbek trucks to the railhead.
        0     Iran i s trying to encourage the use o f Chabahar as a transit port for Afghanistan and
              the CAR. Chabahar has limited draft, slow handling and, at present, very few vessel
              calls (less than one a week). The port may be an alternative for bulk traffic but the
              charter costs will be higher than to Bandar Abbas or Karachi. To offset these costs
              and encourage use o f the port, arrangements might be agreed for Afghan trucks to
              operate along a specific corridor between Chabahar and the border at Zaranj.

These arrangements could benefit Afghanistan significantly, and they would also provide
potential benefits to Iran, through greater use o f their ports and railways. Iranian truckers would
also benefit from allowing direct access to Herat.


(vii)   WorldBank Assistance to the Transit-Transport Sector

Presently, there are two ongoing projects o f the Bank inthe transport sector, impacting upon also
the transit infrastructure. These include:

a)      The Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (ETRP) -           This project devotes more
than half its finds ($70 million) for the restoration o f an adequate connectionbetween Kabul, the
northern provinces, and the countries along Afghanistan's northem border. This includes the
rehabilitation o f 2 key links on the Afghan ring road system - the Kabul-Salang-Doshi road and
the Doshi-Pol-e-Khumri-Kunduz segment o f the Pol-e-Khumri-Kunduz road, ensuring a
dependable linkbetween Kunduz and the border town o f Sher Khanon the Tajikistan border.

Additionally, about 250 km of rural roads linking to the improved northem corridor will be
improved under this project. Other related components of the ETRP that compliment the
outcomes of the proposed customs and TTF project include significant improvements at Kabul
airport, minor communications improvements at 15 domestic airports, and studies for a transport
sector review, the development of a revisedtransport sector policy, and pre-feasibility studies for
key transport investments, including the feasibility of undertaking upgrading of the important
Herat-Chaghcharan-Bamiyan-Kabullink.

b)       The National Emergency Employment Program for Rural Access (NEEPRA) - This
project i s expected to rehabilitate a minimum 2,000 km o f road roads and 2,300 m o f bridges.
Not only will this improve transport conditions in the subproject areas, but also improve
secondary rural access infrastructure and provide/erect of removable bridges at key locations that
would serve the provincial and national transport systems through the restoration of key road
linksandtheir integrationwiththe coreruralnetwork.

                                        A.      Ministry of Commerce

         Other than transport sector regulation (under the purview o f MOT), Ministry o f
Commerce (MOC) i s the main institution dealing with transit and trade facilitation issues-the
1344Law on the Basic Administration o f Afghanistan provides that the Ministry o f Commerce is
responsible for the `subscribing to the development o f national income' and `regularizing the
imports and exports inthe interests o f the nationaleconomy'. MOC i s tasked with developing and
implementing policies that facilitate economic expansion, trade, and foreign investment. It has
twelve departments, fifteen subordinate units, and 51 percent share in 15 Afghan State Owned
Enterprises (AS0E)-and              has specific departments for border trade, international transit, and
foreign trade, and transit sub-departments in border provinces. It also owns and operates certain
parts o f the trade and transit infrastructure inAfghanistan. A detailed organization chart for M O C
i s given inAppendix 6a.

         The M O C i s currently in the process o f trying to move from [the sometimes conflicting
role] as a state trader [imposed by its current structure and precedents] to the role o f a state
regulator and facilitator o f trade. The M O C i s currently in the process o f assessing the
requirements for structural and civil service reforms to support this re-orientation. It i s only after
this that any true trade facilitation steps can be implemented.

                                 B.      Bureau of StandardsandMetrology

         Trade facilitation encompasses trade related technical assistance. To be effective the trade
related technical assistance has to attend to the whole "product to market" chain. Standards are
meant to make trade between countries easier and to ensure product quality and safety. However,
these standards often end up being non-tariff barriers if any one o f the trading country i s not
equipped to impose and maintain standards. Afghanistan's participation in internationaltrade and
investment flows can be a major contributing factor to its economic growth. Afghanistan's
capabilities related to supply capacity and competitiveness in conjunction with infrastructure for
standards, metrology, testing and quality, have to be established urgently. This i s a basic
requirement to participate inthe trading system-but          Afghanistan has n o relatedcapacity.

         The absence o f a B S M and associated testing laboratories has an even greater impact on
Afghanistan's economy in the context o f its imports. Since TISA cannot check the quality and
safety o f its imports, substandard [and often smuggled] products compete with legitimately
imported quality products and drive these out of the market given the absence o f information to
the consumer and the thriving informal markets. This not only hurts the consumer and the
economy, but also i s a colossal barrier to formal and legitimatetrade.

                                   C.     Trade and Transport Documents

         The single language and use o f local characters, and the non-conformity to intemational
formats ("Layouts")         o f all documents i s a substantial barrier to foreign trade. Imports require a
license from MOC and a transit form, supported by the usual commercial invoice, a packing list,
and the Bill o f Lading4*. Additional, indigenous documents required to cross the border: a permit
from the political provincial agent at the border; two specific additional documents ("Bar Nama"
and "Ilm-0-Khabar");           and a route permit ("Rahdari")    issued by Afghan transport authorities.
Discharge o f imported consignments requires about 26 steps and may need a query from the


42 Inmost cases, the InternationalConsignment Note ofthe CMR Convention.

office o f origin. Inaddition to these requisites, once the goods vehicles cross the border, they may
be subject to various other documentation requirements by the provinces that they may have to
transit through, as often a province may not recognize documents attained from the previous
province.

                               D.       Current RegionalBilateral Agreements

(i) Pakistan

          Afghanistan has a number o f bilateral agreements o f which the most relevant in terms o f
traffic i s the 1965 agreement with Pakistan. Since then, this agreement has been unilaterally
modifiedby Pakistan-primarily            through the introduction o f a negative list o f imports-due to its
concerns regarding large volumes o f goods which find their way back to Pakistan as informal
Afghanistan exports (re-exports). Post 9/11, both governments have re-opened negotiations on
this issue and have substantially reduced the negative list which stood at 24 items at one time.
Once the new customs tariff regime i s implemented by Afghanistan, there i s a good likelihood
that this negative list will be abolished by Pakistan. Another key bottleneck in this treaty i s the
over-reliance on Pakistan railways, which has since deteriorated rapidly and now carries but five
percent o f the total goods traffic in Pakistan. This reliance on rail was justified in the 1960s for
secure movement and controlling diversion o f Afghan cargo as it moved through Pakistan. But,
today in the absence o f the railway, Pakistan is continuing using para-statal carriers such as the
National Logistics Cell (NLC), in lieu o f the rail, for the same reason. Today when 90 percent o f
cargo inPakistan i s hauledby extremely efficient private concerns, these arrangements need to be
reviewed, given the importance o f this transit corridor to both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

(ii) Iran

          The transit agreement with Iran allows reciprocal access for trucks but remains
inoperative for technical reasons. A new MOU has also been signed post 9/11 which offers large
discounts to Afghan trade on customs (90%) and port fees and warehousing charges (50%) at
certain Iranian                 In spite of the Iranian incentives, it is difficult to believe that Iran will
forego its vehicle regulation^^^ and that both countries will agree on reciprocity in allowing cross
border truchng operations to take place on both sides. The participation o f India in the
negotiations lends other encouraging prospects. India will be provided with access to the
preferentialtariff at Chabahar and with a right o f transit for Indian goods through Afghanistan. In
compensation, India will co-finance the upgrading o f the 210 km road between Zaranj and
Delaram with Iran. This road should significantly facilitate access to Chabahar.

(iii) Uzbekistan,Turkmenistan,andTajikistan

          Afghanistan has also negotiated4' bilateral agreements with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
and Tajikistan. These agreements provide Central Asia Republics with alternative corridors for
access to the Indian Ocean, in particular Karachi. The Uzbekistan agreement, which i s not fully


43 Inparticular at the "economic zone" ofChabahar transitport, which is mainly abulktraffic port.
44Afghan trucks do not meet the technical standards requiredby Iran, and Iranian trucks do not want to
enter Afghanistan for technical reasons.

45The true legal status of these agreements couldnotbe ascertained due to conflicting information
available both inthe literature and that forthcoming during the appraisal mission.

operational at present, could provide transit from Termez inU ~ b e k i s t a nto~Herat onwards to the
                                                                                 ~ ,
Islam Qalla Iranian border, and up to the Indian ocean. This arrangement would by-pass the
AfghanPakistani dispute over smuggling and would incline the transit and political balance
towards northernAfghanistan and Uzbek ethnic interests.

                               E.   Afghanistan's TIR Convention Status

         The TIR procedures, documentation and liability system allow specifically approved
vehicles and operators o f member associations and States to transit through as many member
countries as necessary. This i s possible by means o f a single document, "the TIR camet", without
payment o f duties or examination o f the goods. Transit i s contingent on technical standards o f the
vehicle guaranteed by: the local member association; the operator; customs and seals; and the
security o f the cargo compartment design in accordance with TIR specifications. The liability
mechanism for guarantee o f customs duty, should the goods fail to show at the specified
destination (the "liability chain"), i s based in the overlapping responsibilities o f the operator, of
the local member association in the operator's country, and in the overall authority and
responsibility o f the IRU.

         The "Convention o f the International Transport o f Goods under TIR Carnets" o f 1975,
was ratified by Afghanistan through the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce at the date o f accession.
According to Afghan sources, its TIR ratification was suspended inMarch 1983. On the contrary,
the          denies having received the request for suspension in Geneva. Ironically, Afghanistan
continuedto pay its dues until 1995.

         TIR ratificationremains a potential long-term option for seamless transit to, through, and
out of, Afghanistan, provided the terms and conditions o f accession can be met. Full updating o f
IRU membership and TIR privileges for Afghanistan would require a formal request by the
Afghan Chamber o f Commerce (ACOC)48, to the IRU. The request should seek to clarify both
Afghanistan IRU membership status and the current requirements to reinstate Convention
privileges. The request must be made by the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce as a member
association, inthe name o f Afghanistan as member State. Fullreinstatement o f IRUmembership
for Afghanistan will be contingent on the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce meeting technical and
financial conditions to accede to the "liability chain guaranty" responsibilities associated with
TIR transport. This would also entail a technical capacity up-gradation o f Afghanistan's trucking
industry.

                     F.        BondedTransit Operations The PresentSituation
                                                              -

         Bonded transit operations as such do not exist in Afghanistan but transit inthe Torkham-
Jalalabad corridor, as an example, i s authorized under special procedural conditions "in lieu o f
bond" which provide adequate security to Customs. These procedures involve the surrender o f the
vehicle and driver documentation to the Customs Authorities at the border and release o f the
same upon completion o f Customs procedures. These conditions cannot, however, be considered

as standard practice, and may change without notice and are specific to that border. The reasons
for this lack o f consistency include the weak applicability o f laws and administrative norms,
which depend on political authorities and provincial uses. It is also a consequence o f lack o f a
proper financial mechanismfor bonding.

         Although the current Afghan system for transit including bonding securities indocuments
or in kind (30% o f goods), may seem weak, confusing and poorly organized, the current
administrative reality i s different. InAfghan perception, the present surrogate for a bonded transit
system i s in line with other aspects o f current Afghan transit logistics-in    certain cases, standards
do not seem either necessary nor applicable to scenarios where Afghan cultural factors are
predominant and locally understood.

                                     G.      Trade Logistics Costs

         The costs o f trade comprise large group o f direct and indirect costs that are now generally
termed "trade logistics costs"--over      and above the transport charges. These are shown in the
table below4'.

                                     Telecommunications


         Ina well functioning market economy, with highly developed transport and distribution
networks, measurable logistics costs are usually less than 10 percent o f the sale price o f
manufactured goods. In developing or emerging economies, with poor transport networks and
inadequately developed logistics' systems, the costs can be much higher and for raw materials or
basic commodities such as grain or cement the costs can exceed 50 percent o f the sales price.
Landlocked countries like Afghanistan are particularly disadvantaged as they have to depend up
the transport networks o f third counties and their trade is often subject to additional
administrative restrictions and procedures. Transport costs are normally the largest single element
o f logistics costs and major investments may be required to reduce these costs. But very
substantial reductions in total logistics costs can be achieved by streamlining the systems within
which transport and trade operates. Unfortunately, the total logistics costs o f trade are always
difficult to assess as there i s often a lack o f transparency in prices and tariffs and informal costs
can be important. It i s generally recognized that delays and cargo damages partly related to
complex procedures and documentation immobilization account world wide for between 1.5%
and 3% o f the final cost o f commodities at destination. There i s a definite need to understand the
structure and intensity o f current costs imposed by poor trade facilitation inAfghanistan in order
to undertake measures to reduce the same.

                                        H.     Transport Services

(i) Trucking

         There are approximately 80,000 trucks registered with the Transport Special Sector
Department (TSS) o f the Ministry o f Transport o f which 35,749 are based in Kabul. The truck
capacities within this fleet vary from 5 to 50 tones. The structure o f public regulation o f the
industryis old and not similar to that inthe Indo-Palustan sub-region. The Ministry of Transport
(MOT) manages the govemment-owned vehicle fleet (buses & trucks) and regulates the private
sector transport industry. It has two parallel structures to deal with govemment-run and private
transport services, with an overarching central hierarchy which provides oversight and planning
for public and private sector operations. These parallel structures are shortly described below,
while an organizational layout o f the ministryi s included inAppendix 6b.

         The public transport services are
managed        centrally       by the    MOT'S
operations       department.      Thirteen (13)
regional offices manage passenger service
operations, while goods transportation i s
handled through nine state-owned Kamaz                    authorities.  The current level
Enterprises, out o f which at least 2 are not
currently operational. The private sector
operators are licensed and regulated by the
Transport Special Sector (TSS)-a          quasi-
autonomous operational arm o f the MOT.

         The       TSS         encompasses  and
regulates all private sector transport
undertakings, and was established in 1933 as a department o f the MOT. It operates through a
private sector general directorate at Kabul as its central office, with regional sub-offices in 32
provinces, boundary offices in border districts, TSS branches at 3 ports, and TSS foreign offices
in 4 neighboring countries. It has a total staff of about 700, out of which about one third
constitutes provincial staff. The TSS i s responsible for registering (and hence authorizing)
transport companies and associations, issuing route permits, fixing and enforcing transport rates
for the transport o f government cargoes by the private sector, carrying out inspections, insuring
cargo operations through pledged trucks, processing route pass applications for passage,
collecting transport commission over transit transport operations (domestic and foreign), issuing
route passes for incoming foreign trucks, and other regulatory and enforcement functions
including the levy o f fines over non-compliance with the set rules andregulations.

         The TSS was re-organized by a as a result o f a proposal prepared by the Ministry o f
Commerce and enforced by the Ministry o f L a w and Justice in March 1967. The notified rules,
regulations, job descriptions and functions are still effective, although some have been subject to
various amendments. Key features o f the re-organization (that are still effective) are as follows.
There are prescribed procedures for: issuance o f route permits (establishing ownership) and
traffic permits (change o f ownership); transport card or note book for routes (domestic only);
and, transit document (border-crossing permission).

         Trucks are not allowed to cross borders without the "notebook for route" and the "transit
document"; and the associations, companies or individual owners must guarantee safe return o f
vehicles going outside Afghanistan. The "Rules" also stipulate that goods transport will be

Attachment7: Trade Facilitation                                                                Page 108




organized into companies and associations and that transport operators will be entitled to a
reasonable fare. It further sets technical capacity conditions for vehicles and operators and
punishment orders. The core o f the TSS-the       PS transport industry-is   organized in companies
and associations registered with TSS through a pledge of a minimum of ten trucks (called
companies) and of fifty trucks (called associations). The pledge i s a form of warranty covering
any losses during the operational term of licenses which have a term o f 3-4 months before
renewal. The trucks are pledged to TSS through a Court guarantee, under which any losses are
compensated by TSS. The number of trucks owned by associations may be between fifty and
several hundred. Trucks may, however, belong to individual owners under the common lien of
the association.

        Under all this regulation, the private sector trucking industry is based on traditional
means of ownership and collateral financing, which work as they are simple and adapt well to
existing traditional instruments of barter, collateral responsibility and informal trading currently
inuse byAfghans. Observance, applicability andenforcement ofnorms ishowevercontingent on
the same informality as that o f the social environment inwhich transport operates. Hence inways
and means of operation, the Afghan goods transport industry i s similar to industriesin the Indo-
Pakistan sub-region. It is, however, very different inoperational means when compared to Iran or
to the trucking industries in the CIS countries. As a result, by and large, Afghan trucks do not
operate into any o f the neighboring countries except Pahstan-and         that only into Peshawar to
pick transshipped cargo.

         Transport prices vary throughout Afghanistan based on season, local levels of demand,
"spot" requirements of local capacity from NGO's, and contracts from international freight-
forwarding principals. It has been practically impossible within the short appraisal period, to
gather confirmed evidence of the current cost and pricing levels. However, roughly, they seem to
oscillate from less than US$0.02 to about US$0.20 per todkm for long-haul tractor semi-trailer
combinations. This wide price range is the result of different load factors5', ways of operation,
and vehicle-operating-costs. These low and regionally competitive prices are a function of inter
alia: the age, origin and capital cost o fvehicles; domestic availability of cost-effective spare-parts
including for maintenance; and, the typical ways and means of operation of companies or
associations,notwithstandingperils o f overloadingand safety.

(ii) Freight-forwarding

         Although formally non-existent today, the domestic freight-forwarding (shipping,
insurance and banhng) industryexisted and was very active prior to 1975. There are no norms of
accreditation for freight-forwarders and the few domestic agencies acting on commission to
secure transport capacity or retum-hauls (including agencies at border-crossing posts) are not
cognizant of, or working on, modem freight forwarding rules. However, international freight-
forwarders are operating inAfghanistan post September 11,200 1.

         According to information gathered by the mission, their operations are expanding rapidly.
These service the bulk of the international cargo transactions of international development
agencies, NGO's and o f those o f commercial origin. This i s a very substantial business moving
both container and bulk cargo, over-size equipment, general cargo and containerized house-hold
goods. The international freight-forwarding business i s operating normally, although through
foreign operators and financial instruments. It operates on "thru-bill-of-lading"             standard


   An average of54% for an annual distance ofbetween 90,000 and400,000 km.

into two separate financial parts: up-front collection o f "door-to-destination-port'' dues at origin,
and final destination payment o f inland freight charges from port o f entry to final destination in
Afghanistan. The participation of domestic freight-forwarding capacity inthe above operations i s
so far nil. The informal character o f border transit payments and options to "facilitate" these
international transport operations varies from border to border.

               I. StateOwnedEnterpriseslinkedtoTradeFacilitationIssues

        There are more than 140 state owned enterprises (ASOEs) inAfghanistan, many o f which
are defunct and none o f them are operating at full capacity. An initial overall review o f these
ASOEs has indicated that TISA divide these ASOEs into three distinct categories: those which
need to be liquidated and their assets sold; those that should be sold over the short-term as going
concerns; and those that should be retained in the state-sector over the mediumterm (with a view
to future privatization).

         Of these MOF, MOC, and MOT own at least 10, 20, and 14 ASOEs, respectively. Some
o f these are directly related to customs, trade, transit, and transport facilitation, in ways such as
some control the transithansport`trade infrastructure, some are previously bonded companies,
some are bonded transport carriers, some are state insurance and banking companies, etc. Inall
cases they are currently a part o f the trade facilitation regime, provide employment to substantial
number o f people, and often play irrational roles (vis-&vis a modem trade facilitation
environment).

         M O C i s now planning review o f the roles o f these ASOEs, directly holding a stake in
trade facilitation, with a view to decide on the future course o f action that it should recommend to
TISA.

                    J.        Trade FacilitationObjectives & GuidingPrinciples

(i) Obiectives

         Complementary to the objectives o f customs modernization, trade facilitation to be
undertaken under this project has two distinct targets: first, to develop the enabling regulatory,
physical and commercial environment for fiscal control o f trade revenues; and second, to increase
trade and transport competitiveness by reducing logistic cost.

(ii) GuidingPrinciples

         Transport and trade activities are deeply ingrained in the social context o f countries and
inAfghanistanthe prevailingsocial attitude is informalrather thanformal.

         This is critical to the approach that needs to be taken to influence a gradual change from
informality to formality, and adoption o f modem options for cross-border transport operations,
bonded systems for freight intransit, insurance and financial trade practices. This gradual change
would condition the Afghan society to accept legal limitations, and could minimize the effects of
economic and social trauma when regulations are enforced.

         It is also important to make sure that private sector stakeholders in trade, transport, and
transit, are not only consulted but that avenues are created to ensure that they have an equal. ifnot
higher, stake in the new formal system.

                                    K.      The Facilitation Strategy

         The strategy that has emerged from the above review and analysis o f various trade,
transit, and transport, facilitation issues and the mission's discussion with the ACD and MOC, i s
described in this section. The basic strategy would be to "fix the basics" and simultaneously
undertake detailed butrapid assessmentsto understand the practical trade facilitation gaps.

         This will involve provision o f consultants, conduct o f studies, and data collection inthe
following areas:
         e     policy and overall strategic framework for restructuring o f key departments in MOC
               (including support to M O C PRR);
         0     Bureau o f Standards and Metrology (BSM);
         0     alignment o f national trade documents (priority to ASYCUDA related documents) to
               UNLayout Key (UNLK) Standards;
         e     transit treaties and corridor agreement;
         e     implementation o fTIR;
         e     rationalizationo f the role o f MOC's state-owned enterprises;
         e     developing the role o f private sector;
         0     benchmarking o f trade and goods transport logistics costs and time;
         e     a review o f MOT'Sorganizational structure and it's the transport services regulatory
               environment; and,
         e     ad hoc advice inmatters o ftrade facilitation

         The project will also support the incremental operating costs o f MOC, and provide some
basic infrastructure and equipment to support the establishment o f the BSM and to the
restructuringo f selected departments within MOC.

   Civil Service ReformandRestructuringinAfghanistanCustomsDepartment:A Review


The Priority Reform and Restructuring Decree (PRR) is aimed at ACD. ACD functions both
within MOC and MOF but here only the MOF is reviewed. ACD was the first departmend
agency to have its reform proposals approved by the Independent Administrative Reform and
Civil Service Commission (IARCSC). This following of due procedure i s significant bothfor the
department and also for establishing the writ of the civil service as a whole.


     0   IARCSC i s responsible for approving PRR proposals; for allocating Interim Additional
         Allowances (IAA) from the Civil Service Reform Funds to employees transferred into the
         higherinterim salary scales, andprovidingmodest support for equipment.


     0   Approval o f the PRR decree highlights IARCSC's growing capacity to implement
         reforms. The IARCSC has an advisory and oversight role in supporting the
         implementation of institutional reforms. Therefore, IARCSC and the Ministerial
         Advisory Committee require that agencies affected by PRR submit periodic reports for
         evaluating the Public Administration Reforms. IARCSC also evaluates appointments of
         staff not only to the IAA scales, but also to normal civil service positions. This causes
         institutional strengthening o f ACD through PRR, under due IARCSC supervision. The
         supervisory capacity of the Commission will be enhanced when the Second Emergency
         Public Administration Reforms under the World Bank/DFID become operational.


     0   Key components of the Customs reform plans are detailed in the PRR Stage 2
         Application by Customs Department.


     0   A significant part of the reform environment in Customs is that the MOF as a whole is
         deeply committed to institutional strengthening through administrative reforms. The
         Budget Department is in the first phase of implementing the reforms, and MAC and
         IARCSC have cleared the Treasury Department of the MOF to proceed to the second
         stage. Thus, it would be possible to roll out the PRR process across the entire MOF in
         Kabul by mid2004.


     0   The World Bank will support PRR through TA to be provided by its field public
         administration specialist. Towards the end of December 2003, the IARCSC will review
         the performance ofall stafftransferred or appointed to the higher IA scale.

         The Civil Service Reform Fund can only provide support for the salary difference
         between the existing pay scale and the higher IAA allowances for those transferred to the
         IAA scale. This is obviously not enough to sustain the reform or to even to provide the
         supportive environment to implement the reforms.

         From the rapidly unfolding PRR process now underway across ministries, it is clear that
         when donors fund non-salary components o f PRR proposals, it helps to provide the
         enabling environment for administrative reformand institutional strengthening.

        The World Bank is, therefore, requestedto consider financing the non-salary components
        necessary for the full implementation o f the PRR proposal as detailed inthe Stage 2 PRR
         applicationo f the ACD.

        CivilServiceReformandRestructuringinMinistryof Commerce:A Review



     0  The Priority Reform and Restructuring Decree (PRR) provides a vehicle to promote
        institutional reformwithin Government structures. Ministries may apply for reform status
        by submitting detailed proposals to the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Public
        Administration Reforms, which i s headed by the Chairman o f the Independent
        Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCRC).


     0  Through PRR, the applying agency i s enabled to transfer or appoint key employees to a
        higher PRR salary scale, seek resources for equipment and modest refurbishmend
        upgrading o f office infrastructure (PRR Procedures, Attachment 8).


     0  MOC is a prime candidate for reform. However, it i s unlikely that the whole o f the M O C
        comes under the PRR umbrella. M O C must evaluate and prioritize its functions and
        services, and strategically select units needing reform. Dialogue would also be required
        between the Bank, IARCSC and a reformteam to be appointed by the MOC.


     0  The reform team would decide to selectively its target candidates, like Border Trade and
        the Minister's office. Once these key units are strengthened and their management
        capacity improved, the reforms could be expanded to other departments. This approach
        has already proven successful inMOF. The Bank encourages such a strategic approach.


     0  To promote dialogue and reform, the Bank supports the following:

        a.     Establishment o f a team within the MOC to develop and design reform proposals
               under the PRR umbrella. The World Bank and key donors would be a part o f this
               team.
        b. Provision o f a technical assistant for a period o f 3 months to work with the reform
               team. The TA would provide administrative and professional support to the PRR
               team.
        c.    Development o f PRR proposals by December and submission for approval to MAC
               and IARCSC.
        d. Interactionbetweenthe PRR team and other key stakeholders inthe dialogue leading
              to formulation o f the reform proposals.


     0  Shouldthe PRR applicationbe successful, IARCSC would support the following:
        (i) AdditionalsalariesforthosetransferredtothehigherPRRscale
        (ii) Requiredequipmentandofficerefurbishment

     0  The MOC will need additionalresources to develop and implement PRR such as:

        1.       An institutional development specialist to support the PRR team during two-
                 months.
        2.       A HR andor institutional development specialist to assist the MoC to implement
                 the PRR
        3.       Resources for missions to M O C establishments across Afghanistan.

                            Measuring Project Performance at the Local Level

Given the state o f development o f Customs and transit inAfghanistan, only one project
performance indicator at the local level will be measured and monitored.

                                        Measurement of time for release

1. Principle

The time to release trucks shall be measured throughout the entire project life at three pilot sites:
Kabul inland clearance depot, Torkham, and Islam Qilla. The purpose o f the measurement i s to
calculate the total time it takes to clear all the border procedures, including, when applicable, (i)
immigration, (ii)     processing by other agencies, (iii)     processing by agents or brokers, and (iv)
processingby Customs. The aggregate figures obtained shall, therefore, span the entire time spent
between crossing into Afghanistan's border zone until exiting the border precinct (formal entry
into Afghanistan), or until the release note for the goods i s issued by Customs (inland clearance
depot located inside the clearance terminal).

2. Pumose

The purpose o f the measurement is to evaluate the impact o f the project for trade facilitation. It i s
not meant to evaluate the performance o f any individual agency involved in the processing. As a
future step, the authorities may introduce a more detailed analysis leading to a breakdown in the
time consumed between the different steps inthe clearance process.

3. Data Collection Period

The measurement will be carried out over a period o f three consecutive days each month,
altemating between peak and low traffic periods.

4. Resources and Methodolow

Simple yet efficient forms for data collection will be developed by the project team. The
measurement will be carried out by usinglocal staff resources and will cover the following ACD
posts:

4.1. Border - Enty into Afghanistan:

     An observer posted at the border will note the registration number of trucks crossing the
     border entry point and the time o f entry;
     Another observer at the transshipment station will again note the incoming truck's
     registration number and the registration number o f the Afghan truck on which the goods are
     reloaded. For trucks that do not require transshipment, this step will be ignored;
     A thirdobserver at the exit gate will note the registrationnumber o ftrucks exiting;
     At the end o f each shift, the shift manager will collect the data sheets for analysis locally and
     at the national headquarters.

Attachment 11: ProjectPerformanceIndicatorsand Monitoring                                        Page 119




4.2. Inland - Timefor clearance:

     An observer posted at the entrance o f the terminal shall note the registration number o f
     incoming trucks and the time o f entry;
     This observer will also note on the data sheet (i)whether the goods or the vehicle was
     inspected, and (ii)    ifany discrepancy, error, or irregularity was detected.
     The truck number shall be entered on the clearance declaration (ACCD or SAD).
     The officer authorized to release declarations will note on the declaration the time when the
     goods are released.
     At the end o f each shift, the data sheets will be matched against the declarations, and sent to
     national headquarters for processing.

5. Targets

Despite the difficulty arising from the absence o f a clear baseline, current estimates for truck
clearance time are 200 minutes for the borders and 300 minutes for the inland clearance stations.
These estimates should be interpreted cautiously, and will be subject to review after the first
collection. Subsequent clearance time targets shown in the following table could be reviewed
concurrently:

6. Monitoring

                    PROJECTJUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS


                                              A. Project Justification

The viability o f the project has been appraised in this section on the basis o f both conventional
economic costs and benefits and in terms o f its contribution to TISA's overall strategy for re-
establishing government and economic activity in Afghanistan. The narrowly defined terms o f an
economic analysis alone cannot encompass the potentially huge benefits that the project may end
up having in reinforcing and widening the writ o f the Afghan government across the whole
country.

(i) EnhancedGovernmentRevenue

This project is justified on the grounds that its overall result should be substantially increased
government revenue that, in turn, would provide sound financial basis for a functioning Afghan
state. Receipt o f State revenues would be sustainedthrough:

          (d) Improvedand enhanced collection o f Customs duties, which are a relatively efficient
               means o f collecting State revenues. Customs duties are usually the major source o f
               government revenue for countries in which most activities are conducted in the
               informal sector, and where taxes on incomes, whether individual or corporate, are
               difficult to assess and collect.
          (e) Emergence o f an efficient and effective Customs service. This can both widen the
                revenue net, by bringing more o f the total trade into the official channels, and
                improve revenue collection.
          ( f ) Facilitatetransfer o f Customs revenues from the provinces to the central government.

Increased Customs revenues will involve the transfer of resources from the private sector to
government and might be considered as largely a distributional issue. However, in the case o f
present day Afghanistan, the re-establishment o f government and its core functions would
generate very substantial economic and social benefits for the people that, in the large picture,
would be well above any loss to the fi-agmented informal sector.


(ii)      EnhancedTrade and Economic Activitv

Afghan Customs and transit arrangements are cumbersome, slow and almost totally inconsistent
with prevailing international norms and standards. The present system imposes major penalty
upon both the trader and transporter, raises the cost o f trade and acts as a barrier to potential
trade-oriented economic enterprise - especially those accustomed to modem Customs and trade
regimes. This project will remove some o f the impediments to business enterprise and help create
the enabling environment for enhanced economic activity and investment. In addition, a more
efficient Customs service, with greater institutional capacity, could become an important frontline
organization inthe govemment's efforts to control the flow o frestricted or prohibited goods.

(iii) EnhancedTransitFacilitation

Afghanistan i s a landlocked country and i s consequently dependent upon its neighbors for access
to the sea and to its non-regional trading partners. Its present transit treaties are either inefficient

Attachment 12: Project Justification and Economic Benefits                                        Page 123




(Pakistan), ineffective (Iran) or indraft (Tajikistan). The result i s a very fragmented transit system
due to repeated transshipment o f cargo, double-handling and very limited Afghan participation in
transit, outside the country. Improved procedures and a more efficient Customs service within
Afghanistan could substantially reduce trade costs but ideally should also be accompanied by the
streamliningo f the entire transit systems to allow a freer flow o f vehicles and reduced restrictions
on trade. Such enabling environment would also include Afghanistan's entry into the
international logistics system with through movements o f containers and the progressive
elimination o f transshipment and double-handling.

Afghanistan i s potentially a key link for transit routes from Central Asia to the Gulf and Arabian
Sea. Though development o f such routes could generate transit earnings for Afghanistan, their
real value would be the leverage gained to negotiate the terms and conditions for Afghanistan's
own international transit. Efficient systems within Afghanistan will be essential to attract and
develop effective and competitive Central Asia transit routes. This project will also provide
technical assistance for developing the systems necessary for streamlined regional transit,
including re-activation o f the TIR. Afghanistan's role as a transit country may not develop
rapidly until important security and infrastructure constraints are remedied. This project will
assist to lay the necessary foundations for the development o f such a transit infrastructure.

                                                B. EconomicAnalysis

(i)      Identification o f Benefits & Assumptions for Analysis

A more efficient Customs service operating with streamlined border and clearance procedures
will reduce both truck waiting times and cargo delay times. In addition, improvements to ACD
may reduce the variability in transit and clearance times and thereby introduce greater
predictability into the system. At present, the border and Customs formalities are cumbersome
and time consuming, imposing significant delay and cost onboth trucks and goods, for example:

          Transport operators estimate that it takes three to four days to move between Peshawar
          and Kabul, a distance o f under 300 h s . The roads are poor, trucks are heavily loaded
          and security imposes operating constraints yet an effective daily distance o f less than 100
          kms indicates additional constraints. Most truckers estimate that they need one or two
          days to undertake all the border crossing formalities - one operator said that though
          clearance should take one day, it sometimes takes three days and usually takes two days.
          This delay is reflected in the road freight rates: movement from Karachi to Peshawar
          (1730kms), for bagged freight, i s less than USq!0.95/ton-km, while for the movement
          from Peshawar to Kabul, it i s USq!4.5/ton-km.


     0    On the Iranian and Chaman routes, most trucks" are unloaded at the border and the
          goods are reloaded onto Afghan trucks. The trucks are then driven a relatively short
          distance (<130 kms) and the goods are again unloaded. Under this system, additional
          unloading/loading time i s incurred. Also, likelihood o f loss or damage to the cargo is
          increased.




   There is evidence to suggest that some Pakistanitrucks canmake it into Afghan territory uponthe
payment of a certain (variable) fee, contingent upontheir reaching an agreement with the local and
regional authorities.

Attachment 12: Project Justification and Economic Benefits                                    Page 124




     0   Most cargoes are also transshipped at least once on the routes between ports and
         destinations inAfghanistan. Transshipment between rail and road i s inevitable, but much
         o f the cargo i s also transshipped at the border from a foreign to Afghan truck, both for
         imports and exports. Goods are usually off-loaded again for Customs clearance and may
         be moved within the warehouses during the clearance procedure. Cargo i s almost never
         placed in containers, which means that the sacks, cartons, packages, etc. have to be
         handled individually. Each handling operation increases costs by US$1.5 to US$4.5 per
         ton, depending on the location and type o f cargo. These handling operations are usually
         carried out manually by untrained labor5'. Reducing the number o f transshipments and
         handling operations will reduce the percentage o f loss and damage.


     0   Simplification o f transit and Customs clearance procedures will also reduce the
         administrative and management costs to importers, though it i s difficult to place
         numerical values on such savings.

It is not possible to provide a precise estimate of reduction inoverall transit time that the project
may achieve, but savings of, at least, one day for trucks and possibly more for cargo, would
certainly be achieved. Greater savings will have to be made for Afghanistan to develop a modern
trade regime and provide the basis for attracting foreign investment. Provision o f adequate cargo
handling and storage facilities at the major clearance depots will also increase efficiency and
provide more secure storage, with less chance o f loss or damage.

(ii) QuantificationofBenefits

This sectionprovides a quantificationo fthe above benefits ineconomic terms.

a)       Truck Operating Cost Savings - The World Bank financed a study of the Pakistan
Trucking Sector in 2003, and the vehicle operating costs estimated in this study compare
favorably with the actual rates charged for imports into Afghanistan. The data is, therefore, a
reasonable basis upon which to estimate likely savings in vehicle operating costs from reduced
delay time (Table 1).

Based on limitedobservations, approximately 15 percent of the vehicles are tractor-trailers. Thus,
the averageunit cost saving for 3+ axle trucks i s US$45/truck-day.

Prior to the appraisal mission, traffic counts were undertaken as part o f a survey of the border
posts. The duration o f the counts conducted near Kunduz and at Torkham varied between one to
three days respectively. Vehicle composition at Torkham was applied to entry points for which no
data exists ontraffic composition. Table 2 summarizesthe results of these counts.

Inthe analysis, the potentialbenefitto the light commercialvehicles (mainly pick-ups and station
wagons) has been ignored as the benefit likely to be small. It i s also assumed that only import
trucks would benefit from substantial saving in transit time, as the great majority of trucks are
empty on the retumtrip. The total potential truck cost savings from reduction o f one day transit
time is estimated at aboutUS$7.5 milliodyear, as shown inTable 3.

If streamlined transit and Customs procedures allowed a two-day reduction intruck times, the
savings would double. The trucking sector in and around Afghanistan i s competitive and much o f
the value o fthe truck cost savings would be reflectedinlower freight rates.

b)        Cargo Time Savings - Savings cargo time are conventionally valued on the basis o f the
reduction in inventory costs. The limited evidence available suggests, however, that shippers'
value reduced transit time over savings in inventory costs (studies in Kenya and South Australia
suggest values o f >20 times the inventory cost value). Placing value on-savings in cargo time
requires an estimate o f the total value o f imports, whereas precise estimates o f either the value or
volume o f imports are not available for Afghanistan. Moreover, a significant proportion o f the
cargo does not comprise commercial imports and time saving benefits probably do not occur. On
the basis o f the level o f commercial imports estimated in the Trade Annex: US$2.36 billion and
5.2 million tons, and an interest rate o f 12.5%, the reduction in inventory cost from one day's
saving in transitklearance time would amount to only US$0.81 million. It appears possible to
reduce total delays to cargo (both transit and clearance time) by at least two days, generating total
savings per year o f about US$1.6 million. This, however, should be considered as probably a
gross underestimate o fthe value placedupon such time saving by the commercial sector.

c)        Cargo Damage Reduction - A considerable proportion o f Afghanistan's import traffic i s
subjected to multiple handling operations during transit and Customs clearance. Streamlining the
system, facilitating the use o f containers, reducing the number o f handling operations, moving to
mechanical means, training the handlers, and improving both handling and storage facilities
would reduce losses and damage. Studies o f other transit systems suggest loss and damage at 2%
- 3%  o f total cargo and these systems impose far fewer handling operations than in Afghanistan.
                        -
If some transshipment procedures could be eliminated, for example at the borders, it should be
possible to significantly reduce losses and damage. Reduction inloss and damage o f 1%o f cargo
value for the over 50% o f imports presently transshipped would result in annual benefits o f
approximately US$14million.

d)        Cargo Handling Cost Savings - Cargo handling charges vary at different points in the
transit chain, averaging around US$2.5/ton for each handling operation. Eliminating one handling
operation for 50% o f the approximately 5.2 million tons o f import would result in savings o f
US$6.5 million.        These savings in handling costs would, however, be achieved through a
reductioninunskilled employment, which might offset the social value o f the savings incosts.

e)       Overall Economic Bene$ts - The potential benefits from the project, if it i s successful in
streamlining Customs and transit procedures and systems, are very large in relation to the
expected costs:

                    Truck time savings                      US$7.5 million
                    Cargo time savings                      US$ 1.6 million
                    Cargo loss reduction                    US$ 14.0 million
                    Cargo handling cost reduction US$ 6.5 million
                    Total benefit                           US$29.6 million

This benefit may well be an understatement as it assumes a low value o f cargo time, does not
include imports on the Chaman to Kandahar route, nor the benefit for importers o f reduced
management time. Moreover, even if the project achieves only 50 percent o f its rather modest
targets, it will still generate substantial rates o f return. If the wider implications o f increased
Customs revenues to State are included, the overall economic and social returns would be very
muchhigher.

(i) PresentRevenueSituation

The 2002f03 ordinary budget, from which payroll operations and maintenance expenditures are
funded, totals US$550 million. Government estimates that a total o f US$200 million will be
mobilized from domestic revenues with the balance, US$350 million fi-om external revenue
(donor assistance). If government reaches the SY1382 target for domestic revenue mobilization,
collection will be over 50% higher than the US$83 million collected in SY1381. The vast
majority o f revenue collection comes from the border Provinces.               These revenues are not
voluntarily remitted to the Treasury, but have required substantial collection efforts on behalf of
the Ministry o f Finance. In the second quarter o f SY1382, revenues equaled 30.6% o f the
ordinary budget with US$ 8.1 million from the Central Government and US$ 53.1 million from
the Provinces. In addition, accumulated flight fees o f US$14 million and US$4.5 million in
communication license fees were yet to be remitted for the remainder o f the year. Table 1
provides a summary o f domestic revenue54mobilization against expenditures for the first 5
months o f SY1382.

54The MOF Revenue Code Table classifies revenues by major areas, type and revenue items based on a
revenue description. Direct Taxes are covered under code 01000. Indirect taxes are coded under 02000 with
Customs revenues collected from the private sector (code 02100), semi-public companies (code 02200) and
revenues from state owned enterprises (Code 02300).

a)      Increased Government Operating Expenditures - Unfortunately, increased revenue
collection in 1382 barely keeps pace with increased expenditure requirements. By the 5" month
o f 1382, expenditure was up 10% over the same period last year. As the pressure to allow pay
reforms for police, teachers and health workers increases, the priority reform and restructuring
(PRR) process expands and O&M payments to provinces increases, ordinary budget requirements
will be higher than US$550/year over the medium term. The ordinary budget from domestic
revenue collection (largely duties on imports) will therefore remain a major challenge. To
underscore this, ordinary spending in SY1382 which was close to 20% higher than the previous
fiscal year, and this trend i s likely to continue.

Forecasts show that Government funding o f the ordinary budget will remain at a relatively
constant base, therefore, declining as a percentage o f overall expenditure^^^. The fiscal plan needs
to be underpinned by considerable increases in revenue collection in the short term. Extemal
finance would require up to 60% to cover the recurrent needs o f the new administration.

(ii)     Revenue Implications o f the ProposedCustoms Laws6

Whilst the direct economic benefits o f the project are clear (savings in truck and cargo time,
cargo loss and handling) there are wider economic implications related to the collection o f import
duties that remain central to the locus o f this investment. Currently, revenues from import duties
collected by Provinces are not routinely remitted to Kabul in accordance with the Customs law,
and also standard rules and valuation procedures are not in operation. However, as the project
will provide support for the development o f the Customs service and infrastructure, as well as
overall policy development within the Ministries o f Finance and Commerce, improved revenue
collection by central administration remains an important immediate and medium term objective.

Based on the rather crude trade volume figures available, and the draft tariff structure outlined
above, it is possible to make some basic calculation on the revenue eaming potential o f the
current administration. However, to maximize duty collection in the medium term, it would be
essential to covert unofficial trade into official trade through improved compliance. Much o f this
depends upon buildingcapacities within the present Customs administration. Given that the exact
volume o f imports and exports for 2003 are not known. The following estimates o f revenue
eaming potential are based on the results o f a recent traffic census conducted by UNOPS. In
drawing up this estimate, the following assumptions have been made:

         It is assumed that duty will only be charged on official imports at the draft tariff rates
         indicated above (0, 5, 10 and 20%). The average un-weighted tariff used in the scenario
         calculations therefore i s 8.75%.
         The calculations assume that valuation i s conducted usingmarket exchange rates and that
         valuation i s based on CF; and,
         Goods in transit will not be charged duty but only nominal service charges regulated by
         the transit framework agreements.



                                 ~~


55Forecasts for revenues from ongoing tax reform (income, excise) are unlikelyto be a major source of
revenue over the short term.

56At the time o fwriting this report, the revisedCustoms Law was yet to be approved. Mucho fthe analysis
containedwithin the section is based on the final draft amendments to the CustomLaw and legislative
framework for Customs administration.

     0    The import estimates are based upon 50% o f the total traffic flow - therefore assuming
          that, on average, flows are balanced in and out and that all trucks coming into
          Afghanistan are full o f imports goods.

A recent (albeit limited) traffic survey conducted during September 2003 showed an average of
611 light medium and heavy vehicles entering Afghanistan every day. The following charts
demonstrate the relative importance o f different border crossings in terms o f import volume
(based on the truck census).

The percentage volume o f in-coming traffic to Afghanistan i s as follows: Torkhum-Jelalabad
(65%), Islam Qala-Herat (14.2%), Torgundi-Herat (7.3%) - these are the major revenue earning
border posts that will need to receive particular focus under this programs7. Calculating the
average axel loads and the assumed average US$ value per metic tonne o f cargo imported
through different border crossings, i s a crude method for estimation o f revenue, once the un-
weighted average tariff is applied. Table 3 below associates the volume o f traffic with an average
value per tonne across different borders and i s further illustrated in Figure 2. The margin or error
inthis calculationmay be significant, as data collected is not accurate. However, based on these
calculations, the total value of imported commoditiesper year currently is inthe order o f U S 2 . 6
billion and, based on the un-weighted average tariff, potential revenue collection would be
US$231 million for 1382.

At present, less than 50% o fplannedrevenue collectionhas been achieved inthe first 8 months o f
SY1382. This highlights considerable scope for improvement in collection, and centralisation.
According to the 2"d Quarter these calculations o f SY1382, were only 26% per cent o f available
importrevenue collected.

Once the amendments to the Customs law are effective, it will be vital to monitor market
response to the proposed tariff schedule and rates on compliance valuation.



57 The traffic survey didnot however present data of vehicle numbers for the Chaman - Kandahar corridor
which is probably more important than some of the other corridors. The figures presented are therefore
conservative estimates oftotal import volume and potential revenue earnings.

Inforecasting the future revenue eaming potentialofthe Government, through indirecttaxation
(import duties), one must identify the current location of highest revenue collection. Data
provided by the Afghan Management Information System (AFMIS) presents the following
revenue position of central and provincial administration for 1382. Currently, indirect taxes (as
defined in foot note 3) constitute 13% of Central revenues and a little over 65% of Provincial
revenue actually remittedto the Treasury.

Provincial revenue data providedby AFMIS highlightsthat during SY 1382, Provincial revenues
were collected as follows: Herat (58.2%), Kandahar (17%), Nangahar (11%), Kunar (5.1%),
Balkh (2.5%) and Khost (2%). The remaining 26 provinces contribute only 3.8% of the total
indirecttaxation (primarily imports).

There are clear gains to be achieved. The preceding projections show the potential importance o f
Nangahar for revenue collection, as the primary route o f import into Afghanistan, both interms o f
volume and value. Potential collections from Nangahar exceed Herat by over US$40 millionlyear
however, presently import duty collection stands at only 16% o fHerat.

(iii) Conclusion

Inspite of the somewhat crude analysis conducted above, the importance of enhancing revenue
collection and increasing remittances from the Provinces, i s in the interest o f national
sovereignty.     It i s also central to resolving the current fiscal crisis faced by the Central
Government. The project will assist in re-establishing an effective and loyal Customs service,
while investing ina logical sequence o f targeted policy and institutional reforms. Inessence, this
will mean focusing on development o f a new infrastructure for administrative procedures and the
modemisationlcomputerisation along the main import corridors. From an economic point o f
view, the corridors from Torkhum through to Kabul and Islam Qala through to Herat and Kabul
willremain important.

           CUSTOMSFINANCIALMANAGEMENT: ANINITIAL ASSESSMENT

Funds received by Customs authority are a major source o f revenue for TEA. Hence, it is
important that a strong Financial Management System i s in place to minimize the leakages and
ensure adequate audit trail for accountability. An assessment was undertaken o f Kabul Customs
facilities and the same was linked with the system in place at the central bank as well as the
MinistryofFinance (MOF).

Following aspects were considered for a proper Financial Management System in relation to
Customs Revenues:


     0   Ensuringproper assessmento f duties on all imports andexports
         Collection of duties as assessed
     0   Transfer o f funds collected to appropriate accounts
     0   Reporting o f income to the Treasury
     0   Accounting o f the income inGovernment's accounts.

Scope for Improvements

Although systems put in place at the Custom Houses appear rudimentary in approach, but are
effective in ensuring that duties are assessed, collected and transferred to the appropriate
accounts. Hence, any modernization o f the present system should ensure that present strengths
are retained and built upon. However, it must be again emphasized that this i s true for Kabul
only, province assessment needs are yet to be made. Based on the attached assessment following
main areas o f improvements inthe current Customs Financial Management system at Kabul have
emerged:

         Separate accounts for revenues and expenditures       -  Presently one account i s used to
         deposit all revenues as well as incur all Operation & Maintenance expenditures. This i s
         not a good internal control practice as it creates scope for error. Possibilities o f having a
         separate account for revenues should be considered. This enhances control over income
         as reconciliation will relatively be easier.


     8   Customs house-wise reconciliation - Funds received from different Custom Houses are
         deposited inone bank account. At present no Customs-house wise reconciliation with the
         funds deposited inthe bank account are done. Hence, no reconciliation is done to ensure
         that incomes reported by various Customs Houses are in agreement with the amounts
         received.

         Reconciliation of reports generated by different departments - The above reconciliation
         for Customs income becomes even more important considering the variations observed
         among different reports as produced by different departments. There should be a regular
         and up to date mechanism to reconcile income from different sources.

         Analytical checks on income generated - At present there i s no proper mechanism that
         undertakes assessment o f incomes from different Regions/Provinces. This is based on
         alternative data, rather than relying on information received from the Provinces and

Attachment 14: Customs Financial Management                                                  Page 135



         Customs Houses. A good Financial Management System would ensure that a check on
         the Customs income receivedis verified basedon alternative sources o f information.

         Streamlining the Customs declaration and assessment system - A declaration form
         (ACCD) passes through a large number o f hands, which creates confusion and delays.
         This is particularly the case at Kabul Custom House. The system needs streamlining to
         ensure efficiency, effectiveness and a proper balance between segregation o f duties.

         Computerization The computerization process at present i s mainly limited to compiling
                                -
         ACCD database. The process should facilitates report generation and better FM.

The System as recorded duringassessment i s attached as an Appendix to this attachment.

To ascertain the actual system in place, visits were made to Kabul Airport Customs, Kabul
Customs House and related counterbranch o f the Da Afghanistan Bank. To complete this picture
it is imperative to visit some o f the Provinces Customs Houses. This was not possible duringthis
appraisal mission. While writing this note, effort has been made not to duplicate the system
already described elsewhere in the Annex, as far as possible, though at places due to the context
some duplication may occur. Systems being described below are more or less common to the two
locations visited. Any specific variations have been highlighted wherever considered appropriate,
The Customs House has a much larger volume o f business. It handles 200-250 transactions o f
impoflexport on a daily basis, compared to 25-30 transactions at Kabul airport.

(i) AssessmentofDuties

Goods imported can be broadly classified under two categories, either falling under exempted
category or taxable category:

a>       Exempted imports - Under the exempted category importers are mainly Diplomatic Missions,
         Foreign Military forces, NGOs, etc. As can be expected, at the Kabul airport there is a large
         volume of such imports. To regulate such exempted imports, the importers are required to obtain
         authorization (through an exemption form). The importer must submit this Authorized approval
         along with duly completed ACCD form (Declaration Form for goods imported) to the Customs
         Officials responsiblefor import assessment.

b)       Taxable Imports - All importers are required to be registered under the Ministry of Commerce.
         Based on this registration, each importer/exporter is issued an ID number. Normally the importer
         is required to have imports cleared at the Custom House, where he is registered. However many
         of the imported cars, are reported to be assessed and tax paid at Custom Houses located in the
         Provinces that the vehicle is passing through.

The consignments are evaluated on values as provided by Chamber o f Commerce. Presently
values are compiled through classifications contained in23 different groups. In case the value is
not available inthese groups, it i s obtained through reference to Chamber o f Commerce. Tariff i s
calculated based on these values and recorded on the ACCD form. Total custom duty payable is
indicated on another form called Evaluation Form. Both ACCD as well as Evaluation Form
require approval by the Head o f the Department or any o f his Deputies. The ACCD form, passes
through a number o f hands, before approval, indicating segregation o f duties, perhaps even to the
extent o f creating certain inefficiencies.       The matter needs to be studied and, if necessary,
harmonizedbetween internal check and efficient disposal o f ACCDs.

At the end, all ACCD forms are filed ineach importer's file. At the Kabul Customs House this is
done on the basis o f a serial number, considering large volume o f transactions.

(ii) CollectionofDuties

A DAB bank counter is available close to the Kabul Airport Customs office. Similarly, a DAB
branch is housed in a building adjacent to the Kabul Customs House. At the Kabul Customs
House each importer i s required to deposit the duty in the Bank, along with a pay-in-slip to
facilitate payment. Duties are generally paid in cash to DAB. Transfer payments are allowed
only if the dealer has an account inthe same branch. After receipt o f funds, the Evaluation Form

Attachment 14:CustomsFinancialManagement                                                     Page 137




i s signed and stamped by the cashier and a senior DAB Officials. A receipt (also called Credit
Memo) is providedto the customer for amount collected from the import/export of the goods.

At the end ofthe day, the DABbranchprepares a summary, ACCD-wise, o ftotal funds collected.
This is submittedto the accounting section ofthe Customs House. Such a report is very useful to
reconcile the tax accounted inCustoms records with the tax collected on a daily basis. The same
procedure i s followed at the Kabul Airport Customs Office, with certainminor variations.

(iii) RecordingofIncome

All ACCD forms are entered into a register at the Customs back-office. The duty amount is
recordedinthis register according to amount payable to different agencies. This i s mainly to the
Ministry of Finance as Custom Duty, including penalties, Municipality Tax (1%) and Red
Crescent (2%).       On certain items there are specific duties which are payable to Ministry of
Commerce. Details of such a break-up are useful to ensure transfer o f funds to the appropriate
 agencies. It was not clear, if such a break-up is readily available at the Kabul Airport.

 (iv)     Transfer of Fundsto Appropriate Accounts

 From the DAB counter at the airport, funds are transferred to its Head office on a daily basis. A
 report i s sent to the Treasury for funds transferred to MOF's A/c at Head Office on a daily basis.
 The Kabul Customs House provides a transfer advise to the DABbranch, indicating the amounts
 to be transferred from DAB branchto different agencies' bank accounts at the Head Office. This
 i s normally done on a Thursday afternoon, covering the entire week's transactions, i.e.       from
 Saturday to Thursday. The DAB branch issues an advise to the Customs House indicating the
 amounts transferred to the respective account numbers along with a bank statement to various
 account holders on aregular basis.

  (v)      Reportingof Income to Treasury

  Kabul Custom House reports weekly to the Treasury. The purpose of this report is to reconcile
  each transfer made to the Treasury. The report sent by the Kabul Customs House, provides the
  daily total collection. This amount i s further broken down among the various recipients o f taxes.
  The report also includes cumulative amount of tax collected for the fiscal year. From the Kabul
  Airport Customs a similar report i s sent to the Treasury. There may be some minor variation in
  the formatting of the report. Normally there are three copies of the report, to the Admin
  Department of the MOF, RevenueDepartment and the Treasury Department.

  (vi)     Accounting of Income intoNational Accounts

  Based on reports received from the Custom Houses, the Admin. Department prepares income
  vouchers (M27) to credit the income in the accounting software. Normally a report corresponds
  to a transfer o f fund to the bank account. Thus an M27 i s prepared for funds transferred by the
  Custom House. At Kabul, mustofiats are not involved as the reports and funds directly reach
  MOF. However, incaseofProvinces, funds areroutedbymustofiat, who preparesM29, which is
  a summary o f M27s, and i s supposedto represent each transfer from the Province to MOF. Here
  it may benotedthat transfer offunds fromProvinces isnot regular.

(vii)    Internal Checks

MOF has appointed a group o f four controllers who are based at the Kabul Customs House, their
primary objective i s to verify the correctness o f eachACCD form.

(viii)   Analytical and Other Control Measures

There are very few analytical or cross reconciliationprocedures inplace to verify the accuracy o f
the data beingcompiled by different departments. For example, though Cash Management Unit
reconciles the bank account with accounting records, there is no attempt to reconcile income from
different Custom Houses as accounted in the records and as reported. Further, there was no
evidence of procedures inplace to reconcile ifthe Customduties collected are inline with various
broad trade estimates, either for the country as a whole or o f a specific Region. Such measures
could help provide alternative indicators for accuracy or otherwise of the income being reported
by various Regions.

(ix)      Computerization

Bearing Point, funded by USAID, i s presentlypreparing a database of Customs functions. It has
formatted and finalized the format of ACCD form, the main custom declaration and evaluation
form. It has also input all the data and values for 23 groups o f goods as compiled by Chamber of
Commerce and used by the Customs department for valuation purposes. At present the ACCD
forms are ina spreadsheetformat at Kabul Airport and Kabul Customs House.
