Some lessons learned\n            included: the experience with the construction of the\n            Shiyan-Manchuanguan Expressway (SME) shows that resettlement\n            can have beneficial effects on living standard of the\n            affected people through the following measures, such as: (i)\n            effective leadership of provincial government; (ii)\n            efficient management and distribution of resettlement funds;\n            (iii) extensive public consultation throughout the entire\n            project and responsiveness to village issues and concerns;\n            (iv) effective procedures for receiving and addressing\n            complaints; and (v) dealing with complaints in a timely\n            manner. Among these, the public consultation was the key\n            factor. The public made useful suggestions on the expressway\n            alignment, the selection of centralized resettlement sites\n            prior to relocation, the allocation of housing lots at these\n            sites, land reclamation. From the start, specific objectives\n            were adopted, including minimizing resettlement impact,\n            saving cultivated land, creating new arable land, relocating\n            to more productive land, and restoring roads and irrigation\n            systems. The result was improvements in housing standards,\n            road access, drinking water, and the large majority of those\n            resettled expressing satisfaction with the process and their\n            new dwellings and location."}, "docdt": "2010-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
