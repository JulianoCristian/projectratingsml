This\n            resettlement action plan (Volume 1) and policy framework\n            (volume 2), sets the standards to minimize relocation, and\n            social impacts that will occur as a result of land\n            acquisition, based on the country's legal framework,\n            and the Bank's policy requirements regarding\n            resettlement. Displaced persons losing agricultural land,\n            will be entitled to reallocation compensation, and to\n            benefit from collective investment of land compensation.\n            Wherever land reallocation is not possible, displaced\n            persons shall be provided with employment wages, at minimum\n            equal to income lost, or, may be paid a resettlement\n            subsidy, equivalent to at least six times the average annual\n            production output value of the land in the previous three\n            years. Should this not be sufficient to restore livelihoods,\n            the subsidy may be raised to as much as fourteen times the\n            average annual output value. Provided land compensation, and\n            resettlement subsidies paid are still insufficient,\n            resettlement subsidies may be further increased upon\n            approval by the municipal government. Displaced persons\n            whose land in temporarily taken to facilitate construction\n            works, will be compensated for their income losses, crop\n            losses, and for the cost of soil restoration, and damaged\n            infrastructures. Housing and structural losses will be\n            compensated through the provision of replacement housing of\n            equivalent value, at full replacement cost, and/or\n            replacement or restoration of facilities, and services.\n            Moving expenses will be provided, and, special measures, or\n            preferential treatment will enable the poor and vulnerable\n            households to replacement housing that meets minimum\n            community standards. Business, or employment losses will be\n            compensated through alternative business sites, cash\n            compensation, and transitional payment for moving expenses,\n            and loss of sales or income, while alternative employment at\n            equivalent wages will be provided, or, cash settlement\n            equivalent to at least three years of lost wages. A\n            transitional payment for re-training, relocation or other\n            measures, will be provided.
