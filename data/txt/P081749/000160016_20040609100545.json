The\n            project has three components: (1) Highway capacity\n            investment: The project will finance the construction of the\n            105.1 km Hubei section of the Shiyan Manchuangan Expressway\n            (SME), a 106.8 km highway linking Shiyan City in\n            northwestern Hubei province to Manchuangan in Shaanxi\n            province. The project also includes a 6 km connecting road\n            in the Shiyan city area, six interchanges, one monitoring\n            center, one monitoring sub-center one service area, two rest\n            areas, two maintenance areas, and electrical and mechanical\n            equipment (E&M) for maintenance operations and\n            management. E&M equipment includes toll,\n            telecommunications, and traffic monitoring systems, and\n            safety and fire emergency facilities in tunnels.     (2)\n            Local Road Improvement Program (the LRIP):  The Local Road\n            Improvement Program (LRIP) addresses the lack of\n            accessibility in remote, low- income areas of Hubei\n            province. Under this program, the project will rehabilitate\n            and upgrade a series of low-class local roads in Shiyan\n            City.   (3) Institutional strengthening, policy development,\n            and road safety initiatives. These activities aim to\n            strengthen capacity of the Hubei Provincial Communications\n            Department (HPCD) to manage the provincial highway network\n            efficiently and improve the sustainability of provincial\n            highway sector financing. Expected improvements in the\n            quality of roads will lead to lower transport costs\n            throughout the province and lower life-cycle costs for road\n            maintenance. Adopting more efficient practices for managing\n            road will promote effective use of public funds, thereby\n            enhancing the contribution of the highway network to\n            economic development and its responsiveness to social needs.\n            Finally, road traffic safety initiatives will reduce\n            accident rates, thereby saving lives and addressing negative\n            road impacts."}, "docdt": "2004-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
