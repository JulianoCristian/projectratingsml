following standards are and will be involved in the environment impact assessment, environment
management plan and during construction and operation period in the -future:
Ambient Air Quality Standard
According to the related environment standard for project area decided by Hubei, Class II of the
Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996) will be implemented for the ambient air quality of the
environment impact assessment and the environment management plan of the project. The air pollutant
discharge will be evaluated against Class II of Integrated Discharge Standard for Air Pollutant
(GB6297-1996). Details are listed in Table 1.2-1 below.

in the operation phase. The State Environment Protection Bureau's document No. [2003]94-Notice on
Related Issues about Environmenital Noise in the Environmental Impact Assessment of Road and
Railway (including Light Railway) Projects is executed. For city sensitive buildings centralized area
whose acoustic environment function areas lhave been classified, Standard of Environmental Noise of
Urban Area (GB3096-93) and Applicable Area Classification Specification of Environmental Noise of
Urban Area (GB/T]5190-94) are applied for assessment of noise impact in the operation phase. If the
main buildings close to the road are three-storey ones or hiigher, the area from tlhe first row of buildings
facing the road to the road is applicable for Class VI of Standard of Environmental Noise of Urban Area
(GB3096-93); If the main buildings close to the road are ones less than three-stories or champaign, the
area of a certain distance outside the road redline is applicable for Class VI of Standard of
Environmental Noise of Urban Area fGB3096-93), details are shown in Table 1.2-2.
Noise Limits for Construction Site (GB12523-90) are appliecd in the assessment for noise impacts in
construction site. Details are given in Table 1.2-3.

1.4Environment Impact Assessment Conclusions
Through surveys and assessment of the natural environment along the proposed hiighway, comparison and
selection of different schemes, anticipation of environmenit impacts, preparation of impact mitigation
measures and environment management plan, and public consultation, the following conclusions have
achieved:
Current Environmental Status
*   The current water quality of the water bodies in the project area is good, and can basically meet the
quality requirement defined in the Hubei Surface Water Function Zoning.
*   The current ambient air quality within the project area is very good. The monitoring results in three
monitoring points in countryside, school and lhospital show that the daily average NO2 can meet
Class II of AmbientAir Quality Standard (GB3095-1996).
*   The current acoustic environment quality in the project area can meet the Class II of Environment
Noise Standard for Urban Area (GB3096-93) , actually reaches Class I, so tle ctirrent acoustic
environment quality in the project area is very good.
*   No precious wild animal or plant, or important fish resource or forest is observed or recorded in the
project area.

Environmenit Management Plan for Shiyan to Manchuanguan Section ofYinwu Inter-Provincial Highway Project
Following archeological survey, the project is involved in three cultural sites through careful
alignment. The Alignment K will escape from one cultural site at the Pingsi Tomb, Team No.1,
Sunjiawan Village, Qingqu Township, Yun County; the Alignment K will pass througlh from the
southwest site of the Jianliupu cultural site, Team No. 4, Jianliupu Village, Hejia Township, Yunxi
County with indirect impact on that site. Southerni Shaanxi Military Area Hospital Site is located at
the Kejiawan Village, Xiangkou Township, Yunxi County, Alignment K passes by from the north of
the site, construction of the project will indirectly affect the site, it is recommended that local
reinforcement protection shall be carried out for thie site. At present no cultural site is discovered at
the sites for link road, access road, construction camp, borrow pit and spoil disposal site. See
Drawing No. 1-2.
Major Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Constructioii Period
*   Based on comprehensive analysis by natural environment, biological environment and engineering
criteria, alternative K and local alternatives A2 ,A4, AO, B2 and B3 for alignmenit comparison have
been recommended for this project, which have been agreed by HPCD.
The location and interval of overpasses is rational.
Surface water quality would not be severely affected provided that the constructioln management is
enhanced and proper technique is adopted.
Construction equipment is determined to be the major source for noise. Because most of affected
areas are sensible receptors such as villages and schools, ther-efore it is forecasted that noise level at
some receptors will exceed the standard limit.
The major air pollutants in construction phase are air-borne dust, stockpiling oi powder material and
asphalt smoke. Roadside receptors would be affected by these air pollutant emissions.
*   Digging, hill cutting, filling and stockpiling in construction phase will cause potential impact to
eco-environment. The impacts could come from borrow pit, access road and deposit site.
*   Cultural Site unearthing work shall be completed before the construction is commenced. Other
discovered sites will not be directly affected. If any relics are discovered during the construction, the
site work should be stopped immediately and at the same time the cuitural depar-tment should be
informed. The site conistruction work should be suspended until the cultural department issues
permit.
The safety of roadside residents will be affected. Especially hill blasting operation will cause severe
risk on human safety.
Some epidemic diseases, such as HIV and SARS, are likely to occur when the flow of people is
increased in construction phase.
Major Impacts during Operation Period
*   In operation phase, noise will affect acoustic environment. In particular, the noise level at the
roadside school and house and hospitals would exceed the standard limit. With appropriate measures,
the noise impact could be effectively mitigated.
*   The domestic wastewater and car washed water produced from one service zone and two parking
zones should be pre-treated before being discharged into water body. Car washed water shall be
reused after oil removed by oil/water separator. Class I of Integrated Wastewater Discharge
8 Hubei Provincial Communication Department



Environment Management Plan for Shiyan to ManchuanguLani Section of Yinwu Inter-Provincial Highway Project
Standard (GB8978-1996) should be met for all treated wastewater. The domestic wastewater
produced from service zone and parking zone should be treated via septic tank before being
discharged into water body in penetration way. Therefore it is anticipated that the water quality in
the water body nearby would not be seriously affected by the project.
*   Both adverse and positive impacts will be made by the project. Improved road system will attract
more tourists into the city, which will damage parks and other natural scenes; on the other hand the
increased volume of tourists will produce more wastes.
This road project will signiificantly improve the local transportation condition, thus bring substantial
benefits to the local economy, people's income and agricultural restructuring. It will also provide an
easier access for the roadside residents to market, service and education. As a result, life quality of
the local residents will be improved, and poverty alleviated.
Result of Public Consultation
At the environment impact assessment of the project, public comments collection and survey have been
carried out in the project area. All the residents, local governments and non-governrmenital organizations
directly affected have been put into the survey and their comments and suggestions on the project have
been widely collected. The survey shows that the public is strongly supportive to the project and that they
think the construction of the project will play a very important role in developing individual and local
economy. The major concerns of the public are loss of land, house demolition, traffic blocking, irrigation
system damage, asphalt smoke, borrow pit and the deposit site selection., which have been detailed in the
environment impact assessment of the project.
1.5Environment Action Plan Composition
The environment action plan of the project is composed of the following parts:
1). Environment impact mitigation plan: refers to the managemiient activities to prevent or reduce
disadvantageous impacts on1 environment;
2). Environment supervision plan: refers to the supervision activities to assure simultaneous
implementation of mitigation measures with the project;
3). Environment monitoring plan: refers to the monitoring activities to eliminate pollution during
construction and operation.
The environment protection management procedure of the project refers to Drawing No.1.5.

Enviromnent Managemenit Plan for Slhiyan to Manchuanguan Section of Yinwu Inter-Provincial Higlhway Project
Chapter 2 Environment Management Plan
2.1 Environment Management Plan at FSR Stage
The main environment protection work of the project at the FSR stage is to carry out the environment
impact assessment of the project, including the preparation work before the environment impact assessment
report and preparation of environment management plans for different components of the project. In 2002,
I-IPCD entrusted the Second Harbor Engineering Investigation Design Institute of MOC to undertake the
environment impact assessment work of the subject project. In the following more than one year, the EA team
has made site survey many times along the whole alignment and monitored the current environment values
and assessed the found problems and potential impacts of the proposed project on the environment and carried
out selection and comparison analysis jointly with the design unit on all the alignments ancl options and made
public consultation along the project and prepared the environment management plan of the proposed project.
At the FSR stage, on the basis of collection of project background information, site survey's and the FSR, the
enviromnent impact assessment outlinies has been completed.
In December 2002, the State Environmenit Protection Administration approved the environment impact
assessment outlines of the project. Many new contents will be added in the outlines following the
progress of the environment impact assessment Work and the comments of the WB delegation at several
meetings. Hereby the EA team has updated the outlines according to the comments of the State
Environment Protection Administration and the WB delegation.
In June 2003, a first draft of Environment Impact Assessment Report was submitted to the World
Bank, in October 2003, the second draft, in December, 2003, the third draft and in April 2004 the fourth
and final draft, following the comments received from World Bank appraisal.
Preparation of environment management plan is a main environment management work at the
development stage of the project, whlich will pay a very important role in mitigatincg disadvantageous
impacts of the proposed project on the environment.
2.2 Environment Management at Design Stage
The main environment management work at the engineering design stage is as follows:
Alignment Selection
An alignment is recommended after comparison of two alternatives and fourteen alternative sections in

environmental, socio-economic and engineering criteria by the EA team, design unit and resettlellment
team, which has been selected anid confirmed by HPCD and local governments.
Soil Erosion Prevention and Treatment
At preliminaiy design, the design work of permanenit drain and protection facilities along the whole highway
started, a combined method of engineering and plant measures shall be applied in the protection design for
high filled and deep cut sections, those measures include retaining wall, intercepting dyke, settling pond,
geo-cloth filtration, tree and grass planting and vegetation resumptioni at some areas. A certain method or some
combined measures will be applied to control soil erosion for the area sensitive to soil erosion. According to
the practical experiences of highways of other regions in Hubei witlh the same landform and soil, these
measures can completely meet the requirement of soil erosion prevention of the project.
Resumption of Borrow Pit
It can be seen from the above table that the material source is 0.1-25km from the road. The material site
is covered with 0.5-2m thick soil layer. The topsoil will be returned to the original area to minimize the
soil erosion to the acceptable extent after the material site is closed. The commercial material sites are
over 434km from the road at the farthest, which shall be resumed by the developer as per related
regulations. Because the used-out commercial site of the project shall be reported to related authority, so
as to urge developer to take the specified resumption measures to minimize the impact. The locations of
material sites are given in Table 2.2-1.

Resumption of borrow pit and deposit site
Building retaining wall, settling pond, drain ditches, and planting on the surface for every deposit
site can assure the stability of the deposit area and minimize soil erosion or completely avoid soil erosion.
The scale and stability requirements of deposit site shall be determined as per the stacking height and
volume. The topsoil placed aside before shall be returned back to the deposit area after deposit is
completed. The specific locations of deposit sites of recommended alignment are shown in Drawing
No.2-1 and Table 2.2-2 and Table 2.2.

In addition, 151,000m3 abandoned soil wil be applied for filling to create land and to restore farmland
along the road.
The cost required to resume deposit sites along the project is about 14.2 million yuan.
Mitigation Measures of Communication Noise Impact
Mitigation measures, such as noise barrier or boundary wall raising, should be taken at the sensitive
receptors wlhere the noise level will exceed the standard. These measures, including noise mitigation
forest and sound barriers, will be confirmed in the design document and tender. Table 2.2-4 and Table
2.2-5 summarize the mitigation measures for alternative A.

Implementation time of mitigation measures is decided in accordance with standard exceeding years of
communication noises anticipated with communication noise anticipation mode. The actual noise values
during operation shall be frequently monitored (see the following environment monitoring plan). If there
are bigger differences between actual noise values and anticipated ones, related noise mitigation
measures and implementation time shall be properly adjusted. The measures to be implemented during
construction and in 2009 will be implemented simultaneously with the project construction, whiclh will be
included in the contracts with the project contractors, in order to produce mitigation effects just after
operation.
Mitigation Measures of Water Quality Impact

Environrnent Management Plan for Shiyan to Manchuanguan Section of Yinwu Inter-Provincial H-ighway Project
1) The design of road surface and foundation drain systems has started, the roadside ditch is considered
to avoid connecting with fishponds and farmland.
2) Wastewater treatment facilities should be constructed at the service zone to treat the domestic
wastewater before being discharged into water body. Box below shows the process diagram of the
wastewater treatment facilities. The wastewater containing oil from the car washing process should
be reused after treatment by oil-water separator. Class I of Integrated Standard for Wastewater
Discharge (GB 8978-1996) should be applied for wastewater disclharge into river. If the treated water
is used for irrigation, it shall meet the Farmland Irrigation Water Quality Standard (GB5084-92).

3) The wastewater producect from two parking zones should be treated in septic tank before being
discharged into irrigation system. The wastewater containing oil from the car washing process should
be reused after treatment by oil-water separator. Class I of Integrated Standard for Wastewater
Discharge (GB 8978-1996) should be applied for wastewater discharge.
4) The wastewater produced from one maintenance zone should be treated in septic tank before being
discharged into irrigation system. The wastewater containing oil should be reused after treatment by
oil-water separator.
5) The water flow retention time shall be elongated in the design of drainage ditch over the Hanjiang
River in case of dangerous goods leakage.
Mitigation Measures of Air Pollution Impact
Besides minimization of sensitive receptors at the alignment selection stage, the main air pollution
prevention measures at the design stage are to reasonably select the locations of borrow pit, deposit site,
central asphalt melting and enclosed concrete mixing stations. Location of these stations will be carefully
selected to be far from the sensitive receptors, at least 300 m leeward from residential areas, schools and
hospitals.
Mitigation to Road Separation
The project is a fully closed highway, the construction of the project will cause road separation and
inconvenience for the production, living and traffic of the residents at both sides of the higlhway.
In order to minimize the separation of road, design team has collected commenits and opinions through
extensive public consultation. Among 105.099 km of higlhway, the combined lengtlh of bridge and tunnel

(where the highway would not separate the communities) is 41.27 kin, accounitin-g for 39.26% of the total
length of the highway. There are 93 bridges (78 of which are elevated viaducts over dry land anld would
not separate the communities), 30 tunnels, 20 passages and 4 platform bridges and 21 grade separate
overpasses alonig the expressway. In addition, 16 among 126 culverts along the expres-5way are designed
in such a way that they can be used also as passage besides flood dischiarge or irrigation. In total, there
will be 145 passages after deducting river-crossing bridges (74 bridges, 30 tuinnels, 4 platform overpasses,
21 grade separate overpasses and 16 culverts), equivalent to 1.35 passage per kmT. Additoionally, overpass
structure passage is applied in designing the cross withi existing road to elimliiate the road separation
problem.
Long-term forecast for traffic demiand have been considered when determlining the width and hieight of
the passages. Three sets of sizes for passages hiave been determined in Table 2.2-6:

Access Road
For impacts of access road on environment, contractor shall take the following mi-itigation m-easures
for the access road near sensitive receptors (residential area):
Contractor will educate their truck drivers to lower speed so as to reduce diust and noise for the
access roads within 100 m from- sensitive receptors suich as residential area. The transportation will try to
avoid the noon time opearatolin in residenitial areas to avoid disturbing residenits who may nap at thiis time.
With regard to thiree impacted schools, the school management will be consulted for reasonable tim-e and
schedule for truck tranispoirtation. When approaching the schools, all trucks will slow down and
prohibited from using their hiorns. The truck parking and ser-vices areas will be set ini areas at least 300 m
away fromn the school. The access roads will be sprayed with water regularly in dry season and strong
wind conditions.
Contractor shiall sprinkle water on roads at day time an-d stop transporting at n-ight time (after
22:00pm) and take measures listed in Table 2.2-7 for access roads near senisitive receptors.

analysis on alternative alignments. Through comparison and analysis, alternative alignment and local
options with less impacts on cultural sites will be selected. However, at present there is stilt a cultural site
to be affected by the proposed project, the Jianliupu cultural site is located at the nortlheast of the
proposed project, the construction of the project will cause indirect impact on it, protective untombing
shall be done for that tomb. Southerni Shaanxi Military Area Hospital Site now is one of COuilty class
relics protection units, revolutionary site, found by the investigators at site survey, with good reserve
condition. Alignment K passes by from the north of the site, construction of the project will indirectly
affect the site, it is recommendecl that local reinforcement protection shall be designed and carried out for
the site by a qualified engineering company to be entrusted by the Shirnan Highway Company, under the
instructions of Hubei Provincial Archeological Institute.
To minimize damage on this cultural site, Hubei Provincial Archeological Institute shall carry out
protective unearthing work as per the FIELD ARCHEOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION issued by the State
Relics Protection Administration before commencement of constructioni. Any valuable relics shall be
delivered to local museums for storage and stuLdy. Before allowing contractor to construct, photo taking,
measurement and filing shall be done for the above-mentioned cultural sites.
Though protective unearthing has been done, it is possible to discover any cultural heritage along the
project in construction phase. An archeological team  has been organized by Hubei Provincial
Archeological Institute, headed by Director Wang Yanghong, to undertake the site survey, clearance and
evaluation of any discovered cultural heritage. Local museums shall dispatch experts to assist the
unearthing work when the alignment, four link roads and deposit sites are investigated.
The formal unearthing work will start at the mid-February, 2004, unearthing situations shall be reported
to the HPCD once every two weeks, all the unearthinlg work shall be completed ten days before
commencement of the construction at latest. The uleartlhing work includes
1) Unearth all the sites affected by thie project;
2)  Collect and pre-evaluate the discovered heritage;
3) Drafting, video and photo taking;
4)  Repair and evaluate the relics in room;
5) Prepare the report;
6)  Issue unearthing report in provinicial relics magazine;
7)  Store the heritage in museum.

The actual protection works will include protective excavation of the Jianliupu site ancl restrengtlheniing of
the South Shaanxi military hospital. The implementation of these protective works will be conducted by
qualified contractors engaged by Shiman Highway Construction Commanding Office, under the guidance
of Hubei Cultural Relics and Archeaological Institute.
Land Occupation and Resettlement
A draft Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared by HPCD and is subject to the confirmation
of the World Bank. The main proposed actions are:
1) Supervision organizations at provincial, municipal and county levels will be set up to monitoring the
flow of the compensation fund;
2) Fund Use Program should be prepared by each affected village in consistency with the RAP. The
village without the program will not be eligible for receiving the compensation fund;
3) A follow-up investigation plan will be conducted by the resettlemenit office of Hubei Province, by
holding public meeting and interview at the affected village, to scrutinize the ftund allocation;
4) The affected people will be relocated witlhin the same village, provided the new place is better of living
environmenit and they agree to the plan;
5) Special financial aid will be provided to the affected people who are in poor financial condition for
building new houses;
6) In addition, affected villages shall support and help villagers select new homesteads and farmland.
Farmland of the farmers not directly affected by thie project but poorer shall not be adjusted so as to
avoid advantageous impacts due to land adjustment.
Accident Risk
As the project will cross Hanjiang, Du and Tian Rivers upstream of Danjiangkou Reservoir, waster
quality impact would be significantly severe if thie traffic accident of vehicle transporting dangerous
material occurs. The drains, retarding basin and plug device will be provided on the bridges to be
constructed on these rivers. In additioni, crash-proof railing will be installed on the bridges.
Anti-flood
Anti-flood requirements of bridges and passages of the project have fully been considered at design, the
major technical parameters for bridge design are flood of once every 300 years for super bridge and once
every 100 years for other bridges. Under such design condition, normal flood discharge and storage can
be assured.

Environmenit Management Plan for Shiyani to ManclhuaniguLani Section of Yinwu Inter-Provincial HIighway Project
importance responsibilities on effective environment impact control and impact mitigation, and most of
afore-designed environment protection measures shall be implemented by the contractor. In order to
ensure the satisfactory implementation of the environimental plans by contractor, following measures
should be taken:
1) Environmental management should be included into the pre-qualification evaliation criteria to
contractors;
2) The contractor owning ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certificates will be preferable;
3) At least one full-time environimental staff will be designated to monitoring the construction activity at
each package road section;
4) Environmental protection should be specified in the construction contract;

construction supervision bidder shall have two persons (one of them as senior manager) to
participate in the trainiing held by contractor.
2.4 Mitigation Measure in Operation Phase
Noise
1) According to the result of noise projection in the environment impact report, noise level at the point
200 m from the central line of the road can meet the Class IV standard, ancl from 250 m can meet the
Class I standard. But because the proposed highway is located at hilly area, and goes along gully,
almost the area 250 m from the central line of the road will have hills blocking, Therefore school or
hospital should not be allowed to construct within the area 250 m from the central line of the road,
shops and warehouse should not be allowed to construct within the area 100 m from the central line of
the road.
2) Environment factor shall be included in environimenit management. Motor vehicles speed will be
limited by warning and traffic control signs to be erected near the sensitive receptors. The noise along
the highway, especially the noise at the sensitive receptors shall be frequently monitored to ensure the
noise value within the projected one. If the monitored noise is over the projected one, prevention
27 Hubei Provincial Communication Department



Enviro-nment Management Plan for Shiyani to Manchuaniguani Section of Yinwu Inter-Provincial Highway Project
measures shall be taken.
Water Quality
1) The leaky tank truck and uncovered overloaded truck should be prohibited from driving on the road
because there are many rivers, ponds and other sensitive water bodies along the higlhway, which can
effectively prevent pollution of water bodies along the highway from leaked materials;
2) The drain facilities should be maintained on regular basis to achieve good operating condition;
Accidental Event
An emergency leading grouLp has been jointly formed by Hubei Provincial Expressway Group and Hubei
EPB. If an accident occurs, the leader of the group will be immediately informed, and the remaining
procedures in the emergency plan will then be kick-in.
"Three certificate system" should be implemented to manage the vehicle transporting dangerous material.
A uniform sign should be marked on the vehicle for dangerotus material transportation. Dedicated land
and parking area should be planned for these vehicles.
Air Pollution
Several authorities are involved in the control of atmospheric pollutant discharge, including legislation
authority, automobile manufacturers, and public security authority. Tail gas venit of automobiles must be
controlled in Hubei. At current stage, the national laws and rules will be executed strictly in Hubei, such
as limit on lead content in gasoline and pollutant discharge standard etc. the tail gas vent of automobiles
must be strictly check when drive licenses are renewed each year. Tail gas sampling and check exercise
should be carried out at the toll station. Any vehicle fails to meet the standard for tail gas emission should
be rejected from the road.
The atmosplheric environment at sensitive receptors shall be monitored often, to assure N02 within the
projected value. If monitored value is over the projected one, 10m wide tree planting method shall be
applied.
Public Health
The local governments will disseminate the information on HIV and SARS via public media to the public.
Scrutiny on suspected people bearing HIV or SARS should be enhaniced. Hotel, restaurant and railway
station should be the key objects for regular inspection.
Viaduct
Through consultation with local authorities, common understandings on disadvantageous impacts of
viaducts on the envirornment have achieved and related solutions have been decided. This mitigation
28 Hubei Provincial Communication Department



Enviromienit Management Plan for Shiyan to Manchuanguani Section of Yinwu Inter-Prcvincial Highway Project
measures include:
1) Traffic regulations and management should be stringently enforced to reduce accidents;
2)  Clear traffic signs should be installed at the viaduct area;
3)  Garbage bin shall be equipped at the stations and streets with viaducts;
4)  Hotels, restaurants, stations and other public facilities at viaducts shall be regularly checked,
following the increase of traffic flow and passenger flow, cleaners shall be increased.
5). Air quality and noise level should be monitored to ensure these impacts being effectively mitigated
by the proposed measures.
6). Public security of hotels, stations and other public facilities shall be enhalnced.
2.5 Personnel Training
The success of environmental management for the Project relies on the knowledge, and
experience   of the   personnel  involved  in environmenital managemaenlt. As contemporary
methodologies and approachi towards environmental management for road construction and operation are
still new to the agencies in the local department concerned, therefore it is very important to carry out
domestic training and abroad training. The abroad training location shall be the countries witlh mature
road construction and operationi environment management systems. Domestic training can be held by
inviting experts from universities, environment research institutes and professional consultation
organizations. Persons havinig received abroad training can be trainers for domestic training.
As the lessons of the past three World Bank financed projects, contractor and construction supervision
unit must be self supervised. Though such supervision is not the final goal, it can become a permainent
approach to remind them for environment protection and good for better supervision of environment
management and supervision organizations. To carry out advantageous supervision on personnel of
contractor and supervision organization, personnlel and their leaders of contractor and supervision
organization must be trained,
The total personnel training program will be 148 personi weeks witlh a total cost of RMB509,260 or
US$61,400. Among this, domestic training will be 128 person weeks with a total cost of RMB19,010 or
US$23,900 and overseas training, 20 person weeks with a total cost of RMB3 11,250 or US$37,500.

Note: the surface water quality shall be monitored once every week during bridge pile foundation
construction and it can be monitored as necessary during other periods.
Additionally, construction team and supervision team will carry out the monitoring.. program on daily
basis:
Monitor the noise level at the sensitive receptor by potable monitoring kit;
By visual means to check the air-borne dust;
By visual means to check the water quality in the river, creeks, fish pond and irrigation canals affected by
the construction activity.
The results of the monitoring program will be included in formal written reports and suibmitted for review
by WBFPO on monthly basis. In case of unexpected impact occurs, the construction team should report
immediately to the WBFPO and contract specialized institute to monitor.
The monitoring staff for each road section should be trained before the monitorin-g program is conducted.
The consultant of the WBFPO will visit the site to supervise the monitoring exercise each month based
on the monthly monitoring report. All of the requirements for monitoring and reporting program should
be incorporated in the provisions of construction contract.

Monitoring Report
The results of the monitoring program will be included in formal written reports twice a year and
submitted for review by WBFPO (or local transportation bureau in the operation phase) and its
consultants, Hubei Provincial EPB and the World Bank. These reports will be the basis for evaluation of
site environmental performance and for developing additional mitigation measures for unaniticipated
impacts, which exceed applicable standards. Figure 4-Ishows the reporting arranigement.

Figure 4-1  Reporting Procedure
Equipment and Instrument
Because Hubei Provincial Road Monitoring Station has been well equipped with necessary instruments,
there will only be new procurement of GPS and hand-lheld noise meters (3GPS and I I noise meters) with
a total cost of RMB 160,400.
Monitoring Cost Estimate
The construction period will be 3.5 years and each year environmental monitorinig cost will be
RMB200,000, tlherefore the total cost for monitoring for construction phase is RMB 700,000. For the
operation phase, RMB200,000/year will be required for the monitoring *for 20 years. In addition, a
contingency of RMB80,000 will be set aside for accidental monitoring and mitigation/remediation
planning. A full-time staff will be provided for maintenance of greening, drainage system, bridges and
culverts.
The cost for monitoring by construction team will be included in the contract budget, therefore the
WBFPO has no such a cost estimate separately.
