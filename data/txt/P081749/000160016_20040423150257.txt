1 Introduction

        This document is the Executive Summary of Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
        World Bank financed Shiyan to Manchuanguan Section of the Yinwu Inter-Provincial
        Highway Project (Shiman Highway or the Project). It provides a general summary of the
        findings in the Project Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental
        Management Plan (EMP), including legal and policy framework and applicable
        environmental standards, inajor potential adverse impacts to the physical and socio-
        economic environments in the Project area, analysis of alternatives, mitigation measures
        designed, public consultation programs, and environmental management plan for the
        Project. The Executive Summary could serve as a concise environmental report to
        environmental administrators, Project decision makes, project-affected groups, non-
        government organizations and the general public, as well as to the executive board of
        directors of the World Bank.

1.1 Project Background

        As a section of the Yinwu Inter-provincial Highway, the Project is one of the key
        infrastructure projects in the Hubei province and a se,ment in the strategic national trunk
        highway network. As the expressway will eventually provincial capital of Wuhan at its
       east end to Yinchuan, the capital city of northwestern province of Ningxia at its west end,
        Shiinan expressway will be a critical link between the inore developed central and coastal
       region with northwestern China and will play an important role in the enormous Develop
       China's West program. Within the province, it will form part of the "automobile"
       corridor, alleviating transportation bottleneck surrounding the fast growing automobile
       manufacturing industry in northwest Hubei. Together with the connecting road and rural
       road components also in the same Project region in Hubei province, the Project will be a
       significant contributor in development of regional economies, improvement of standard
       of living and alleviation of poverty.

       A revised feasibility study for the Project started in mid 2002 and was completed in
       November 2002. The project preliminary engineering design was completed in
       November 2003 while the final detailed engineering design is expected to complete in
       May 2004. Over the same period, Environinental Assessment (EA) for the Project has
       been conducted by Second Navigation Survey and Design Institute (SNSDI). An EA
       Terms of Reference (TOR) was compared in August 2002 which was reviewed, revised
       and approved in December 2002 by the State Environmental Protection Administration
       (SEPA). The first draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report was prepared in
       June 2003 which was reviewed by SEPA and World Bank missions in the second half of
       2003 and revised accordingly based on the comments received from the World Bank and
       SEPA. The final draft of EIA, together with Environmental Management Plan was
       submitted to the SEPA in December 2003 and on December 26, 2004 reviewed by an
       expert panel convened by SEPA. Comments received from the panel review have been
       incorporated into the final EIA report which was submitted to SEPA in January 2004.
       The official approval of the EA from the SEPA is expected by the end of March, 2004.

       The Shiinan expressway is classified as a Category A project since it involves inajor
       expressway construction on new alignment, grade highway upgrading partially on new
       alignment, increased noise, motor vehicle air emission, occupation of fertile and barren
       land, community severance, soil erosion and resettlement.

EA Executive Summary


1.2 Basis of the EA

       The regulatory and policy requirements for environmental assessment of development
       projects in China were followed during the preparation of EA, as were the World Bank's
       safeguard policies. Major laws and regulations applied to the EA are as follows:

            Laws of Environmental Protection of the P.R. China of December 1989;
            Environmental Impact Assessment Law of P.R. China of October 2002;
            Law of Water and Soil Conservation of June 1996;
            Law of Air Pollution Control of August 2000;
            Law of Water Pollution Control of May 1996;
            Law of Environmental Noise Pollution Control of October 1996;
            Circulation on Strengthening EIA for Construction Projects Receiving International
            Financing of June 1993; and
            Technical Specifications for Environmental Impact Assessment, (five volume series
            from 1993 to 1997).

       Of the ten World Bank safeguard policies, Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP4.01),
       Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30), Cultural Property (OP4.1 I), Forestry (OP/GP4.36),
       Natural Habitats (OP/BP4.04), Pest Management (OP4.09), and Indigenous People
       (OD4.20) are applied in the EA first through screening and, where triggered, included in
       the full assessment. Since there are no Project components that would involve
       international waterways, d a m or construction in disputed areas as defined under the
       World Bank's OP7.60, safeguard policies related to these subjects are not applied in the
       EA. Relevant international environmental agreements in which China is a signing party
       have also been included where applicable as a basis for the EA.

EA Executive Summary


2 Project Description

       The Project is located in the northwest of Hubei province in central China. The Shiman
       Expressway starts from Jianinao district of Shiyan city, extends northwest bound through
       Yun county, Yunxi county and ends at provincial border town of Manchuanguan,
       Shanyang county in the neighboring Shaanxi province (Map 1). The Project has three
       major components: the main expressway, connecting roads linking urban centers and
       rural roads connecting villages with townships and counties. The connecting and rural
       roads are located within the Shiyan municipality which are the directly impacted/serviced
       Yun, Yunxi and Zhushan counties (Map 1) which are state and provincial level poverty
       regions. The expressway will be constructed completely on new alignment, where the
       connecting roads will partially on new alignment and partially on the existing roads. The
       rural roads will be primarily on exiting roads, involving hardening/pavement and
       widening of the existing low grade roads to increase their transportation capacity and all
       season access.

       Key specifications of the components are summarized in Table 2-1




      The construction of the expressway is scheduled to commence in Jun 2004 and complete
      in Jun 2008. The country road construction is scheduled for May 2004 to May 2006 and
      the bridge construction, May 2004 to the end of May 2007.

3 Baseline Environment

3.1 Physical Setting

        The Project area is located in the north semi-tropical region with a continental monsoon
        climate. The average annual temperature ranges from 11 to 17"C, and average annual
        precipitation from 696 to 1200 mm. The terrain configuration of the expressway area has
        a general gradient from northwest to southeast with elevations from 200 to 1200 m. the
        expressway alignment is in general in the same orientation with the mountain bodies in
        the area. The Baozliou rural road is in north-south direction along the river side in general
        with elevations of 300-950 in. Most sections of the road has mountain on one side and
        river on the other with 5-30 in differential elevation between the road surface and the
        river bed. The JianjLinhe river site is a natural river valley of Hanjiang river. On the
        Yuinxi county side of the bridge is mostly steep hill and bare rocks while the Yun county
        side is basically river sediment delta with relatively flat with sand and gravels.

3.2 Sensitive Receptors

        Along the expressway alignment, a total of 23 villages/townships and 10 schools are
        identified through field investigation as sensitive or otherwise vulnerable to changes in
        the environment which surrounds them, such as construction activities, air pollution,
        increased noise, construction dust, etc. These sensitive receptors are located about 30 to
        I50  in from expressway central line to the nearest points in these sensitive receptors.  In
        addition, the expressway will also cross five rivers and run nearby one dinosaur egg
        protective area which is a national level reserve (Map 2). Along the connection road,
        there are two villages and one school while along the rural roads there are nine villages,
        11 schools and five hospitals which are sensitive receptors because of their proximity to
       these Project components.

       The sensitive receptors are the focus of tlie monitoring program for the baseline
       environmental conditions as well as the environmental impact assessment. They are also
       the key areas for impact mitigation measures designed to protect or otherwise ininimize
       the adverse impacts at these sensitive locations.

3.3Air Quality

       Existing ambient air quality was monitored during the EA to determine the baseline
       conditions. The monitoring was conducted near seven selected representative sensitive
       receptors such as villages and schools between March and April 2003, with five
       consecutive day continued measurements each time. The representative results of the
       monitoring at the main expressway and country road are presented in Table 3-1.




                                                4                                 Shiman Expressway

*: NOx was monitored at this location instead of NO2

       The above results show that NO,, concentrations were between 0.012 to 0.044 mg/m3,
       below tlie applicable standard of 0.12 mg/m3 (Class 11 in the Air Quality Standards). The
       TSP and PMloon the road side were between 0.06 to 0.33 mg/m3and 0.03 to 0.16 mg/m3,
       respectively, slightly higher than their respective applicable standards. The results
       indicate fairly good existing ambient air quality at tlie Project areas. The TSP and PMlo
       exceedance was mostly along the existing road side which is caused by tlie existing
       traffic on these roads.

3.4Noise

       Existing noise levels in five sensitive locations along the main expressway and 11 along
       the rural roads area were measured. The results are presented in Table 3-2.




                                                  5                             Shiman Expressway

EA Executive Summarv


           Table 3-2 Existing Noise Level at Selected Locations along Project Alignment




       The above noise monitoring results show that both day and night time noise levels in the
       areas along the main expressway alignment were below the applicable standards, even
       reaching Class I standards, showing excellent existing acoustic environment. This is
       because there are no major noise sources in these areas except farming activities. In the
       rural road areas, the noise was significantly higher and some were even higher than
       applicable standards. In the townships, the noise sources include urban activities as well
       as the traffic. Noise in these areas reached 58.6-63.6 dB(A) for day time and 40.6-51.3
       dB(A) at night, exceeding sliglitly the Class I1 standards but meeting the Class I11
       standards. The schools along the existing rural roads are mainly impacted by traffic noise.
       As some of the schools are as close as 5  into the road side and the road has turns at these
       locations which cause motor vehicles to brake and horn, the noise level reached as high
       as 72.5 dB(A) for the day time, significantly exceeded the applicable Class I standards.
       The two rural villages along the existing road had noise levels of 56.4 and 57.1 dB(A) at
       day time and 47.9 and 49.6 dB(A) at night respectively meeting Class I1 standards. The
       village near the proposed rural bridge site exceeded slightly Class I1 standards.

3.5 Water Quality

       Surface water quality at Hanjiang river, which is the largest river to be crossed by the
       expressway, was monitored on March 5-7, 2003. All monitored data show that measured
      parameters     (pH, COD, Oil, SS and total P) were within their respective applicable
      standards. Based on historical water quality data and the results of water quality
      monitoring conducted in April 2003 of Dong, Liayu, Beixing and Jiangjun rivers, which
      are impacted rivers by the rural road component, except a few exceptions, all water
      quality parameters met the applicable standards. SS at Beixi river monitoring site
      exceeded slightly Class I1 standard.

EA Executive Summary


3.6 Soil Erosion

        The primary type of soil erosion in the project area is water and colluvial erosion,
        particularly surface and ditch erosion, caused by unfavorable land form, topography,
        geology, soil and hydrology conditions, coupled with disturbance to the surface
        vegetation without appropriate control. Common forms of soil erosion include movement
        of surficial materials, ditch failures due to the lack of vegetation, soil dissolution
        following intense rainfall, and landslides. Soil erosion intensity in the main expressway
        area is 1874-2139 t/km2a. The rural road area belongs to upper reach of Hanjiang river
        with severe soil erosion. With nearly 10 years of mountain closure and wood-cutting
        moratorium, the soil erosion has been gradually under control. The intensity now is
        2100-4600 t/km2awhile at the Jiangjunhe river bridge site, 3000 t/km2a.

3.7 Cultural Property

        A survey by professional archeology, cultural relics institutes and local cultural relics
        specialists was conducted in January 2001 and again in June 2003, covering the main
        expressway line, the alternative alignments proposed and evaluated, connecting roads,
        borrow pits and spoil soil disposal sites. The survey included walk-through of the entire
        alignment, visual observation and limited sub-surface investigation through drilling
        and/or sampling. Three cultural relics have been identified, including a Tang-Song
        Dynasty tomb, a New Stone age tomb and a revolutionary site in the modern history. The
        later two will be directly or indirectly impacted by the expressway construction due to
        their close proximity to the alignment.

3.8 Socio-economic Baseline

        The total population crossed and serviced by the expressway is approximately 1.69
        inillion and the total serviced area is 112 million mu (1 5 mu to a hectare), including
       approximately 1.31 inillion mu of cultivated land. The major citiesiurban centers along
       the expressway include Shiyancounty, Yun county and Yunxi county, although the
       expressway will not go through the any of these urban areas directly. The expressway
       will affect directly 59 villages and townships, 10 schools, five major rivers and many
       more small rivers, creeks, irrigation channels, and fisWwater ponds, because of their
       proximity to the expressway alignment. It will run adjacent to the state level Qinglongshn
       dinosaur egg fossil reserve, At its closest point, the expressway alignment will pass an
       area 140 in to the edge of the experimental zone of the reserve. The rural road area does
       not have any significant urban centers or reserves.

EA Executive Summary


4 Environmental Impacts

4.I Soil Erosion

        Soil erosion will occur during the Project construction phase when surface vegetation and
        soil are damaged. The primary area of potentially increased soil erosion includes deep
        cuts, high fills, earth borrow pits, construction waste/excessive earth disposal sites,
        temporary construction sites, treatment of special geological conditions and other areas
        where surface soil will be disturbed. According to the modeling result, the soil erosion
        intensity will reach 9866.28 t/km2a during construction and for the whole construction
        period the total soil lost will be 2.33 million t, which is 2.22 million t higher than the
        current level of soil erosion over the same number of years if there were no project. The
        increased soil erosion will also occur in the early of the operation phase in areas where
        vegetation planting is applied for rehabilitation of disturbed soil. Soil erosion for rural
        road construction is also expected to increase.

        During the early stage of the operation phase, the soil erosion will be still higher than the
        current level because the soil erosion measures such as landscaping will take time to be
        effective. It is expected that about 3 three years after project operation, the soil erosion
        will reach about 80-100% or reduce to the levels before the land disturbance, when newly
        planted vegetation will mature. Some of soil control measures, such as concrete sloping,
        however, will reach its 100% effectiveness immediately after it is completed.

4.2 Impact on land uses and vegetation

        The Project will permanently occupy 12605.5 mu (1 5 mu to a hectare) of land including
       40% of waste land and wood land, and 39.4% of cultivated land. In addition, a total of
        104 borrow pits will temporary occupy 7425.4 mu of land and the five borrow pits will
       occupy 127.66 mu of land, and permanent waste soil disposal land will occupy 576.77mu.
       The construction, borrow pits and disposal sites for the connecting roads and rural roads
       components will occupy more land, permanently or temporarily, but as the rural road is
       upgrading of an existing road, the permanent occupation of additional land will be
       ini nimum.

       The vegetation, including crops, trees and other vegetation on the occupied farmland and
       woodland will be lost to the Project. However, compared with the total cultivated land in
       the Project areas, that occupied by the Project and thus the impacts to agriculture is
       relatively small (about 0.013-0.29% of the directly affected districts and townships).
       Except in the expressway pavement area itself, impacts on vegetation in other portion of
       the expressway areas will be short termed as the slopes, central separation media, open
       space of tlie interchange areas, borrow pits, disposal sites and other temporary occupied
       areas will be landscaped and rehabilitated with lawns, trees bushes and other vegetation.
       In fact, it is expected, these landscape programs will result in a net increase in vegetation
       coverage rate in areas along the expressway.

       The proposed expressway alignment is 2 km away from the Sifangshan Botanic Park and
       12 kin from Niutouslian Forest Park. Because of the distances to these parks, the direct
       impacts from expressway construction activities as well as noise, air emissions and local
       damages of vegetation during operation phase to those parks are expected insignificant or
       negligible.

EA Exec21tive Summary


4.3Impacts on WaterEnvironment

         Construction Phase

         Impacts on the water environment during the construction phase include primarily
         discharge of sanitary sewage froin the expected 21 construction camps and bridge
         construction activities. Each construction camp, with an estimated 200 to 300 workers,
         will generate about 2 to 3 t of sanitary sewage per day which, if not treated properly,
         would affect the water quality of the receiving environment. In addition, municipal solid
         waste generated from the camps, if not handled properly could also affect water quality
        through contaminated surface runoff.

        Bridge construction could result in suspension of river sediments. The construction
        machines operating in or near the river could also be a risk for oil contamination from
        potential leaks or spills, affecting river quality particularly during the spawning season of
        April to June each year. The area affected will generally be a short distance downstream
        froin the bridge construction sites.

        Operation Phase

        Wastewater sources from the operation phase will include sanitary sewage from service
        stations and parking lots, car washing effluents and pavement runoff of the first flush in a
        rainfall event. The wastewater from point sources will be treated to the applicabIe
        standards before discharge so the impacts will be limited. The surface runoff is very
        sinall compared with the receiving river flows and as such the impact is expected to be
        insignificant, based on modeling result.

        The transportation of hazardous materials, both road transportation and water navigation
        could pose a risk of water contamination from traffic accidents occurring near the rivers
        which involve vehicles and water vessels loaded hazardous materials and result in major
        spills. Based on the frequencies of occurrence of such severe accidents, the prediction
        results indicate that there exist a very sinall probability of water contamination from this
        source. If they do happen, catastrophic consequence may result to water quality, aquatic
        life and eco-system, health and safety of the people living downstream froin the accident
        locations.

        The Danjiangkou reservoir located downstream froin the Jiangjunhe river bridge, which
        is part of the rural road component, will go through a major upgrading through a rise of
        its dam. The hydraulic modeling shows that the designed dam increase and the resulting
       water level rise in the river, will not affect the bridge and the navigation under the bridge
       as the bridge is designed for 100 year flood which is able to accommodate the water rise.

4.4 Noise Impacts

       Construction Phase

       Construction noise will be primarily from construction machinery. Based on the noise
       intensity and compounded effect of simultaneous operation of multiple machines, an
       noise attenuation model predicts that at 55 in from construction machines, the noise
       levels will be reduced to below the applicable day time noise standards. It will take about
       250 in for the noise to meet the standards at night. There are only very small of residents


                                                  9                                Shiman Expressway

EA Executive Summary


         who live within 55 m froin the construction sites so the impacts will be very limited.
         There are, however, a large number of people within the 250 m area from the
         construction sites. There would be a significant noise impacts if construction machines
         operate at night. In addition, residents living on both sides of access roads will be
         impacted by the higher noise levels from increased traffic of construction transportation
         vel1icles.

         Operation Phase

         Noise levels for the 23 villages which are located near the proposed expressway are
         predicted for the years 2009, 2020 and 2028. The results show that noise at all the
         villages will be within the applicable standards during the day time in 2009. With the
         increase of traffic on the expressway, some villages will start to be exposed in higher
         noise particularly at night. In 2020 and 2028 all noise levels during the day time will still
         be within the applicable standards but 2 villages will exceed the noise standard at night
        by 1.9 to 2.4 dB(A) in 2020 and five will exceed in 2028 by 0.6-5.9 dB(A). For the
         schools near the expressway, the noise model predicts that in 2009 two will exceed the
        applicable standard by 2.3-5.9 dB(A). The same two schools wiII continue to be impacted
        by noise over longer terins when noise will exceed the standard by 4.5-8.3 dB(A) in 2020
        and by 6.0-9.5 dB(A) by 2028, respectively.

        For the rural road upgrading, the traffic is projected to increase from the current level to
         1245 MTE/day in 2009 and 2516 MT/day in 2020. Despite the increase, it is still a
        relatively small traffic volume and there is no noise model which can fit such small
        traffic volume for noise projection. Based on an analogy assessment, using a rural road
        under the similar topographic conditions, with the similar traffic volume, the noise in
        2009 is expected to be less than 65 dB(A) during the day time and less than 55 dB(A) at
        night at 10 in froin the road side. These levels meet Class 111 standards. The analogy
        assessment also predicts that in 30 in from the road side, the noise will meet Class I1
        standards, both day and night times.

4.5 Air Impact

        Construction Phase

        Airborne dust will be a primary air contaminant during the construction phase. The
        sources of the dust will be unpaved access roads, DisposaI areas, materials storage areas
        and transportation. The factors affected dust airborne will include climate conditions and
        type of construction activities. The impact area can be 150 m from the source of dust.
        Another source of air emission is asphalt and concrete mixing stations. The impacted area
        can be up to 300 m leeward from the source.

        Operation Phase

        Using an air dispersion model and motor vehicle emission model, it is predicted that NOx
        concentrations are expected not to exceed the standards in the year 2028 under the
        normal weather conditions but exceed the standards under the unfavorable weather
       conditions. Compared with the without Project scenario, it is expected that more NOx (by
       42%) but less CO (by 47%) and THC (by 44%) will be generated because the
       significantly increased motor vehicle speeds on the expressway over the speeds on the
       existing highways. The green house gases will be in general reduced.

4.6Socio-economicImpact

       Community Severance

       Because the expressway will be fully fenced with limited access, it will separate farmland
       and rural communities from one another in both sides of the expressway. In total, 23
       villages will be affected for access to farmland, services, schools, markets, and/or other
       parts of the communities.

       Cultural Relics

       According to the report prepared by of Hubei Provincial Relics and Archaeological
       Research Institute during the Project EA, the proposed expressway will go through three
       cultural relics sites: the Jianliupu site of the New Stone Age (3000-4000 BC), with a total
       area of 5000 m2,Pingchi tomb of Tang-Song Dynasties (300-1000 AD) with a total area
       of 2000 m2and Shaanan military hospital site (1920-30s). Preservative excavation will be
       conducted at Jianlilupu site while no actions are needed for the other two sites due to
       their distances to the proposed expressway alignment. Based on the current assessment
       by provincial archaeologists, as well as further consultation with other specialists, these
       three cultural relics sites do not have significant history, cultural or architecture values
       and are not included in any of the state, provincial or county level cultural relics lists. The
       site investigation by the Institute and local cultural specialists of the rural road sites find
       no cultural relics within the rural road impacted areas.

       National Reserves

       The expressway will go through outside of a national reserve for dinosaur egg fossils.
       The reserve is divided as central zone, buffer zone and experimental zone. The outer
       experimental zone has no finds of any dinosaur egg fossils but no destructive
      construction activities are allowed within the zone according to the relevant regulations.
      The original K line, at its closest point, is about 45   in to the edge of the experimental
      zone. While at this distance it would not impact the reserve area directly, but the risk is
      high as the construction activities could extend to wider areas. Through a sectional
      alternative line, the final expressway alignment at this area will be 140 m from the edge
      of the experimental zone, further reduce the risks.

      Health and Safety

      Health risks are primarily related to increased transit population during construction
      (construction workers) and operation (visitors) in the regions. The increased mobile
      population could potentially bring and spread infectious diseases in the Project area. The
      in-hygiene and un-healthy life style of the workers could spread diseases such as hepatitis
      and AIDS to local residents as well as among themselves.

      The safety risk is primarily in the construction phase with the local residents, particularly
      children who have little awareness of construction site safety in a linear construction sites
      with virtually no access control along the expressway alignment. The explosion operation
      for deep cut and materials borrowing and the resulting flying stones, as well as explosive
      handling, will be among the most dangerous activities on the construction sites which
      pose risks to residents. The explosive operation could also affect the safety and structure


                                                 1 1                              Shiman Expressway

         integrity of houses in a 500 rn radius area through strong vibration of the explosion as
        well as damaging roof tiles and windows from flying stone from explosion.

        Tourism

        The proposed expressway will greatly improve the accessibility to the Project areas
        including local tourist attractions and as a result, more visitors are expected to visit local
        parks and conservation areas, such as the Wudaoshan Mountain Park (located 40 kin
        away from tlie expressway). The increased tourists and motor vehicle traffic will bring
        higher loads to the environment and eco-system in the park, including air emission,
        sewage, and solid waste generation.

4.7 Resettlement and Relocation

        The resettlement and relocation of the proposed expressway will occupy permanently
        12605.5 mu of land, affect three urban districts, 92 townships, 46 villages and 142 village
        groups. The total directly affected families who either lost land, houses or both will be
        5020 with 20,398 people. The Project will also occupy yards, water wells, walls, tombs,
        trees, irrigation systems, country roads and utilities within the expressway area. The
        impacts will also include mismanagement of land and house compensation funds,
        unsatisfactory with land re-assignment and insufficient compensation for house
        replacement. However, in general, the new houses following the relocation are expected
        to be better and bigger than tlie houses they replace with using the resettlement and
        relocation compensation funds, representing an improvement of housing conditions and
        the standards of living.

        The total cost of resettlement and relocation, including compensation to all affected, is
        estimated to be RMB223.37 million.

4.8 Safeguards Policies Assurance

       The EA team conducted a screening for ten safeguard policies of the World Bank and,
       when triggered by the Project conditions, full assessment. The safeguard policies which
       are incorporated in tlie EA include Environmental Assessment (OP4.01), Cultural
       Property (OP4.1 l), Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) and Public Disclosure (BP 17.50).
       Those safeguards which have gone through the initial screening but found not warrant a
       full assessment include Natural Habitat (OP4.04), Pest Management (OP4.09),
       Indigenous Peoples (4.20) and Forest (OP4.36). There remainder safeguards are not
       applicable because the Project does not have any components involved these safeguards
       issues. These include Safety of Dam (OP4.37), International Waterways (OP7.50) and
       Disputed Areas (OP 7.60).

5 Analysis of Alternatives

        The analysis of alternatives and determination of expressway alignment incltide the
        following process: first, three transportation corridors between Sliiyan and Xian, the
        ultimate destination of this expressway, were identified and compared and the one with
        the least environmental impacts was selected (in which this expressway is a section).
        Within this corridor, two alternative alignments were then identified and compared with
        the one with the least environinental impacts selected as the preferred alignment. Finally
        on the preferred alignment, fine modifications were introduced in several sections to
        compare with the original alignment in the attempt to further avoid and minimize
        potential adverse impacts of the expressway. The expressway alignment is determined
        based on these three steps in analysis and comparison of different alternatives.

        Tlie three corridor alternatives analyzed at the first stage are (see Map 3 for details):

       Corridor 1:       starting from Shiyan through Manchuanguan, Sihepu, Zhashui and
                         ending at Xian, with a total length of 300 km (preferred alternative).
       Corridor 11:      Starting from Shiyan and along national highway 209 north to Xiping in
                         Henan province and then along national highway 312 in Henan to
                         Sliaanxi province and then through Zhangzhou and Liantian and finally
                         ending at Xian. The total length for this alternative is 391 kin.
       Corridor Ill:     Starting froin Shiyan going south to Laobailu and then through national
                        highway 316 to Xuyang, Zhenan, Zhashui and Guanghuojie and ending
                        at Xian, The total length of the alignment in this corridor is 395 kin.

       Corridor I is selected based on the least land occupation and least resettlement, which in
       turn would have smaller amounts of disturbance and impacts to the natural and socio-
       economic environments. Furthermore, the area within Corridor I is relatively stable
       geologically, with mild soil erosion. In addition, the cuts and fills within Corridor I would
       be the smallest compared with the other two corridors, implying least disturbance and
       least need for disposal. Corridor I also receives the widest supports from the local
       governments which is also an important factor in the analysis of alternatives by the EA
       and other project teams. Mitigation measures have been proposed and included in the
       engineering design where appropriate as well as in the Project EMP for mitigating
       adverse impacts expected to be caused by Corridor I, particularly in areas where Corridor
       I has higher impacts than other corridors.

       Within the preferred corridor, limited by the site topography and geology, there are two
       possible alignments for considerations and comparison, Alignment K (107.14 kin) and
      Alignment B (108.97 kin). The two alignments overlap at the Shiyan section and go
      separate alignments before merged again near the end of this section of expressway at
      Manchuanguan. Through a detailed analysis of the potential impacts, and comparison of
      the two alignments, Alignment K is selected as the preferred alignment based on lower
      soil erosion, lower land requirement, lower biodiversity and lower amount of biomass,
      cross less rivers with less bridges and in-water construction, less cuts and fills and less
      tunnels, and less cultural relics, although the Alignment K has higher niimber of sensitive
      receptors to noise and higher amoiint of housing relocation and displaced persons. In
      addition, Alignment I<      receives better supports froin local governments and less
      community severance and social impacts by the expressway construction and operation.

EA Executive Surnnzary


       Within Alignment K, the preferred alignment, nine sections, named A1 through A4 and
       A0 and B1 through B4 were identified where alternatives analyzed and compared with
       their corresponding I< line sections. The two alignments and nine optional sections are
       shown in Map 4. The comparison of these nine sections and results are shown as follows:

       Al:       This section is to attempt to the issue of the I< line going tlvough the north edge
                 of Shiyan city, by move this section further away. However, A1 would impact
                 more schools and does have the support o the local government and thus it is
                 dropped.
       A2:      A2 is proposed for minimize the disturbance to existing highway G209. By
                comparison, K line section would affect more villages, dismantle more houses
                and cross the existing road by six more times, alternative A2 is preferred.
       A3:      In order to avoid the potential impact to the Qinglongshan dinosaur egg fossil
                national reserve, A3 is proposed. But this newly proposed alternative section
                would cross a river with a poor bridge position, and tlm is not desirable. Yet, the
                potential impacts to the reserve are still a concern and another alternative section
                A0 is proposes.
       AO:      A0 is located further away from the dinosaur reserve (about 140 in compared
                with the K line of 45 m) and at the same time the location of bridge is good.
                Although K line may not have the impacts to the reserve, further away from the
                reserve, lower the rislts. Thus A0 is selected.
       A4:      This section is proposed to better fit the city planning and development
                requirement of Qingqi township. In addition, although A4 would have a longer
                tunnel, it would avoid several sensitive receptors and reduce resettlement needs
                compared with corresponding I< line section. With these considerations, A4 is
                selected.
       B1:      This alternative section is based on geological considerations. B1 would go
                through better geological site and has better solution for spoil soil disposal. But
                B 1 would create more resettlement probleins and go through more sensitive
                receptors, upsetting the environmental benefits brought in geological conditions.
                T~LIS, K line section is maintained.
       B2:      This is option proposed to reduce the spoil soil in the service zone. Furthermore,
                B2 would avoid three shallow slide areas which could also generate higher
                geological unstabilities and even disastrous events by the expressway
                construction during the heavy rain seasons. Although B2 would create more
                resettlement, it is still preferred particularly after a finer adjustment of line (20-40
                m shift) to minimize the increased resettlement and other environmental impacts.
      B3:       This alternative section is proposed mainly for better geological and construction
                conditions. Furthermore, this option also is better in hydrological conditions, less
                land occupation, soil control, etc. Thus, B3 is preferred option.
      B4:      This optional section is proposed to reduce the Erdaoya tunnel. It achieves this
               goal but would create more spoil soil need disposal. With all factors considered,
               the original K line section is still kept.

      For the rural road, it is mostly upgrading on the existing road. Any alternative alignment
      would involve new and green field alignments, and thus more land occupation and more
      impacts to the surrounding environments. Also the existing road serves mostly the rural
      communities and many services and other facilities have well established along the
      existing road, which would be impacted by new alignments. Thus, no alternative
      alignment is considered and rural road component would be on the existing road.

6 Mitigation

       For the adverse environmental impacts of the Project, the EA has developed a series of
       measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or otherwise compensate the adverse impact from
       the project. These mitigation measures are summarized below:

6.I Design Phase

        Soil Erosion

       To control soil erosion, permanent engineering works such as concrete and stone
       pavement on deep slopes and other cut and fills areas are included in the design
       completely stabilize the soil surface. Other works include interception ditches and
       landscaping. The borrow pits will be rehabilitated through conversion all five borrow pits
       into ponds or landscaping following completion of earth borrowing operation. For the 21
       excessive construction waste disposal sites, retaining walls, settling ponds, and drainage
       systems will be built. The stockpiles of the waste will be finally covered with soil and
       landscaped. The same measures will be taken at all borrow pits and disposal sties used for
       the connecting and rural roads.

       Noise

       A number of measures to minimize noise have been incorporated into the design for
       sensitive receptors at which the noise level is predicted to exceed the applicable standards.
       These measures, and the proposed implementation time, are summarized in Table 6-1.

       In addition, in several villages where no mitigation measures are planned because the
      predicted noise levels are below the applicable standards, increased noise monitoring will
       be implemented to ensure the actual noise levels after expressway operation comply with
      the predictions. Mitigation measures will be taken if the monitored data show noise levels
      exceed the standards.

      Similar measures and application principles, primarily noise control windows for the
      affected schools and tree planting will also be taken at sensitive receptors along the rural
      roads where noise level is predicted to exceed the applicable standards.

      Water

      To minimize the impact on water quality, wastewater treatment facilities will be designed
      and built at the service areas, including motor vehicle maintenance and repair shops, car
      washing operations, as well as other domestic facilities at the service areas along the
      expressway. Aerobic biological wastewater treatment process has been selected and

      meet the applicable discharge standards as per Integrated Wastewater Discharge
      incorporated into the design which is capable of removing COD and suspended solid to
      Standards (GB8978-1996). The car washing wastewater will first go through a pre-

       treatment for oil removal before enter into the biological wastewater treatment unit. In
       addition, the two branch management centers and two maintenance centers are very small
       and septic tanks will be installed for wastewater treatment before discharge.



       Community Severance

       To minimize the impacts of community and farmland severance, numerous rounds of
       consultation have been conducted with the affected villagers. Based on the needs and
       engineering considerations, on top of the 99 bridgedelevated viaducts and 30 tunnels
       along the expressway where there is no severance, there will be four over head bridges,
       21 grade separate interchanges, 20 passage ways, and 16 culverts capable of pedestrian
       passing. In total, excluding the river crossing bridges, the expressway will have 145
       facilities for pedestrian and farming vehicle crossing. On average, there will be 1.35
       crossings for each kilometer of the expressway or the rural residents will need to walk a
       maximum of 738 meters on average to cross the expressway to the other side. The
       provisions in the crossing design have been provided to allow various farm vehicles to
       use as well as for future expansion.

       Cultural Relics

       Preservative excavation at the cultural relics sites will be conducted and completed prior
       to the commencement of expressway construction. During this process, all valuable
       archaeological and cultural articles from the sites will be uncovered, studies and kept by
       the county museum. The excavated sites will be photographed, measured, documented or
       modeled if necessary before handed over to contractors for expressway construction.
       Contractors will be educated to strictly follow the procedures in case there is any chance
      find during construction. The procedure caIls for immediate halt of construction activities
      and contact relevant authorities. Contractors may resume work at the site if so instructed
      by authorities and cultural relics specialists following their on site investigation.

      Forest Park

      Because of the distance to the expressway, the impacts to Sifangshan Botanic Park,
      Niutaoslian Forest Park and Wudangshan Mountain Park will be insignificant. However,
      the Project will result in indirect impacts to the park through better access to the park and
      attraction to more tourists. To mitigate the indirect impacts, an environmental
      management plan for the parks will be prepared. The specific measures will include
      locating motor vehicle parking lot at 300 in away from the park area, and providing
      sufficient garbage bins and washroom faci1ities.

      Resettlement and Relocation

      All relocated residents will be properly compensated and received training for new
      employment. Special consideration will be given to the elderly, illiterate and farmers in
      terms of compensation. For people whose sources of well water will be disrupted by the
      construction by the construction of tunnels, additional water wells and other water supply
      sources will be developed.

6.2 Construction PJzase

       Temporary Land Occupatjon

       The construction workspace will be minimized to reduce the iinpact of land occupation.
       Areas which must be occupied will be re-vegetated after the completion of construction.
       Workers will be educated to protect trees and other vegetation as much as possible during
       construction. Temporary settling ponds will be built where necessary. To minimize soil
       erosion on disturbed soil, temporary protection measures such as grass mats will be
       applied in places where permanent protection works cannot be complete in time for the
       draining season.

       Construction Noise


       minimum). Operation of loud construction machinery and major construction activities
       Large and noisy construction activities will be kept away from populated areas (150 m

       will strictly restricted to the day time. Temporary noise barriers will be constructed to
       protect the sensitive receptors such as schools from the impact of construction noise.
       Construction traffic will be directed to avoid sensitive locations and completely banned at
       night time.

       Water

       To minimize adverse iinpacts to surface water during construction, cofferdam techniques
      will be used in bridge coluinn construction with complete isolation of work areas. River
      crossing construction activities will be scheduled to the extent possible during the low
      flow periods. The discharge from construction camps will be a potential source water
      contamination. To mitigate the potential impact, no sewage from construction camps will
      be allowed to discharge without treatment. The sewage will be either held at the site and
      empties to treatment facilities regularly or through on site treatment such as septic tank to
      meet the irrigation discharge standards. For the Jiangjunhe bridge in the rural road
      component, the in-water construction schedule will avoid April to June of the year during
      the spawning season.



      Unpaved access road and construction sites will be water prayed twice a day (once in the
      morning and once in the afternoon), or more on dry and windy days to suppress airborne
      dust. The hog mills and concrete mixing stations and other point sources of air emissions
      will be located leeward far enough from sensitive receptors (300 m minimum). The best
      efforts will be given to minimize the number of the hog plants and thus the impacted
      areas in both expressway and rural roads. Trucks loaded with soil and other dusty
      materials, as well as materials stockpiles will be covered with canvas.

      Construction Calms

      Construction camps will be appropriately located to miniinize the disturbance to the
      surrounding communities. Solid and liquid waste will be stored with proper protection
      and removed from the sites regularly with qualified vendors for disposal. The cainps will
      be maintained in sanitary, hygiene, orderly and good housekeeping conditions to


                                                17                              Shinian Expressway

EA Executive Summarv


        minimize the health hazards to the workers and adverse impacts to the surrounding
        environment.

        Worker will be educated for hygiene and healthy lifestyle at the construction sites to
        control infectious diseases and protect the workers and the local communities. Warning
        signs, public education, necessary barriers, etc. will be provided to protect public safety
        at the construction sites, especially during explosion operations.

        Cultural Relics

        Two cultural relics which are right on the project alignment will undertake protective
        excavation prior to the commencement of construction. The result of excavation will be
        moved to provincial museums for permanent protection and displays. A procedure for
        handling "chance finds" will be prepared and provided to the contractors, who will be
        requested to halt construction until the chance finds have been studied by professional
        archaeologists and instructed to resume construction.

        Contractor Management

        Experience with previous World Bank financed expressway project in Hubei province
        has indicated that high awareness and full participation of contractors in environmental
        management at construction are critically important to ensure environmental performance.
        Environmental protection will start from pre-qualification of contractors when
       environmental awareness and management systems will be an evaluation criterion. The
       environmental mitigation measures, management and monitoring plans will be
        incorporated into bid documents to ensure there will be sufficient funding for these
       activities and the environmental management will be contractual obligations to the
       contractors. Finally, short course training will be provided to all winning contractors and
       construction supervision on environmental policies and regulations, potential impacts,
       mitigation measures, daily monitoring and reporting, and emergency handling.

       Rural Road Construction

       The rural road component is located in a remote mountainous region and the construction
       will likely be conducted by local contractors. As these contractors may lack skilled
       management and operation staff and the government supervision may be weak in remote
       locations, the environmental management of the rural road construction may be poor. As
       mitigation, the local transportation bureau and winning contractors will go through an
       environmental management training program, by specialists selected and sent by Hubei
       Provincial Communications Department (HPCD). The content of the training will include
       environmental management during construction, noise and dust control, construction
       camps management, borrow pits and disposal sites reclamation, and construction safety
       and health. In addition, HPCD will strengthen its supervision during rural road
       construction through both HPCD environmental staff and its environmental consultants.
6.3 Operation Phase

       Noise

       No new school, hospital or other sensitive facilities will be allowed to build within 250 m
       from the central line of the expressway or 37 to 50        in from the central line of the


                                                18                              Shiman Expressway

EA Executive Summarv


       connecting roads to prevent noise impacts to these facilities in the future. Traffic
       management will be enforced and motor vehicles will not be allowed for speedy which
       generate excessive noise as well as safety concerns.

       Air emission

       Motor vehicle air emissions control requires integrated approach from numerous
       government agencies as well as private sector stakeholders. The province will enforce
       applicable standards for motor vehicles and fuels and implement the motor vehicle
       inspection programs to minimize the air emissions from the increased motor vehicle
       traffic on the expressway.

       Transuortation of hazardous materials

       Hubei province will set up a leading group to handle transportation of hazardous
       inaterials and emergency response in an event of a traffic accident involving trucks
       located with hazardous materials, particularly in sensitive locations such as bridges or
       other places near surface water bodies. Licensing and permitting procedures will be
       strictly enforced to control the traffic involving hazardous materials on provincial
       expressway, connecting road and rural roads network.

       Monitoring

       Extensive environmental monitoring programs will be implemented during both
       construction and operation phases (details below) to ensure that adverse environmental
       impacts are as projected during the EA and the mitigation measures proposed will be
       implemented and effective. In adequate mitigation or new adverse impacts emerged
       beyond the EA prediction will be detected by the monitoring programs promptly and
       appropriate new actions will be taken to address them.

7 Environmental Management Plan

       An environmental management plan (EMP) has been developed in a separate and stand
       alone document. The EMP includes policies basis and applicable environmental
       standards, environmental management system, mitigation measures and monitoring plans
       for both the construction and operation phases.

7.1 Objectives

       The EMP provides a framework for the implementation of mitigation measures and
       environmental management and monitoring during the Project implementation. As such,
       it represents the commitment of Project proponent as well as the governments of the
       Project area for environmental protection, pollution control and impact minimization.
       More specifically, the EMP is to:
            Set out the legal and policy framework as well as applicable environmental standards
            with which the Project will be compliance;
       0    Identify and design with sufficient details and specifics of mitigation measures for
            adverse impacts of the Project;
       0    Specify   institutional   roles  and   responsibilities  for  mitigation    measures
            implementation and environmental management during Project;
            Outlines the requirements for environmental monitoring and reporting needs; and
           Provides a stand alone document which may be used during Project implementation
           for Project supervision.

7.2Management and Supervision Organizations

       There will be two layers of organizations who will be responsible for environmental
      performance of the Project. The first is environmental management organizations
       including the Environmental Office of the Ministry of Communications, the HPCD, the
      Project Management Office (PMO) which is the Project proponent, the expressway
      company to be established which will be responsible for the expressway operation and
      various technical groups for environmental monitoring and design. The other group is the
      environmental supervisory organizations which include SEPA and Environmental
      Protection Bureaus of different levels of government in the Project region.

7.3Environmental Monitoring

      The EMP also includes environmental monitoring programs for both construction and
      operation phases. The parameters to be monitored include relocation and resettlement,
      soil erosion, noise, dust, degradation of water quality, stream sedimentation, solid waste
      disposal, and electromagnetic radiation. During the construction phase, environmental
      monitoring will be conducted in two approaches: daily and routine monitoring consisting
      of mainly visual observations and limited equipment measurements such as hand-hold
      noise meters; and periodic monitoring by professionals using standard methods
      recognized by regulatory authorities. Monitoring reports wiIl be compiled at intervals of
      once every three to four months, summarizing the findings of the monitoring. The reports
      will be submitted to project proponent as well as relevant agencies and the World Bank.
      During the operation phase, noise levels will be monitored once a month for the first six
      months and once every six months thereafter. Soil erosion will be monitored once every
      six months, while air and water quality will be monitored once a year.

Z4 Institutional Strengthening and Training

       To ensure the environmental performance of the Project, the EMP emphasizes the
       institutional building and strengthening. Besides an organizational structure involving
       various management and supervision organizations for environmental decision making,
       monitoring, reporting and fixther mitigation planning and implementation, the EMP
       includes detailed programs for personnel training. The programs involve training aboard
       and doinestically for professional, managerial and technical personnel from the
       governments, project proponent and operation units, environmental institutions and
       contractors and construction supervisions.

       The environmental training for contractors and construction supervisions will be held
       prior to the commencement of construction. The objective is to ensure that each


                                                21                           Shirnaii Expressway

8 Public Consultation and Information Disclosure

       Two rounds of public consultation have been carried out during the EA: the first round at
       the preparation of EA terms of reference (TOR) in December 2002 and the second round
       at draft EA reports between March 2003 and August 2003. Various methods have been
       used in public consultation, including public opinion surveys through questionnaires,
       public meetings at villages and with local people's representatives, and interviews with
       affected groups and individuals. The people consulted included mainly those who will be
       affected directly by the project. Relevant government and non-government organizations
       and experts on various environmental and socio-economic issues have also be consulted.

       In total, 2759 copies of a public opinion questionnaire were distributed and 2754 were
       returned. Among people surveyed, some are well aware of the Project (24.6%) or have
       some knowledge of it (75.4%). The vast majority of the people (98.9%) felt the
       expressway, as well as the connecting roads and rural roads necessary and wish to see the
       construction start as soon as possible. Of the environmental concerns, 86.5% of people
       surveyed cited noise and 41.3% concerned about dust during construction. Most of the
       affected people (84.7%) would like to see landscaping and tree planting as a measure to
       mitigate adverse impacts of the project.

       In total, 61 villages, 11 schools, two hospitals, eight local government agencies and eight
       non-government groups participated in the two rounds of public consultation. There have
       been a total of 21 public meetings and 85 group interviews. The main public concerns
       include appropriate compensation for land acquisition and resettlement and relocation,
       timely rehabilitation or restoration of damaged irrigation systems, construction safety,
       noise at schools, better access to and exits from the expressway, and sufficient passage
       ways across the expressway. For the rural roads components, besides the concerns similar
       to those listed above, the public is also concerned about road block and access to services
       during road upgrading and .student safety at the schools as connecting roads are not
       fenced, and convenient links with and access to the expressway.

      The EA team has responded the public concerns including setting up land acquisition and
      resettlement offices under HPCD to develop, supervise and implement resettlement
      action plan (RAP), developing plans for irrigation system restoration, conducting public
      education and erecting warning signs for construction safety, constructing sufficient
      passageways and crossings with provisions for pedestrians and farm vehicles (totaling
      about 1.35crossing per kin on average) to mitigate community severance impacts, install
      fences at the sensitive sections of the rural road to provide safety protection to students,
      residents and livestock, install noise insulation windows and tree planting to minimize the
      impacts of noise from the expressway and connecting roads, and provide full
      consideration to local economy and transportation needs such as appropriately locating
      access ramps/interchanges, employment opportunities during construction, etc.

      In compliance with EIA process requirements of Chinese government and the World

      records were distributed in public places along the expressway, such as libraries, book
      Bank, the completed draft EIA and EMP reports as well as part of the public consultation
      centers, etc. The concerned public can have the access to and review of the reports at
      these places. In addition, the Project information and availability of the reports were
      advertised in Hubei Daily, the provincial wide newspaper and two of the most popular
      internet web sites in the province (one of wliicli is a nation wide website). The public
      consultation and information disclosure are summarized in the tables below. The EA

EA Executive Summary


9 Conclusions

       The Shiyan to Manchuanguan expressway will play an important role in alleviating
       transportation bottleneck between provincial capital Wuhan and Yinchuan in the
       northwest province of Ningxia, promoting regional economic development, improving
       access to market and services, and the standard of living, and assisting in poverty
       alleviation. As a segment of a major transportation trunk road to northwest China, the
       expressway will also contribute to the Develop China's West program. The connecting
       roads provide a better link between some major urban areas in the Project regions to the
       expressway. The rural roads significantly improve the access of remote rural areas to
       market, services and townships and counties in all weather conditions.

       The construction and operation of the expressway will result in a number of adverse
       impacts to the physical and socio-economic environment in the Project regions. These
       impacts include permanent occupation of land, vegetation and agriculture, increased soil
       erosion, increased noise and air emissions along the expressway alignment, particularly
       in the environmentally sensitive receptors, community severance, health and safety of
       local residents, water quality and irrigation systems, and resettlement and relocations.
       Some of these impacts can be significant.

       However, with the mitigation measures designed specifically for the adverse impacts, the
       impacts will be prevented, reduced, minimized or otherwise compensated. Furthermore,
       an environmental management systems involving environmental management and
       supervision organizations, environmental monitoring, institutional strengthening and
       personnel training will be established to ensure the environmental performance of the
       Project. The appropriate implementation of the mitigation measures, as well as the
       environmental systems, the adverse impacts will be reduced to acceptable levels. The
       Project is environmentally acceptable and feasible when mitigation measures and EMP
       are.implemented effectively.
