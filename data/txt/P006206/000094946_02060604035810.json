report focuses exclusively on the\n            water supply, sanitation, community development, and health\n            education aspects of the two projects to allow\n            cross-sectoral lessons to be drawn with regard to the World\n            Bank assistance strategy in the rural water supply and\n            sanitation sector. OED rates the outcome of both the FIS II\n            water supply and sanitation components and the RWSP projects\n            as \"satisfactory\" since the FIS II project\n            combined \"substantial\" relevance, efficiacy, and\n            efficiency and the RWSP project \"high\" relevance\n            with \"substantial\" efficacy and efficiency.\n            Sustainability of both projects are rated\n            \"likely.\" World Bank performance of both projects\n            is rated \"satisfactory\" although it should be\n            noted that quality at entry of the RWSP was superior to that\n            of the FIS II. Similarly, Borrower performance for both was\n            rated as \"satisfactory.\" Two main lessons were\n            derived and recommendation made: The end of construction\n            does not end the government's responsibilities;\n            therefore, the government must create back-up regulation and\n            operational assistance to the communities. Second, rural\n            water supply and sanitation programs invariably neglect the\n            sanitation components; therefore, it is advised that a\n            national sewerage and sanitation program be prepared and implemented."}, "docdt": "2002-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
