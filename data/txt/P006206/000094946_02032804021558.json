aspects:\n            The project has left new water and sanitation systems\n            constructed with a high likelihood of continued operation.\n            Both World Bank and Borrower performances are judged to be\n            satisfactory overall. Some of the many lessons learned from\n            this project include the following: Community participation\n            is key for sustainability. Training should include both men\n            and women. Communities and municipalities have demonstrated\n            the capacity to finance a high percentage of investment\n            costs. A \"price and subsidy cap\" is an important\n            tool to force a review and reduction of costs and stretch\n            the public money to reach more people. The tendency for\n            costs to increase with each added actor is noted (consulant\n            to prefecture, to Social Investment Fund (SIF) to\n            contractor, and back to SIF). Incentives mattered in\n            enticing the SIF to consider low-cost options and reduce the\n            final costs of the sub-projects. One agency should be\n            responsible for all aspects of project implementation.\n            Reduce the number of contracts and increase the size of the\n            packages as far as possible. Propose early involvement of\n            the municipalities which have shown increasing interest and\n            capacity. Counterpart funding should be assured from the\n            outset. Simplify the process of design and system of\n            approval. Community development and training should continue\n            after construction. Increase the use of auto-construction\n            method with the help of NGOs."}, "docdt": "2002-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
