poverty in rural areas\n            by enhancing productivity through improved health conditions\n            and a more efficient use of the time saved collecting water.\n            Specific objectives include: 1) increasing the coverage and\n            sustainable use of water and sanitation services in rural\n            communities and municipalities; 2) assisting the local water\n            and sanitation units in developing the capacity to provide\n            technical assistance to municipal governments and local\n            communities; 3) supporting the sustainability of water and\n            sanitation services through extensive training of\n            community-level operators and administrators; and 4)\n            strengthening the capacity of the National Directorate of\n            Water and Sanitation (DINASBA) to formulate policies,\n            prepare technical standards, and mobilize financial\n            resources. The project consists of the following components:\n            1) rural water and sanitation infrastructure program which\n            includes 2 subcomponents: (a) water supply facilities and\n            shallow wells with hand pumps and rainwater catchments; and\n            (b) small-scale wastewater collection facilities, treatment\n            and disposal systems, and latrines; and 2) institutional\n            capacity-building program comprising 3 subcomponents: (a)\n            financing of project management to assist the institutions\n            in charge of project implementation; (b) financing of\n            technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions and\n            communities in their capacity to provide safe, reliable and\n            sustainable water and sanitation services; and (c) training\n            program that will fund training to stakeholders and\n            institutions responsible for backstopping water and\n            sanitation services."}, "docdt": "1995-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
