Somatra; and Samarinda in Kalimantan. The sub-projects in\n            the respective cities include, as appropriate, development\n            of surface or underground water sources, treatment plants,\n            pumping stations, storage tanks, transmission mains and\n            primary and secondary distribution mains including detailed\n            design and construction supervision as well as public\n            standpipes, fire hydrants and public bathhouses. The\n            sub-projects also include the provision of miscellaneous\n            equipment, stores and staff housing for the water\n            enterprises. The project would provide management and\n            technical assistance to DSE and the water enterprises (WE)\n            for implementing proposed changes in organization and\n            working procedures as well as feasibility studies for seven\n            future water supply projects."}, "docdt": "1974-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
