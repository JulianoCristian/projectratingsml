MALI
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWxAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for continuing the rehabilitation
and modernizati n of the Chemin de Fer du Malî (CFM). The objectives of the
project are to improve CFM's role in the tra;sport sector of Mali, to enable
it to satisfy the country's demand for rail transport, and to establish its
own financial viability. The proposed Credit of US$6.7 million equivalent
would be the second lending operation in Mali for railway purposes; the proj-
ect would complement the recent loan/credit made to the Senegal Railway
(Loan 835-SEN and Credit 314-SEN, US$9.6 million, June 1972), which provides
the link to the port of Dakar for a considerable proportion of Mali's inter-
national traffic.
ii.       Mali has no access to the sea, and most of its international traf-
fic is transported by rail over the Senegalese railways to and from the port
of Dakar. The alternative road/rail system through Ivory Coast to the port
of Abidjan is more costly for most of Mali's traffie, and the connections
through neighboring Guinea offer no practical alternative due to the poor
physical state of the road and railway connections of this route.
iii.      Benefits from the first railway project (Credit 95-MLI, US$9.1
million, 1966) have been achieved more slowly than originally anticipated.
The physical program is now almost complete, about three years behind sched-
ule. Progress toward the financial and traffie targets has also lagged, but
these conditions are now improving. Other commitments under the Credit have
mostly been met, but in these instances too, more slowly than originally
intended.
iv.       CFJI's poor liquidity position is due to the large volume of current
debt owed in part to the Government and in part to the Senegal Railways for
past equipment charges. The Government has agreed to take action toward
assuming these debts.
v.         CFM has produced an investment plan for 1973-76 as a successor to
its previous plan which was mainly financed by Credit 95-11LI. The new plan
forms the basis for the proposed project, and consists of continuation of
track improvements and provision of locomotives and rolling stock to meet
the forecast traffie. At present, some traffic is being diverted to the
more costly Abidjan route because of lack of capacity on CFM. Improved
operational targets are set out in a Plan of Action which has been agreed
during negotiations as part of the investment plan. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$9.3 million equivalent, including contingencies,
with a foreign exchange content of US$8.5 million. The proposed Credit
would cover the cost of foreign exchange on all items except those to be
financed by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) in the amount
of US$1.8 million equivalent.



- ii -
vi.       In order to improve its management and administration, CFM need8
consultants to advise on organization and to help in staff training for plan-
ning, management information, accounting procedures, and personnel manage-
ment; in addition, CFM will need to continue retaining technical assistance
personnel, and to intensify training schemes for other categories of staff.
Adequate provision for these services is included in the project.
vii.      The Government owns all the main transport agencies -- CFM, the
air and river transport companies, and the major trucking enterprise. Opera-
tions are coordinated through a National Transport Board attached to the
Ministry of Transport. Investment decisions are made by the Council of
Ministers. There are no major problems of road/rail competition, because
the road system caters mainly to areas not served by the railway.
viii.     The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 18%.
The financial benefits are also reasonable. The railway will not, however,
be able to realize financial equilibrium and meet all charges in the foresee-
able future, due to heavy interest charges on outstanding debt. Selective
rate increases yielding additional revenue of 8% from January 1, 1974 will
be necessary, and have been agreed upon during negotiations. The operating
ratio will then improve from 107% in 1972 to 87% in 1976. The rate of return
on average net fixed assets in use is ta be at least 2% in 1974 and 1975,
3% in 1976, and 3.5% in 1977.
ix.       The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$6.7 million to the
Government of Mali, with relending to CFM, for a term of 25 years, including
four years of grace, at an interest rate of 7-114% per annum.



MALI
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The C rerument of the Republic of Mali and the Chemin de Fer du
Mali (CFPI) have asked the Association to help finance a 1973-76 investment
plan designed to continue the physical rehabilitation of CFM's equipment,
and to improve its management, operations, and finances. The project com-
prises this investment plan, and covers track works, motive power and rolling
stock, training of staff, and reorganization of management administrative
services. The cost of the project is estimated at MF 4,300 million (US$9.3
million equivalent). The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) is
expected to finance about MF 810 million (US$1.8 million equivalent), and
an IDA Credit of about MF 3,100 million (US$6.7 million equivalent) is
proposed; the Credit will meet about 72% of the total cost of the project,
and about 79% of its foreign exchange cost. In association with the project,
a Plan of Action for improving CFPI's operations and finances is proposed.
1.02      This Credit would be the second to CFM since Mali became independent;
the first Credit (95-MLI) in 1966 amounted to US$9.1 million equivalent, 98%
of which has been spent, with the remainder to be disbursed by the end of June
1973. Prior to independence, the Mali Railway benefited from a Bank loan
(Loan 100-FR, US$7.5 million, 1954) which was made to the Office Central des
Chemins de Fer d'Outre Mer.
1.03      The Malî Railway runs from the Mali/Senegal border to Bamako, the
capital, and on to Koulikoro, on the Niger River. It once formed part of the
Dakar-Niger Railways which were operated under a single management based at
Thies in Senegal. The Mali Railway was created in 1960 by the Government
of Mali as a state-owned autonomous enterprise, taking over that part of
the net assets of the former Dakar-Niger Railways which were located in Mali,
and which comprised 38% of the total; the remaining 62% became the Senegal
Railway, operating under independent control and management.
1.04      At the time of the first railway Credit to Mali, Senegal vas granted
a credit of US$9 million equivalent for development of its railways. The
Bank Group made a second Loan/Credit to Senegal (Loan 835/Credit 314-SEN) in
1972 to carry on the rehabilitation and modernization of the Senegal Railway
in parallel with similar work for the Mali Railway. Since the two railway
systems basically form a single operating entity, the loans/credits to each
are coordinated and mutually beneficial.
1.05      International traffic through Senegal is regulated by an agreement
between the Governments of Senegal and Mali, and by a convention between the
Senegal and Mali Railways. International traffic is also facilitated by a
customs agreement between the two countries, providing for tax-free passage



-2-
of Mali goods in Senegal. Cooperation between the two railways is satis-
factory, and the convention provides an adequate and practical basis for the
regulation of international traffic. As in the case of Loan 835/Credit
314-SEN to Senegal, any substantial interruption to international traffic
between that country and Mali for other than technical reasons, or for
reasons beyond the Borrower's control, shall be an event of default of the
Credit to Mali.
1.06      The performance of CFM has improved more slowly than anticipated
under Credit 95-MLI. The physical program is almost complete, although some
three years behind schedule; as a result, progress toward achieving the fi-
nancial targets has lagged. Much of the delay was due to CFM's inexperience
and slowness in procurement procedures, and to delays by equipment suppliers.
Further, additional track material was included at a late stage in the Credit
which would account for about one year of the three referred to above. Traf-
fic has not grown as rapidly as projected as a result of recent economic
stagnation in both Senegal and Mali. Economic missions to the two countries
have however reported that both economies are again expanding, and are ex-
pected to continue to do so. 1/
1.07      Mali has also received a highway Credit for US$7.7 million equivalent
(Credit 197-MLI, 1970) for highway maintenance and feeder road construction; a
second highway Credit for road reconstruction, technical assistance, and
feasibility studies was appraised in June 1972, and is being presented to the
Board together with the present project.
1.08      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to Mali
in July 1972 consisting of Messrs. C. Buratti (Engineer), A. Mates and B. du
Parc (Economists), C. T. Vu (Financial Analyst), and J. Kesson (Consultant).
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      With an area of about 1,200,000 km2 and a population of about 5.3
million, Mali is one of the poorest countries in Africa. It has ino access
to the sea, bordering Algeria on the north, Senegal and Mauritania on the
west, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta on the south, and Niger on the east.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 1970 was approximately US$60, and
GDP growth rate in recent years was just marginally higher than the popula-
tion growth rate (2.8% p.a. vs. 2.5% p.a.). The last economic mission pro-
jected a 4-5% rate of growth of GDP for the future. Domestic production is
mainly agricultural, and the population is 90% rural. The rural population
is self-employed; this is reflected in the small number of wage and salary   2
earners in Mali, fewer than 60,000. Population density is very low (4 per km ),
mostly because of the vast desert areas.

-3-
B.   The Transport Sector
(i) General
2.02      The capital of Mali is located more than 1,200 km from the ports of
neighboring countries, a factor which implies considerable transport costs
being added to the prices of exported and imported goods. The two main interna-
tional routes (catering for some 85% of total export-import freight traffic)
are:
(a) From Bamako to the port of Dakar in Senegal -- 1,283 km,
642 km of which are in Mali. No alternative road exists
on this route which serves about 60% of total inter-
national traffic.
(b) From Bamako to the port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast --
approximately 1,230 km by road or by a road/rail combina-
tion. (A paved road leads from Bamako to Ouangolodougou,
and from there to Abidjan by rail.) Of the two alter-
native approaches to Abidjan, the road/rail combination
is the more economic. Approximately 25% of the inter-
national traffic is carried on this route which was de-
veloped to avoid total reliance on the access to the sea
through Senegal, and which provides the areas of south and
southeast Mali with a shorter route to the ocean.
The balance of 15% of export traffic is mainly with Upper Volta.
2.03      International transport consists mainly of exports of groundnuts
and cotton, and imports of fuels, foodstuffs, and consumer goods. The
greatest portion of the internal goods traffie comprises transfer of agri-
cultural products from production surplus regions to consumption regions,
and distribution of imports. Rail provides the leading international route
(average haul on the railways is about 460 km); road traffic is largely
internal. For passenger transport, which is mainly internal for both road
and rail, the average journey is 100 km and 160 km respectively on the two
modes.
2.04      The highway network comprises about 13,000 km of roads, of which
only 3,100 km provide all-weather service. Compared to other road systems ln
the region, the Mali highways are in poor condition. The length of road per
1,000 inhabitants is less thàn 2.5 km (about 4.5 km in Senegal). Only about
1,300 km are asphalted, and these are all concentrated in the Bamako-Sikasso-
Ilopti triangle; road connections to other regions (mainly Kayes and Gao) are
mere tracks. Maintenance of the system is being improved through Credit
197-MLI. Vehicle operating costs are given in Table 1. Distribution of the
highway network and other elements of Mali's transportation system are shown
in Map IBRD 2855R1.



-4-
2.05      The waterway system comprises about 1,650 km, and is navigable for
approximately seven months per year. Maintenance of the system is practically
non-existent. The most important part is the Niger river which serves as an
extension of railway services from Koulikoro to the eastern part of Mali.
A Bank mission considered improvements of the waterway system, and identified
a possible project to include the provision of tugboats, barges, workshop
facilities, navigational aid equipment, and dredging works for a total of
about US$2 million; however, the Government has not yet submitted a request
to the Bank for financing the project.
2.06      Air transport is insignificant except for international passenger
traffic. Bamako Airport is the most important of the six asphalted airatrip8
in Mali.  A new international airport financed by FED is now under construction
near Bamako. Air transport is mainly catered for by the national company Air
Mali which handles about 70% of all passenger air traffic, and about 80% of
all freight air traffic, including international traffic.
(iî) The Role of the Railway in the Transport Sector
2.07      CFM carried about 250,000 tons of imports and exports in 1971;
this figure represents about 75% of total rail freight traffic. The railway
provides the cheapest mode of transport for this international traffic. A
comparison of transport costs from the Bamako region to the ports of Abidjan
and Dakar (Table 2) proves that transport on the railway route to Dakar, com-
pared with a road/rail combination to Abidjan, is substantially cheaper for
all products. The difference in cost ranges from US$10 per ton for flour
and sugar, to US$28 per ton for petroleum products.
2.08      The railway is the only mode of transport in the western part of
Mali, providing an international passenger service twice a week from Mali to
Senegal, and a link between Bamako and Kayes (second largest city in the
country). Passenger service by road between Bamako and Kayes can be provided
only by landrovers over difficult terrain, and only for a limited period during
the year. Roads in that area are impassable for trucks. The main national
freight traffic is from the cement plant at Diamou whose expected output in
1976 is 60,000 tons (currently 40,000 tons), representing about US$3.6 million
of import substitution.
2.09      The reasonably low cost of operations on the Bamako-Dakar railway is
a result of the simple operations required, the long average haul (over 460
km), and the nature of goods transported. In 1970, total costs per ton-km
were 9.8 MF, equivalent to USé1.9. A cost study recently completed by the
French consultants SOFRERAIL recommends adjustments in the tariff structure,
notably an upward revision of tariffs for freight traffic (para. 6.10).  The
railway will, for the foreseeable future, continue to provide Mali with the
most economical mode of transport for the bulk of its traffic (Table 3).



- 5 -
C.   Transport Coordination
2.10      The Government of Mali has full control over the major companies
in the transport sector: Mali Railway, Mali Navigation Company, Mali Road
Transport Company, and Air Mali. Although these companies are responsible
for their operations, the Government decides upon their investments in infra-
structure and equipment, and maintains fixed tariff levels for all modes.
These decisions are made by the Council of Ministers, based on recommendations
from the Ministers of Transport and of Finance.
2.11      Within the Ministry of Transport, the National Directorate of
Transport (DNT) is responsible for making recommendations regarding tariffs,
and for regulating the transport entities. Enforcement of regulations and
control of rates is generally effective. DNT allocates import-export traffic
(on a weekly basis) between road and rail transport, a measure made necessary
by the shortage of railway capacity (para. 3.12). Haulage by road of import-
export transport requires authorization from the DNT, which tries to limit
it to the Government-owned enterprise. The planning of investment in infra-
structure is done mainly by the Ministry of Public Works.
2.12      There are no major problems of investment coordination, since the
road system caters mainly to areas not served by the railway (Bamako-Sikasso-
Mopti triangle). However, part of the road system serves the international
route to Abidjan which competes with the railway route to Dakar. The Govern-
ment' s policy to keep open both routes to the ocean is justified by past cir-
cumstances (disruption of traffic between Mali and Senegal during 1960-63), as
well as by the interregional traffic.
2.13      The allocation of traffic among modes is distorted by:
(a) inadequate maintenance and capacity of railway equipment; and
(b)  an outdated road tariff system (unchanged since 1967) which
does not enable road carriers to renew and expand their
vehicle fleet).
2.14      The completion of the first railway project (Credit 95-MLI), com-
bined with the proposed second project, is expected to provide CFM with suf-
ficient capacity and adequate standards of operations. The system of trucking
tariffs was reviewed with the Government during negotiations for the proposed
Second Highway Project (para. 1.07), and it was agreed that a study of the
trucking industry would be undertaken which would aim at defining a pricing
policy allowing carriers to cover the cost of their services, and would also
identify measures to improve the efficiency of road transport.
2.15      There is a third connection to the sea through Guinea, but it ls
not presently usable because of the poor physical state of the system. In
1961/62, a team from the USSR studied a possible 300 km railway link between
Bamako and Kourossa on the Guinea Railway. Apart from investmunts in the
Guinea Railways, the railway was then estimated to cost US$40 million. Al-
through the project would reduce the distance from Bamako to the sea to about



- 6 -
900 km, it does not appear economically feasible in the foreseeable future,
and the Government has no plans for pursuing the proposal. Railway invest-
ment will be limited to the agreed 1973-76 plan (para. 4.01).
3. MALI RAILWAY
A.   Organization and Management
3.01      CFM is owned by the Government, and was established by an ordinance
dated November 29, 1960, as an autonomous public enterprise to be operated on
a commercial basis.  It comes under the authority of the Minister of Transport,
Telecommunications and Tourism, who is also Chairman of the 16-member CFM
Board. The Board comprises six Ministers, the Director of Post and Tele-
communications, and nine other members representing the users, National
Assembly, and staff.
3.02      CFM has the usual departments of a railway authority; an organ-
ization chart is shown in Annex 1. Under the previous Credit 95-MLI, a
consultant was appointed to assist in formulating a reorganization of the
administration; he reviewed the management and operations of CFM, and made
several recommendations, some of which have been carried out (see Annex 2
for summary). Regarding management, the main proposals were to appoint an
assistant manager, and to establish three divisions for administration, oper-
ations, and engineering. An assistant manager has been appointed, but the
arrangement of divisions was not implemented; the latter is however not
essential, and the present arrangement can be retained. The most urgent need
is to strengthen the management administration and its staffing with trained
Malian personnel; an examination is needed to establish the requirements and
staff for planning (para 3.03), accounting and inventory control practices
(para. 3.07), statistics and management information (para. 3.11), personnel
management and commercial practices (para. 4.11). Details of these require-
ments are spelled out in the following paragraphs, and terms of reference
for the required consulting services to be financed under the proposed
Credit are given in Annex 3. These have been reviewed and agreed during
negotiations.
B.   Staff and Wages
3.03      Management and senior staff consist of two main categories; older
personnel with long experience in railways (extending from the time of the
former Dakar-Niger Railway) but with little administrative ability; and
younger men, some of good caliber, who have theoretical training but are
still in the process of acquiring practical experience. There is little
capacity for long-term planning, and much of the work in the technical depart-
ments depends considerably upon technical assistance provided from France.
Personnel providing this assistance now totals 18; the main needs at present
are in accounts, workshops, operations, training, and track works. Assur-
ances have been obtained from the Government and CFM that technical assist-
ance will be maintained at levels to be agreed with the Association from
time to time, with emphasis placed on training Malian personnel.



- 7 -
3.04      The training schemes for Malian staff which started in 1968 now
need to be extended to cover both new entrants and existing personnel, es-
pecially those progressing toward supervisory positions. The performance
of these schemes has proved satisfactory, and the training needs have been
endorsed by a recent Unesco/Bank mission. 1/ There is also a need for staff
to obtain wider experience on railways outside Mali, and it is proposed that
some senior staff be sent on technical training visits to railways with con-
ditions similar to those in Mali. Under the present Credit, the Association
proposes to support three of the four training efforts by providing: (a)
about US$130,000 for equipment in the training center for new entrants and
existing staff, as recommended by the Unesco/Bank mission; (b) about US$230,000
for consulting services aimed at improving the railway's management; and (c)
about US$50,000 for sending senior staff to training schools and railway
organizations outside Mali. The fourth program consists of on-the-job train-
ing by technical assistants, and is being supported by France. These programs
should enable Malian personnel to reach higher standards of efficiency, and
to take over an increasing share of the work presently being carried out by
the technical assistants.
3.05      Table 4 gives present staff categories and numbers.  The total num-
ber of employees is 2,180, consisting of 1,400 permanent and 780 temporary.
About 84% of the temporary staff are engaged on track maintenance, but this
proportion should decrease after 1976 upon completion of the track improve-
ments. The percentage of personnel to total working cost was 46% in 1971,
and, according to the financial forecast, is expected to remain at a reason-
able level over the period 1973-76.
3.06      Based on the average number of employees and on the traffic in 1971,
productivity was 110,000 traffic units 2/ per employee, which is comparable
to other African railways of a similar character (Cameroon 114,000, Nigeria
92,000, Sudan 123,000, East Africa 119,000). 3/  On the basis that the total
of CFM staff remains at about 2,100 through 1976, and with the traffic in-
crease forecast, productivity would rise to about 155,000 traffic units per
employee. The Plan of Action shown at Annex 4 sets this figure as the
target.
C.   Accounting and Audit
3.07      The Accounting and Finance Department consists of two sections,
one responsible for the control of receipts, the other for bookkeeping
activities; both sections report to the Chief Accountant who is assisted by
1/   Mali, Education and Development, Unesco (No. EFM/48), April 1972.

one French technical assistant. Although this simple structure has its ad-
vantages, it no longer satisfies the needs of CFM's growing operations. To
remedy this, procedures should be redefined, and the technical assistant
should devote more of his time to training local staff. (See Terms of
Reference in Annex 3).
3.08      To comply with the requirements of Credit 95-MLI, CFM's accounts
for 1965/66 through 1971 were audited by independent auditors. The reports
mention no irregularities, but call for a series of corrections and improve-
ments to accounting procedures and to inventory control. CFM has submitted
a schedule for effecting the suggested improvements, some of which have
already been implemented. It was agreed during negotiations that CFM would
submit future audit reports to the Association not later than six months
after the end of each financial year.
3.09      CFM has a fund to indemnify victims of work and traffic accidents,
and this fund has so far been adequate.  However, CFM has no insurance on
its property or stores; railways normally carry their own insurance on pro-
perty, but often insure their stores against fire and other risks. The
question of insurance is included in the consultants' terms of reference for
the management study (Annex 3).
D.   Railway Property
3.10      Track infrastructure is sound, and on completion of material re-
newal, ballasting and rail joint welding, as proposed, will be in good con-
dition. Bridges have been neglected, and a full inspection is to be completed
during 1973; the extent of repair and possibly strengthening work will then
be determined. Locomotives have also been in poor condition, but the recent
provision of new workshops and acquisition of spare parts (under Credit
95-MLI), as vell as the organization of maintenance, should ensure improve-
ment (Amnex 5). The reconstruction of telecommunications and installation
of train control equipment (alo under Credit 95-MLI) should result in im-
proved train services and car control within Mali. A brief description of
the railway traçk, structures, buildings, and equipment is given in Annex 6.
Details of locomotives and rolling stock are given in Table 5.
E.   Operations
3.11      Table 6 gives a summary of traffic operating statistics from 1966/67
to 1971, while Table 7 gives general data on CFM's operations and finances.
Little data are.available for the period pric.r to 1966/67; preparation there-
after has followed from the supervision of Credit 95-MLI, but further statie-
tical data are needed to aid management. This requireme2t is taken into
account in the proposed management study.
3.12      The critical factor in recent operations has been the poor avail-
ability of locomotives which has led to excessive operation of those kept in



service, and numerous failures in tra£fic (Annex 5). As noted above (para.
3.10), the position is improving, but for 1972 the total traffic capacity
has been about 60,000 tons below demand, resulting in diversion to the more
costly Abidjan route. In 1973, the capacity shortage may be about 30,000
tons, mainly in the first half of the year. The arrival of new locomotives
and achievement of improved availability should enable all traffic demands
to be met from late 1973 onward.
3.13      Freight car utilization is also pooI; the main need is for shunting
locomotives to reduce standing times at depots and sidings, but better train
and car control is also necessary. This should now be possible with the im-
proved telecommunications put into use in late 1972. Regarding international
traffic, Mali has little control over its cars once they are in Senegal and
at Dakar Port, and closer daily liaison is being mutually arranged between
the operating departments of the three organizations. With the introduction
of more larger-capacity cars (35 tons instead of the previous 20-25 tons),
the average load per car should increase by about 15% and, with better turn-
around, the average journey per day should increase by about 20% (Annex 7).
Proposals for a time-phased program of improved locomotive availability and
freight car productivity are set out in the Plan of Action in Annex 4, and
have been agreed with CFM.
3.14      Passenger services consist of international runs twice a week
(shared with Senegal Railways), and national services which are part railcar
and part mixed-train. There is no road toward Kayes and the Senegal frontier,
and a demand exists for improved service between Kayes and Bamako; CFM pro-
poses to provide this by means of a daily railcar service. In turn, more
accommodation will be released on the trains serving international passengers,
and also the slower, more costly mixed-train operations can be reduced
(Annex 7).
F.   Traffic
(i) Freight Traffic
3.15      Since the resumption of international operations on CFMI lines,
freight traffic has grown steadily from 194,000 tons in 1963/64 to about
324,000 tons in 1971, an average annual increase of 7.4%. In terms of ton-km,
the annual increase in the same period was 8%, with a small increase in aver-
age haul from 444 km to 463 km. This growth was reflected mainly in exports
(cotton seeds, karite 1/ products, and groundnuts), in imports of foodstuffs,
and in cement transport from the plant at Diamou.
3.16      A detailed analysis of major products transported by rail (Annex 8)
shows that in 1976 the railways are expected to carry 446,000 tons of freight,

and which is also used for soap, cosmetics, etc.



- 10 -
equivalent to 212 million ton-km (Table 8). This would represent an annual
rate of growth of 6.6% in terms of tons, and 7.1% in terms of ton-km, both
slightly lower than in the past. The traffic forecast extends to 1978, two
years beyond the investment plan, and for the last two years the rate of
growth is about 5.5%. Over 55% of the total projected increase is attributed
to cement (in national traffic), groundnuts and by-products (in exports), and
petroleum (in imports).
3.17      The traffic projection was compared with the results of a macro-
economic model (Annex 9) which uses GDP and average revenue per ton-km (all
in constant prices) for the period 1964-1971 as explanatory variables of
traffic growth. The model indicates that, in order to achieve the result6
of the commodity analysis together with a rate increase of 8% (para 6.11),
GDP should grow by 3.6% annually; such a rate is however somewhat below that
forecast for the country.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.18      Up to 1967, traffic increased in ternms of passengers and pass-km on
both national and international lines (about 8.5% p.a. and 12% p.a. respective-
ly). Since 1967, however, CFM has been losing national passenger traffic
mainly on short distances, resulting in an increase of average haul. Over
that same period, international passenger traffic remained constant in terms
of passengers, and increased in terms of pass-km, also reflecting an increase
in the average journey. The poor service and inadequacy of the equipment (in
mid-1972 an occupancy factor of well over 100% was recorded on express trains)
contributed considerably to the slowdown in growth of passenger traffic. The
capacity and service offered to passengers is expected to improve following
the placing in service in late 1972 of new passenger coaches accuired under
Credit 95-MLI, and with four new coaches and two new railcars, a1l operating
between Bamako and Kayes, as proposed in the Plan. Passenger traffic is
expected to grow annually until 1976 at about 6% on national and international
lines (Table 9).
Tariffs and Costs
3.19      CFM's tariff system is basically the same as that of the pre-1960
French West African Railways. It is based on average distance for each
major commodity, with higher rates for national than for international traf-
fic. The tariffs were increased in 1967 (30%) to offset the devaluation,
and again in 1970 (10%); but international rates in Mali are lower than in
Senegal, because the rates were not fully adjusted after the devaluation.
Passenger rates are fixed at MF 8.30 per pass-km on first-class and MF 5.60
on second-class for national traffic, and MF 10 and MF 7 respectively for
international trains. Except for 1971, rate increases generally kept pace
with the average rate of inflation; but the overall tariff level was still
relatively low.
3.20      Average freight revenue has been increasing from MF 6.8 per ton-
km in 1964/65 to MF 9.7 per ton-km in 1971 (Table 10). The start of cement
transport from the Diamou Plant in 1970 has also contributed to the increase



- il -
in average receipts in that year, since cement productioni was carried at a
high rate. The Government decided in 1972, however, to reduce the tariff
on Diamou cement from MF 14.9 per ton-km to MF 12.3 per ton-km, which is
still well above fully distributed costs.
3.21      Passenger traffic also shows an upward trend in receîpts per unit-
km; these receipts rose from MF 3.8 per pass-km in 1964/65 to MF 6.0 per
pass-km in 1971 (7% annual increase in current prices equivalent to about
2% in real prices). This was entirely due to tarîff increases in 1967 and
in 1970.
3.22      Cost and revenue data for 1970, broken down into major traffic
components, are given in Table 10. The comparison shows that there are no
major distortions in the tariff system. Full costs are covered in most
categories, except for international passenger traffic, and traffic from
Koulikoro to Bamako (about 1% of total traffic); the latter category does
not even cover marginal costs. In their recently completed study, consult-
ants SOFRERAIL (France) propose certain changes in the tariff structure in
order to simplify the system, to relate tariffs more closely to costs, and
to increase revenues. The major recommendation is to introduce a unified
tariff system for national and international freight traffic, with rates
fixed primarily as a decreasing function of distance. Based on 1970 figures,
the changes recommended would produce an estimated increase in revenues of
about 8%. During negotiations, the consultants' recommendations were re-
viewed with the Government and CFM, and it was agreed that selective changes
would be made and a new tariff structure would be introduced not later than
January 1, 1974. The tariff changes would be such as to yield an 8% increase
in revenues.
4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      CMI produced a 1970-75 investment plan of about US$8.0 million
equivalent as a successor to the plan prepared in 1964 which was financed
mainly by Credit 95-MLI. However, the proposed plan lacked adequate technical
data, detailed estimates, and economic justification. Also, the Association
thought it premature to consider a new plan until expenditure on Credit
95-MLI was nearer completion, and until some of the equipment provided was
more fully utilized, and the most important lending conditions complied with.
During the past year, progress has been made on all these aspects (see Annex
10 for summary of compliance with conditions of Credit 95-MLI), and CFM has
prepared a revised investment plan for 1973-76 on the basis of recent traffie
forecasts. This revised plan amounts to MF 4,300 million (US$9.3 million
equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of about MF 3,900 million
(US$8.5 million equivalent). The plan is set out in Table 11, with notes



- 12 -
on its various items given in Annex 7. CFM has agreed at negotiations to
review the plan at least annually. Also, in view of its tight financial
situation, CFM has agreed that, except for small items of miscellaneous
equipment not exceeding US$150,000 equivalent per annum, investments will
be limited to those included in the plan, unless the Association agrees
otherwise. In parallel with investment, targets for operational improve-
ments are set in the Plan of Action (para. 4.20).
B.   The Proiect
4.02      While the investment plan is designated as covering the period
1973-76, most of the foreign exchange will be committed in 1973-74, with
only minor amounts remaining in 1975-76; local expenditure for completion
of track and building works will continue through 1976. The plan consists
essentially of:
(a) track and buildings: MF 1,155 million (US$2.5 million), for
items including (i) equipment for and renewal of 21 .5 km of
track; (ii) ballasting of 210 km of line; (iii) joint weld-
ing of 380 km of rails; and (iv) minor repairs to bridges;
(b) rolling stock: MF 2,455 million (US$5.3 million), consisting
of 4 main line locomotives; 5 shunting locomotives; 2 rail-
cars; 8 trailers; 4 passenger coaches; 125 freight cars; and
apare parts for rolling stock;
(c)  management:  MF 300 million (US$0.6 million) for equipment for
accounts/statistics, consulting services, and training; and
(d)  contingencies:  M  400 million (US$0.9 million) for physical
and price contingencies.

4.03      Renewal of track material is being carried out, under Credit 95-MLI,
on 71 km of track out of a total of 88.5 km between Kayes and the Senegal
border. The proposed second project includes the balance of 17.5 km, plus
the replacement of 4 km of worn material on a sharply curved and graded sec-
tion near Bamako. This will complete major track renewals required on CFM
f or some years ahead.
4.04      Provision is also made for stone ballast, where lacking, over some
210 km of track, and for welding of rail joints on sections totaling about
380 km. These works will: (a) improve track strength, (b) prolong life of
track material, (c) reduce maintenance costs on track and on rolling stock,
and (d) enable higher average speeds.
4.05      Track maintenance equipment is included mainly to build up stocks of
spares for existing mechanical ballast tampers, to provide small mechanized
tools, and to make available railcars for transport of men and material, all
to improve standards of maintenance and reduce costs.
4.06      Maintenance of bridges has been neglected for many years; FAC has
provided funds for a physical examination and for a check on bridge strengths
against existing and possible future loadings. An allocation has been in-
cluded for minor repairs, and for some strengthening if necessary. Reports
and cost estimates on major repairs are expected to be available in 1973.
4.07      The existing traffic yard at Bamako is adjacent to the passenger
and freight yards; it is awkward to operate and is crossed at one end by
a main road. Allowance is made for a new yard, including earthworks and the
first phase of track works, to permit easier operations and to save time
expended in car and shunting locomotives.
4.08      A review of future train service requirements to meet the traffic
forecast, and of the prospective availability and utilization of locomotives,
shows the provision to be justified of four additional main line locomotives,
two additional shunting locomotives (plus the replacement of three existing
units not now operational), two additional railcars (plus eight trailer cars),
and four additional passenger coaches. The main line locomotives are to be
of 1,200 hp, similar in type to existing units which allow maximum flexibility
and ease of maintenance and provision of spares. The new shunting locomotives
are to be of 400 hp to allow handling of larger, heavier freight cars. The
railcars at 850 hp are also to be larger than the existing units to allow for
hauling four or five trailer cars on an increased regular service between
Kayes and Bamako. The passenger coaches will complete the Mali train require-
ments for the international Bamako-Dakar connection (eight coaches have
already been provided under Credit 95-MLI).
4.09      Spare parts are included to continue the buildup of spares and
replacement units (such as diesel and electric motors) which are essential
for obtaining regular maintenance, reducing workshop time, and improving the
availability of units.



- 15 -
4.10      Some 70 freight cars are between 40 and 55 years old, in poor
condition, and not suited to regular use on long-distance freight service as
required between Dakar and Bamako; it is proposed to replace these with larger
capacity cars (35 tons instead of 20-25 tons) which have roller bearings and
improved brake gear. In addition, to carry the increased traffic of oils
and general cargo, and also to cater for the track ballasting program, a
total of 55 additional freight cars is proposed.
4.11      Provision is made for consultants to carry out an examination of
CFM management requirements and to introduce new procedures and equipment
for planning, statistics, and management information, accounting services,
storekeeping, and personnel management. The consultants will also be asked
to advise on improvement of the commercial section. Terms of reference for
these services as agreed with CFM are given in Annex 3.
4.12      Simple training schemes exist for new appointees and for present
staff of CFI4, but improved facilities are needed for extension of these courses
Allowance is made for equipment in accordance with a scheme prepared by CFM
and endorsed by a recent Unesco/Bank mission (para. 3.04). In addition,
allowance is made for providing training overseas for senior Malian staff
(three or four persons a year for three to six months each over a two-year
period).
4.13      The cost estimates for track material are based on recent (late
1971) prices quoted for the last section of renewal under Credit 95-MLI;
figures for ballasting and rail joint welding are based on recent quotations
to CFM for the equipment, and on CFM estimates for local cost; locomotive
costs are based on figures negotiated between CFM and FAC for French supply;
1972 international bidding prices have been used for the freight cars and
estimated international prices for passenger cars. Contingencies have been
allowed for as follows: 10% physical contingencies on all local costs, and
10% price contingencies on foreign and local costs for CFM, and IDA-financed
items for 1973, with an additional 5% per annum for the years 1974 through
1976. (Conventions have been signed and orders placed for FAC-financed items).
C.   Financing of the Project
4.14      The proposed Credit of US$6.7 million will meet about 72% of the
total cost of the project. It will finance 79% of the foreign exchange cost,
with the balance (for four main line and two shunting locomotives and spares)
to be met by FAC, and the local cost of MF 400 million (US$0.8 million equiv-
alent or 9% of the total cost) by CFM.  The following table summarizes the
financing of the project:

4.15      CFM is seeking Canadian financing for the management consulting
services; if this is obtained, the amount allowed in the Credit for this
purpose (about US$0.23 million equivalent) will be made available for other
uses (para. 4.19).
D.   Execution. Procurement, and Disbursement
4.16      CFM is competent to carry out the project.  Track renewal, ballast-
ing, and rail joint welding will be performed by CFM's own forces which have
acquired adequate experience during execution of the previous project, and
which produce good quality work. Construction of the new Bamako yard will
also be done by CFM's staff and by local contract for the earthworks. Ar-
rangements for bridge repairs will depend upon the extent and specialization
found necessary after receipt of the technical reports.
4.17      The Government relieved CFMl of duties levied on imports for goods
financed under Credit 95-MLI, and it has confirmed that this policy will be
continued for this second Credit. The Senegal Government follows a similar
policy with respect to Loan 835/Credit 314-SEN.
4.18      Procedures of international competitive bidding will be followed for
purchase of imported track material and equipment for ballasting, rail joint
welding, and maintenance, as well as for three shunting locomotives, railcars,
trailers, passenger coaches, and freight cars. The four main line and two
shunting locomotives, to be financed by FAC, are being purchased in France.
4.19      Disbursements will be made on the cost of imported equipment and
materials at the Mali frontier, as well as on the foreign cost of consultant
and technical services and training. The estimated quarterly and annual
rates of disbursement are given in Table 12. It is proposed that any savings
on items financed by the Credit should be used to finance the foreign exchange
cost of similar items which might be considered necessary during subsequent
reviews of the plan; this will be subject to review and agreement with the
Association.
E.   Plan of Action
4.20      In order to achieve the full potential benefits of the investment
plan.and to enable CFM to reach financial equilibrium in 1974, a Plan of



- 17 -
Action has been agreed between the Governnent, CFM, and tle Association dur-
ing negotiations. This plan outlines measures which CFM should adopt to im-
prove operations, particularly those of locomotives and freight cars; to im--
prove staff productivity; to introduce a cost-related pricing policy with
a simplified tariff system; to increase income by general and selective
tariff increases; and to cover all working costs, adequate depreciation, and
all financial charges. The lines of action proposed by the Association are
included in the relevant sections of this report and are shown at Annex 4.
During negotiations, agreement on the content of this annex should be reached
with the Government and CFM.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The 1973-76 investment plan is partly a continuation of the track
improvement plan financed under Credit 954I-M, and partly an equipping of CFM
with replacement and additional rolling stock to carry the traffic forecast
to 1976. For the economic evaluation, it was assumed that the traffic beyond
1976 would stay constant at its level for that year. This assumption is
conservative, since the traffic forecast (Table 7) shows that the upward trend
is expected to continue beyond 1976.
B.   Economic Benefits of the Plan
5.02      The investment in the railwav during the plan period will enable it
to provide better service for import-export traffic to the western and central
parts of Mali, areas for which rail is the cheapest mode of transport (Table
2), as well as for goods and passengers transported between Bamako and the
western regions and Senegal which are served onlv by the railways.
5.03      The economic evaluation compares the two most economic routes for
export-import transport: transport on the Mali Railway to Dakar, and the
road/rail connection to Abidjan (Table 2). The railway connection to Guinea
was not considered because it requires a large investment in Mali, and exten-
sive improvemients on the Guinea railway which is at present unsuitable for
carrying heavy traffic in large quantities; such a project does not appear
economically feasible in the foreseeable future. The comparison shows that
transport costs on the Abid.jan route exceed those of the alternative route
by about US$13.8 per ton on average. The difference in costs between the
twqo routes stems mainly from the higher cost of road transport, and the addi-
tional unloading at Ouangolodougou that occurs when using the road/rail com-
bination to Abidjan.  The total traffic forecast for the Mali Railway in
1976 is about 445,000 tons, and the maximum expected capacity of the railways
before undertaking the investments proposed in the project is 355,000 tons
(1971 transport was about 325,000 tons).  Benefits of the new investment
plan originate from the avoidance of diverting traffic to the more costly
Abidjan route. These benefits yield a satisfactory 18% rate of economic
return on the investment plan.



- 18 -
5.04      The above rate of return underestimates the economic benefits of
the investment plan for the following reasons:
(a) road transport operating costs were taken into account exclusive of
infrastructure costs, and used only heavy (22 ton) vehicle operat-
ing costs on paved roads, thus underestimating present road costs;
(b)  any lack of capacity on the railways might affect national trans-
port, and would mainly result in lack of transport for local
production froin Kayes (para. 2.08); this element was not taken
into account in computing the rate of economie retutn;
(c)  tie comparison does not take into account the difference in sea
transport cost from Europe to Dakar and to Abid-lan, the latter
being 20% higher.
C.   Sensitivity Analysis
5.05      The rate of growth of future freight traffic was reduced to 5% per
annum (significantly lower than that experienced in the past).  Under this
condition, the benefits of the investment plan would materialize fully only
in 1978. The rate of economic return would be reduced to 15%. An increase
of 10% in cost of transport in Senegal (both port charges and rail rates)
while prices in Ivory Coast remain constant, would reduce the rate of economic
return to 16%. Thus, even under adverse conditions, the rate of economic
return is still satisfactory.
D.   Evaluation of Various Components of the Investment Plan
General
5.06      Although the investment plan is justified as a whole, an examina-
tion was made to see if, and at what cost, some of its components could be
substituted without affecting the level of traffic to be carried in the
future. (Locomotives and freight cars could not be substituted, and there-
fore a separate rate of return was not calculated for these items.)
Way and Works
5.07      Track renewal and other works serve three main purposes:  (a) to
increase the life of rails; (b) to reduce maintenance costs of rolling stock;
and (c) to decrease turn-around time. The costs of this item were compared
with an alternative of maintaining existing rail at higher maintenance and
renewal costs, and larger requirements for equipment.  The resulting rate of
economic return on this item is about 14%.
Tank Cars
5.08      To cater for additional petroleum traffic, there are two alterna-
tives for CFM: (a) use rented equipment from a private transport company,



- 19 -
Compagnie Africaine des Transports (CAT); or (b) buy additional tank cars (10
are proposed in the investment plan). CFM proposes to follow the latter
course, which is reasonable; and assuming that CFM will charge the same rate
as CAT (80 CFAF per hectoliter Dakar-Bamako), the rate of financial and
economic return will be about 15% (after allowing for maintenance costs).
Passenger Railcars and Trailers
5.09      The increase in passenger traffic over the period 1972-76 is estimated
at about 150,000 passengers, and should be met by purchase of four passenger
coaches for the international train, and two railcars (each hauling four
trailers) to operate daily between Bamako and Kayes. The latter equipment
will also release additional capacity needed for international traffic and
currently tied to services between Bamako and Kayes. For the economic
analysis, it is impossible to find any alternative investment, since no
adequate road exists. Therefore, revenues were taken as a minimum economic
benefit of the service; and although omitting the consumer surplus, the rate
of return on this item is 12% which is considered satisfactory.
E.   Low Density LUnes
5.10      The Bamako--Koulikoro section (58 km) carries only 30,000 tons, com-
pared with at least 250,000 tons on other sections of the railway; this re-
sults in high unit costs of transport on the section. Total freight revenues
on the line and generated by it in 1970 were MF 123.4 million, while total
freight costs for the traffic (including marginal costs incurred on other
lines by the generated traffic) were MF 147.6 million, leaving a financial
loss of MF 24 million (US$52,000).
5.11      An alternative of using road transport for freight from Koulikoro
to Bamako, and transfer at Bamako from road to rail transport proves to be of
the same cost as the railways. For 30,000 tons in 1970, total costs on the
line (for freight) were HF 84 million, while cost of transport by road, in-
cluding cost of transfer, would amount to MF 83 million.  This amount under-
estimates the real costs, which should also comprise the costs of the follow-
ing:
(a)  additional storage in Bamako;
(b)  damage to goods in transferring from road to rail; and
(c)  delay caused in shipping time.
In addition, traffie on the line is expected to increase by about 20,000 tons
in 1976, and by much more if there is any improvement on river transport from
Koulikoro. This additional traffic would reduce costs significantly, and
there is consequently no economic justification for closing the line.

6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      CFM had operating losses for several years since its creation,
but the situation improved gradually until 1971. Details of revenue and
expenses over the recent past from July 1965 to December 1971 appear in
Table 13. CFM operating revenues covered working expenses in 1967/68 and
1969, and covered operating expenses (including depreciation charges) in
1970 and 1971. Between 1966 and 1971 revenues doubled; operating coste
increased but only by about 50Z, and the operating losses dropped. This
trend was reversed in 1972 due to shortage of traction in the early part
of the year and its consequent effect on rail traffic. It is however ex-
pected to improve in 1973 as improved maintenance facilities and procedures
become effective.
B.   Present Situation
(i) Actual operating results
6.02      Table 13 shows CFM's income statements from July 1, 1965 to Decem-
ber 31, 1971 (excluding the period July-December 1968 when the financial year
was changed to coincide with the calendar year). The income statements are
summarized as follows:

/2   Projections made by the Association during appraisal of project financed
by Credit 95-MLI.
6.03      Over the past six years, income rose at an average of about 14%
per year, resulting essentially from a rise in freight traffic with a shift
toward higher value commodities carried, and also from two tariff increases
(para. 3.19) which were the only ones in the last 12 years. Of total revenue
in 1971, freight traffic accounted for about 70%, and international traffic
for about two-thirds of total revenue, thus reflecting the importance of the
Railway in export-import trade of Mali.  On the expenditures side, working
costs inereased at about 7% p.a., resulting mainly from rising costs of
materials (most of which are imported); personnel costs remained fairly
constant however, accounting for about 50% of total working costs. This
performance is considered satisfactory, and due credit should be given to
CFM for its effort to control costs. After allowing for deprecîation,
which had been increased after an asset revaluation in 1969 to a level
considered adequate, the operating ratio decreased from 127% in 1965/66
to 97% in 1971. These ratios reflect a steady progress achieved by CFM,
but not as substantial as the level projected at the time of the previous
Credit appraisal. This is largely because traffic did not grow as fast as



- 22 -
forecasted, and the slow implementation of the First Railway Project fi-
nanced under Credit 95-MLI, delayed the benefits from these investments.
(ii) Summary Balance Sheet
6.04       CFM's condensed balance sheet data for the years 1965/66 to 1971
are given in Table 14, and the data for 1971 summarized below:
As of December 31, 1971
1F Million
Assets
Current assets                               1,778,2
Net fixed assets                            10,821.5
Total assets                             12,599.7
Liabilities
Current liabilities                          2,140.8
Long-term debt                               3,755.5
Equity                                       6,703.4
Total liabilities and equity             12,599.7
Ratios
current assets/current liabilities               0.8
Debt/equity                                    36/64
Current liabilities which exceeded current assets included the
following:
(a) MF 607.3 million due to the Government for accumulated and
unpaid interest charges and commission on the proceeds of
Credit 95-MLI relent to CFM;
(b) MF 181 million in accumulated taxes collected by CFM
on behalf of Governnent, but not transferred to it; and
(c) MF 540 million due to Senegal Railways for the use of
interchanged equipment.
Concerning items (a) and (b) above, CFM had requested the Government to
allow it to exchange these against the past net losses for which CFM claims
contributions from the Government under Article 19 of its Statutes (the
amount of such undisbursed subsidies as of December 31, 1971 was MF 1,583.6
million). This matter was discussed during negotiations. Goverrnment and



- 23 -
CFM indicated that items (a) and (b) above have now been adjusted against
the Governiment contributions to CFM, in the account for 1972. As regards
item (c), CFM started repaynent in June 1972 to Senegal Railways according
to a schedule which covers payment of MF 150 million in 1972, MF 200 million
in 1973 and MF 190 million in 1974. Government is now reimbursing MF 150
million to CFM, and adjusting this amount against Government contributions
for the past losses of CFM. CFM's balance sheet as of December 31, 1971
shows that the receivables, at MF 980.4 million, were high. Some improve-
ments in the procedures have been effected recently and the position improved.
6.05      The only long-term debt included in the Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 1971 was the proceeds of Credit 95-MLI relent by Government
to CFM. The Association and Government previously agreed that repayment
by CFM to Government originally due from January 1970 should be deferred
till 1972, because the Credit had not been fully disbursed and CFM's fi-
nancial situation was tight. Acknowledging these difficulties, which per-
sisted in 1972, Government has deferred repayment until 1973. It was also
indicated by Government during negotiations that in view of CFM's financial
situation and the implementation of higher tariffs from 1974 only, the Gov-
ernment would adjust the payments due from CFM to Government from the years
1972 and 1973 in respect of Credit 95-MLI and the taxes, against the Gov-
ernment' s contribution towards the losses of CFM.
(iii) Future Prospects
6.06      A forecast of CFM's revenues and expenditures appears in Table 12
and is summarized below:
MF Million

- 24 -
6.07      The forecast above is based on the freight and passenger traffic
projections (paras 3.17 and 3.18) and takes account of the recent (1973)
changes in staff wage levels. It has also been assumed that material price
levels and staff wage levels will rise at 5% per annum during 1974-1977.
Expences on car rental from Senegal Railways are assumed to practically cease
after 1973, since better control of car interchange movements and increase
in CFM's car fleet will make reliance on borrowed equipment almost unnecess-
ary.  Financial charges will increase as Credit 95-MLI is fully disbursed, and
additional borrowings will be made during the project period 1973-1976. On
the revenue side, forecasts incorporate the effect of tariff adjustments
from January 1974 that Government and CFM have agreed to implement (so as
to result in an 8% increase in revenue); additional revenues needed during
1976 and 1977 by further adjustments have been shown separately in Table 13
(these additional revenues will be required to achieve the financial targets
referred to in para 6.08).
6.08      Government and CFM desire to keep tariff increases on Malt Rail-
ways ta a minimum, particularly in view of the importance of the Railways
in imports and exports and in the economy in general. On the other hand, the
Railways are not required to make a contribution to Government. The question
in regard to the financial objectives for CFM was discussed during negotiations,
and it was agreed that CPM and the Government would take all such steps
(including, but not limited to adjustment of tariffs) as shall be required
to provide revenue sufficient to cover operating expenses, taxes if any,
debt service, and a reasonable portion of its capital investments including
replacement of assets. In order to achieve this, it was agreed during
negotiations that CFM would earn rates of return of at least 2% in 1974
and 1975, 3% in 1976, and 3.5% in 1977. The forecasts above show that these
targets can be achieved. Under the forecasts, the financial situation of
CFM would progressively improve, and the internally generated funds -
amounting to MF 1,070 million in 1977 - would be adequate to fully cover
maximum debt service requirements of MF 721 million (reached in 1978) and
provide funds for investment needs. (The investment needs of CFM after 1977
are expected to be relatively lower since a large part of the track has
already been renewed).
6.09      Cash flow data for the period 1973-1977 are given in Table 15 and
the debt service payments are detailed in Table 16. The position in respect
of the period 1973-1977 is summarized below.

6.10      The forecast summary balance sheets for the years 1972-1977 are
given in Table 14. The forecasts show a significant improvement in CFM's
situation, with the ratio of current assets/current liabilities improving
from 1.6 in 1973 to 4.3 in 1977. The debt/equity ratio will however rise
to 48/52 in 1976 and 1977. In view of the substantial debt of CFM and the
rise in debt service charge (which will reach a peak of about MF 721 mil-
lion in 1978), there is need to keep a careful watch on the debt situation.
It was agreed during negotiations that CFM would get the Association's agree-
ment before incurring any debt if its net cash revenue for the fiscal year
or the 12 consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence,
whichever is greater, would be less than 1.25 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all its debt including the
debt to be incurred.
7. AGREEMENTS REAC1-ED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of
Mali and CFM on the following principal items:
(a)  terms of reference for consultants for management improvement
(para. 3.02);
(b)  implementation of new tariff system, and increasing revenue by
at least 8%, from January 1, 1974 (para. 3.22);
(c) limitation on changes, except for minor items not to exceed
US$150,000 equivalent per year, to CFM's 1973-76 investment
plan (para. 4.01);
(d) the Plan of Action for improvements in CFM's operations and
finances (para. 4.20);
(e) settlement of debts between the Government and CFM (para 6.04);
and
(f) a limitation on future CFM debt (para. 6.10).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$6.7
million equivalent to the Government of the Republic of Mali, with re-lending
to CFM, for a term of 25 years, including four years of grace, at an interest
rate of 7-1/4% per annum.

Plan of Action
Introduction
The physical and financial rehabilitation of CFM has been of con-
cern to the Borrower. It is the aim of the Borrower to enable and assist
CFM to carry out its physical rehabilitation and to achieve financial viabi-
lity so as to permit it to meet all operating expenses (including adequate
allowances for depreciation and renewal funds) and debt service obligations
out of internally generated funds, and to make a contribution toward its
investment needs. The Borrower and CFM intend to implement the following
measures with the objective of enabling CFM to fulfill its appropriate
economic role, to complete its physical rehabilitation, and to achieve
financial viability.
Operations
(a) CFM will take all necessary steps to improve its operat-
ing efficiency and to achieve the following targets by fiscal years 1974
and 1976:

2.        Average availability has been poor, and those locomotives that were
available for service were operated continuously. Lack of regular maintenance
led in turn to increasing locomotive failures in traffic. The result was
that, for the first three months of 1972, only three or four BB1100/1200
locomotives were available (average 38%), against a normal service requirement
of seven (see Annex 7), and much of the traffic from Dakar could not be carried.
3.        The position has begun to improve with:  (a) the bringing into use
of the new workshops at Bamako; (b) spare parts ordered in 1970/71 starting
to arrive (the time fromu initial requisition to delivery at Bamako may be up
to two years); and (c) the organization of maintenance by the French technical
assistance staff. About five or six locomotives were expected to become avail-
able during early 1973 (availability about 62%); a seventh locomotive should
also then become available as a result of the return to service of a unit
damaged by fire in April 1971 (about 75% availability).  Two new GM locomo-
tives purchased on supplier's credit were scheduled for delivery in March
1973; two new BB1200 locomotives financed by FAC are expected in the last
quarter of 1973, and a further two, also FAC financed, during 1974. By late
1973, the backlog of maintenance should have been overcome and in 1974, all
traffic requirements should be met with a locomotive availability of 75-80%.
CFM intends to start withdrawing their old BB1100 locomotives from full main-
line service in 1975-76.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
4.        The position with regard to shunting locomotives and railcars has
also been poor, but the main backlog of maintenance should be overcome by
early 1973. However, spare parts cannot now be obtained for the three BDR
150 HP shunters, and they should therefore be written off and replaced. CFM
hopes to restore the two BB 500 HP locomotives to limited service, but again,
spares are becoming difficult to obtain; the units may soon have to be
scrapped.
5.        Because of the original complete lack of spare parts and spare
units, the initial lack of knowledge by CFM concerning inventory prepara-
tion, and the long delivery periods, it is taking time to build up stocks.
Another complicating factor is that while the nine BB 1100/1200 mainline
locomotives are basically of the same type, they were supplied over a period
of ten years and consist of three different models, involving, to some ex-
tent, different spares. In 1971/72, about US$390,000 equivalent worth of
spares was ordered under Credit 95-MLI; about another US$50,000 of spares
is being financed by FAC, while about US$100,000 of spares for the new
BB 1200 locomotives is included in the most recent FAC tranche of financing.
From a review made by CFMl and the French technical assistance staff, there
is a need for further "capital" spare units to a total of about US$200,000
equivalent to speed up intermediate and general repairs, and also to have
available against accidental damage. Provision for this is accordingly
proposed in the 1973-76 investment plan. Spares required for normal main-
tenance, after the provision of initial stocks, should be financed by CFM
from its annual operating budgets.

MALI
MALI RAILWAY
Brief Description of Railway Property
Tracks and Structures
1.        The single-track meter-gauge Mali Railway (CFM), 642 km long, was
built between 1881 and 1906 to connect Kayes on the Senegal River to Bamako
and Koulikoro on the Niger River. Later, in 1924, it was connected to the
Dakar-St. Louis Railway to form the Dakar-Niger Railway.  The track material
between Kayes and Bamako was relaid prior to 1960, while 71 km of the 88.5 km
between Kayes and the Senegal border is being relaid under Credit 95-MLI.
Released second-hand material is being used to replace light material
(20 kg/m rail) in poor condition between Bamako and Koulikoro. It is pro-
posed to relay the balance of track between Kayes and the Senegal border
under the proposed second Credit, after which the whole of CFM will be pro-
vided with 30 kg/m rail on steel sleepers in good condition.
2.        Stone ballasting and rail joint welding is being carried out along
with the relay. Some 210 km of track still lack ballast, and some 380 km are
to be joint-welded. Both are proposed in the second Credit and when com-
pleted should, together with the track renewal, provide CFM with a sound
track requiring little major work (apart from some makeup ballast near Bamako).
3.        There are four major bridges and  about 39 other smaller spans
whose maintenance has been neglected for many years. CFM has obtained a
grant from FAC under which the four major bridges were examined by SNCF en-
gineers in 1971; the other bridges are to be examined by SOFRERAIL in 1973.
The bridges are to be checked for carrying capacity, and CFM proposes that
they should all be strengthened (if not adequate at present) to carry heavier
diesel locomotives in the future. It is doubtful if such strengthening is
needed on CFM, but the question should be decided once the report on the
bridges is available.
4.        Telecommunication wiring has been renewed, and new train control
equipment has been provided under Credit 95-MLI which should meet operating
needs for some years ahead.  Signaling equipment is of simple design, but is
adequate for the number of trains and the speeds in force.
5.        New workshops have been provided at Bamako under Credit 95-MLI,
and with possibly minor additions, particularly of equipment, should meet
CFM needs for some years. Buildings at Bamako are adequate, but wayside
buildings are mostly in poor condition due to lack of proper maintenance.

Main line diesel locomotives, small        =       2
Shunting diesel locomotives                        7
Railcars, diesel                           =       3
Passenger cars, trailers, vans                    39
Freight cars--CFM                                317
Freight cars--privately owned tank         =      37
7.        All the locomotives and railcars have lacked proper maintenance
in the past; as a result, many units are in poor condition. The opening
of the new workshops at Bamako at the end of 1971 and the provision of
spares during 1972 should improve the position in 1973. Spares cannot
now be obtained, however, for three of the shunting locomotives (16 years
old), and it is also unlikely that the two small mainline locomotives
can be kept in use much longer. Their replacement has therefore been
allowed for in the proposed second project.
8.        Eight new passenger restaurant and baggage cars were provided
under Credit 95-MLI; these are for use on the twice-weekly international
passenger trains between Bamako and Dakar (shared with Senegal Railways),
and have recently gone into service. The ages of the remaining passenger
cars vary between 20 and 47 years; their condition is generally poor but,
with the new workshops, CPI should be able to overhaul and improve some of
these cars. Four additional new passenger cars are proposed to complete
the Mali international train set, and CFM proposes to increase also the
railcar and trailer fleet to cater for increasing national passenger traf-
fic, mainly between Kayes and Bamako.
9.        CFM has 317 freight cars, and there are also 37 privately-
owned tank cars for petroleum traffic. The general condition Qf freight
cars is reasonable, but about 70 are over 40 years old and in poor condi-
tton; CFM proposes to replace these by new larger-capacity cars of modern
design, suited to the long-haul traffic between Dakar and Bamako.

MALI RAILWAY
Investment Plan 1973-1976
Track
1.        Under Credit 95-MLI, 71 km of track material (out of a total of
88.5 km) between Kayes and the Senegal border is being renewed with 30 kg/m
material. There will thus remain a balance of 17.5 km to complete the relay-
ing of the section. In addition, there are 4 km of track on sharp curves,
near Bamako, which are in poor condition and should be replaced. A total
of 21.5 km of 30 kg/m track material is therefore included in the 1973-76
investment plan to complete relaying on CFM. Only minor annual material
replacements should then be required for a number of years to come.
2.        Stone ballast is lacking on about 210 km of main line track be-
tween Kayes and Toukoto, while lesser amounts are needed for about 280 km
between Toukoto and Bamako.  Rail joint welding has been carried out on
110 km of track (and is being provided on the relaid track on the Kayes-
Senegal border); there remains about 380 km of joint welding to be done.
Both ballasting and joint welding should be pursued to: (a) improve the
track strength, (b) prolong the life of the track material, (c) reduce
maintenance costs on track and also on the rolling stock, and (d) enable
higher average speeds to be obtained. CFM proposed to establish its own
quarry at Toukoto to produce ballast at a cost reasonably below the current
contract rates; also, transport time and costs will be less from Toukoto than
from present contract sites near Bamako and Kayes. Allowance is made in the
investment plan for the equipment required to establish the Toukoto quarry,
and, under the locomotive and freight car items, for shunting locomotives
and hopper cars to transport the ballast in two train sets between Toukoto
and the working areas. Allowance is also made for portable electric rail
joint welding equipment to carry out the welding on existing rail.
3.        The item in the plan for track maintenance equipment will cover
(a) the buildup of spare parts for two existing ballast tampers, (b) small
mechanical tools, and (c) railcars for the transport of track men and mate-
rial.
4.        The maintenance of bridges on CFM has been neglected for many
years. An examination is needed to establish the repairs required, and a
check should be made to establish the exact bridge strengths in relation to
existing and possible future loadings. FAC has provided funds (as a grant)
for this study; to date, an examination of four major bridges has been made
by SNCF engineers, while a contract with the consultants SOFRERAIL is being
negotiated to cover the examination of all remaining bridges. Until the



ANNEX 7
Page 2
reports are available (in 1973), LC Is not possLble to estimate the cost
of bridge repairs and strengthening required, and in the meantime a provi-
sional sum has been included :Ln the plan.
5.        The present main traffic yard at Bamako is parallel with the pas-
senger station and freighr-handling depot; it is awkward to operate, tends
to become congested, and shuntirtg operations at one end are hindered by a
heavily used main road. CFM proposes to lay out a new yard on a nearby site
made available by removal of the old locomotive workshops (with the opening
of the new Korofina workshops outside the main town area) to permit easier
operations, save car and shunting-locomotive times, and provide easier re-
ception and dispatch of freight trains. Allowance is made in the plan for
earthworks for the whole yard and for the first phase of track work, using
new switches but second-hand plain track material (released from the main
line relaying).
Miscellaneous
6.        This item is to cover locally financed works, mainly for buildings
and other miscellaneous structures.
Locomotives and Railcars
7.        For freight operationis, the traffic inward from the Senegal frontier
toward Bamako is the control. The two principal kinds of traffic are imports
ex Dakar, and cement ex Diamou (440 km to Bamako). From Table 8, the fore-
cast demands are:
Tons ('OO)         1972      1973      1974      1975      1976

10.       From train service, and allowing 76% average availability in the
future, to give 10 locomotives available vill require a stock of 13. This
will be met by 9 existing locomotives, lesa 2 to be withdrawn în 1975-76
giving net 7, plus 6 new locomotives being supplied in 1973-74. Each unit
should travel about 90,000 km per year, which would be satisfactory.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
11.       Number of railcars proposed -- 3 old + 2 new - 5
to cover 4 in service and 1 in maintenance,
then km/year per railcar - 90,000, which again is reasonable.
The new railcars are to be of 850 hp, and capable of hauling 4 trailers.
Shunting Locomotives
12.       CFM requires 7 shunting locomotives for normal operations, plus 2
for track works. Of the 7, about 3 are needed only part-time in the crop
season and at the workshops. This will allow time for maintenance. There
are 7 units in the present fleet, but 3 of these are out of use and not
repairable because spare parts are no longer available. The effective num-
ber is thus 4, with 3 to be replaced and 2 additional units to be provided.
Freight Cars
13. Oil Traffic
(a) Petroleum
An improved turn-around time of 10 days (instead of present 12 days)
is assumed. With this, the present tank car capacity vill carry 64,000 m3
against a 1976 requirement of 73,000 m3 (equal to 64,000 tons) excluding
aviation fuel, assumed to come from Abidjan, as proposed by oil company. The
shortage will require 7 additional tank cars of 49 m3 capacity.
(b) Vegetable Oils
Similarly, for vegetable oils from Koulikoro, the present capacity
is 7,200 m3 against 11,000 m3 forecast for 1976. The shortage will require
3 additional cars.
(c) Total additional tank cars = 10
General Traffic
14.       Productivity per car in 1976 is assumed (Annex 4) at 586,000 net
ton-km.
The general traffic forecast in 1976 - 179 million ton-km
Number of cars required                = 179 million
586,000
= 300
Add 10% for maintenance                = 330
Additional cars required               - 330 - 308 (existing)

Number proposed                        -  25



ANNEX 7
Page 5
15.       The track stone ballasting will last 4 years in the present pro-
gram and 6 to 7 years with additional work in a further renewal program.
Some general flat cars are being used at present which otherwise could be
employed in public traffic. Wastage also takes place in off-loading from
flat cars. It is proposed to obtain 20 ballast hopper cars which allow
quicker and more accurate off-loading; they will speed up the ballasting
work and release flat cars for public traffic. When the main ballasting
program is completed, there will remain a continuing need for some ballast
cars for normal annual renewals, while the balance will be available for
public traffic, as well as for stone, sand, and general mineral traffic.
16.       Total number of new cars to be provided:
Renewal of cars over 40 years old        70
Additional general cars              =   25
Additional oil tank cars             =   10
Additional ballast cars                   20
Total                =  125
Management
20.       The management organization and staffing of CFM personnel are in-
adequate. An examination is needed to establish the detailed requirements
of organization and staff, and to establish training schemes in:
(a) Planning.
(b) Statistics and management information.
(c) Accounting practices.
(d) Storekeeping.
(e) Personnel management.
(f) Commercial practices.
(g) Organizational Manual.
21.       Provision is made in the investment plan for consultants to carry
out this work (US$230,000), and for simple accounting and statistical equip-
ment to be installed in accordance with the procedures recommended (US$220,000).
The training of suitably selected staff over a period in the procedures as
accepted by CFM will be an important part of the work of the consultants
(Terms of reference at Annex 3).
22.       In addition, an allowance is made (US$130,000) for buildings and
equipment for improving training facilities for new entrants, and for promotion

and refresher courses in the departments for traffic and for mechanical and
civil engineering, in accordance with a scheme prepared by CFM and endorsed
by a recent Unesco/Bank mission which reviewed Malian educational proposals 1/.
23.       Finally, provision is made for sending three or four Malian senior
officers a year to other suitable railways for periods of three to six months
for practical technical training ($50,000).

Sectoral Traffic Forecast
1.        This sectoral traffic forecast was prepared based on information
presented by the Ministries of Agriculture, Production, and Finance, and all
export-import companies concerned. The final traffic forecast quotes their
projections or represents the appraisal mission's judgment on the projection.
National Traffic
Cement
2.        A cement factory in Diamou started its operations in October 1969.
Tle capacity of the factory is about 75,000 tons per year. The present level
of production is 50,000 tons per year, but part of it is accumulating at the
plant due to lack of traction capacity on CFM which provides the only mode
of transport to the distribution centers in Bamako. It is estimated that
production of the plant will reach 70,000 tons by 1978 and will satisfy all
local demand for cement.  With an average distance of 448 km, this should
result in total transport of about 31 million ton-km.
Other Full Carload Traffic
3.        Total transport in 1970 amounted to about 44,000 tons of full car-
load traffic, and in 1971 to 27,000 tons. The decline was due to:
(a) a large decrease in groundnut transport (dry year
resulted in reduced production); and
(b) a decrease in transport of rice and millet which were
imported directly to Kayes rather than transported
to Bamako and back to Kayes.
While the second item is a permanent change in distribution, it is estimated
that groundnut transport should maintain a level of 3,000 tons even after ac-
counting for increased crops in the Kayes region, and that rwo more products
will increase their share in transport substantially (fertilizers and cola
nuts estimated at 5,000 tons per year). With the lack of road competition,
the rest of the products are expected to rise at about 4% per year, equal
to the expected annual rate of growth of GDP.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
Other Lesa than Carload Traffic
4.        This traffic has been stable in the past:  9,140 tons in 1969,
10,210 tons in 1970, and 9,880 tons in 1971. It is assumed that it will
stay at its 1971 level for the rest of the period under analysis.
Exports
Cola Nuts
5.        Transport of cola nuts started in 1970.  The product is imported
from Ivory Coast and exported to Senegal. The main reason for using road/rail
transport to Senegal rather than shipping by boat is that sea transport causes
loss of flavor to the cola nuts.  Transport of this commodity grew from 2,600
tons in 1970 to 8,200 tons in 1971, and 14,000 tons were expected in 1972. It
is estimated that exports will reach 20,000 tons in 1975, and thereafter grow
at 6% annually.
Cotton Seeds and Cotton Fibers
6.        These projections are based on information provided by CFDT (Compag-
nie Francaise de Textiles). While in 1971 cotton seeds considerably outweighed
cotton fibers on rail transport, the higher growth rate of cotton fibers will
result in total transport of 15,000 tons for each category in 1978.  Cotton
seeds are exported mainly to Japan, and cotton fibers to Europe.
Groundnuts, Groundnut Cakes and Groundnut Oil
7.        This projection was based on information from the Bureau d'Affaires
Economique and the manufacturing company SEPOM. Each ton of groundnuts is
converted in the manufacturing process (performed at Koulikoro on the rail-
way line) to 0.7 ton of groundnut cakes (used for feeding animals) and about
0.3 ton of groundnut oil. The 1973 production capacity of SEPOM is 14,000
tons of groundnut cakes and 6,000 tons of groundnut oil. This -level of ex-
ports (out of which 2,000 tons of groundnut oil will be exported to Ivory
Coast and would not use rail transport) would remain the same up to 1976,
when an additional unit will increase production to 8,000 tons of oil and
17,500 tons of groundnut cakes. When these estimated quantities are deducted
from the estimated surplus of about 61,000 tons in 1976, about 36,000 tons
of groundnuts remain for exports. Beyond 1976, only groundnut exporte should
grow at 4,500 tons per year (assuming no further expansion of the plant at
Koulikoro).
Karite Products 1/
8.        The karite is a cyclic crop and accordingly showed variations in
the past: 9,700 tons in 1969, 4,300 tons in 1970, and 10,600 tons in 1971.
1/   See footnote on page 9 of report.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
While overall growth in the future is estimated at 6%, these yearly variations
were taken into account, resulting in total transport of 13,500 tons in 1977
and 7,500 tons in 1978.
Other
9.         Other carload exports were assum,ed to grow at 4% per annum at a
one-to-one relation with real growth rate of GDP, while less than carload
traffic is expected to stay at the 1971 level.
Imports
Agricultural Machinery
10.       Imports of agricultural machinery at a level of about 4,000 tons
in 1972 are expected to grow at an annual rate of 5%, reaching a level of
about 5,400 tons in 1978.
Cerent
11.       Cement imports, carried only by rail in the past, amounted to
6,600 tons in 1971 and are expected to be eliminated in 1973 as a result of
increased production of the cement plant in Dliamou.
Construction Materials and Equipment
12.       With the priority given by the Government to construction works,
it is estimated that total imports of this category will grow at about 2,000
tons per year to a total of 22,000 tons in 1978.
Fertilizers
13.       Fertilizer imports, showing a large increase in 1971 as a result
of efforts by the Ministry of Agriculture to introduce better cultivation
methods, are expected to grow annually by about 6% after reaching a level
of 14,000 tons in 1978.
Foodstuffs
14.       Total transport in this category (including sugar, flour, maize,
rice, millet, etc.) amounted to 61,500 tons in 1970 and 62,650 tons in 1971.
While rice imports (about 10,000 tons) should cease as of 1976 as a result
of increased domestic production, the three-year plan drafted by the Govern-
ment estimates an annual rate of growth of 4% for imports of other foodstuffs.
Thus, about 67,800 tons of imports are expected for 1978, only about 5,100
tons more than in 1971.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
Petroleum Products
15.       Despite the higher transport cost, a large portion of petroleum
imports to the areas of Bamako and Koulikoro is transported via Abidjan.
This is due to the lack of traction and delays in marshalling yards. The
turn-around time Dakar-Bamako-Dakar is about 12 days. With adequate traction
and improved turn-around time, it should be reduced to 10 days in 1974. For
the traffic forecast, the oil companies' projection was taken as 3a basis.
For 1974, total demand for the Bamako-Koulikoro area is 55,000 m  and for
Kayes 18,000 m3, equivalent to a total of 56,000 tons. For 1978, about
65,000 tons of imports by rail to these regions are expected. This repre-
sents an increase of about 30,000 tons over 1971 traffic, and eliminates the
necessity of importing fuel via the alternative route from Abidjan.
Salt
16.       Salt is imported from Senegal, and amounted to 17,400 tons in 1971.
In 1972, limitation on railway capacity allowed total transport of only about
14,400 tons, but total demand was estimated at 20,000 tons. The demand for
salt, basically for conservation of food products, should reach 27,000 tons
in 1978, an annual growth rate of 6.5%.
Other Imports
17.       These imports were assumed to grow at 4% annually in line withh
GDP growth. Less-than-carload imports are expected to remain stable at
their 1971 level.
Comparison of Traffic Projections with those assumed in appraising Senegal
Railways Project
18.       The appraisal report for the Senegal Railways assumed total import-
export traffic of 291,000 tons between Senegal and Mali in 1976; the projec-
tion in the present report is 338,000 tons for 1976. The difference is due
to the present availability of more detailed, up-to-date information on Malits
potential railway traffic.

Mali Railways
The regression used for this analysis relates total tons hauled
by the Mali Railways to GDP and to average revenue per ton-km (both in con-
stant prices) in the following form:
T   -   K (GDP) J  (AR)fR
where:    T   =   Total tons
GDP   =   Gross Domestic Product in millions of MF
in constant 1969 prices
Ô   =   Elasticity of T to GDP
AR   =   Average Revenue per ton-km in MF
in constant 1964/65 prices
0z   =   Elasticity of T to AR
The data used for the model cover the years 1965-1971:
