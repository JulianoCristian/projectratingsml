INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$6.7
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a railway project. The
proceeds of the credit would be re-lent to the Regie du Chemin de Fer du
Mali (RCFM) for 25 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report on "Recent Developments in the Economy of Mali" (AW-30a)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 10, 1971. A Country
Data Sheet is attached in Annex I. An updating economic mission visited Mali
in early 1973, and a new report is being prepared.
3.        With a per capita CDP of around $70, Mali is one of the poorest
countries in Africa and one of the 25 "least developed" countries identified
by the United Nations General Assembly. Agricultture, livestock and fisheries
are the mainstay of the economy and the principal source of foreign exchange.
Manufacturing output accounts for onlv about 4 percent of GDP. The recorded
real growth of total GDP during the 1960's was about 2.8 percent a year or
marginally higher than the population growth rate of 2.5 percent. A series
of drought years has created new problems for Mali and neighbouring countries,
causing marked flucttlations in food grain production and heavy losses of live-
stock.  Total agricultural and livestock production in Mali is estimated to
have fallen bv 5 percent in 1969, and after a good recovery in the following
year, which was matched in other sectors, agriculture has barely kept pace
with the annual increase in population. Consequently, CDP growth has been
even more sluggish since 1970, and in 1973 there is likely to be an actual
decline because of exceptionally low rainfall last summer.
4.        Reports on previous credits to Mali have drawn attention to the
legacy of difficult economic problems inherited from the regime of Modibo
Keita which was overthrown by the militarv in November 1968. Many of these
problems persist in spite of the efforts made by the present government at
the beginning of its administration to correct the most serious distortions
in the economy by raising agricultural prices, removing some of the restric-
tions on trade, stimulating the inflow of private capital and increasing tax
revenues. Food prices continue to be held down for the benefit of urban
consumers, with consequent disincentives to production and an incentive to



- 2 -
smuggle grain to neighboring countries where prices are higher, thus reducing
domestic availabilities and increasing import needs. The established govern-
ment policy of hiring all graduates of the nation's "ecoles superieures1' un-
able to find employment in the private sector has been a factor exerting con-
stant upward pressure on public expenditure. Most state enterprises appear
to be still operating at a loss. Action to deal with these problems will at
best be taken only very gradually, and with the additional difficulties created
by the drought, the economy remains weak and its foreign exchange reserves neg-
ative - a situation made tenable only by the French guarantee of convertibil-
ity for the Malian franc and French financial assistance.
5.        There are nevertheless a number of encouraging developments.    Pro-
duction of cotton and groundnuts, the two principal expor; crops, appears to
have been fairly well maintained in spite of the drought.- However, cotton and
groundnut production remain about 10 percent below plan target. Substantial
amounts are being invested in various programs for expand-ing the output of
cotton and rice, including the Mopti rice project, which is being financed by
IDA, and further projects for groundnuts and livestock are under preparation.
River fisherfes, for which the European Development Fund has provided assist-
ance, have also been making good progress, and exports to neighbouring coun-
tries are on the increase.
6.        Tne balance of payments improved considerably during 1968-71.    The
overall deficit -fell from MF 9.6 billion in 1963 to WV 1.2 billion in 1970.
±owever, in 1971, substantial irports of cereals necessitated by the effects
of the drought on domestic food production largely contributed to the deficit
of ME 3.4 billion. Tle trade deficit was virtually constant throughout ex-
cept for the deterioration already noted in 1971. The net deficit on services
was reduced by 30 percent during the period. The main source of improvement,
however, was the reversal of capital flows, mostly on private account, from
a net outflow of MF 6.6 billion in 1968 to a net inflow of MF 2.2 billion in
1971. Data for 1972 are still incomplete but mid-year figures suggest that
recorded exports and recorded imports were running 26 percent and 18 percent
lower respectively than in the previous year. The apparent discrepancy between
export and production growth may be explained, particularly for groundnuts
and fish, by variations in the volume of unrecorded exports and farm consumption,
for which data are not available. The decline in exports is likely to continue
into 1973 on account of the drought.
7.        Public savings have remained negative despite some improvement in
tax collection in recent years. Government current expenditures have been
rising at the rate of 6 percenIt a year. In spite of this, the budget deficit
(excluding investment expenditures financed out of foreign aid) was reduced
from 'T 6.3 billion in 1969 to MF 2.4 billion in 1971.    Comparable data for
1972 are not yet available. Partial results indicate a deficit of about MF 2.7
billion.
8.        The 1973 budget provides for expenditures of HF 28.1 billion as com-
pared with ETF 25.8 billion in 1972.  Personnel emoluments, which claim over



-3
60 percent of total government expenditure, account for most of this increase.
Some of it was due to a small general increase in salaries with effect from
January 1, 1973. To finance the estimated expenditure, the Government lhas
undertaken a number of measures to increase tax revenue. The poll tax, a
minimum head tax paid mostly by farmers, was increased by 20 percent. In
view of the drought and the prospect of a poor harvest this year, however,
additional revenue from this source is unlikely to materialize.
9.        The Government's main hope of increasing tax revenue lies in fur-
ther improving tax collection. To this end, the Covernment has adopted the
policy of closing down toward the end of the year businesses in tax arrears.
Such businesses, some of which were still closed when the economic mission
left Mali in mid-February, are allowed to reopen only if they pay half of the
arrears immediately and the remainder within three months. Nevertheless, a
current deficit of MF 2.4 billion is projected for 1973, a substantial in-
crease over the 1972 budget estimate (MF 1.8 billion).
Foreign Aid
10.       Much the greater part of public investment is financed from exter-
nal sources. From 1966/67-1970, Mali received an annual average of US$30
million of external aid, including technical assistance of about US$3 million.
Nearly half of this aid was provided by the U.S.S.R. and the People's Republic
of China in the form of long-term concessionary loans. Close to 40 percent
of the total came from France and the European Development Fund in the form
of grants. In 1971 Mali received foreign aid disbursements of US$23.6
million,(including US$7.0 million in technical assistance), of which US$17.4
million were grants and US$6.1 million were loans. How much of this was used
to finance the emergency grain imports mentioned earlier remains undetermined.
Data for 1972 are not yet available.
11.       The present drought has prompted special emergency aid to Mali from
various sources. Of the emergency aid which FED recently approved for the six
drought-stricken Sahelian countries, US$8.6 million is earmarked for Mali.
The FAO has announced an emergency crash program for all six countries and,
in this connection, a special FAO mission visited Mali at the time of the most
recent Bank economic mission to that country. The FAO operation, with which
the World Food Program (WFP) and the UNDP are associated, has already allo-
cated 50,000 tons of food grains for the six countries. This quantity exceeds
last year's allocation by tenfold and is estimated to claim some three-
quarters of the WFP emergency resources for 1973.
12.       Mali's total external public debt outstanding of US$317 million
equivalent at the end of 1971 (including US$56 million undisbursed) was nearly
10 percent higher than the year's GDP. Total repayments of principal and
interest due in 1971 would have claimed about 12 percent of the year's total
foreign exchange earnings as compared with a debt service ratio of 8 percent
in 1970. Actual debt service payments, however, were small owing to the 1970
rescheduling of Chinese and Russian debts, which constitute two-thirds of the
country's total foreign debt.



13.       Mali's prospects for accelerating economic progress are primarily
dependent on raising agricultural and livestock production for export and on
improving its infrastructure with investments geared closely to the needs of
the productive sectors of the economy. In view of its limited capacitv to
raise public savings and its difficult balance of payments position, Mali will
continue to rely heavily on foreign assistance. The present external debt
situation and the poverty of the country suggest that this assistance should
be on the most concessionary terms possible and cover a high proportion of
total project costs, including substantial local expenditures.
PART II: BANK, GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
14.       The proposed credit would be IDA's fifth operation in Mali, bringing
the total of IDA funds committed to US$34.0 million.
15.       Bank Group lending during the 1960's was handicapped by the country's
poor economic performance and the lack of well-prepared and econemically justi-
fied projects. A US$9.1 million IDA credit (95-MLI) was made, however, in 1966
for the improvement of the Malian section of the Bamako-Dakar railway.
16.       Since the end of the 1960's, project preparation has been sharply
stepped tup. The Bank's 1969 economic mission and other reconnaissance and
preparation missions provided the basis for formulating a substantially
expanded and diversified Bank Group lending program.    The first results of
these efforts have already materialized. An IDA credit (197-ME,T), of US$7.7
million, helped finance a first highway maintenance project in 1970. Credits
respectively amounting to $6.9 and $3.6 million for the Mopti rice project
(277-ETI) and a telecommunications project (321-111,I) were approved in 1972.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of Februar- 28, 1973,
and notes on the execution of on-going projects. The total amount disbi!rsed
as of February 28, 1973, was US$14.9 million; the amount undisbursed was
TS$12.4 million.
7.        Apnraisal in the field of a first educational project, which should
be presented to the Board in the next few months took place in Novemoer 1972.
mTh project would aim principally at reorganizing the educational system to
make it more responsive to manpower requirements.
15.       Mali has considerable potential for agricultural and livestock
development. In fact, most of the operations envisaged by the Bank Group
for the period 1974-1975 directly or indirectly concern the rural sector,
and include groundnut/millet and livestock development projects being
prepared with the assistance of FAC experts and PMWA and scheduled for Board
presentation in FY 1974. The groundnut/millet project would provide for
improving feeder roads, constructing wells, and training extension workers.
A cotton project (FY 1975), which would include processing and storage facili-
ties and feeder roads, has been identified. Finally, the Mopti rice project
of 1972 includes feasibility studies for a second rice project to be financed
at some later stage.



PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN MLI
The Transport System
19.       Mali has an extensive transport system with .an adequate geographical
layout.  At present it consists of a 642 km railway (Regie du Chemin de Fer
du Mali - RCfl); about 13,000 kn of roads, of which 3,100 km provide all-
weather service; about 1,650 km of inland waterways which are navigable for
about seven months each year; and an international airport at Bamako as well
as about a dozen airfields serving domestic commercial needs. The two main
international routes (catering to some 35 percent of total export-import
freight traffic) are:
(a)  the railway from Bamako to the Port of Dakar --- 1,283 km,
642 km of which are in Mali -- which serves about 60 per-
cent of total international traffic; and
(b) a road/rail combination from Bamako to the Port of
Abidjan, approximately 1,230 km in length. (A paved
road leads from Bamako to Ouangolodougou, Ivory Coast,
which is on the railway to Abidjan.) Approximately
25 percent of the international traffic is carried on
this route which was developed to avoid total reliance
on access to the sea through Senegal and to serve
mainly the areas of south and southeast Mali.
20.       Like other vast land-locked West African countries, Mali's transport
infrastructure requires substantial investments, and, as noted, several Bank
projects (Credits 95 and 197-MLI) are underway with a view to improving the
transport sector. The railway credit proposed in this report and the road
credit proposed in an accompanying report would provide new investments in
track renewal and rolling stock as well as in highway rehabilitation and
feeder road betterment. The European Development Fund (FED) is financing the
construction of a new international airport at Senou, just south of Bamako,
to replace the existing facility which is severely limited in capacity.
Judged by the current economic plan and by the investments in transport under
preparation, the planning of infrastructure is well geared to the needs of
the country.
21.       Most domestic trade is carried by either road or rail.    Road
transport accounts for close to 75 percent of all passenger traffic; the
railway carries about 15 percent; water transport, 8 percent; and air
transport, the remainder. Domestic freight traffic is handled 45 percent
by road, 40 percent by rail, and 15 percent by water transport. For external
transport, the railway is the more important mode. Of the total import-
export traffic, estimated at about 400,000 tons per year, 55-60 percent is
shipped via the railway to and from Dakar. About 20-30 percent is transported
by road/railroad to and from the Ivory Coast, about half of it being overseas
trade directed through the Port of Abidjan.   Remaining import-export traffic
consists of trade with neighboring countries.



6-
The Highway Network
22.       Mali's highwav network comprises about 13,000 km of roads and tracks.
It includes a well-developed network of primary roads linking the main popu-
lation centers of the central region (Bamako, Segou, Sikasso and Mopti) with
each other and with the transport networks of Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast.
The 3,100 km of primary road network include about 1,630 km of paved roads
and 1,470 km of all-weather gravel roads.   The primary road network, together
with the railwav and river, form the backbone of the transportation system.
They are comiplemented by a scattered network of secondary roads and earth
tracks, which provide access to rural areas.
23.       The condition of most primary roads is adequate for present
traffic levels, although several paved roads built more than 15 years ago
require strengtheeting and rehabilitation.  The condition of the secondary
network is less satisfactorv and manv rural areas are not provided with
reliable commulnication. The highest priorities in the highway sector are
adequate highwav maintenance, rehabilitation of existing primarv roads,
and the improvement of specific secondarv roads in support of agricultural
development programs. The first highway project as well as the recently
ne7otiated road oroject are directed towards these objectives.
The Role of the Railway
24.       The Regie du Chemin de Fer du Mali orovides the only mode of
tranisport in the western part of Mali, providing a link between Bamako and
Kayes (second largest city in the country), and numerous small. towns and
villages in between. Passenger services by road between Bamako and Kayes
can be provided onlv by landrovers over dlifficult terrain and only for a
limited oeriod during the year. The roads in that area are not passable
for trucks under any condition.   The main national freight traffic is from
the cement plant of Diamou, near Kaves, whose expected output in 1976 is
60,000 tons (currently 40,000 tons), equivalent to about US$3.6 million of
import substitution, based on the CIF price of imported cement.
25.       The RCFM carried about 250,000 tons of imports and exports in 1971;
this ficure represents about 75 percent of total rail freight traffic, the
principal commodities (by weight) being foodstuffs (63,n00 tons), petroleum
(36,000 tons), groundnut products (42,000 tons), salt (17,000 tons), and
cotton products (16,000 tons). The railway provides the cheapest means of
transport for this international traffic. A comparison of transport costs
from the Bamako region to the ports of Abidjan and Dakar demonstrates that
transport oni the railway route to Dakar, compared with the road/rail combina-
ttoII to Abidjan. is substantially cheaper for al] products.   The difference
in cost ranges from US$10 per ton for flour and sugar to US$28 per ton for
petroleum products.
2o.       The railway provides an international passenger service twice a
week to Senegal at a tariff which is about 80 percent lower than that by air
and caters mainly to the less affluent segments of the population.



-7-
Transport Coordination
27.       Government control of the transport industrv through public owner-
ship applies to: the Malian railroacl (RCFM), the Mali Navigation Company,
Air lMali, and the Mali Road Transport Company (CNTR) which enjoys a 20
percent share, in terms of ton-km, of Mali's road freight transport. Although
these companies are responsible for their operations, the Government decides
upon their investments in infrastructure and equipment and maintains fixed
tariff levels for all modes of transport. These decisions are made by the
Council of Ministers, based on recommendations from the Minister of Transport
and the Minister of Finance.
28        There are no major problems of investment coordination, since
the road system caters mainly to areas not served by the railway (Bamako-
Sikasso-Mopti triangle). Part of the road system, however. serves the
international route to Abidjan, which competes with the railway route to
Dakar. The policy of the Government, however, is to keep open the two
routes to the ocean; past circumstances (disruption of traffic between Mali
and Senegal in the period 1960-1963), as well as intraregional traffic,
justifv this policy.
PART IV - THE SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Railway Project" (No. 32a-MLI)
is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided in
Annex III. The Government of the Republic of Mali and the Regie du Chemin
de Fer du Mali (RCFM) asked the Association to help finance a 1973-1976 in-
vestment plan designed to continue the physical rehabilitation of the RCFM's
equipment and to improve its management, operations and finances. The
proposed railway project comprises this investment plan, the total cost of
which is estimated at MF 4,300 million (US$9.3 million equivalent).
30.       This proposed credit would be the second to the Regie du Chemin
de Fer du Kali since the country gained independence in 1960; the first
credit (95-MLI) in 1966 amounted to US$9.1 million equivalent, 98 percent
of which has been spent, with the remainder to be disbursed by the end of
June 1973. After allowing for depreciation, the operating ratio of the RCFMI
decreased from 127 percent in 1965/66 to 97 percent in 1971. These ratios
reflect a steady improvement but not as substantial as that proposed at the
time the project was appraised. Progress toward achieving financial targets
has lagged primarily because traffic growth has been inhibited by low trac-
tion availability.
31.       At the same time as the first credit to Mali, the Association
had granted a credit of US$9.0 million equivalent to Senegal for the
development of the Senegal Railways. A second loan/credit was made to
Senegal (Loan 835/Credit 314-SEN) on June 23, 1972, by the Bank Group to
carry on the rehabilitation and modernization of the Senegal Railways in



-8-
parallel with similar work for the Mali Railway. Since the two railways,
in Mali and Senegal, basically form a single operating entity, the loans/
credits to each are mutually beneficial.
The Project
32.       The pronosed project would consist essentially of:
(a) traclc and buildings: (i) equipment for and renewal of
21.5 km of track; (ii) ballasting of 210 km of line;
(iii) joint welding of 380 km of rails; and (iv) minor
repairs to bridges;
(b)  motive power and rolling stock:   4 maini line locomotives;
5 shunting locomotives; 2 railcars: 8 trailers; 4 passenger
coaches; 125 freight cars and spare parts for rolling
stock; and
(c) management: equipment for accounts/statistics, consulting
services and training.
33.       Under Credit 95-MLI, 71 km of track material is being renewed between
Kaves, Mali's second largest city after Bamako, and the Senegalese border out
of a total of 98.5 km. There thus remains 17.5 km to complete the relaying
of the section. In addition, there are 4 km of track on sharp curves, near
Bamako, which are in poor condition and in need of replacement. A total of
21.5 km of track materials is therefore included in the proposed railway
project as well as stone ballast, which is lacking on about 210 km of main
line track between Kaves and Toukoto. Welding of rail joints on sections
totaling about 380 km is also included. Both ball½stina and joint welding
need to be done to (a) improve track strength, (b) prolong life of track
material, (c) reduce maintenance costs on track and also on rolling stock,
and (d) permit higher average speeds.
34.       A review of future train service requirements to meet the traffic
forecast and of the prospective availabllity and utilization of locomotives
and railcars shouw that the provision of four additional main line diesel
locomotives, two additional shunting locomotives (plus the replacement of
three existing units not now operational), four additional passenger coaches
and two additional railcars (plus eight trailer cars) is justified.    The main
line locomotives are to be similar in type to existing units for maximum flex-
ibilitv and ease of maintenance and spares provision. The new shunting locomo-
tives will be able to handle larger, heavier freigj-ht cars, and the railcars
will also be larger than existing units to allow for hauling additional trailer
cars on an increased regular service between Kayes and Bamako. The passenger
coaches will complete the Mali train set for the international Bamako-Dakar
connection, eight coaches having already been provided under Credit 95-MLI.
In addition, some 70 freight cars are between 40 and 55 years old, in poor
condition, and not suited to regular use on long distance freight service as
requiired between Dakar and Bamako; the project under consideration proposes



-9-
to replace them with larger capacity cars having roller bearings and improved
brake gear. Further, to carrv the increased traffic of oils and general cargo,
and also to cater for the track ballasting program, a total of 55 additional
freight cars is proposed. Finally, spare parts are included to continue thle
build-up of spares and replacement units (such as diesel and elctric motors)
which are essential for obtaining regular maintenance, reducing workshop time,
and improving the availability of units.
35.       The plan of action outlined in conjunction with the proposed
project and accepted by the C.overnmeht and Regie during negotiations calls
for the phvsical rehabilitation and financial viability of the RCWf so as to
permit the Regie to meet all operating expenses (including adequate allowances
for depreciation and renewal funds) and debt service obligations out of in-
ternally generated ftnds, and to make a contribution toward its investment
needs. To acliieve these ends, the RCFM will take appropriate measures, in-
cludirig:
(a)  tile implementation of a system of control that will permit
prompt evaluation of progress;
(b) the setting of rates and fares such that no rate or
fare shall be set below the incremental cost of providing
relevant service;
(c) appropriate modifications to the existing tariff
system; and
(d) all necessary steps to achieve an operating ratio of
not more than 91 percent in its fiscal year 1974, and
89 percent in its fiscal year 1976.
36.       Provision is made for consultants to carry out an examination
of RCFV management requirements and to introduce new procedures and equipment
for planning, statistics and management information, accounting services,
storekeeping and personnel management.   In addition, although simple training
schemes exist for new entrants and for present staff, improved facilities
are needed for the extension of these courses. Allowance is therefore made
under the proposed project for new buildings and equipment, in accordance
with a scheme prepared by the RCF.M and endorsed by a recent UNESCO/Bank
mission. Moreover, allowance is made for the provision of practical, tecbni-
cal training periods overseas witlh suitable railwavs for senior Malian
staff to the extent of three or four persons a year for three to six montlhs.
Financial Aspects
37.       The RCF! had operating losses for several years from its creation,
but the situiation improved gradually until 1971.   Operating revenues covered
working expenses in 1967/68 and 1969 and covered working expenses plus depre-
ciation charges in 1970 and 1971.   Between 1966 and 1971 revenues doubled;
operating costs increased but onlv by about 50 percent. Owing, however, to



- 10 -
the retirement of four locomotives and serious damage to two others during
the period 1969-1972, rail traffic as well as revenues decreased by early
1972. Nevertheless, the situation is expected to improve in 1973 as new lo-
corotives become operational and better maintenance facilities and procedures
become effective. As recards the financial objectives for the RCFM, it was
agreed during negotiations that the Regie would earn rates of return of at
least 2 percent in 1974 and 1975, 3 percent in 1976, and 3.5 percent in 1977.
Forecasts of the Regie's financial situation indicate that internally generated
funds, amounting to MF 1,070 million in 1977, would be adequate to cover fully
maximum debt service requirements of MF 721 million (reacihed in 1978) and pro-
vide funds for investment needs.   As noted, it has been agreed that RCFM will
take all necessary steps to achieve an operating ratio of not more than 91
percent in its fiscal year 1974, and 89 percent in its fiscal year 1976.
38.       The RCFM'Vs liquidity position has been poor due to the large volume
of debt owed partly to the Government and partly to the Senegal Railway. The
Government, lhowever, has recently acted to lessen RCFM's debt burden by waiv-
ing MF 788 million owed to it by the Regie. Further, Government has agreed
to continue waiving RCF,?t pavments of interest and principal on the proceeds
of Credit 95-TLI, relent to the Regie, and to continue compensating the RCnI'
for Dayments made by the Regie to the Senegal Railways for the use of inter-
changed equiDment.
39.       In their recently completed study, consultants SOFRERAIL (France)
propose certain changes in the tariff structure in order to relate tariffs
more closely to costs and to increase revenues. During negotiations, the
consultants' recommendations were reviewed wittl the Government and the RCFM,
and it was agree6 that selective changes would be made and a new tariff
structure would be introduced not later than January 1, 197J.    The tariff
changes would be such as to yield an 8% increase in revenues.
Cost and Financing
40.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes, is estimated at US$9.3
million witlh a foreign exchange component of US$8.5 million. The proposed IDA
credit of US$6.7 million would meet about 72 percent of tne total cost of the
project and finance 79 percent of the foreign exchange cost.    The remaining
foreig-n exchange requirements of US$1.3 million would be met by the French
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and cover costs for four main 'ine and
two shunting locomotives as well as spare parts. Local currency expenditures
amounting to about 9 percent of total project cost, or about US$0.8 million,
would be covered by the RCFM out of its own resources. The proposed IDA credit
of T!S$6.7 million to the Government would be re-lent to the RCFM for repayment
in 25 years including L years of grace, and would bear interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum. Funds available to the RCFM from the FAC would come partly in
the form of a concessionarv loan bearing an interest rate of 3 percent per
year and repayable over 16 years, including one year grace, and partly as a
grant.

Project Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
41.       The RCFM is competent to carrv out the project. Track renewal,
ballasting and rail joint welding will be handled by RCFIs4's own work forces
which have obtained adequate experience during the previous project and produce
good quality work.
42.       The Government relieved CFM of duties levied on imports for goods
financed under Credit 95-MLI and has confirmed that this policy will be con-
tinued for the proposed second railway credit. Imported track material and
equipment for ballasting, rail joint welding, and maintenance, as well as
railcars, trailers, passenger coaches and freight cars will be obtained through
international competitive bidding. The four main line and two shunting loco-
motives, financed by FAC, will be purchased in France.
43.       Disbursements will be made on the cost of imported equipment and
materials at the Mali frontier, as well as on the foreign cost of consultant
and technical services and training, and will extend through FY 1977.
Benefits
44.       The economic evaluation of the proposed project compared the two
most economic routes for export-import transport, including the road/rail
connection to Abidjan and the railway to Dakar. The comparison demonstrated
that transport costs for the Abidjan route, including costs for petroleun
products, exceed those of the alternative route by about US$13.8 per ton.
This difference between the two routes stems mainly from the higher cost of
road transDort and the additional unloading and loading at Ouangolodougou,
Ivory Coast. that occurs when using the road/rail combination to Abidjan.
The benefits associated with the avoidance of the higher cost involved in
diversion of traffic to the Abidjan route would yield a satisfactory 18 per-
cent rate of economic return on investmenit.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit kgreement between the Association and
the Republic of Mali, the draft Project Agreement between the Regie de Chemin
de Fer du Mali and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for
railroad development projects.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

PART VI - REGOMMENDATION
48.       I recomnmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Credit 95-NKLI:  First Railw_.L Project
The US$9.1 million First Railway Project of 1966 (95--IU), the
physical program of which lagged behind schedule at one time bv about three
years, is now almost completed in terms of physical content. The closing date,
set initially for June 30, 1970, was first postponed to December 31, 1971. The
Association, however, agreed that savings of $480,000 under the credit should
be used for track renewal on an additional 14 km of track and therefore ex-
tended the closing date to December 31, 1972.   Mkst recently, the credit's
closing date has been further postponed to June 30, 1973, because of a delay in
delivery of equipment. Progress toward the financial targets of the project
has also been slow.   In particular, the Railway's financial situation has been
precarious but is now improving (see paragraphs 37 and 38).

Credit 197-MLI: First Highway Project
The US$7.7 million First Highway Project of 1970 (197-MLI) is being
carried out with the assistance of two teams of experts, from the International
Labor Organization (ILO), which are providing technical assistance, including
help to reorganize the Equipment Department of the National Directorate of
Public W4orks (DPW). The Borrower's performance is good and the project is
nrogressing satisfactorily after a slow start.
Credit 277-71LI:  lMopti Rice Project
The US$6.9 million Rice Development Credit of January 1972 (277-MLI)
is IIow makinc satisfactory progress after initial delays due to Government
budgetary constraints and the lack of 'Knowledge of IDA procedures by officials
of tne relevant Ministry.   It is expected that the project's main civil works
contract, awarded recently, should be completed within two years, or one year
alhead of appraisal schedule.
Credit 321-MLI: Telecommunications Project
The US$3.6 million Telecormunications Project of June 1972 (321-N.lI)
is not yet effective. The date of effectiveness, originally November 1, 1972,
has been postponed several times. The new date is April 20, 1973. The credit
is expected to become effective upon receipt of a duly prepared legal opinion
from Government.
