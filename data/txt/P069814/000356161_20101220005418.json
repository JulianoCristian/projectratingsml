Technical Assistance\n            Credit Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            simple and realistic project design, especially in a country\n            with limited institutional capacity and political\n            instability. Appropriate and realistic Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) framework should be developed during\n            project preparation. The Bank should have decided not to\n            grant extensions after the closure of Consolidation\n            Structural Adjustment Credit (CSAC) as it is difficult to\n            support complex reforms on a pure technical assistance\n            project.
