Project\n            for the Kyrgyz Republic aims to help implement reform\n            measures under the Consolidation Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (CSAC). The project has four components. The first\n            improves the business environment: it finances the services\n            of an expatriate consultant who will implement the decrees\n            on improving start-up procedures and business inspections;\n            funds a diagnostic analysis and surveys; and thereafter, it\n            simplifies business procedures, including business\n            registration. The second component helps revenue\n            mobilization, provides financing for an international\n            customs advisor, and supports the customs modernization and\n            reform. The third component strengthens the state energy\n            agency in its institutional and technical capacity, thus\n            enabling it to prepare detailed market rules governing the\n            operation of the unbundled electricity and gas sectors; and\n            to monitor rule implementation. This component also assists\n            the Government's efforts to privatize the\n            country's gas and electricity distribution companies;\n            strengthens the financial viability of the gas company;\n            helps carry out an audit; helps implement, monitor, and\n            assess a social assistance compensation strategy for urban\n            areas undergoing significant household utility tax\n            increases; supports the public relations campaign; and\n            purchases gas meters, parts, materials, and equipment. The\n            fourth component supports project management, other\n            technical assistance, and contingencies."}, "docdt": "2000-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
