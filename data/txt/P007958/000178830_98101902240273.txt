INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
FOR A LIMA-AMAZON TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$76.5 million to help
finance a Lima-Amazon transport corridor project. The loan would have a
term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Peru"
(No. 655-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 3, 1975.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since 1968 the Government has followed a development strategy in
which economic growth is linked to a transformation of the society to achieve
broader popular participation in the country's economic, social and political
life, thus addressing one of the most serious problems of Peru's economy and
society --the sharp differences in wealth and opportunities between income
classes and geographical regions. As was recognized by the Consultative
Group for Peru, which met in Paris in April 1975, much progress has been made
during recent years in implementing this strategy. The land reform in the
coastal areas is advanced and, although greater difficulty has been found in
improving the lot of the Sierra peasants, efforts to organize production
cooperatives there are being accelerated. In the field of industry most
enterprises have complied with the Industrial Community legislation --which
provides for a gradual participation of the workers in the ownership of the
enterprise-- and a new Social Property Law was approved aimed at promoting
new industrial and entrepreneurial capacity within a system of self-management
by the employees. Some progress has also been made in strengthening the
management capability of the public sector and the Government has been able to
secure increasing amounts of foreign loans to finance the public investment
program, although much of this inflow was on relatively hard terms.
4.        Following two years of financial consolidation in 1968-69, GDP grew
at an annual rate above 5.5 percent during 1970-74. Gross domestic invest-
ment rose from less than 13 percent to almost 17 percent of GDP between 1970
and 1974, largely because of the increase of public and private investment
in mining and petroleum. However, as consumption also grew faster than GDP
and heavy losses were incurred by public enterprises marketing imported
petroleum and foodstuffs, gross national savings fell from 15 to 11 percent
of GNP between 1970 and 1974. The excessive growth of aggregate demand
combined with the sharp rise in Peru's import prices since 1973 resulted in



- 2 -
both an acceleratiou of the annual rate of domestic inflation --from an
average annual rate of 7.2 percent during 1969-73 to over 17 percent in
1974-- and an increase in the deficit of the balance of paymiielnts on curreat
account from 0.5 to 6.2 percent of GDP between 1972 and 1974. Net long--term
capital inflows rose fromii $110 million in 1972 to $840 million in 1974.  This
inflow went to both public and private sectors, including substantial credits
for mineral resource development.   This inflow permitted a $290 million
increase in net international reserves in spite of the widened resource gap.
5.        During 1975 the Government strove to reverse the deteriorating
financial trends, stimulate agricultural production and reduce inflationary
pressures through a series of tax and price measures. In January 1975
indirect taxes were increased and subsidies on food were reduced.    On June 30
a second package of measures further reduced consumption subsidies through
increases in prices of basic foodstuffs and petroleum ranging from 25 percent
for diesel fuel to 100 percent for premium gasoline. This set of measures
also included (a) sharp increases in power, water and transportation charges
and in prices of other basic goods such as steel and cement. (b) a 40 percent
reduction in prices of fertilizers to stimulate agricultural production, and
(c) strict controls over future salary adlustments in the public and private
sectors.
6.        On August 29 a new governiment assumed office.   It has pledged to
adhere to the same broad objectives as those of the preceding one, while
improving financial and economic management.   As a complement of the measures
taken earlier, on September 26 the Sol was devalued by about 15 percent.
The devaluation shiould help improve the ability of the exporters of non-
traditional products to compete in foreign markets, increase the savings
of traditional. exporters and help reduce the growth of imlports.
7.        The strong measures taken in 1975 by the Government were well
directed at attacking the basic causes of Peru's financial difficulties.
However, the country's financial position continues to be under strong
pressures mainly because of two factors. In the first place, the fall in
demand for Peru's exports caused by the prolonged international recession
has significantly reduced export earnings and the rate of growth of GDP.
The fall in prices of mineral and fishmeal exports was not fully offset by
the large increase in price of sugar exports and the recovery of fishineal
production.  The decline in export demand, together with work stoppages,
resulted in a drop in mining output, while the inadequate price policies of
past years, together with sharply increased fertilizer prices in 1974, caused
a fall in agricultural production. Secondly the continued losses incurred
by public enterprises have upset the Government's policy of seeking to improve
public savings. They were caused principally by not passing to the consumer
the increased local costs of imported petroleum, foodstuffs and fertilizers
resulting from the devaluation and the further increase in international petro-
leum prices of last October. These losses have not been compensated by the
rapid growth of tCenitral Government revenues during 1975 (faster than GDP at



current prices) and have eroded the Government's earlier efforts to increase
public savings. Import demand was stimulated by the financing of the result-
ing large public sector cash deficits with banking credit at a time when
private financial savings were contracting in real terms. Moreover, imports
also continued to rise because of the increase in investment (mainly in petro-
leum and mining), which has a high import component. Net long-term capital
inflows may total over $1.2 billion in 1975, but will not be sufficient to
finance the current account deficit. The overall result will be a fall in
net international reserves from $690 million in December 1974 to around $250
million by the end of 1975, equivalent to only about one month of imports.
8.        In the next few years Peru's finances --external and domestic-- will
be under considerable pressure. Much will depend on the speed at which the
economies of the industrialized countries recover with the resulting increase
in prices and values of Peru's exports, on the availability of long-term
foreign capital on softer terms than in 1975 and on the Government's ability
to control aggregate demand and increase savings. In 1976 the terms of trade
are not likely to improve, while the volume of exports will not expand much
because most of the large mining projects now under construction will not be
completed until 1977 or later. At the same time, if international capital
markets continue to be as tight as they are now Peru will have difficulty in
obtaining large net additional funds from commercial sources on suitable terms.
It is therefore clear to the Government that most of the effort to reduce the
resource gap will have to be made internally. The Government is preparing a
set of additional large tax and price measures, a revision of interest rate
policy and a change in incentives to industry aimed at reducing their fiscal
cost. In addition, the Government is prepared to cut back its public invest-
ment program in line with the availability of domestic and foreign savings
even though this program is focussed heavily on projects in the mining and
industrial sectors designed to strengthen the country's balance of payments
position.
9.        Starting in 1977 the balance of payments situation is likely to
begin to improve as the volume of mining exports will increase substantially.
In addition, it is likely that Peru will virtually eliminate its dependence
on imported petroleum by the end of 1977 and will thereby save some $350
million per year by 1981 (at 1975 prices). However, it is now considered
unlikely that the country will become a substantial net exporter of petroleum
in the foreseeable future. The Government is also making efforts to develop
other lines of export, such as in manufactures and tourism.
10.       In the future Peru will have to rely more on medium and long-term
borrowing to finance its investment program, rather than on continuing
large-scale commercial borrowing. The April 1975 Consultative Group reviewed
the list of projects presented by the Peruvian Government and concluded that
project loan commitments of the order of $950 million annually would be
required during 1975-76. The Consultative Group recommended that external



financing should be provided on terms as favorable as possible (including
assistance on concessional terms) and agreed that some local cost financing was
needed. To ensure that the burden of debt service does not become excessive
in the late seventies and early eighties, at least one half of new loan
commitments should be obtained on terms similar to those of official lending
agencies. This is comparable with what was achieved during 1971-74.
11.       While actual inflows of external loans during 1975 may be similar
to what was expected by the Consultative Group, the average terms are much
harder. Only about one third of new commitments were obtained at terms
comparable to those of official lending agencies and the average maturity of
commercial loans was below five years. Together with the poorer prospects
for petroleum production this makes it even more critical for Peru to obtain
longer maturities in future borrowing. The public debt service ratio which
was 22 percent in 1974 rose to an estimated 27 percent in 1975 reflecting
mainly a sharp increase in interest payments and the decline in the value
of merchandise exports. Although the debt service ratio will remain high
for the rest of this decade, it should decline gradually in the early 1980's
if the Government continues its efforts to increase national savings and if
more suitable lending terms are obtained in future years.
12.       In sum, during recent years the Government has continued to carry
out the economic and social reforms initiated in 1968 and simultaneously
achieved a satisfactory rate of economic growth. While the Government is
committed to consolidate these reforms so as to move toward a more just
society, efforts are also being made to mobilize natural and financial
resources to achieve and finance a satisfactory expansion of the economy
and of per capita income. As has been the case in most other Latin American
countries, Peru has been seriously affected by the international recession
and is now experiencing considerable financial difficulties. The Government
has in the past shown pragmatism and flexibility in its economic management.
Since early 1975 it has taken measures designed to help solve the present
problems and is now preparing strong additional measures which are likely to
be implemented in the first quarter of 1976 and are aimed at raising the level
of savings, reducing inflation and the growth of imports.
13.       Given Peru's export prospects and the present structure of its
external debt, Peru will need a substantial amount of long-term financing to
meet its development requirements. Peru's ability to service the projected
levels of external debt is enhanced by the favorable medium-term export out-
look and the continued cautious management of its external financial position.
14.       Provided the efforts to restore and then maintain internal and
external financial stability continue, and the policies to develop natural
resources, improve human resources and increase the standards of living of
the rural poor continue to be pursued, Peru remains creditworthy for external
lending on conventional terms.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's 28th operation in Peru.
With the last $26 million loan for a highway project in the same transport
corridor, signed on July 1, 1974, Bank lending to Peru reached $318.2 million
net of cancellations. Of this amount, 45 percent has been for transportation
(mainly highways and ports), 26 percent for agriculture, 21 percent for
electric power and about 8 percent for education. In addition, a small loan
was made for industry. Bank lending to Peru during 1968-72 was limited to
a reconstruction loan made in 1970, due to a combination of factors, mainly
the Bank's concern over the Peruvian fiscal situation and balance of payments
prospects and the then outstanding investment disputes. As these problems
were being solved the Bank resumed lending to Peru in FY74 with three loans
for a total amount of $75 million. As lending was being resumed during that
period, Bank project identification and preparation activities proceeded,
laying the groundwork for increased lending.
16.       On July 25, 1975, the Government nationalized the assets of the
Marcona Mining Company in Peru without making provision for the payment of
compensation. Subsequent negotiations between the Company and the Government
did not reach a conclusion and the matter has now been taken up for negotia-
tion between the United States and Peruvian governments. Certain interim
understandings have been reached, and the discussions are continuing. In
these circumstances, it has seemed to me appropriate to present this loan
proposal to the Executive Directors. I intend to review progress made on
this matter prior to presentation to the Board of other loans now at an
advanced stage of consideration (see paragraph 19 below).
17.       IFC commitments to date have been about $24.0 million ($15 million
to Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper mining project
and the rest all in industry) of which $15.3 million is held by the Corpora-
tion. Project execution has been generally satisfactory. Annex II contains
a statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of October 31, 1975 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       The Bank plans to assist the Government in achieving its economic
and social development goals by aiding in: (a) the expansion of productive
capacity in crucial sectors; (b) the creation of a physical and social
infrastructure capable of sustaining and fostering the positive evolution
of the nation's productive capacity; and (c) the consolidation of structural
and institutional reform which will help the socioeconomic transformation now
underway. Also the Bank expects to continue to play a role in coordinating
external assistance through the mechanism of the Consultative Group, the
next meeting of which is scheduled to convene in late 1976, and will try to
become a catalyst for new sources of funds for major investment projects.



- 6 -
19.       The major emphasis of the Bank's medium-term program will be in
agriculture with a two-fold objective: raising the standard of living of
the large rural population of the highlands and increasing food production.
Following up on the agricultural sector mission which visited the country in
1974, Bank staff and the Bank/FAO Cooperative Program are assisting the
Government on the preparation of projects for rural development in the
Sierra and irrigation rehabilitation in the coastal area. A first irrigation
rehabilitation project is now being appraised. At present a mining project
is being appraised jointly with the IDB and negotiations for a joint financ-
ing operation are expected to take place shortly. This project of CENTROMIN-
PERU. which took over the Cerro de Pasco operations, is to expand copper
production and export, to reduce the environmental effects of the mining
operations, and to improve the living conditions of the miners. Also, a
power distribution project for the Lima metropolitan area, a sites and
services project to help alleviate poverty among the urban poor, and a DFC
project are currently being appraised. In addition, the Bank is identifying
otner projects in the power and transport sectors.   At present, kank loans to
Peru constitute about 5.8 percent of total outstanding debt, including undis-
bursed, and absorbed 4.8 percent of the country's external debt service obli-
gations in 1974.  No significant changes in these ratios are expected for the
next five years.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN PERU
20.       The Andes, the world's second highest mountain range, divide Peru
in three markedly different physical regions: the Coast, where most of the
industrial and modern agricultural development has taken place; the Andean
highlands, with most of the mining activities of the country; and the sparsely
populated Amazon jungle region, where lack of adequate transport facilities
has been a major constraint for the development of its resources. The economic
development of the country has been influenced considerably by this geographi-
cal division and has resulted in a concentration of most of the economic activ-
ity and wealth along the narrow coastal region, in particular the Lima-Callao
metropolitan area.  The absence of adequate transportation infrastructure
linking the three geographic areas has contributed greatly to this situation,
by limiting specialization and the generation of surpluses for exchange on the
basis of each region's comparative advantage.
21.       Transport facilities are constrained by the difficult topography
of Peru.  The Panamerican Highway, running the entire length of the country
near the coast, provides the backbone of the Peruvian network. Major secondary
roads and two railway lines link the most important coastal cities and the main
ports with large towns and mining centers in the Andean highlands. A few roads
leading into the Amazon jungle have been under construction for several years,



but the topographic, geologic and climatic conditions have largely contributed
to the absence of an all-year link between the coast and the interior of the
country. Aside from aviation, which provides limited transport capacity, the
only semi-permanent connection between the three regions is the Lima-Pucallpa
road, which links the Lima-Callao metropolitan area on the Coast to the Amazon
river, and through it to the Atlantic Ocean. However, some sections of this
road, as described below, still need major investments in drainage, protective
structures and pavement to provide for an all-weather road and reduce the
presently high maintenance and transport costs.
22.       The transportation system on the whole is in a rudimentary condi-
tion, resulting in high transport costs, long travel times, and considerable
damage to both vehicles and cargo. The road network comprises some 50,000 km
of roads of which only 5,000 km are paved. There are 35 ports, of which 11
handle most of Peru's international trade. The railway system is limited to
two separate lines, which largely specialize in ore transportation. In view
of the unusually difficult topographic condition of the country, the relatively
long distances involved and the still low volume of traffic between major
population centers in the three regions, air transportation is playing an
important role in opening up new areas --in particular the prospective oil
fields in the Amazon jungle-- linking various population centers in the
interior, where extensive fixed transport facilities cannot be justified,
and connecting major urban areas along the coast, where surface transportation
involves substantial travelling time. Overland transport in the Oriente Region
--the Peruvian Amazon Basin-- depends almost exclusively on the waterways
provided by the widespread Amazon river system.
23.       On the whole, the present transport system satisfies the minimum
requirements of the coastal area, but is inadequate to the development needs
of the mountainous and amazonic jungle regions. In view of the high cost of
road investments in Peru, more careful screening of investment projects than
in the past is required and the Government is appropriately cautious in its
investment decisions for new roads. Contrary to the ambitious road develop-
ment plans of the past, the Government's strategy is to give relatively low
priority to new road construction in the short term, unless it is part of a
broader development scheme, while emphasizing road maintenance, for which
budgetary allocations have been increased considerably during the last few
years. As to the longer term transport requirements, there is no doubt that
substantial investments in roads will be needed in the future.
24.       To carry out this strategy, the Government is increasingly focussing
on three key aspects that need to be strengthened: the transport planning and
coordination mechanisms, the maintenance level of existing roads and the
technical know-how to build roads in the Andean terrain. As to the first
aspect, improvement has been noted since 1969, when coordination and admini-
stration of the transport sector, which was carried out by various agencies,
was centralized in the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In addition,
to strengthen the still limited planning capacity of the Ministry, the Bank
has been entrusted as Executing Agency of a United Nations Development



- 8 -
Programme-financed project to assist the Government in reviewing its policies
and practices, evaluate the system of data collection, existing transport
studies, and other related matters, in order to establish improved planning
and review procedures, assist in the preparation of economic plans, and train
the Peruvian technicians needed to set up an effective planning organization.
The Bank was also involved, together with the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America, in a technical assistance program which intended
to provide the necessary statistical information on a continuing basis for
transportation planning purposes. These efforts should help the Government
in screening larger and more complicated investment projects which will be
required to meet the longer-term transportation requirements of the country.
25.       In the past the maintenance level of existing highway infrastructure
has been poor and there has been serious deterioration of roads through in-
adequate and insufficient repair and resurfacing. This resulted from in-
sufficient allocations of funds for maintenance, partly because of past fiscal
stringencies. The Government has nearly quadrupled the maintenance budget
since 1967 and has doubled it again for 1975-76, but even so, the maintenance
budget is still not large enough. As the financial constraint is removed,
other limitationis, mainly organizational and lack of qualified staff, are
likely to prove to be more pressing. In order to help remove this latter
constraint, the Bank financed under the 1970 highway reconstruction loan a
study of a maintenance program and the related training requirements for such
a program, and the Government agreed to take action in the light of the study's
recommendations in connection with the loan for the sixth highway project
(Loan 1025-PE).
26.       As to the development of technology for road construction, the
Andean highland configuration poses serious difficulties in road design and
construction methods. The combination of unstable terrain, difficult seismic,
geological and soil conditions and torrential rains cause frequent floodings
and landslides with consequent damage to the roads. Although significant
experience has been gained in recent construction work through the Andes,
particularly in the Bank-financed La Oroya-Aguaytia road, extensive geotechnic
studies are still required to fully evaluate past experience and to adopt more
adequate construction technology. Such studies are being carried out under
the sixth highway project.
27.       Following the petroleum products price increases which were intro-
duced on July 1, 1975, (which included 100%, 66% and 25% increases in the
price of premium and regular gasoline and diesel, respectively), the level
of road user charges in Peru is now considered adequate, but the structure
of such charges needs to be improved. Although there is an element of
differential taxation iTI the present structure by taxing gasoline more
heavily in the Coast than in the Amazonic jungle, for example, it appears
that charges paid by the Lima-Callao area do not cover the social costs
generated by private vehicles used for urban traffic. Also, indications
are that a large portion of truckers are not paying their share of road use
since diesel oil is not specially taxed and these truckers are the major
contributors to rapid deterioration of the road network. As a step towards



improving this situation the Government is, under the sixth highway project,
carrying out a study of the marginal costs of the various vehicles using the
road network in Peru, and the conclusions of such a study will be used as an
input for revising road user charges.
28.       Ports in Peru, including river ports, are operated and managed
by the National Port Authority (Empresa Nacional de Puertos - ENAPU) under
the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, but the
responsibility for overall planning, preparation and construction of new ports
(and in some cases major expansion of existing ones) rests with the Ministry.
This separation of functions between the Ministry and ENAPU is not entirely
satisfactory and the Government and the Port Authority have undertaken to
study the means to increase the effective participation of ENAPU in the
planning, preparation and execution of new projects and eventually to transfer
these responsibilities to ENAPU. Action on this matter will be followed up
in the context of future port projects. ENAPU was created in 1969 under the
auspices of Bank Loan 446-PE for the Port of Pisco and its record has been
good. ENAPU charges tariffs to port users and collects concession fees from
private ports owned and operated by industrial and commercial enterprises.
Although the overall revenue of ENAPU exceeds operating expenses plus the
amortization of debt assigned to it, the level and structure of tariffs need
to be revised to reflect more accurately the costs of the services provided
and to generate cash for future investments. ENAPU is aware of this need and
is presently carrying out a tariff study with the aim of requesting a revision
later next year.
29.       The Amazon River system's fleet consists of over 250 commercial
vessels of different caliber (from seagoing ships to motor boats) and age.
At present old river boats are being replaced by modern ones and there is
also a trend towards bigger barges. Government and private enterprise are
currently expanding substantially the river fleet capacity to meet the in-
creasing traffic demand particularly due to the oil exploration activities
in the area.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project would be the 13th in Peru's transportation
sector receiving Bank financing; it was appraised in May/June 1974 and sub-
sequent to completion of the complementary studies recommended by the ap-
praisal mission, was negotiated in Washington, D. C. on June 9-13, 1975. The
Peruvian delegation was led by Mr. Franklin Caceres, Executive Director
General of Public Credit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and included
representatives of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and ENAPU.
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. An Appraisal Report
No. 659a-PE dated December 15, 1975, on the project is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.

Background
31.       While the ports and railway projects have been carried out relative-
ly smoothly, experience with the road projects has usually been difficult.
Two of the loans, totalling $15 million, were made for road maintenance
(127-PE and 300-PE) with mixed results in the first (due to inadequate counter-
part funds and initial administrative difficulties) and considerable success
in the second. The reconstruction project, (706-PE), geared to build up roads
in an earthquake stricken area and to provide technical assistance to improve
road maintenance efforts, is now proceeding satisfactorily after delays in
the engineering work. Bank involvement in the Lima-Amazon transport corridor
is summarized in the following table:

32.       The first two road improvement projects in the Lima-Amazon road
were plagued with difficulties from the outset. The first one (271-PE),
which helped finance the reconstruction and pavement of about 170 km of the
Aguaytia-Pucallpa road, was only 80 percent completed when loan funds were
exhausted in 1967, mainly because of the unexpectedly difficult soils and
climatic conditions. At that time, because of the stringent fiscal situation,
the Government was unable to raise funds to continue the works. Extensive
failures have since occurred in the work done. Financing for the construction
works to complete a portion of this road (the Pucallpa-Neshuya section) to
the originally projected standards were included in Loan 1025-PE of 1974,
and financing for the construction works needed to complete the road
(Aguaytia-Neshuya section) is included in the proposed loan. The second
road improvement loan (425-PE) was made to finance the construction works
on the La Oroya-Aguaytia road; however, after large cost overruns, the Bank
agreed in November 1969 to reduce the scope of the project, which was completed
by January 1973. The remaining works to complete the La Oroya-Aguaytia road
are being carried out in two stages, the first one --between Huanuco and
Aguaytia-- is covered under Loan 1025-PE, and the second one --between Huanuco
and La Oroya-- would be covered under the proposed project as explained more



fully below. Despite large overruns in project costs the investments remain
economically justified by the increase in traffic already experienced along
the corridor.
Description
33.       The proposed project consists of:
(a)  Improvement of the road between Lima and the port of Pucallpa,
comprising completion of construction and improvement of four
road sections, and improvement of two feeder roads leading into
the main corridor, as follows:
(i) San Mateo-Morococha (35 km);
(ii)  La Oroya-Huanuco (234 km);
(iii) Aguaytia-Neshuya (106 km);
(iv) Access road to Pucallpa and its river port,
including some streets of Pucallpa (9 km); and
(v) Improvement of two feeder roads leading into the
Lima-Pucallpa road:   Tambo del Sol-Huachon (90 km)
and Huanuco-Churubamba (20 km).
(b)  Improvement of the upper Amazon River transport system
comprising construction of new ports at Pucallpa and Yurimaguas,
expansion of the existing port at Iquitos, and provision of
cargo-handling equipment at all three ports;
(c)  Procurement of road maintenance equipment and workshop
installations;
(d)  Procurement of equipment and craft for hydrological
observations; and
(e)  Consulting services for:
(i) feasibility and detailed engineering studies for 115 km
of the road sections included under (a) iii and (a) iv
above;
(ii) updating of economic and financial evaluation studies
for ports under (b) above;
(iii) master plan and feasibility studies of priority sections
for the coastal corridor;



- 12 -
(iv) feasibility study of the Ambo-Huacho road;
(v)  feasibility study of a number of regional airports;
(vi) regional development plan for the Selva Central area; and
(vii) supervision of construction of items (a) and (b) and of
procurement in items (c) and (d).
34.       This project is a continuation of a series of projects which aim
at completing the construction of an all-weather road across the range of
mountains and improving and/or constructing the main river ports in the Amazon
River system which the road is going to feed with increased traffic. The
main objective of the project which is obviously associated with projects
financed under Loans 271-PE, 425-PE, & 1025-PE, is to provide an efficient
access to Peru's hinterland by significantly reducing transport costs along
the road from the Coast to Pucallpa, minimizing closures of this road in
extreme weather conditions, and by reducing transport costs at the transfer
point to the Amazon River system in Pucallpa, and at the two other major ports
in the system, namely, Yurimaguas and Iquitos. The project would not only
substantially improve the link between the Coast and the Amazon jungle but
also improve access to a number of other economically underdeveloped areas
with rich agricultural potential, where spontaneous settlements of peasants
from the highlands have already taken place with the road developments thus
far in the area and some Government assistance; it would also improve the
transport conditions in the jungle along the river as the new or expanded
ports with adequate handling equipment will increase the transport capacity
and efficiency of the river system.
35.       Bank involvement in the project is also aimed at assuring appro-
priate design standards, execution and ensuing maintenance of the road. Most
highway projects involve a tradeoff between construction costs, on the one
hand, and maintenance and vehicle operating costs, on the other. The minimum
cost solution which has been worked out during appraisal of the project has
resulted in relatively modest engineering standards for a number of sections
of the road, in the most difficult mountainous stretches, which would call
for an important maintenance effort. To meet this requirement, the acquisi-
tion and utilization (in accordance with an agreed program) of the necessary
maintenance equipment for the entire road from La Oroya to Pucallpa is pro-
vided under Loan 1025-PE and the proposed loan. The project will also have
an impact on the administrative and financial performance of ENAPU as re-
flected in the covenants agreed upon with the Port Authority on working
ratios, rate of return and audit, and will provide the basis for sound in-
stitutional reforms in the future.
36.       The project will be executed by the Ministry of Transport and
Commnications through its Directorate General of Land Transport as far as
road construction and improvement is concerned, and through the Directorate



- 13 -
General of Water Transport as regards the river transport investments. The
organizational structure which now combines highway planning, design, con-
struction and maintenance under only one directorate will help improve per-
formance. However, due to the multimodal composition of the project which
involves two General Directorates and the National Port Authority, the
appointment of a Project Coordinator within the Ministry of Transport and
Communications has been agreed upon with the Government. He will coordinate
the various units involved, will monitor progress, and report to the
Vice-Minister on project execution. This project coordinator will also
carry out the same functions with regard to the sixth highway project
(Loan 1025-PE) which is intimately linked to the proposed project, so as
to ensure a parallel progress on both segments of the Transandean Corridor.
(Section 4.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). Under these arrangements, and
with the assistance of consultants services provided for under the proposed
loan (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement), and with the experience
gained from previous construction works across the Andes, it is expected
that the project will be satisfactorily executed by mid-1980. Upon completion
of the port works, the assets will be transferred to ENAPU as equity and will
be operated and maintained by it (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement);
ENAPU has proven administrative and technical capability to carry out these
functions.
Costs and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project (excluding interest during construction)
is estimated at $128.7 million equivalent of which about $69.4 million--or 54
percent--is in foreign exchange. This cost estimate includes allowances for
increases in both quantities and prices which amount to $10.2 million and $28.4
million, respectively. Price increases have been estimated at a rate of 22
percent per annum in 1975, 18 percent in 1976 and 15 percent thereafter for
local currency costs and at rates varying from 7 to 16 percent per annum, de-
pending on the year and the item procured, for foreign costs; also, a 15 percent
quantity contingency was used for road works in consideration of the unusually
difficult geological and climatic conditions of the area and the recent history
of slope failures during construction; for the river ports a 10 percent allow-
ance for physical contingencies has been made.
38.       The proposed $76.5 million loan would finance the estimated foreign
exchange costs of the project ($69.4 million) and 50 percent of interest and
other charges on the loan during the construction period ($7.1 million). The
proposed term of 25 years corresponds to the estimated economic life of the
bulk of the project, i.e. the road components; the proposed grace period of
five years, roughly corresponds to the loan disbursement period.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Construction contracts will be awarded after international competi-
tive bidding except for the (a) construction and improvement of feeder roads,
which because of their dispersed locations and small size, the Borrower would



- 14 -
have the option to carry out by force account under supervision of consultants
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) civil works at the port of Iquitos, which are
currently being carried out by SIMA (a state enterprise which possesses
the required construction capability and is in a favorable position to build
these structures quickly using the steel available in stock and its well
equiped workshops and slipways on the river bank) under a negotiated contract
with the Government on terms unlikely to be improved by other organizations.
Procurement of equipment is to be made through international competitive
bidding, with local suppliers to be granted a margin of preference of 15
percent of the CIF bid price or the customs duties payable by a non-exempt
importer, whichever is less. At present, hardly any cargo handling or road
maintenance equipment is produced in Peru.
40.       Disbursements will be made on the following basis:    (a) 48 percent
of total expenditures for civil works contracts, and of total expenditures
certified by consultants in the case of works carried out by force account;
(b) 100 percent of foreign exchange costs --or 100 percent of the ex-factory
cost of locally produced goods-- of road maintenance, cargo handling, dredging
and hydrological equipment: and (c) 57 percent of total expenditures for
consulting services. No disbursements will be made for expenditures incurred
prior to the date of the proposed loan, except for those incurred after
July 1974 for civil works at the port of Iquitos and consulting services for
the preparation of the project and up to a maximum of $1.74 million; based
on the project execution schedule, the proposed loan would be fully disbursed
by mid-1980.
Financial Position of ENAPU and the River Ports
41.       ENAPU's revenues consist of tariffs collected for services provided
by the ports it operates and fees paid by the owner-operators of private port
facilities. Past financial performance of ENAPU has been satisfactory,
although it has deteriorated since 1971 largely as a consequence of the abrupt
reduction of fishmeal exports but also due to increasing operating costs and
constant tariffs since 1968. As of the end of 1974 ENAPU had net fixed assets
of S/.4,017 ($89.0 million) and over S/.400 million ($8.9 million) in cash
deposits with the Treasury. Current assets are about six times current
liabilities and long-term debt is less than 10 percent of equity due to the
Government's present policy of contributing new assets as equity. Financial
projections based on current commodities exports and imports prospects show
that an increase in revenue of about 40 percent would be required during
1975-76 to achieve in 1977 a 6 percent return on net fixed assets without
including concession fees or other revenues which are not related to services
provided by ENAPU. The port authority is presently carrying out a tariff
study with a view to proposing the necessary adjustments and it has agreed
to revise its tariffs prior to the end of 1976 and thereafter from time to time
to achieve the target of a 6 percent return on net fixed assets (Section 3.03
of draft Project Agreement). Such a return would generate enough cash to cover
all financial responsibilities presently assigned to ENAPU by the Government,
as well as a reasonable contribution to the financing of the construction of
new ports presently assigned to Directorate for Water Transport.



- 15 -
42.       Port services at Iquitos have generally been priced below their
marginal cost as part of the Government's subsidy policy for the development
of the Jungle Region, the cash deficits being made up by a combination of
private concession fee revenues and straight subsidies from ENAPU. Under the
proposed loan it has been agreed, however, that tariffs in Iquitos will be
adjusted so as to achieve a working ratio of 100 by 1978, excluding concession
fees which are collected in the area (Section 3.03 of draft Project Agreement).
The ports of Pucallpa and Yurimaguas presently have no facilities or tariffs,
but once the ports are built, tariffs will be set at such level as would be
required to obtain a working ratio of 100 by 1979 for the three ports as a
group since they function as a closed system, the traffic generated at each
one of them feeding the others (Section 3.03 of draft Project Agreement).
This financial policy still involves an element of subsidy, equal to depre-
ciation and the opportunity cost of capital; this is considered acceptable
to promote the development of the Jungle Region and consistent with the
overall regional development policy of the Government endorsed by the Bank.
Justification
43.       The proposed project is economically well justified with an economic
rate of return of 23 percent for the road element and 22 percent for the ports
component. Each of the items making up both elements is also justified in-
dividually with rates of return ranging from 9 percent to more than 30 percent.
The proposed project is expected to have an important developmental effect in
both the Jungle Region and the areas to be served by the roads component of
the project by reducing transport costs and, hence, promoting economic activity.
At present transport costs along the corridor vary from 10 percent to 29 per-
cent of the wholesale market prices of the main products of the Jungle Region.
It is, therefore, expected that the reduction of transport costs resulting
from this project will have an important positive development impact on the
area, as has been already experienced under past transport projects along the
corridor.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between ENAPU and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of the
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       The draft Loan and Project Agreements conform to the normal pattern
for loans for road and port projects.



- 16 -
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

the chosen periods are "before the crisis" and "since the crisis".
3/ No trend exists, values are very scattered with a sharp peak in 1970, a year of record current account surplus.
4/ Refers to 1962-68.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 418-PE:     San Lorenzo Irrigation Project; US$11 million Loan of June
18, 1965; Effective Date: November 24, 1965; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
Because of inadequacy of water supply, the Bank agreed to reduce the
project area; consequently, the project was redefined and the original loan
amount of US$11.0 million was reduced to US$6.5 million. (See Memorandum to
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

the Executive Directors "Peru; Proposed Change in Loan 418-PE", February 28,
1968-33). The Closing Date, originally June 20, 1967, was postponed four times,
first to June 30, 1969, then to December 31, 1973, then to December 31, 1974,
and then to June 30, 1976. The last postponement of the Closing Date was
granted to allow the Borrower to use the undisbursed amount of the loan
(US$350,000) for the replacement of a valve at the San Lorenzo reservoir,
which is important for the overall operation of the system. The project has
encountered a number of difficulties, both administrative and technical but
these problems are being overcome. Project management has been strengthened
and the last part of the project related to the drainage scheme is progressing
satisfactorily. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the revised
Closing Date.
Loan 706-PE:   Road Reconstruction Project;   US$ 30 million
Loan of September 14, 1970; Effective Date: October 26, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This loan was signed only three and a half months after the earth-
quake in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility
study and final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken much longer
than expected because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal,
because of administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with the
on-going decentralization of the Central Government, and because of problems
with the consultants engaged to study and supervise the project. Construction
of a short section of road near Huaraz, the capital of the region, is near
completion. Work is well advanced on the two remaining sections along the
Callejon; bidding for the access road has now taken place and construction of
this last section has also started. The road reconstruction element of
the project is expected to be completed by the end of 1976, 15 months later
than the original Closing Date of the loan, which has been extended according-
ly.
Loan 933-PE:   Agricultural Credit Project;   US$25.0 million Loan of
September 12, 1973; Effective Date: December 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and became effective on
December 12, 1973. Although the project had a slow start, progress is now
satisfactory.  Disbursements are now on schedule.
Loan 949-PE:   Education Project;   US$24.0 million Loan of Decmeber 5, 1973;
Effective Date: March 5, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan became effective on March 5, 1974. Serious initial delays
were caused by administrative difficulties with the Project Unit and late
appointment of counterpart staff to the consultants who were to define
curricula for the ESEPs (Escuelas Superiores de Ensenanza Profesional). The

recent change of status of the Project Unit which has been upgraded to the
rank of Directorate General and the strengthened management of the project
have markedly improved the prospects for efficient implementation of the
project.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; US$26 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids for construction works were invited in October 1974, on the
basis of the official cost estimates, but contractors failed to respond. After
an upward revision of the cost estimates new invitations to bid were issued in
March 1975. Contractors response this time has been positive and bids for all
sections have been submitted. Project implementation is eight months behind
schedule.
