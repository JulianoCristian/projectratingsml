                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Compensatory Education Project is to improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of children
                         in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic education levels
                         that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and municipalities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         2010-11 school year, as in the previous ISR. New data is expected to be collected at the beginning of the next school year. Despite initial lags in disbursements, the Project exceeded
                         disbursement estimates for 2011 and has caught up with projected disbursements. Some examples of good progress (from 2011): the gap in test scores between the 172 target
