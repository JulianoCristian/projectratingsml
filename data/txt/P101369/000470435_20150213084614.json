"The Compensatory Education Project for\n            received a satisfactory outcome rating with low risk to\n            development outcome. The Bank\u0092s performance was rated\n            moderately satisfactory while the Borrower received a\n            satisfactory rating. There was one restricting that took\n            place within this project. The change was a reallocation of\n            funds from Categories 2 and 6 to Category 1. This change was\n            requested in order to disburse the full loan before Project\n            closing. There were no revisions to the PDO or project\n            components. The Project provided a number of lessons that\n            were considered in preparation of the follow-on operation.\n            With respect to the Early Childhood Development (ECD)\n            intervention, there were lessons learned about sessions\n            specifically targeted at fathers, which were unsuccessful.\n            Future efforts to engage fathers should be better suited to\n            the cultural and gender norms that prevail in many of these\n            areas. The Mobile Pedagogical Support (API) program has also\n            provided valuable lessons. Since engagement with parents is\n            an important element of the program, visits by APIs to\n            parents will be held on weekends, in order to maximize the\n            probability that fathers who work outside the village of\n            origin are present, since women are less likely to receive\n            the API when they are home alone. One key lesson learned\n            from the program is the need for more frequent supervision\n            by National Council for Educational Development (CONAFE) of\n            schools targeted by the program. From an administrative\n            viewpoint, expense categories under the Project did not\n            correspond with Project Components, making it difficult for\n            the Implementing Agency to monitor Project costs.\n            Categorization of expenses by component, rather than by\n            procurement category, would allow for a better understanding\n            of outputs and activities by component in future projects."}, "docdt": "2015-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
