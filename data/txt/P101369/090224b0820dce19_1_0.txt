                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Compensatory Education Project is to improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of children
                         in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic education levels
                         that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and municipalities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With only 9 months before the end of the Project, the counterpart is showing very good progress towards the achievement of the Project Development Objective and in implementing
                         activities. The data presented in this ISR is mostly based on the Progress Report for the first semester of 2013, with the indicators referring to the ENLACE results for the year 2013
                         still pending. Some examples of good progress: the number of children attending at least 80 percent of the ECD sessions financed by the Project has grown from 43,241 in 2009 to
                         57,983 in 2013 in the 172 target municipalities. The number of established ECD service points in the same municipalities increased from 2,885 in 2009 to 3,498 in 2013. The
