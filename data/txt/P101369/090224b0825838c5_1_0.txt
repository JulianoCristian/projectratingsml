                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Compensatory Education Project is to improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of children
                         in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic education levels
                         that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and municipalities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objective of the Compensatory Education Project has been achieved. For instance, the number of children attending at least 80 percent of the ECD
                         sessions financed by the Project in the 172 target municipalities increased to 57,983 in 2013, from 43,241 in 2009. The number of established ECD service points in the same
                         municipalities increased from 2,885 in 2009 to 3,498 in 2013. The percentile in which the median ENLACE test score for primary education in the 172 target localities falls in the
                         national distribution increased from 5.80 percentile in school year 2008-2009 to 12.23 in school year 2012-2013. The increase for the median test score in secondary has been even

                         Project led to an improvement of learning outcomes.
