                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Compensatory Education Project is to improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of
                         children in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic
                         education levels that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and municipalities.

                         Project became effective on August 26, 2011. Despite the delay in effectiveness, the counterpart has been able to make good progress in the achievement of the Project
                         Development Objective, as can be seen from the advances in the indicators. For example, the gap in test scores between the 172 target municipalities and the national level is

                         on implementing activities. The rating for Implementation Progress has therefore been upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
