1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Mexico’s great strides in reducing poverty and improving educational outcomes have been
met with persistent inequity, particularly for indigenous populations and disadvantaged
communities. Increased coverage in basic education narrowed some gaps for disadvantaged groups
by achieving near-universal coverage among pre-school children aged 4 and 5 and primary school
students, and educational attainment improved from 6.8 years in 1993 to 8.4 in 2006. Enrollment
among primary and lower secondary school-aged indigenous children also increased, from 69.8
percent in 19901 to 91.5 percent in 2005, compared to 94.7 percent nationally. In addition, poor
children aged 5-14 living in rural areas were enrolled at 93.7 percent in 2006, up from 89.5 percent
in 2000.

2.      Concerns remained, however, about the quality of learning. Mexico had the lowest PISA
results among all OECD countries, marginalized populations continued to face unequal education
opportunities, and the quality of education services that did reach these communities was low.
Recognizing quality as a key issue, the Ministry of Public Education’s (Secretaría de Educación
Pública, SEP) Sectoral Program for Education (Programa Sectorial de Educación, PSE) 2007-
2012 included as its first objective to elevate education quality to improve students’ academic
achievement. In addition, the Alliance for Education Quality (La Alianza Para la Calidad de
Educación) was created by agreement between the Federal Government and the teacher’s union,
the National Syndicate for Education Workers (Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la
Educación, SNTE), with the goal of improving student learning through a transformation of
management and service delivery. Increased evidence of the effectiveness of Early Child
Development (ECD) programs also led to substantive, albeit uncoordinated, expansion of
programs targeting children ages 0-4, such as the Programa de Estancias Infantiles (SEDESOL),
daycare facilities (IMSS, ISSSTE), and Centros de Desarrollo Infantil (CENDI). In marginalized
communities, ECD services proved to be a cost-effective intervention, however, coverage was
limited.

3.      The rationale for Bank involvement was threefold: first, support to the National Council
for Educational Development (Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo, CONAFE) in targeting
rural and indigenous areas complemented the Bank-supported Quality Schools Program
(Programa Escuelas de Calidad, PEC), which focused on the peri-urban poor. CONAFE supports
educational services at the national level in the most marginalized communities in Mexico. Second,
the Project was an important supply-side response to the Oportunidades program, which the Bank
was co-supporting. Third, the focus on basic education (comprising pre-primary, primary, and
lower secondary) was a natural fit with the then forthcoming policy-based Bank operation on upper
secondary, and the ongoing project at tertiary level. The Project was also in line with the National
Development Plan (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, PND) and the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Mexico for FY 2008-13. The Project also contributed to the objectives outlined
in the PSE and the Alliance for Quality Education to increase equality of educational opportunities
and to increase community participation in education.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.     The Project development objective (PDO) of the Compensatory Education Project was to
improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of children
in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. The PDO is measured through two Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs):

        Gap in test scores between the 172 municipalities and the national level.
        Number of children 0-4 years old who attend at least 80 percent of the sessions of the ECD
         intervention in target municipalities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

5.      The Project targeted compensatory and community2 schools in the 172 most marginalized
municipalities in the country, focused both on young children (0-4) for the ECD component, and
students grades 1-6 (primary) and grades 7-9 (9th grade is referred to throughout as 3rd year of
secondary). The 172 municipalities were previously identified under CONAFE’s Agenda for
Equitable Education (Agenda Educativa para la Equidad); these were selected through the
combined criteria of (high or very high) marginalization and social and educational decline and
minimum numbers of potential beneficiaries, so as to reach as broad a segment of the population
living in marginalized municipalities as possible, in line with CONAFE’s mandate. CONAFE’s
programs are implemented nationwide, but the Project provided additional support to expand
CONAFE’s services in the 172 most marginalized municipalities. Marginalization levels are
determined by the National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Población, CONAPO).3
Interventions were further targeted based on additional factors: ECD focused on communities with
at least eight families, and with the highest infant mortality rates and teenage pregnancy rates;
school-based management (SBM) interventions sought to benefit indigenous compensatory
schools, as well as community schools, while mobile pedagogical support targeted compensatory
and community schools with the poorest performance on the National Evaluation of Academic
Achievement in Schools (Evaluación Nacional del Logro Académico de Centros Escolares,
ENLACE) test, in the 172 municipalities and beyond.



2
  Compensatory schools are regular, non-community schools run by the SEP, located in marginalized, rural, or
indigenous communities that receive additional funding, or compensatory programs, from CONAFE. Community
schools are managed entirely by CONAFE in rural and marginalized areas that lack regular schools.
3
  CONAPO’s marginalization index is a composite of the following eight socioeconomic indicators:1) percentage of
population aged 15 or more that is illiterate; 2) percentage of population aged 15 years or more without complete
primary education; 3) percentage of private homes without drainage or toilet; 4) percentage of private homes without
power; 5) percentage of private homes without running water inside the house; 6) percentage of private homes with
some level of overcrowding; 7) percentage of private homes with dirt floors; 8) percentage of private homes without
a refrigerator. When ranked in order of the marginalization index, those localities in the highest two out of five sub-
intervals are defined by CONAPO as having ‘very high’ and ‘high’ grades of marginalization.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Early Childhood Development Intervention (US$30.0 million)

6.      This Component supported activities to expand ECD services. The Project supported
existing CONAFE ECD programs and sought to expand and improve the level of support to the
neediest 172 municipalities around the country. Activities under this component were:
    (a) provision of technical assistance and capacity building to ECD promoters, module
        supervisors, and zone coordinators to deliver the capacity building to parents, relatives and
        caregivers of children aged 0-4;
    (b) provision of out-of-school capacity building to parents, relatives and caregivers of children
        aged 0-4 to improve their competencies and practices in caring for children and contribute
        to the children’s comprehensive development and school readiness; and
    (c) provision of technical assistance to design capacity building materials for the capacity
        building of parents, relatives and caregivers of children aged 0-4.

Component 2: Interventions in Basic Education (US$63.2 million)

7.     This Component supported activities to support basic education in the most marginalized
schools and municipalities in Mexico. Activities included:

   (a) Sub-component 2.1: This Sub-component supported SBM interventions in compensatory
       and community schools. In compensatory schools, the Project supported CONAFE’s
       ongoing SBM program, Support for School Management (Apoyo a la Gestión Escolar,
       AGE), which was introduced in 1996. The Project supported capacity building of
       Community Advisors (Asesores Comunitarios, CAs), and their subsequent capacity
       building of parents’ associations (Asociaciones de Padres de Familia, APFs), and the
       provision of direct support to APFs, with special emphasis on the targeted 172
       municipalities (most schools were in the 172 municipalities, but some were not). The
       Project supported a new and similar SBM modality in community schools, Community
       Strengthening for Education (Fortalecimiento Comunitario para la Educación,
       FORTALECE). CONAFE’s community education model relies on support from
       Associations to Promote Community Education (Asociaciones Promotoras de Educación
       Comunitaria, APECs), which are comprised of parents, tutors, and other community
       members to manage the community school model in their communities, and even house
       and feed community school teachers assigned by CONAFE. In FORTALECE, APECs are
       the equivalent of APFs for AGE. Both APECs and APFs received direct support for minor
       school repairs and rehabilitation, minor infrastructure improvements, educational materials,
       and activities to improve the school environment and enhance collaboration and
       accountability mechanisms at the school level.
   (b) Sub-component 2.2: This Sub-component supported mobile pedagogical support (Asesoría
       Pedagógica Itinerante, API) to under-performing students, teachers and parents of students
       in under-performing schools (as determined by ENLACE scores, where at least 30% of
       students received low scores) through mobile tutors. Activities under this Component
       focused on the 172 municipalities and beyond; other areas (with the same ENLACE
       criteria), were also covered depending on schools’ capacity for absorption of the program



                                                 3
       (minimum number of students, in multi-grade classrooms, with two teachers or less).
       Mobile tutors would, for a one-year academic cycle, divide their time between two separate
       schools, spending 15 days in each school per month; the first and focal school was one
       within the list of those with the lowest ENLACE scores, and the second school was chosen
       by geographic proximity. The Project also provided technical assistance to design materials
       for tutors to provide mobile pedagogical support.
   (c) Sub-component 2.3: This Sub-component comprised an innovative pilot that was designed
       to transfer managerial and supervision responsibility for public service delivery,
       particularly CONAFE-run educational services such as ECD, to municipalities. The pilot,
       Gestión Municipal para la Equidad Educativa (GEMUN), focused on five municipalities
       in different states, for which the Project provided support for (only) technical assistance,
       namely expenses incurred for capacity building of staff at the municipal level.

Component 3: Project Monitoring, Management and Evaluation (US$3.2 million)

8.      This Component supported the provision of technical assistance and capacity building to
strengthen the capacity of CONAFE to implement the Project, and provision of technical
assistance and capacity building to CONAFE and external stakeholders (such as associations with
an interest in local development, municipal associations, etc.) to monitor and evaluate the Project.
One of the main activities under Component 3 was the creation and implementation of an
integrated management and monitoring module for ECD, AGEs, FORTALECE and APIs. This
component also included support for impact evaluations (IEs) of several Project activities
including ECD and APIs, as well as Project supervision by CONAFE in areas covered by the
Project.

N/A

1.7 Other significant changes

9.     The Project was restructured on June 6, 2014, in order to reallocate funds from Categories
2 (School direct support) and 6 (Unallocated funds) to Category 1 (Consultant Services and
Capacity support), in order to disburse the full loan before Project closing.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

10.     The Project was designed to complement both the Government’s and Bank’s strategies to
improve access to educational services and learning outcomes in the most marginalized
communities. The second part of the PDO was slightly unclear (whether improved learning
outcomes pertained to children attending ECD services or to children in basic education). The
PDO indicators, however, made clear that the second half of the PDO referred in fact to primary
and lower secondary students. The design focused largely on the provision of additional support
to the 172 municipalities that CONAFE had identified as the most marginalized. The Project’s
greater emphasis on compensatory schools followed the Bank’s and IADB’s traditional division



                                                 4
of labor, whereby the Bank supports CONAFE’s compensatory actions, while the IADB supports
community schools.

11.      Based on the experience of the Basic Education Development Project in Support of the
Third Phase of the Basic Education Development Program (P085851, Loan 7249-MX, the
Project’s predecessor, also known as PAREIB III), where State Coordinating Units (state-level
PIUs) were closed when the project’s support ended, the Project supported a more sustainable
structure. Implementation was supported by, and capacity strengthening provided for, CONAFE’s
State Delegations in states covered by Project activities (primarily the eight states in which the 172
municipalities are located), which are responsible for service delivery throughout the state. The
Project would strengthen project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity
within each delegation, with designated resources under Component 3 for supervision of Project
activities.

12.     The design was evidence-based and built on experience and lessons learned from previous
Bank projects with CONAFE. The experience of PAREIB III, whereby fathers’ participation in
ECD proved to be lower than expected, was addressed by tailoring a series of programs specifically
for fathers. A previous ECD evaluation showed that interventions would result in greater gains
with the direct participation of children, and activities were thus designed to dedicate more time
to direct interventions with children and parents by including children in some sessions. For
Component 2, lessons from SBM programs in other countries were incorporated into the design,
in addition to improvements in targeting criteria, capacity building materials, and the expansion of
SBM to community schools (and not just compensatory schools). The Project also incorporated
lessons learned from CONAFE’s prior experience with APIs, namely broadening the scope of
API’s activities to include pedagogical support to children, support to teachers, and outreach to
parents, in addition to making greater efforts to match the language skills of APIs to their
designated areas, particularly in indigenous areas.

2.2 Implementation

13.     There was a 14-month delay in reaching Project effectiveness. The Loan Agreement was
signed on June 9, 2010, whereby one of the conditions of effectiveness was the signature of a
contract (Contrato de Mandato) between the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de
Hacienda y Crédito Público, SHCP), the National Financial Development Bank (Nacional
Financiera, S.N.C., I.B.D, NAFIN), and CONAFE. The condition of effectiveness was met with
some delays, because the standard Contrato de Mandato was being redrafted at the time, and the
Project became effective on August 26, 2011. Project activities were not affected in spite of
effectiveness delays.

14.     Under Component 1, ECD sessions geared specifically toward fathers and awareness-
raising activities were an innovative approach to incentivize greater participation of fathers in
communities with limited male participation, which is frequent in Mexico and other countries in
the region, due to strong social norms that limit fathers’ involvement. Fathers were also allowed
to participate in joint sessions with mothers, but no mechanism was put in place to monitor their
participation (separately from mothers)—the Project was unable to fully capture, therefore, their
actual participation. Fathers-only sessions did not manage to attract fathers as expected.



                                                  5
15.     The AGE intervention supported capacity building for CAs and direct support and capacity
building for APFs, and also led to refinements in the program overall, namely the evolution of
AGE operational guidelines in 2013. Guidelines were expanded to cover areas beyond
management of the support to more comprehensive thematic capacity building for parents, and the
number of APF sessions was expanded from four to six per year by the end of the Project. The
API program focused first on compensatory schools, but changed course mid-way through the
Project to community schools. In 2011, APIs in compensatory schools were met with several
challenges: resistance from teachers, lack of interest by students and parents, and unexpectedly
high levels of illiteracy, even in higher grade levels, among others. In 2012, APIs were placed
instead in community schools, which tend to have lower enrollment and are worse performing on
the ENLACE test. Similar issues were encountered in these schools, but given the smaller scope,
APIs were able to provide more focalized attention to students, teachers, and even the community
at large. For example, to incentivize parental involvement, several APIs resorted to tutoring their
students at home in order to increase parents’ awareness of their role and the potential benefits of
the program.

16.      A few activities under Sub-Component 2.3 commenced in 2010, however the pilot was
discontinued in December 2013. Implementation proved costly for CONAFE, and coordination
difficult between the different institutional levels, as the model did not follow the regular
institutional channels within the education sector (where responsibilities rest largely at the state
level). Contracts were signed between CONAFE and four out of five targeted municipalities, with
capacity building of municipal staff and consultations at the local level to create municipal-level
plans to help close educational gaps. Capacity was a significant constraint, however—at the
municipal level in terms of managerial capacity, and within CONAFE, given that it has neither the
resources nor the mandate to provide extensive capacity building to municipalities, whose
administrations also change every three years. The Administration that came to office in 2013
discontinued the pilot.

17.     Some activities under Component 3 were implemented with support from other sources,
such as the IE for the ECD component, for which 3ie, the International Initiative for Impact
Evaluation, provided US$1 million. The IE was conducted by the Bank’s team in cooperation with
an education think-tank, the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE). Impact
evaluations were also carried out for the API program the AGE program, of which the latter was
not foreseen in the PAD. One major activity under Component 3, the integrated management and
monitoring module for all programs under the Project, was never implemented, though there have
been efforts made toward achieving an integrated system. In 2013, the Planning Unit began to
collect data from several State Delegations to populate the module and this effort is still ongoing.
Even without the system, Project indicators were monitored consistently by CONAFE throughout
the Project period. The Component supported supervision by CONAFE for all activities supported
by the Project, most of which were in the 172 municipalities.

18.      The change of administration in 2013 led to changes within CONAFE, namely internal
restructuring and significant staffing changes, with ensuing delays in implementation. Project
activities suffered only minor disruptions, however, and Bank disbursements slowed, but all
Project activities were implemented by December 2013.




                                                 6
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design:

19.    The Project identified annual targets, KPIs, and intermediate indicators linked to the PDO
and Project components. The Results Framework, however, presents several inconsistencies. KPIs
are consistent with the PDO and the Project design, but the second KPI, Gap in test scores between
the 172 target municipalities and the national level for 6th grade of primary and 3rd year of
secondary, was incorrectly worded and the gap was never measured. Instead, the indicator
measured the median percentile ranking of students in compensatory schools in the 172 targeted
municipalities on the ENLACE test, in Math and Spanish. The targets were constructed to show
an expected increase in the median percentile ranking.

20.     The addition of Component objectives was not logically consistent with the PDO, or with
the intermediate indicators with which they are associated. For example, the objective of
Component 1, “To improve the reach and effectiveness of the ECD intervention in target
municipalities”, goes beyond the scope of the PDO, which focuses on improved access to ECD
services. Similarly for Component 2, Sub-component 2.1 includes additional objectives that are
not part of the PDO—the objective of Sub-component 2.1 is “To improve the efficiency and quality
of the education system through school-based management,” but the PDO only focuses on learning
outcomes (quality) and not on internal efficiency.

21.     Many IRIs measured outputs unrelated to Project activities, or inputs instead of outputs
that would provide evidence of the Project’s contribution to achievement of the PDO. As such,
IRIs were poorly designed to monitor implementation of Project activities. For example, IRI 9,
“Total amount of financial support transferred to and received by the FORTALECE entities” is an
input, not an output indicator. IRIs 18 and 19, “Number and percentage of localities in the 172
municipalities, that have beneficiaries from both Oportunidades and Educación Inicial,” and
“Number and percentage of localities in the 172 municipalities, that have beneficiaries from both
Oportunidades and Educación Inicial,” were not linked to any Project activities that would have
led to these outputs. Indicators 10 (Grade failure rate in community schools in the target
municipalities), 12 (Grade failure rate in non-community schools in 172 municipalities), and 13
(Student scores in the ENLACE test in non-community schools in 172 municipalities), should have
been outcome and not intermediate indicators, since they did not measure outputs.

M&E Implementation:

22.     Project indicators were monitored consistently by CONAFE, with information flowing
from CONAFE State Delegations to the federal level. M&E in the 172 municipalities also
benefited from increased support for supervision activities. M&E design weaknesses were not
addressed throughout the Project, but several baselines (though not the targets) were informally
revised as new data surfaced. These were not formally adopted through a restructuring, however.
Because the Results Framework did not include many output indicators, it was difficult to monitor
implementation progress throughout the Project. Another challenge was consolidation of financial
and programmatic monitoring systems for Project activities, which remain separate. Since 2013
there have been greater efforts toward achieving an integrated system by collecting data from



                                                7
several State Delegations, which is still ongoing. The integrated M&E module that was to be
supported by Component 3 of the Project was not developed, however.

23.      M&E benefited from support under Component 3, and from supplemental support from
3ie, for IEs of the ECD, AGE, and API interventions. The evaluations are of great importance for
CONAFE's future programs and as a learning experience for other countries in the region and
worldwide. Preliminary findings of the IE for API (April 2014), based on a randomized control
trial, indicate that the program had a positive and significant impact on the transition from primary
to lower secondary, providing evidence that the program was successful in raising educational
attainment but not learning outcomes. Qualitative evidence suggests that this may be partly due to
APIs being matched to communities with no consideration for their capabilities in the indigenous
language spoken there. Preliminary results of the IE of the ECD program, based on a randomized
control trial, suggest that after one year of implementation, parents attending the sessions displayed
an improvement in the observed parental practices, determined by variables that measure, among
others, the interaction between the caregiver and the child, the degree of autonomy left to the child,
and the degree of parental responsiveness. The IE also found a positive, significant effect on
children’s gross motor skills. Preliminary results from an IE on AGE, based on a randomized
control trial, shows that the AGE program had a sizeable, but not statistically significant, impact
on learning outcomes for 3rd graders. This is most likely due to the positive impact that the program
had on parental participation.

M&E Utilization:

24.     Project data was utilized for updating baselines for several intermediate indicators, and also
for consistent monitoring of all Project indicators. Revised baselines led to revision of targets for
five intermediate indicators (although these were not revised formally through a Project
restructuring). Preliminary findings of the IEs for API and ECD, were used to inform the design
of the follow-on operation. Preliminary findings from the AGE IE were used to inform this ICR,
specifically to assess the potential impact of AGE on learning outcomes.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards:

25.     To address issues preventing indigenous populations from fully benefiting from
CONAFE’s programs, and in compliance with Bank’s OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples, an
Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was prepared to guide program implementation. Approximately 40
percent of the population is indigenous in the 172 municipalities in Mexico targeted by the Project.
The IPP provided recommendations for improving services to indigenous populations for each
Project component by designing more culturally adequate alternatives. CONAFE complied with
these recommendations by adapting existing ECD materials to meet the needs of indigenous
children and parents (in the ECD Component), and consistently seeking out strategies to improve
the participation of indigenous parents in preschool and primary education through improved
outreach, particularly through the API intervention, where tutors often visited students’ homes in
an attempt to increase parents’ awareness and participation.




                                                  8
Fiduciary compliance:

26.     Fiduciary compliance was sound under the Project. For financial management, unaudited
financial reports and external audits were prepared in a timely manner. Audits were clear and most
fiduciary issues resulted from a lack of an integrated IT platform to control all of CONAFE’s
financial management processes; these were therefore managed separately but satisfactorily. There
were some minor procurement delays, mostly resulting from delays in preparation of Terms of
Reference, but all activities were executed satisfactorily by Project closing.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

27.      A new Project was approved on October 24, 2014 by the World Bank Group’s Board of
Executive Directors in order to provide continued support for several Project interventions, namely
APIs and ECD services, taking into account lessons learned from the IEs carried out under the
Project. The ECD component will cover the implementation for nation-wide coverage of the
program. Changes in the capacity building and delivery models will be piloted in 2015 and
eventually scaled up in future years. For APIs, the Project will allow the expansion of services
provided to the worst-performing schools in the most marginalized municipalities in the 31 states,
with additional emphasis on selection and placement of candidates in language-appropriate
localities. The Project will not support AGEs and FORTALECE, but these receive continued
Government support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives:

28.     Relevance of objectives is High. The objectives of improved access to ECD services and
improved learning outcomes for children in the most marginalized communities are not only
suitably aligned with CONAFE’s institutional mandate, but also with sector priorities as outlined
in the Sectoral Program for Education 2008-2013, and the new Sectoral Program for Education
2013-2018. The objectives are also aligned with two of the five National Goals, which underlie
the National Development Plan 2013-18 (NDP): Inclusive Mexico (México Incluyente), with the
goal to expand ECD services to marginalized, including indigenous, populations; and Mexico with
Quality of Education (México con Educación de Calidad), with the goal to improve learning
outcomes for marginalized populations. Objectives are equally well aligned with the Bank’s CPS
2014-19, which supports improved ECD access, as well as strengthening and expanding SBM,
under its theme of “Increasing Social Prosperity.”

Design:

29.    Relevance of design is Substantial. International best practices, as well as previous IEs of
national programs like AGE and ECD, were incorporated into the design, particularly for SBM
and ECD interventions. Since there was a shortage of ECD services in the 172 municipalities, the
expansion of ECD services to these municipalities by building capacity and supporting ECD
promoters was a suitable intervention for improving access. As shown by a previous IE of the



                                                9
program, the incorporation of children into the sessions was also appropriate for improving the
quality of ECD services as well as access, as was the redesign of materials to conform to local
cultures and languages. The design remained relevant throughout implementation.

30.     There is emerging literature that SBM can improve learning outcomes.4 A previous IE of
AGE (Gertler et al. 2012) showed that the program led to a significant reduction in failure and
repetition rates in primary. Preliminary results from the IE carried out during the Project 5 show
that the AGE program had a large and significant effect on the number of parent-teacher meetings,
meaning increased parental involvement in day-to-day school matters. The results also show that
children in the treatment group scored on average 24.402 points (standard error 23.309) higher
than children in the control group in the 2012 ENLACE test, after benefiting from the program for
one school year (nine months). While the increase is sizeable (0.19 standard deviations compared
to the baseline), especially after 9 months of exposure, the effect is not statistically significant at
conventional levels, due to high standard errors resulting from high intra-cluster correlation. The
expansion of the SBM model to community schools through FORTALECE was a logical extension
to benefit the most underserved areas. Likewise, the API intervention presented a potentially
successful way to improve learning outcomes by providing additional and focalized support to
schools where students achieved the lowest test scores.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

    a. Improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services in the most marginalized
       municipalities of Mexico: High

31.    This objective was achieved. The number of children attending at least 80 percent of the
ECD sessions supported by the Project in the 172 target municipalities increased from 43,241 in
2009 to 57,983 in 2013, beyond the target of 56,685 (refer to Table 1).




4
  Evidence of links between SBM and improved learning outcomes is mixed. Evidence from Kenya shows that parent-
teacher associations lead to better learning outcomes (Duflo et al 2014) when parents are empowered through specific
capacity building. In The Gambia, SBM was shown to reduce student and teacher absenteeism; SBM only had a
positive effect on learning outcomes in communities with high literacy, otherwise the effect could be potentially
negative in communities with low literacy (Blimpo, Evans 2011). In Indonesia, SBM was found to have links to
improved learning outcomes only when school based management is complemented by linkages between the school
committee (Pradhan et al. 2014). Evidence also shows that SBM has improved social participation, governance,
transparency, and accountability, leading to lower dropout and repetition rates (Gertler et al 2012). A recent
observational study suggests that school autonomy may lead to improved learning outcomes when strong central
institutions are in place, but otherwise possibly detrimental (Hanushek et al. 2012). Finally, another study argues that
SBM programs need to be in place for at least 5 years to achieve significant results and at least 8 years to “transform”
schools (Borman et al. 2003).

    intervention in the 172 target municipalities

32.     The Project contributed to the achievement of outcomes through the expansion of ECD
service points in the 172 targeted municipalities from 2,885 in 2009 to 3,498 in 2013.6 ECD service
points are those which provide a minimum of 32 sessions per year (including a combination of 26
joint mother and father, 18 children, 5 fathers-only, and 8 pregnant women sessions). This fell
short, however, of the 3,821 target. The expansion of ECD service points was achieved by
supporting capacity building of ECD promoters, module supervisors, and zone coordinators,
including the costs associated with their capacity building. The Project also supported promoters,
supervisors, and coordinators for implementing the capacity building sessions, and the revision
and development of new capacity building materials to be more appropriate and culturally sensitive
for use in indigenous areas.

33.     The increased availability of service points with trained staff and updated materials led to
an increase in parents’ participation in ECD sessions and greater access for their children. The
number of fathers and mothers trained by the Project and attending at least 80 percent of the
sessions provided (attending at least 21 out of 26 total joint parent sessions in a cycle), increased
from 38,620 in 2009 to 48,640 in 2013; this was 93% of the target. ECD capacity building covered
subjects like child rearing/parenting skills, early stimulation, hygiene, and nutrition. The
participation of fathers (1,714 in 2013) in fathers-only sessions created in an effort to increase their
attendance was a failure. However, anecdotal evidence from Bank supervision missions shows that
fathers attended joint sessions (fathers and mothers), so participation of fathers in fathers-only
sessions is not illustrative of fathers’ attendance overall.

      b. Improve learning outcomes of children in the most marginalized municipalities of
         Mexico: Substantial

34.   Learning outcomes improved in compensatory schools, as measured through the ENLACE
examination, in the 172 targeted municipalities. Table 2 shows evidence of improved learning
outcomes, using evidence from intermediate indicator baselines and targets as well as additional


6
  Although parental participation did not achieve its targets, and the number of ECD service points also fell below the
target, the Project surpassed the target for children attending 80% of the sessions. This could be explained by the fact
that the ECD service point indicator only captures the number of points that provided at least 32 sessions, and not the
total number opened. In some cases, service points were opened but shut down. Reasons for shutting down centers
include fluctuations in population where the minimum number of families fell below the eight-family threshold for
the service to exist within a nine-month cycle (families in these communities tend to migrate often). Another reason
is financial; ECD service points also rely on funding from the municipality, and in cases where municipalities ceased
to provide funds, service points were shut down. These service points could have provided 14 sessions for children
(or 80% of the 18 sessions they were required to attend) before shutting down. The number of service points that shut
down, and the number and type of sessions they did in fact provide, were not monitored by the Project, however.

evidence gathered at the ICR stage. Average ENLACE scores in compensatory schools in the 172
municipalities increased significantly between 2009 and 2013 in Grades 3 (78.86 points), 6 (35.32
points), and 9 (69.5 points), narrowing the gap between them and the national average. These
improvements were greater than those at the national level in Grades 3 (37.59), 6 (23.38), and 9
(10.4). In Grade 9, in fact, the average ENLACE score in compensatory schools in 172
municipalities surpassed the national average by 34.7 points in 2013. Improvements in the average
ENLACE scores in compensatory schools in the 172 municipalities were also higher than the
average for all compensatory schools; average ENLACE scores in all compensatory schools
increased by 61.9 points in Grade 3, 35.04 points in Grade 6, and 37.29 in Grade 9. Although the
AGE program was uniformly implemented nationwide, including in areas supported by the Project,
evidence from Table 2 suggests that ENLACE scores in areas covered by the Project improved
with respect to the average compensatory school—this may be explained by increased support
from the Project for supervision (by CONAFE and also Bank supervision missions) and M&E in
these areas. Failure rates decreased substantially in 6th grade of primary in compensatory schools
in the 172 municipalities, though they did increase slightly in 9th grade.

35.     The Project contributed to the achievement of this objective through its support to the AGE
program, which received the bulk of Project funds. The Project supported capacity building for
CAs and APFs, in addition to direct support for school improvement plans developed by APFs.
Between 2011 and 2013, the Project supported capacity building for an average of 47,286 APFs
per year; in the final year, 47,408 APFs were trained, above the target of 46,462. Capacity support
of CAs and APFs was designed to foster collaboration in school planning and management, and
improve school performance based on the creation of school improvement work plans, as well as
the increased participation of parents that would lead to greater interaction with teachers and
students. Each school year, capacity building of CAs and other school-based figures (teachers,
principals, etc.) took place between October and December, and APFs received four capacity
building sessions between January and June. These consisted of an orientation session to explain
how to create work plans, obtain and utilize AGE direct support, and requirements for tracking
and proving expenditures. AGE’s direct support vary by the number of students and teachers in a
school—for primary, the maximum support is MX$7,000, or around US$514, and for secondary,
it is MX$12,000 or US$881. Direct support was used to purchase school materials (not texts) for
students and teachers, or for maintenance and small repairs of school grounds. Other sessions
focused on the purpose and operating strategy of AGE, the role of APFs, and the importance of
parents’ participation in education. In 2012/13, an additional APF capacity building session was
added for APFs to brainstorm recommended actions to support their children’s education, and to
foster accountability within the school, thus increasing parental involvement in school life. The
Project also contributed to the evolution of operational guidelines and methodology for the AGE
program in 2013, and the expansion of topics covered in the APF capacity buildings.

36.      Grade failure rates in community schools in the 172 municipalities, for both 6th and 9th
Grades, provide further evidence of improved learning outcomes (see Table 3); ENLACE scores
for this cohort were not available at the time the ICR was written.

37.    The Project contributed to the outcome in community schools by supporting capacity
building of FORTALECE entities (APECs) by CONAFE in the development of school
improvement work plans. By 2014, 1,373 APECs were in existence and had created yearly work


                                                         13
plans that were approved by CONAFE (prior approval was required for direct support of these
work plans). The goal was to reduce the financial burden on families relating to school
maintenance and upkeep, and also to support the autonomy of APECs (which include parents and
other members of the community) to use the direct support on the school where they believe it is
needed the most. Direct support amounts varied by the number of students enrolled in community
education in each locality (including pre-primary, primary, and secondary), up to a maximum of
MX$12,000 or US$881. Direct support could be spent on a number of items including transport,
maintenance and minor repairs, cleaning, and fungible materials.

3.3 Efficiency

38.    The Project’s efficiency was Substantial. An economic analysis was conducted for three
program interventions, ECD, APIs and AGE. The cost per child per year of the ECD component, as
estimated by a recent IADB study by Myers et al. (2012), is lower than the estimated cost at Project
appraisal (US$76 now vs US$112 at appraisal) and of other interventions targeted to children in
Mexico. For instance, the average cost per child of the program Apoyo Infantil Vivir Mejor is
US$101 per year, and US$416 per year for the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (Myers et al.
2012), both of which offer ECD and nutrition services. Based on the results of an IE of the ECD
program, the cost-benefit ratio of the ECD program is equal to 6.47 with a discount rate of 5
percent. At appraisal, the cost-benefit ratio was 3.93 with a 5 percent discount rate. The Internal
Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of the ECD intervention was 11 percent.

39.      The average cost of the API intervention is US$374 per child per year. Given the novelty
of the intervention, its cost cannot be compared to other similar interventions, but is lower than the
cost per child of a regular basic education teacher in Mexico, which in similarly sized schools
would be approximately US$527 per year. Using the results of the IE of this program, the API
intervention generated a cost-benefit ratio of 10.18 with a discount rate of 5 percent. The average
cost of the AGE intervention is US$26 per child. Based on the results of Gertler at al. (2012) on
the impact of AGE on repetition and failure rate, we find that the AGE intervention generated a
cost-benefit ratio of 14.44 with a discount rate of 5 percent. While no economic analysis of the
API and AGE components was conducted at appraisal, both display extremely high cost-benefit
ratios, rendering them highly cost effective. The API intervention yielded a 16 percent IERR and
the AGE intervention a 17 percent IERR. The Project also closed on time.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

40.     Relevance of Project objectives is High and relevance of Project design is Substantial,
resulting in a Substantial Relevance rating. Efficacy is Substantial, since Achievement of
Objectives was High for one part of the PDO and Substantial for the other. Efficiency is also
Substantial. The overall outcome rating is therefore Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                                 14
Poverty Impacts:
41.     The Project benefited young children and students from the 172 most marginalized
municipalities around the country, of which a high percentage is also indigenous. These
communities have a history of economic and social marginalization, which is enhanced by limited
access to educational services. Access to ECD services has been shown in numerous settings to
increase educational outcomes, particularly for marginalized populations, which could eventually
break the cycle of poverty for many of these communities. Improved learning outcomes in 6th
Grade of primary and 3rd year of secondary, could also have a lasting poverty impact.

Social Development:
42.      The Project contributed to social development and more inclusive growth by tailoring
activities specifically to indigenous populations, for instance by developing new materials for ECD
services that are culturally appropriate, in addition to increasing outreach to parents for increased
participation and empowerment in school-based activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

43.     Implementation arrangements for the Project, which centered on existing structures rather
than parallel PIUs as in previous interventions, contributed to institutional change. Capacity
building at the state level for existing CONAFE structures has benefitted the institution in a
sustainable way. Although the municipal-based management pilot did not continue, it did spark
efficiency discussions within CONAFE and also at the policy level for future possibilities about
improved institutional delivery mechanisms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
44.     The risk to development outcomes is low. By 2014, the ECD intervention had greater
nationwide coverage, including in geographic areas that fell outside the scope of the Project. The
follow-on operation will specifically support the ECD program, ensuring that coverage is sustained
in the 172 municipalities and beyond. Interventions in basic education are also being partially
supported with CONAFE resources and other donor funds (with IADB focused primarily on
community schools). All programs that were included in the Project will continue to be
implemented with CONAFE’s approved budget, and APIs and ECD expanded with the follow-on
Bank operation. Improvements in learning outcomes are likely to be sustained since, in addition
to AGE, most of the schools that received capacity building and direct support through the program
may also benefit from two newly designed SEP programs: Programa Escuelas de Tiempo
Completo and Programa Escuelas de Excelencia, that will also transfer large direct support for
school based management and improved infrastructure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

45.     Numerous lessons from previous Bank supported projects in Mexico, as well as from
international experience, were incorporated into the Project’s design. Social development aspects
were well integrated into the design and implementation arrangements were appropriate and
sustainable, given their reliance on existing CONAFE structures. There were, however, moderate
shortcomings. Several activities under Component 3, representing a significant investment, were
never implemented. The Project’s M&E framework provided some indicators to measure
achievement of outcomes, but one of the PDO indicators was incorrectly formulated. Many
intermediate indicators were also set at the outcome level with insufficient intermediate indicators
to measure project outputs. Risks in implementing the GEMUN pilot were not carefully weighed—
since this was a small and innovative pilot that did not contribute to achievement of objectives,
this was a minor issue. Lastly, there was confusion over total Project costs and whether or not
Counterpart funds would be necessary or available, with the PAD indicating Borrower support in
the Financing Plan that was not considered in the cost table. The Project’s Operational Manual did,
however, clarify the full cost breakdown.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.    The Bank provided consistent support to the implementing agency as needed and had
frequent supervision missions. The Bank granted the Government four extensions of Effectiveness
given delays in fulfilling Effectiveness conditions. Fiduciary aspects were monitored throughout
the Project and the Bank was proactive in assisting with bottlenecks, particularly relating to
procurement. There were moderate shortcomings. While a restructuring was not critical to
achievement of the PDO, the Project could have been restructured when some baselines were
revised and it was clear some intermediate indicator targets would not be met, and also when it
was clear that the pilot and information module activities under Component 3 would not be
implemented.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

47.     Since Quality at Entry is Moderately Satisfactory and Quality of Supervision is Moderately
Satisfactory, Overall Bank Performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

48.    The SHCP and NAFIN were supportive of the Project at all stages, and a follow-on
operation shows the Government’s continued commitment to its goals. There were minor



                                                16
shortcomings in the Government’s performance, however, as it took 14 months after signature of
the Loan Agreement for the Project to reach effectiveness, pending the contractual agreement
between SHCP, NAFIN and CONAFE while the Contrato de Mandato was under revision. The
SHCP showed its support to the Project by requesting a number of effectiveness extensions to this
effect. The SHCP also assigned federal budget resources to CONAFE on an annual basis, in
addition to those provided by the Bank.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.      All Project activities were carried out by Project closing, and CONAFE stepped up
implementation in the final year after implementation slowed down in 2013. It also commenced
implementation of activities before Effectiveness in order to ensure that the Project would be
successfully carried out before closing, and navigated the 2013 change in Administration and
internal restructuring without great disruption to Project activities. There were moderate
shortcomings related to fiduciary issues, namely delays in some procurement processes, and a
failure to implement several activities under Component 3, notably an integrated digital platform
for all programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

50.    Government Performance was Satisfactory and Implementing Agency Performance was
Moderately Satisfactory; since the overall outcome rating is Satisfactory, Overall Borrower
Performance is Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

51.     The Project provided a number of lessons that were considered in preparation of the follow-
on operation. With respect to the ECD intervention, there were lessons learned about sessions
specifically targeted at fathers, which were unsuccessful. Future efforts to engage fathers should
be better suited to the cultural and gender norms that prevail in many of these areas; for example,
fathers are reluctant to participate in ECD sessions on their own, so joint sessions will remain the
norm. Sessions will also be held at different times so as to not conflict with fathers’ working
schedules.

52.     The API program has also provided valuable lessons. Since engagement with parents is an
important element of the program, visits by APIs to parents will be held on weekends, in order to
maximize the probability that fathers who work outside the village of origin are present, since
women are less likely to receive the API when they are home alone. One key lesson learned from
the program is the need for more frequent supervision by CONAFE of schools targeted by the
program. The assignment mechanism for APIs will also be improved in order to guarantee that the
API can speak the local language in indigenous areas. Lastly, since APIs encountered unexpectedly
high levels of illiteracy, APIs will be better trained to assist illiterate students.

53.    From an administrative viewpoint, expense categories under the Project did not correspond
with Project Components, making it difficult for the Implementing Agency to monitor Project



                                                17
costs. Categorization of expenses by component, rather than by procurement category, would
allow for a better understanding of outputs and activities by Component in future projects.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Early Childhood Development Intervention

1.     Component 1 supported capacity building of parents, relatives and caregivers of children
aged 0-4, as well as children aged 0-4, to improve their competencies and practices in caring for
children and contribute to the children’s comprehensive development and school readiness.

2.      Table A2.1 lays out the number of ECD service points supported by the Project per year,
and the number of children and parents that benefitted from the program each year. The Project
also supported capacity building of ECD promoters, module supervisors, and zone coordinators to
deliver ECD sessions in the 172 municipalities throughout the duration of the Project. This
Component also supported a consultancy in 2011 to design new capacity building materials for
ECD promoters, supervisors, and coordinators, as well as the materials for ECD sessions, which
are also in line with the recommendations of the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). Capacity support
materials focus on parenting and child rearing techniques, hygiene and sanitation practices, and
nutrition practices to improve children’s development. The Project also supported the development
of specific materials for fathers-only sessions, which were tailored to the role of fathers and the
importance of their participation in child-rearing. For pregnant women, special sessions included
information on maternal and child health practices, including nutrition, hygiene, etc. Consultancies
were also supported to update coverage and internal competencies for ECD within CONAFE, and
to update technical standards for certification of ECD promoters, coordinators and supervisors.

Component 2: Interventions in Basic Education

3.    This Component supported activities to support basic education, which in Mexico
comprises pre-primary, primary, and lower secondary. Activities were largely focused on the 172
most marginalized municipalities (for AGE and FORTALECE) and schools in the 172
municipalities and other areas with the lowest scores on the ENLACE test (API).



                                                  20
4.     Sub-component 2.1 supported capacity building for APFs and APECs and direct support
to APFs for minor school repairs and rehabilitation, and activities to improve the school
environment. The Project supported capacity building for a total of 1,373 APECs under the
FORTALECE program, which led to their development of a school improvement work program
that was approved by CONAFE. Work programs required prior approval from CONAFE for direct
support. Work programs were developed on a yearly basis and detailed the activities and/or
materials needed by the school, and a detailed budget for the FORTALECE direct support that
would support these activities. Direct support varied by the number of students enrolled in
community education in each locality (including pre-primary, primary, and secondary), up to a
maximum of MX$12,000 or US$881. Direct support could be spent on a number of items including
transport, maintenance and minor repairs, cleaning, and fungible materials. APECs received a total
of US$1,234,153 in direct support funds throughout the Project.

5.      Table A2.2 details the number of Parents’ Associations (APFs) that were trained in the
AGE initiative in compensatory schools with Project funds. Capacity support included orientations
about the AGE program, capacity building on how to develop an annual school improvement plan
and budget and track resources, capacity building on the importance of parents’ participation in
education, creation of action plans to support their children’s education, and to foster
accountability within the school. AGE direct support varied by the number of students and teachers
in a school—for primary, the maximum support was MX$7,000, or around US$514, and for
secondary, it was MX$12,000 or US$881. Support was used to purchase fungible school materials
(not texts) for students and teachers, or for maintenance and small repairs of school grounds. About
141,857 APFs received direct support through the Project, for a total of US$52,212,208.89.

6.      Sub-component 2.2 supported mobile pedagogical support (through the API program) to
under-performing students, teachers and parents of students in under-performing compensatory
and community schools through tutors. This included consultancies to revise and update the API
strategy, and design capacity building materials for APIs. Capacity and direct support for APIs
were supported under this Component. Given the high rates of illiteracy encountered by APIs
during program implementation, a consultancy was also supported to update CONAFE’s literacy
program, Lengua y Comunicación. Table A2.3 provides the total number of schools that APIs
supported throughout the Project, the number of APIs, and the number of children that benefitted
from the program. The Project supported the expansion of the API program to several states (which
varied from 10 to 14 over the life of the Project), and the number of schools supported by APIs
increased to 1,942 in 2013.

7.     Few activities were supported under Sub-component 2.3, since it was discontinued in 2013.
A study was supported in 2011 to assess and develop an implementation strategy for the GEMUN
pilot.

Component 3: Project Monitoring, Management and Evaluation

8.       This Component supported all activities related to Project M&E, including supervision
trips to monitor progress of all project components in the field, as well as to State Delegations to
obtain data. This component also supported consultants to conduct follow-up work for the impact
evaluations.




                                                          22
                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       The Project’s benefits are considered substantial. Project support was used efficiently as
illustrated both by the Benefit/Cost Ratios and by the higher than originally expected Internal
Economic Rate of Return (IERR) in the case of the ECD component.

2.      CONAFE’s ECD program benefited more than 450,000 children at the national level
annually, and their parents and, in communities with high and very high levels of marginalization.
The ECD component of the Project, which supplemented CONAFE’s ECD program, benefited
children between 0-4 years who lived in the 172 poorest municipalities throughout the country.
The ECD intervention had an annual cost of US$76 per child, as opposed to the $112 initially
budgeted, based on the costs reported by Myers et al. (2012). A comparison with the costs per
child of other programs targeting children of the same age and offering similar services in Mexico
shows that the CONAFE ECD cost per child is among the lowest. For instance, the average cost
per child of the program Apoyo infantil para vivir mejor is US$101 per year, and US$416 per year
for the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (Myers et al. (2012)).

3.      The API component supported approximately 41,900 children in 4,198 targeted primary
schools. The cost per child of this component was US$374.82 per year. Due to the extreme novelty
of the program, it is impossible to compare costs with similar interventions. The average cost per
child of a regular teacher in schools of a comparable size to the ones targeted by the API would be
approximately US$527 per year.

4.     Finally, the AGE component supported 48,258 schools in 2011, 46,191 in 2012, and 47,408
in 2013. Although precise data is not available on the number of students in these schools, an
inference was made using a sample of 80 schools which was used for the Impact Evaluation of
AGE. With a total sample of 1,153 children, every school had approximately 14 students. As such,
the AGE component is estimated to have benefited 675,612, 683,268 and 666,189 children in 2011,
2012 and 2013, respectively. The annual cost per child of this component was therefore US$26.

5.      The Project’s substantial economic benefits are also illustrated by the results of the
economic analysis of the Project components, which yield an 11 percent IERR for the ECD
component, a 16 percent IERR for the API component, and a 17 percent IERR for the AGE
component. The analysis assumes that every child will start to work at the age of 23 and will retire
at 62 (so after 40 years of work). In order to compute the benefits of the different components of
the Project, the reference income used is equal to US$3,824.31. This value corresponds to the
Mexican median yearly income per capita (source: ENIGH 2012, Cuadro 2.5) which was
converted using the exchange rate of 1US dollar to 13 pesos (the local currency). It is assumed that
every child will earn a certain fixed income every year throughout their professional career. The
wage has been assumed constant, thus ruling out both inflation and (economic) growth. The
Benefits have been computed by considering the fact that those children who have been targeted
by the Project’s components will earn a certain extra amount during their working life for their
entire working life. Additional individual benefits - e.g. improved health - and social benefits - e.g.
reduced crime rates - have not been taken into account. Therefore, the results presented in this
section have to be considered as lower bound estimates of the benefits

6.      Children targeted by the ECD Component will earn US$217.51 per year more than their
peers not exposed to the intervention, as a result of stronger cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
This improvement is partly due to the improved parenting practices. The results of an IE show that
the ECD component has improved parenting behavior, as measured by the Home Observation for
Measurement of the Environment (HOME) score. Both the baseline value and the increase have
been computed using a representative sample of children who were targeted by this component. A
baseline parenting behavior equal to 0.5137 was found, and an impact of the ECD program on this
value equal to 6 percent after one year. According to Cunha and Heckman (2006), an increase of
10 percent of parenting behavior at the age of 6, as measured by the HOME score, will cause an
increase in the earnings of the child equal to 2.4 percent. The assumption is that baseline parenting
behavior grew not only during the three years in which the child and parents received support from
ECD, but also during the next three years, thus leading to an overall increase by 22.87 percent.
This is a reasonable assumption due to the strong intertemporal complementarities documented by
Cunha and Heckman (2006): an increased investment today makes parental investment tomorrow
more productive.

7.      The children who were supported by the API component will earn US$707.76 more per
year than if they had not benefited from the program. They will have higher wages since they will
have a greater probability of completing lower secondary school. In particular, according to the
results of a preliminary analysis, those children who received API support will have a 24
percentage point increase in the probability of transitioning from primary to lower secondary
school, since 65 percent of the students in the treatment group, as opposed to 41 percent in the
control group, transitioned to secondary school. Taking into account that the retention rate in lower
secondary school level is equal to 81 percent, the API intervention led to a 19.44 percent increase
in the probability of completing secondary school. Because of this, they will earn a higher income.
The higher income has been computed using the coefficient of completing lower secondary school,
without completing the full secondary school, which is equal to 0.952 of the wage equation which
was reported in the PAD (based on ENCOVI 2008).

8.      Finally, the students who were involved in the AGE program will gain US$117.96 more
per year than their peers. Results in Gertler, Patrinos and Rubio-Codina (2012) were used to
compute this result. Their results show that AGE is associated with improved grade failure and
repetition rates and, specifically, that there is a significant 0.6 percentage point reduction in grade
failure and a 0.4 percentage point reduction in grade repetition in AGE treatment schools. Given a
baseline failure rate of 11 percent, this implies a 5.5 percent decrease in the proportion of students
failing a grade, averaged across grades 1 to 5. In order to compute the benefits, we consider a
generic student who has received the AGE support for three years and, in particular, in grades 2 to
4. This child should have a 10 percent increase in the probability of transitioning from primary to
lower secondary school, which means that, assuming that the baseline transition rate was 41
percent, she should have a 4 percentage point increase in the probability of transition. Using the
same values used in the API analysis - i.e the retention rate and the coefficient of finishing lower
secondary school of the above mentioned wage equation - we find that every child that benefited
from the AGE component, will have a 3.24 percent increase in the probability of completing lower
secondary school.

A. Evaluation of Project Development Objectives and Project Description

    (a) Original Objectives:
1.      The Project Development Objective is to improve access to early childhood education
services and learning outcomes of children in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico.
This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic
education levels that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and
municipalities.

   (b) Description of Project Components:
Component 1: Early Childhood Development Interventions
      1.1 Provision of technical assistance and capacity building to ECD promoters, module
          supervisors, and zone coordinators to deliver the capacity building to parents, relatives
          and caregivers of children aged 0-4;
      1.2 Provision of out-of-school capacity building to parents, relatives and caregivers of
          children aged 0-4 to improve their competencies and practices in caring for children
          and contribute to the children’s comprehensive development and school readiness; and
      1.3 Provision of technical assistance to design capacity building materials for the capacity
          building of parents, relatives and caregivers of children aged 0-4.
Component 2: Interventions in Basic Education
      2.1 Support for Basic Education
      2.2 Mobile Pedagogical Support
      2.3 Municipal Management Pilot for Education Quality
Component 3: Project Monitoring, Management and Evaluation

B. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Component 1: Early Childhood Development Interventions

2.      Early childhood education provides out-of-school guidance to parents and caregivers (from
0 to 3 years 11 months) with the goal of improving their childcare competencies and practices,
contributing to their development and preparing them for school. Parents and caregivers of
children under 4 years of age are essential to the success of the Early Childhood Education
program; children’s development will benefit from improvements in their child-rearing practices.
As such, the PDO is closely linked to the objective of Component 1, as both contribute to increased
support for education to the neediest children, specifically support for early childhood education.
This is not only a fundamental right of children, but essential to promote their development.

Early childhood education
3.      The early childhood education program was established 22 years ago as a compensatory
program by CONAFE, and has developed over time. Under the Compensatory Education Project
specifically, the program made headway in the areas of capacity building, development of


                                                31
materials, and fathers-only sessions. It is important to note that the Project focused on the 172
priority municipalities.

Capacity Building
4.     Capacity Building of educational practitioners is essential to develop their competencies
and offer quality educational services that respond to the needs of children, parents, caregivers,
and pregnant women in the most marginalized areas of the country.

5.     A Regionalized National Capacity Building program was developed to reach a greater
number of educational practitioners in a more direct way. This included ECD promoters, module
supervisors, and zone coordinators within different regions (100 participants per region). The
program was successful in imparting capacity building to these actors and met the objectives of
the National Capacity Building Workshop.

Development of materials
6.     The Project supported the development and printing of several capacity building and
pedagogical materials. These materials were used during capacity building sessions for ECD
promoters and others, and also during the ECD sessions themselves. Materials were aimed at
educational practitioners, as well as parents.

7.      The goal of the program is to create capacity building materials for educational
practitioners that will help them develop their skills and eventually develop theoretical and
practical knowledge through their subsequent teaching experience. This includes materials that
will promote knowledge development, as well as skills and attitudes, with a focus on their
applicability in real-life situations that are often complex, uncertain, unstable, unique, and value-
laden.

Fathers-only sessions
8.      The Project supported fathers-only ECD sessions. Although the targets for fathers’
participation were not met in any year during the life of the Project, there was still greater
involvement by men in children’s upbringing and in their participation in sessions overall. Over
the past few years, there has been an increase of approximately 5% nationwide in men’s
participation in ECD sessions.

Monitoring of sessions
9.     There is consistent monitoring of ECD sessions to better understand the strengths and
weaknesses of the program. Monitoring of the number of service points established, and number
of parents, pregnant women, fathers, and children attending sessions in the 172 municipalities,
provided information on the actual number of beneficiaries and highlighted pertinent actions
needed to reach project goals.

Lessons learned
10.    The performance of the Borrower and the Bank are considered satisfactory in the
preparation and implementation of the Project:

11.     The implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) provided valuable lessons.
CONAFE saw the need to adapt two materials to indigenous populations, such that the content,
images and format were more relevant and significant to them. As such, materials were expanded
to include ECD and health issues. With the help of an external consultant, these materials were
adapted and recommendations made on how to better engage indigenous populations from a
strategy and implementation perspective.

12.    One salient lesson is the need to refocus capacity buildings, as well as capacity building
and teaching materials, to include a focus on intercultural issues and also on rights, as a foundation
of ECD. The following materials were developed through the Project:
     “Walking Together.” Family and community in early childhood development.
     Considerations for nutrition, health, and community.

Impact evaluation of CONAFE’s Early Childhood Education program
13.     Impact evaluations have played an important role in shaping policy for social programs,
rendering them a prominent and important tool in the evaluation of early childhood programs.
There is a growing body of evidence in Mexico about early childhood programs, but a notable gap
as they pertain to parents and children under 4 years of age in rural contexts. CONAFE’s program
provides an alternative educational model for ECD provision in the poorest contexts.

14.     The impact evaluation of CONAFE’s Early Childhood Education program, carried out by
CIDE, is still underway. In the implementation of this and previous projects, the Bank team was
available to answer questions and requests, and provided consistent supervision of activities to
ensure that Project objectives would be met.

Component 2: Interventions in Basic Education

15.     The objective was to promote and strengthen social participation around the school to
consolidate a culture of collaboration, respect, and co-responsibility among educational
practitioners, teachers, parents, and students. As such, the Project supported CONAFE’s
previously existing program.

        2.1 Support for Basic Education
16.     In order to achieve the objective of this Component, CONAFE sought to implement pre-
existing program activities, without an explicit distinction between those activities supported by
the Project and those supported through the federal budget. This allowed CONAFE to remain a
key promoter of family participation in rural schools, in accordance with the findings of a
qualitative study sponsored by the Bank.

Factors Affecting Implementation
17.     Bank funds were focused exclusively on primary schools for capacity building of parents
and provision of direct support. CONAFE supported similar activities at the pre-school and
telesecondary levels with federal budget resources.

18.    The following three observations pertain to the Project’s targeting of schools under this



                                                 33
sub-component: i) the Project focused on 172 municipalities in 12 states with the same allocation
of funds, which altered the allocation of funds in those states; ii) the Project pushed forward a
unilateral policy focus on the most marginalized communities, which included urban communities
in the first half of the Project, displacing some multigrade schools; and, ii) targeting criteria were
redefined in the second half of the Project after the qualitative evaluation, which allowed CONAFE
and state authorities to select a more relevant set of schools for the AGE intervention.

19.     In terms of capacity building, the Project sought to improve the quality of capacity building
for parents, also in line with the IPP. Although few capacity building activities were financed by
the Project, supervision and monitoring led to some favorable changes in the AGE program by the
end of the Project. On the other hand, a reduction in budget resources is a risk to the ongoing
objectives of the AGE program. By the end of the Project, AGE has emerged with a new purpose,
definition, and place among federal educational policies to strengthen social participation in school
based management.

Lessons Learned
20.     In early 2013, CONAFE proposed a strategic restructuring of the AGE program to improve
capacity building of parents and social participation for school based management. The new
operational guidelines for AGE became effective in the second semester of 2013 . The Bank’s
participation led to the strengthening of the AGE program in the following ways:
        a. Evolution of operational guidelines from only steps to confirm expenses to also contain
            thematic content.
        b. Permanent inclusion of IPP recommendations in all visual aids.
        c. Defined a methodology for developing parents’ association sessions.
        d. Increased the number of parents’ association sessions from 4-5 to 6 in the final year of
            the Project.
        e. Implementation of a capacity building methodology, Formative Track for Parents, at
            the Project’s end.
        f. Adoption of the Bank’s recommendations to improve registries of trained APFs.
        g. Redefined marginalization criteria for selection of participating schools.
        h. Improved opportunities for consensus with state authorities under a common goal.
        i. Greater complementarity with other federal programs supporting schools and parents’
            associations.

        2.1.2 Community Strengthening for Education (FORTALECE)
21.     Activities under this sub-component sought to diminish out-of-pocket expenses by families
to sustain basic services in their communities, and to strengthen the participation of mothers,
parents, tutors, and community members to improve the school environment.

      2.2 Mobile Pedagogical Support (Asesores Pedagógicos Itinerantes, API)
22.   The activities under this sub-component were designed to improve CONAFE students’
mathematics and communication skills.

Institutional impact of the Project
23.      In 2010, the OECD selected the API Intervention as one of 40 innovative learning projects.
It was selected because it entails a concrete effort to improve learning outcomes of students. In



                                                 34
2012, the program was recognized in an international event, CLASE 2012: Leaders’ Summit for
Action in Education. It brought together experts from around the world to discuss priority topics
in education in Mexico, promotion of innovative ideas, and a forum for debate about ways to
achieve quality education for all Mexican citizens. The API Intervention was among the 20 case
studies presented.

24.     In its first three years, the API Intervention was implemented in primary and secondary
community schools. Since the 2011-12 school year, given its greater impact on learning outcomes
at the primary level, the scope of the intervention was accordingly shifted to primary only. In 2012-
13, CONAFE also included students in the third year of pre-school. This was done in order to
prepare students at this level to acquire reading and mathematical skills more successfully upon
entering primary school.

Factors outside of the Government’s/CONAFE’s Control
25.     Several factors were observed on a frequent basis in the communities where APIs were
located, which had a negative impact on the achievement of the Project objectives. Students did
not always attend class and after-school tutoring sessions often overlapped with students’ activities
or duties at home, or there was a great distance between the school and their homes. Some parents
did not send their children to school and some children appeared to be malnourished, which
affected their learning.

26.     Tutoring was affected by students’ distrust, disinterest, and lack of motivation, in addition
to inappropriate behavior such as: disrespect toward educational practitioners, aggressive behavior
among students, intolerance toward students with special needs, or general rule-breaking. It was
generally found that the students with the lowest performance are those whose families are least
involved in school activities, including those organized by APIs. At the state level, the following
behaviors by parents were frequently reported:
        a. Complaints about excessive homework assigned by APIs, plus regular homework.
        b. Lack of attendance to meetings and lacking commitment to agreed goals.
        c. Parents are disinterested in their children’s professional development and believe
           education is achieved solely in the school.
        d. Domestic violence.
        e. Parents are unaware of how to detect and address special educational needs.
        f. Parents claim illiteracy to justify their lack of participation.
        g. Some parents work outside of the community.

Factors generally under the Government’s Control
27.    The following issues were identified as having affected implementation of the program:
       a. Since the program was launched, many students in higher grade levels of primary have
          been found to lack literacy skills. The program has had to refocus on the acquisition of
          basic literacy skills for some students – nevertheless, they remain at a disadvantage in
          catching up to their peers.
       b. Limited follow-up by APIs.
       c. APIs’ materials are seldom recovered after their cycle is over.
       d. APIs do not consistently evaluate their performance and interaction with students.




                                                 35
       e. Limited follow-up and monitoring of APIs by coordinators, who focus mostly on
          capacity building and administrative matters.

28.     Regarding the performance of community teachers, they appear to have difficulty working
with the pedagogical package, Dialogue and Discovery, as well as with multi-level classrooms,
limited mastery of the curriculum, and in some cases don’t plan their classes. APIs noted a lack of
communication amongst educational practitioners, rejection of APIs due to limited understanding
of their role, resistance to collaborative work, and high teacher absenteeism, which led to APIs
taking over the teacher’s role.

Lessons Learned
29.     To maintain students’ interest, APIs integrated activities such as games, music, readings,
videos, field trips, and workshops. To encourage studying, they asked students to set clear personal
goals. In areas with high absenteeism, APIs chose to visit students’ homes, particularly for students
with no literacy skills, and also tailored schedules to better fit their students’. APIs also
communicated often with community teachers to encourage joint planning. In some cases, APIs
also trained community teachers when needed, to improve their understanding of pedagogical
material and to emphasize the role of community education. Workshops were held with parents to
explain the role of APIs and of parents in their children’s education, and parents were invited to
attend a joint class with their children. Home visits were reinforced and meetings were scheduled
to accommodate parents whenever possible. In addition, several actions outside of the API
guidelines helped improve the program:
        a. In indigenous communities, older children were trained to monitor support for younger
            ones. APEC leaders and community teachers were also helpful in translating
            information for non-bilingual families.
        b. Comparative analyses of students’ performance, whether progressive or regressive.
        c. Establishment of book clubs.
        d. Workshops on students’ behavior and gender equality.
        e. Regional headquarters were assigned one person to work on quality improvement.
        f. Involvement of APIs in the evaluation of learning outcomes.
        g. Sports and cultural activities were held with families, as well as talent shows.
        h. The highest performing APIs developed a capacity building manual for community
            teachers at the primary level, which was used in the 2013-14 school year.

30.     The program has had a positive impact on learning outcomes and on community integration,
lending greater dynamism to educational activities. It was a positive learning experience for
students, community teachers, and APIs alike, whose one-year stay in a foreign community was a
great opportunity for learning, teamwork, and shared experiences. Since APIs focus on the lowest
performing students, their success is not evidenced by performance in standardized tests. The
following areas were identified for further strengthening:
        a. Greater focus by APIs on inclusion, focused on indigenous, migrant, and special needs
            children.
        b. Materials need to be better suited to multigrade classrooms, which include a mix of
            illiterate children, and children with special needs, at different levels.
        c. Reinforce knowledge of operational and program guidelines, as well as program
            materials.

        2.3 Municipal Management Pilot for Education Quality (GEMUN)
31.     This sub-component comprised a pilot program to encourage further cooperation with
federal structures for service delivery. Its objective was to improve the efficiency of the delivery
of educational services by building capacity at the municipal level to manage and supervise
educational services.

Component 3: Project Monitoring, Management and Evaluation

32.    The objective of this Component was to improve the quality of Project implementation,
and strengthen the capacity of CONAFE to implement the Project through management,
monitoring and evaluation activities.

Achievement of objectives
33.    From a programmatic standpoint, most of the targets in the Results Framework were met.
From a financial standpoint, 100 percent of the Project’s US$100 million were disbursed by June
30, 2014. All legal covenants were complied with and the 2013 Audit, extended through June 2014,
found no issues to report at Project closing.

34.     The development of new materials to support educational practitioners was an achievement.
This includes materials to train educational practitioners and improve community education, as
well as materials for APIs, where materials were improved in order to better diagnose, plan, and
evaluate the program. Another achievement was the development of a competency standard to
certify basic education teachers, through a consultancy with Servicios Integrales para la Calidad
y la Competencia Organizacional (SICCOR).

35.      The Project promoted exchanges with other national and international educational
institutions, which strengthened CONAFE’s institutional capacity. Through capacity building and
exchanges, educational practitioners are able to offer a better quality education in accordance with
needs of the communities they serve.

C. Main Factors Affecting Implementation

36.    There were inconsistencies between the amounts committed by the Bank and the National
Counterpart at the time of Project preparation and those agreed to at Negotiations. The estimated
Project cost during preparation was US$166.7 million (US$100 million in Bank funds and
US$66.7 million in Counterpart funds), with a 60/40 participation. Negotiations only included
US$100 million in Bank funds.

37.    The Loan Agreement was signed in June 2010, but the Project became effective in August
2011, fourteen months later. This affected Project implementation since the budgeting exercise for
2010-13 had to be modified to account for the origin of funds for Project activities. This created
some difficulties for implementation.

38.     Implementation was also affected by the change in administration, changes at the Director
level in CONAFE, and constant changes in CONAFE’s structure, especially in technical areas.
Factors generally within the Government’s Control



                                                37
39.    There was a need for better coordination between the SHCP and the World Bank, to
coordinate actions relating to preparation, negotiation, effectiveness, and implementation.

Factors generally within CONAFE’s Control
40.     Agreements were made unilaterally by technical units within CONAFE with the Bank,
sometimes without consulting with the Finance and Administration Unit, which generated some
delays in Project implementation.
    a. Project costs and financing: US$100 million, 100% World Bank funds
    b. Date of last disbursement: June 26, 2014
    c. Comments on the disbursement schedule: For reasons previously noted, the disbursement
        calendar was affected early on in the Project. Once the Project became effective, the
        disbursement flow was accelerated.
    d. Comments on the availability of Counterpart Funds: The Bank financed 100% of the
        Project. There were no Counterpart Funds.
    e. Please specify the loan amount disbursed, and date of last disbursement: The full loan
        amount as per the terms of the contract was utilized.
    f. Please explain differences between the original cost estimates by component and the real
        cost of each component: There were no significant differences. There were US$3.3 million
        in unassigned funds which were transferred to Category 1 for eligible expenditures for
        Early Childhood Education.
