                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Compensatory Education Project is to improve access to Early Childhood Education (ECD) services and learning outcomes of children
                         in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico. This objective would be achieved through innovative interventions at the early childhood and basic education levels
                         that strengthen the involvement of members of the school community and municipalities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The counterpart continues to make good progress in the achievement of the Project Development Objective and in implementing activities. The data presented in this ISR is largely
                         for the 2011-12 school year, with some indicators still pending. Some examples of good progress:the number of children attending at least 80 percent of the ECD sessions financed
                         by the Project has grown by nearly 30 percent since 2010, and the number of fathers and mothers who attended at least 80 percent of the sessions has increased from 38,620 at
                         baseline (2009) to 49,447 in 2012, exceeding the target of 49,158.
