"Ratings for the Social Safety Net\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Colombia's\n            social safety net system was strengthened by the project\n            because both development objectives were achieved. The\n            consolidation and expansion of the Familias en Accion\n            conditional cash transfer program involved a quadrupling of\n            the number of beneficiaries relative to the beginning of the\n            project. The targets on uptake and compliance were not fully\n            reached due to the scale-up in urban areas. A much wider\n            group of government officials in key agencies and ministries\n            understands the link between the strategic vision of the\n            social protection system and the results indicators in all\n            related programs and relevant agencies led by the Ministry\n            of Social Protection (MSP). The expansion of Conditional\n            Cash Transfers (CCT) programs from rural areas to large\n            urban centers presents challenges that must be addressed at\n            both design and implementation stages. The urban poor do not\n            have the same needs as the rural poor in terms of access to\n            basic health and education services for their children.\n            Moreover, they have weaker social networks and frequently\n            face higher opportunity costs of time. Low-cost systems to\n            manage and monitor large-scale CCT programs are essential to\n            keep the marginal cost of expansion low. The availability of\n            adequate technologies made Familias en Accion monitoring and\n            management feasible and cost-effective as it expanded.\n            Making impact evaluation results widely and continuously\n            available can help to shore up borrower commitment to a\n            program and can be particularly important when new\n            administrations come into power and are under pressure to\n            show results. Major changes in the Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) system at the Ministry of Social Protection\n            required changes not only in information systems, but also\n            within the whole institution. Improvements in M&E\n            require changes in organizational culture that acknowledge\n            the relevance and validity of the indicators and the\n            anticipated use of evidence in the decision-making process."}, "docdt": "2011-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
