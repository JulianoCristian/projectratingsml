The additional loan will help finance the costs\n            associated with the further scaling-up of activities in\n            order to enhance the impact of this well-performing project,\n            starting early in 2007, sooner than had been envisaged when\n            the Project was prepared and negotiated. No changes are\n            envisioned for the design or implementation arrangements of\n            the Project. The Additional Financing will continue to\n            finance conditional cash transfers to poor families linked\n            to compliance with key human development conditionalities.\n            These include: a) assuring that children 0-6 have all\n            vaccinations and growth monitoring controls, according to\n            the Ministry of Social Protection protocols; and b) assuring\n            that children 7-17 years of age are enrolled in schools and\n            regularly attend classes. The Additional Financing will\n            enable the Program to expand the current number of\n            beneficiaries (nearly 600,000) to about 1 million by\n            financing the associated bimonthly transfer payments to poor\n            families. The Bank loan will continue to be used to finance\n            only those households targeted using the proxy means\n            instrument while national resources will be used to finance\n            beneficiaries who are displaced persons, individuals\n            affected by violence (not included in the figures above)."}, "docdt": "2007-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
