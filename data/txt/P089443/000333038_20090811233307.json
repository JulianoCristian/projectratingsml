the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: importance of strong Borrower commitment,\n            ownership and leadership. Since its creation in 2001, the\n            objectives and coverage of Familias have evolved. The\n            Government has expanded the program to cover the entire\n            country and in the National Development Plan (2006-2010),\n            defines its role in the social protection system and in the\n            strategy to reduce extreme poverty. The operations of\n            Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs in indigenous\n            communities may require adjustments in the standard\n            procedures. Modifications may be necessary in targeting\n            instruments, the negotiations process, and the types of\n            agreements signed with local authorities. A pro-active role\n            of the government in donor coordination can be effective in\n            providing an overall framework for cooperation. Given the\n            complexity of the social protection system (social security,\n            social promotion, and labor market and employment) and the\n            numerous entities involved each with different institutional\n            structures, the task of articulating a design should have\n            envisaged much more time than the 2 years envisaged. This\n            was particularly the case for the Ministry of Social\n            Protection (MSP), given that the design process implied\n            continuous training and capacity strengthening activities\n            for the entities in the sector which needed to occur in\n            parallel with the advances on design."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
