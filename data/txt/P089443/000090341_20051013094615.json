Colombia will strengthen the Government of Colombia\n            (GOC's) capacity to reduce poverty and inequality and\n            promote human capital investments among the poor.

(ii) Improving the\n            monitoring and evaluation system of the Ministry of Social\n            Protection (MSP) in order to better track and critically\n            review the country's social safety net portfolio. This\n            component will support Ministry of Social Protection\n            (MSP's) mandate of increasing transparency and\n            efficiency of the social safety net and its various\n            implementing agencies by establishing an integrated\n            results-based monitoring and evaluation system in the\n            Ministry that provides accountability, an objective\n            assessment of social policies and programs, and continuous\n            feedback for the design of social safety net programs in Colombia."}, "docdt": "2005-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
