The project\n            objective would be to support the design and development of\n            a social protection system by co-financing the Familias\n            Conditional Cash Transfers Program, expanding it to new\n            areas, and developing it further to become a crisis response\n            instrument, and, strengthening the Ministry of Social\n            Protection (MSP) to improve the basic architecture of the\n            social protection system, in addition to improving the\n            monitoring and evaluation capacity of the MSP, as part of a\n            broader Government effort. In line with the country's\n            legislation, and the Bank's social safeguards, this\n            Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) identifies issues, to ensure\n            indigenous peoples, and ethnic minorities, are included in\n            sharing the benefits of project implementation, and in\n            addition, that their rights are respected, including their\n            cultural identity. The following actions are included in the\n            plan which has been agreed upon with the Colombian\n            authorities: development of a program strategy study on\n            ethnic populations, with special focus on the program's\n            promotion activities; training for municipal staff (enlaces\n            municipales) to be more aware of the ethnic\n            population's specific characteristics. and their own\n            behaviors toward this population group; Promotion of a more\n            cooperative program with health facilities, particularly in\n            the program's training activities (encuentros de\n            cuidado); Further data collection and analysis should be\n            gathered to better understand some of the problems\n            identified by the social assessment, while an action plan\n            will be formulated to address issues; Inclusion of\n            information on ethnicity in the impact surveys."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
