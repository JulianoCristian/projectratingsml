Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory overall. Lessons\n            learned consisted of the following: Too many contracts lead\n            to an excessive supervision workload. Three governments,\n            three implementing agencies, and many parallel financiers\n            also lead to a large preparation and supervision workload.\n            In this case, the number of parallel financiers enlisted\n            under the project proved cumbersome, given the very variable\n            levels of commitment and supervision of parallel financed\n            components. Lastly, where there are multiple sector\n            institutions with diverse, and sometimes conflicting,\n            interests and priorities, the establishment of formal\n            structures for collaboration, such as the Joint Power\n            Coordination Center, can contribute significantly to greater\n            cooperation and harmony between the various institutions."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
