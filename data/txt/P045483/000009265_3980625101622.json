The project will help to\n            restore the generation, transmission and distribution\n            systems to meet at least part of the expect increase in\n            demand within Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), reconnect many\n            consumers still without power after the war, and reduce\n            power outages, variations in voltage level, and other\n            quality of service defects.  The secondary object is to\n            improve cost recovery.  The project components include: (a)\n            rehabilitation of the hydropower stations of Rama, Jajce 1,\n            Caplijina, Trebinje 1 and 2, and Bocac; and the coal-fired\n            power stations of Tuzla (Second Phase), Kakanj (Second\n            Phase), Gacko, and Uglejvik; (b) rehabilitation of\n            transmission facilities in the Federation, Republika Srpska,\n            and between them; (c) reconstruction and rehabilitation of\n            distribution networks in the Federation and Republika\n            Srpska; (d) rehabilitation of coal mines associated with the\n            coal power stations of Tuzla, Kakanj, Gacko, and Uglejvik;\n            and (e) technical assistance consisting of a transmission\n            and institutional rehabilitation study, a coal sector\n            restructuring study, and engineering and project management support."}, "docdt": "1998-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
