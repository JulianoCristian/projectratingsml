the 
Banks 
response 
to 
the 
new 
Government 
of 
Ecuador’s 
urgent 
request

an unsustainable 
fiscal 
position 
and achieve 
high 
growth 
for 
poverty 
reduction.  The 
comprehensive 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
FCCGL 
has 
two 
pillars: 
(a) 
fiscal 
consolidation 
with 
social expenditure protection, 
and 
(b) 
faster 
growth 
with 
improved 
competitiveness. 
Specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
loan 
are 
to 
(a) 
improve 
tax 
policy 
and 
administration, 
(b) 
reverse expansionary spending and 
improve 
budget 
transparency, (c) 
regain 
control 
of 
the 
public 
payroll, 
(d) 
clear 
arrears 
and 
improve public

Benefits 
and 
Risks: 
policies, 
and 
(g) 
increase 
labor 
flexibility. 
These 
objectives 
are 
complemented 
by 
a 
parallel 
programmatic 
operation 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The 
overall 
main 
benefit 
of 
the 
loan 
is 
to 
contribute 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
Ecuador 
through 
two 
complementary 
ways. 
First, 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
FCCGL 
will 
put 
fiscal 
accounts 
on 
a 
more 
sustainable  path. 
Most 
of 
the 
proposed 
measures 
carry 
fiscal 
implications, 
which 
are 
estimated 
to 
produce 
initial 
net 
fiscal 
savings 
of 
about  2  percent 
of 
GDP. 
Fiscal 
reforms 
will 
also 
strengthen 
countercyclical 
fiscal 
institutions 
and 
rules; 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
collection 
by 
the 
IRS 
and 
Customs; 
contribute 
to 
reducing country 
risk, 
which 
should induce 
a 
fall 
in 
domestic interest 
rates 
and 
have a 
lasting 
impact 
on 
economic recovery; 
and 
free 
resources 
for 
financing 
priority 
poverty-reduction 
programs. 
Second, 
the 
reform 
program 
will 
accelerate 
economic 
growth 
through 
structural 
change 
aiming 
to 
increase 
productivity 
and 
deepen 
markets, 
especially  labor. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
loan 
will 
contribute 
to 
increased 
private 
participation 
and 
investment 
in 
basic 
infrastructure-water, 
power, 
telecommunications 
and 
oil- 
sectors, 
attracted 
by 
a 
more competitive 
framework, 
a 
more open 
economy, 
sound 
pricing 
and  regulatory 
policies, 
and 
more 
flexible 
markets. 
The 
main 
specific  results 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
are 
next. 
On 
revenue 
management, 
Customs 
modernization 
and 
tax 
reform 
should lead 
to 
increased 
tax 
revenue 
collected 
by 
the 
IRS 
no 
less 
than 
7.5 
percent 
per 
year. 
On 
expenditure 
management, 
sustained 
implementation 
of 
austerity 
measures 
through 
2003 
and 
2004 
should 
lead 
to 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
primary 
surpluses, 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
3.5 
percent cap 
on 
real 
primary 
spending 
of 
the 
Fiscal 
Law. 
On 
civil 
service 
reform, 
the 
unification 
of 
public 
sector 
wages 
and 
further 
measures 
taken 
to 
rationalize 
public 
employment should 
lead 
to 
negative 
growth 
of 
the wage 
payroll 
in 
real 
terms. 
On 
transparency 
measures, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Transparency 
Plan 
should produce 
virtual 
access 
to 
timely 
and 
reliable 
reports 
on 
executed 
NFPS 
consolidated expenditure 
and the 
establishment 
of 
an 
e-public 
procurement 
and 
national 
investment 
systems. 
On 
debt 
management, 
Ecuador 
should 
clear 
all 
domestic 
and 
external 
arrears, 
and allocate 
no 
less 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
FEIREP 
accumulated 
annual 
proceedings 
to 
debt 
reduction. 
On 
trade 
reform, 
all 
import 
licenses 
should 
be 
unified 
and 
about 
20 
percent 
of 
them, 
considered 
as 
ineffective, 
should 
be 
eliminated 
in 
a process 
of 
effective simplification 
of 
import 
licensing 
procedures. 
On 
power 
sector 
reform, 
electricity 
tariffs 
should 
continue  adjusting, 
reaching 
no 
less 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
average 
costs 
by 
March 
2005. 
On 
telecom 
reform, 
the strategy 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL 
should 
lead 
to 
award 
a 
third 
mobile 
telephony 
license, 
effective 
investments 
by 
a 
private 
investor and 
the 
signing 
of 
management 
11 
Page  7
contracts 
of 
both 
companies 
with 
a 
private 
firm. 
Finally, 
on 
labor 
market 
reform, 
the 
concertation 
strategy 
of 
the 
Government 
should lead 
to 
effective 
salary 
adjustments 
below 
the 
inflation 
rate. 
All 
prior 
actions 
for 
this 
single-tranche 
operation 
have been 
met 
satisfactorily.  Successful 
prevention 
of 
policy 
reversal and 
swift 
implementation 
of 
further 
stages 
of 
the 
Multiyear 
Government's 
Program 
are, 
however, 
uncertain. 
The country 
faces a 
number 
of 
domestic 
and 
external 
risks 
that 
may 
pose  a 
threat 
to 
fiscal 
stability 
and  economic  recovery. 
In 
particular: 
(a) 
political 
opposition 
in 
Congress 
remains strong 
and 
coalitions 
are 
fragile; 
(b) 
social 
unrest 
could 
prevent 
the 
government 
from 
implementing 
adjustment  and  structural 
reform 
measures;  (c) 
given dollarization 
and the 
absence 
of 
any 
meaningful 
lender 
of 
last resort 
for 
the 
banking 
sector, 
external economic 
shocks- 
especially 
a 
severe 
decline 
in 
the 
price 
of 
oil, 
competitive 
depreciations 
by 
neighbouring 
countries, 
or 
sudden  stops 
in 
capital 
flows 
to 
the 
region-might 
make 
a 
deflationary 
fiscal 
adjustment 
socially 
unbearable  and 
put 
the 
fragile  banking 
recovery 
at 
risk; 
(d) 
the 
debt  overhang 
could 
affect 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and 
impede 
Ecuador 
from 
clearing 
arrears, 
or 
could 
lead 
to 
new 
ones; 
and 
(e) 
there 
might 
be 
a 
low 
local 
capacity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
officials 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
an 
ambitious 
program. 
All 
these 
risks 
might 
lead 
Ecuador 
to 
fail 
to 
comply 
not 
only 
with 
its 
arrangement 
agreed 
with 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
or 
with 
the 
program 
of 
reforms 
agreed 
under 
this 
operation, 
but 
to 
abandon 
dollarization. 
To 
mitigate 
political 
risks, 
and 
in 
coordination 
with 
other 
donors, 
the Bank, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Government, 
is 
developing 
a 
continuing 
dialogue 
with 
members 
of 
Congress 
and 
political 
forces 
on 
the 
bills 
submitted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
agenda 
of 
reforms. 
To 
mitigate 
social 
risks, 
the 
GOE 
is 
committed 
to 
developing 
a 
national  dialogue 
with 
union 
and  indigenous 
leaders. 
By 
increasing 
social 
spending 
and 
enhancing  the 
coverage 
and 
delivery 
effectiveness 
of 
basic 
public 
services, 
the government 
hopes 
to 
limit 
the 
impact 
of 
its 
policy 
actions.  These 
efforts 
are 
complemented 
by 
the 
Bank's 
dialogue 
with 
representatives 
of 
the 
civil 
society 
and 
assistance 
to 
the 
government 
in 
reformulating  and  implementing 
social 
protection 
programs 
aimed 
at 
protecting 
the 
poor 
and 
the most vulnerable 
groups. 
To 
mitigate 
external 
risks, 
the  government 
is 
strengthening 
its 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
shocks 
countercyclically 
by 
replenishing 
the 
oil 
stabilization 
fund, 
repaying 
debt, 
increasing 
the 
share 
of 
non-oil 
fiscal 
revenues, 
diversifying 
non-oil 
exports, 
strengthening 
prudential 
regulations 
and 
creating 
a 
liquidity 
fund 
for 
commercial 
banks, 
increasing labor market 
flexibility, 
and 
encouraging  competitiveness 
and 
private participation 
in 
key 
investment 
sectors. 
To 
mitigate 
its 
debt-overhang 
risk, 
the 
Bank

FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION 
AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
FOR 
AN 
ADJUSTMENT 
LOAN 
FOR 
FISCAL 
CONSOLIDATION 
AND 
COMPETITIVE 
GROWTH 
TO 
THE 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
ECUADOR 
PROJECT 
DOCUMENT 
1. 
This 
program 
document proposes an adjustment 
loan 
for 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
to 
the 
Republic 
of 
Ecuador 
for 
US$50 
million. 
This 
operation 
will 
provide 
initial 
World 
Bank 
support 
to 
the  country’s 
fiscal 
adjustment 
and 
structural 
reform 
agenda. 
This 
is 
a  single-tranche 
operation, 
within 
a 
multiyear 
framework, 
reflecting 
the 
overall 
Government’s 
Program. 
The 
loan 
will 
be 
a fixed-spread 
loan 
(FSL) 
in 
U.S. 
dollars 
with 
22 
years’ 
maturity 
including 
6 
years 
of 
grace, 
with 
pre-set 
repayment 
dates. 
This 
operation 
is 
part 
of 
the Bank’s 
response 
to 
the 
new 
Government 
of 
Ecuador’s 
(GOE’s) 
urgent 
request 
for 
assistance. 
A 
parallel 
Programmatic  operation 
is 
also 
being 
proposed 
to 
protect 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups, 
as 
the 
economy 
engages 
in 
an 
austerity 
plan 
to 
correct 
fiscal 
imbalances, 
and 
to 
support design 
and 
implementation 
of 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
AND 
RATIONALE 
2. 
Since 
its 
return 
to 
democracy 
in 
1979, 
Ecuador 
has 
been characterized 
by 
high external 
vulnerability, 
weak 
macroeconomic 
performance, 
and 
poor 
governance. 
Successive 
external 
shocks-tied 
to 
reductions 
in 
petroleum prices 
or 
wide 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
country’s capital 
flows 
as 
in 
1998-and 
natural 
disasters 
have 
been 
combined 
with 
poor 
macroeconomic 
management 
reflected 
in 
high 
fiscal  deficits 
and 
public 
accumulation 
of 
external 
debt. 
These 
developments 
have 
often 
been 
accompanied 
by 
very 
high 
rates 
of 
inflation 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
instability, 
leading 
the 
country 
to 
four 
severe recessions-1982-83, 
1987, 
1989, 
and 
1998-99; 
three 
hyperinflationary 
periods-1983, 
1988- 
1993, 
and 
1999-2000; 
various 
episodes 
of 
payment  moratoriums;  and recent 
twin 
exchange 
rate 
and 
banking 
crises  that 
led 
to 
dollarization 
and destroyed 
20 
banks 
holding 
50 
percent 
of 
bank 
deposits. 
Misguided 
policies 
were 
also 
the result 
of 
unstable government administrations 
and 
poor 
governance. 
For 
instance, 
in 
23 
years, 
Ecuador 
had 29 finance ministers 
who 
remained 
in 
office 
an 
average 
of 
less 
than 
10 
months, 
and 
it 
was 
perceived 
as 
the 
Latin 
American 
country 
with 
the least 
control 
over 
corruption. 
3. 
The twin 
crises 
of 
1998-99 
had 
a 
devastating effect 
on 
the 
poor. 
During 
1995-99, 
the 
number 
of 
poor 
people grew 
by 
more 
than 
2 
million 
and 
the 
headcount 
poverty index 
nearly 
doubled 
from 
34 
to 
56 
percent 
of 
the 
population. 
Similarly, 
the 
number 
of 
people 
living 
in 
extreme 
poverty 
(income 
insufficient 
to 
cover 
a 
basic 
basket) increased 
from 
12 
to 21 
percent 
(Annex 
6). 
The 
crises 
hit 
rural 
areas 
most 
severely, 
especially 
those 
in 
the highlands, 
where the 
poverty rate 
increased 
by 
7 
percentage 
points 
during 
1998-99  alone.  These 
indicators 
reveal 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
crises 
and 
the 
greater 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
rural-mostly 
indigenous-poor 
in 
dealing 
with 
their income 
losses. 
The 
crises 
also 
led 
to 
emigration 
of 
more than 
300,000 
people-3 
percent 
of 
the 
labor 
force-since 
1997, 
making 
the 
country 
a 
significant 
recipient 
of 
family 
remittances, 
although 
at the 
price 
of 
eroding 
the country’s 
human 
capital, 
and 
its 
rural 
social capital. 
4. 
Ecuador 
dollarized 
not 
by 
choice 
but 
as 
a 
last resort 
for 
dealing 
with 
its 
twin 
crises 
that 
occurred 
in 
1999. 
The country 
did 
not 
meet the 
preconditions 
for 
successful 
dollarization, 
including 
a 
solid 
fiscal 
position, 
a sustainable 
public 
debt, a 
diversified 
export 
structure 
to 
accommodate trade 
shocks, 
a 
sufficient 
level 
of 
international 
reserves 
to 
accommodate 
capital 
outflows, 
a sound and 
competitive 
1 
Page  10
banking 
system, 
flexible 
factor 
markets-particularly 
labor 
and 
real 
estate-to 
preserve 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
nontradable  goods 
sector, 
and a 
climate 
to 
attract 
investment. 
Despite 
these 
impediments, 
dollarization 
allowed 
Ecuador 
to 
achieve 
critical 
objectives 
in 
the 
short term: 
it 
unveiled 
the 
serious 
fiscal, 
real, 
and financial 
imbalances that 
plagued 
its 
economy 
in 
the 
late 
1990s; 
it 
brought 
down 
hyperinflation; 
and 
it 
helped 
to 
restore 
confidence 
in 
the 
banking 
system. 
5. 
Ecuador 
is 
at 
a 
turning 
point. 
Its 
stability 
and economic 
recovery 
are 
promising, 
but 
its 
fiscal 
and external positions 
remain 
vulnerable. 
These 
vulnerabilities 
are 
due 
to 
its 
rigid 
response 
to 
real or 
financial 
external 
shocks-typical 
of 
dollarized 
economies 
with 
only fiscal 
policy 
as 
an 
instrument-in 
a 
context 
of 
highly 
volatile 
and oil-dependent 
fiscal 
revenues, 
expansionary spending 
policies, and 
heavy 
external 
indebtedness  that  have 
resulted 
in 
declining fiscal 
surpluses 
and 
high 
balance-of-payments 
deficits. 
For 
their 
part, 
the 
structural 
reforms 
that should 
accompany 
dollarization 
are 
either 
absent 
or 
inconclusive. 
Fiscal 
adjustment 
is 
among 
those 
inconclusive 
ones, 
as 
is 
the strengthening 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
while 
the 
promotion 
of 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
petroleum 
sector 
remains 
absent. 
Other 
reforms 
that  have 
not 
been  carried 
out 
include 
trade 
reform, 
and 
deepening 
competitiveness 
and 
private 
infrastructure. 
6. 
The 
proposed 
operation 
is 
a 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
Loan. 
It 
builds 
upon 
the 
progress achieved 
from 
the 
previous Structural Adjustment 
Loan 
(SAL) 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
22 
June 
2000. 
It 
responds 
to 
the Government’s 
Program 
for 
Economic 
Restructuring and 
Human 
Development 
(PERHD) 
aimed 
at 
solving 
immediate 
liquidity 
problems, 
deepening 
fiscal 
solvency 
and 
strengthening 
fiscal 
institutions; 
and 
supporting 
structural 
reforms-by 
introducing 
flexibility 
in 
goods 
and 
services 
markets 
and 
increasing the 
productivity 
of 
the factors 
of 
production, 
all 
essential 
conditions 
for sustaining 
dollarization 
in 
the 
medium term 
(Annex 
4). 
In 
parallel 
to 
a 
Programmatic 
operation aimed 
at 
strengthening human development and social policies, 
the 
FCCGL 
will 
provide critical 
support 
to 
the 
country’s 
fiscal 
and structural 
reform 
programs. 
7. 
The 
SAL 
made 
initial 
progress 
in 
supporting 
recovery 
and 
advancing 
structural 
adjustment. 
Specifically, 
the 
SAL 
supported 
(a) 
public 
sector 
reforms, 
including 
an 
oil 
stabilization 
fund, 
the 
modernization 
of 
public 
sector 
financial 
management, 
and the design 
of 
the 
legal 
and regulatory 
framework 
to 
facilitate 
privatization 
in 
telecommunications  and 
electricity; 
(b) 
financial 
sector reforms, 
the 
regulatory framework 
for 
intervention,  restructuring, and 
resolution 
of 
banks, 
restructuring 
of 
private 
sector debts 
to 
banks, 
and 
a 
medium-term 
strategy 
for 
development the 
banking 
system; 
and 
(c) 
social 
sector 
measures, 
including 
protection 
of 
key 
programs and 
selected 
projects that 
employ 
unskilled 
labor, 
and development 
of 
a 
social 
expenditure 
targeting 
mechanism. 
Reforms 
on 
these 
fronts 
are 
incomplete. 
The proposed 
FCCGL 
assures 
the 
continued 
progress, 
building 
on 
Ecuador’ 
s 
previous 
attempts 
to 
reach 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
deepen 
the 
structural reforms. 
It 
is 
expected that 
future reforms along 
that 
path 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
Programmatic 
operations. 
8. 
The 
proposed 
FCCGL 
of 
US$50 
million 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
the 
context 
of 
strong 
international 
support 
and 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
IMF. 
It 
has 
benefited 
from 
an 
active 
engagement 
across 
institutional 
boundaries 
within 
the 
Ecuadorian 
government and at the 
local 
level. 
The 
proposed 
adjustment 
operation 
has 
been designed 
in 
parallel 
to 
and 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
IMF 
negotiations 
leading 
to 
the 
signing 
of 
a 
Stand-By Arrangement  (SBA). 
The 
13-month 
SBA 
for 
SDR151 
million 
was approved 
on 
21 
March 
2003 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
fiscally stabilizing 
the 
economy and generating 
high-quality growth 
with 
key 
structural 
reforms 
under 
a 
framework 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
dollarization. 
9. 
The 
loan 
is 
crucial 
and 
timely. 
Ecuador 
faces 
not 
only 
a 
difficult 
sociopolitical 
situation, 
which 
limits 
the 
space 
for 
reforms, 
but 
also 
severe 
budget 
illiquidity 
and 
pressing 
external 
arrears that  the 
country 
still 
has 
to 
clear. 
Barely 
three days 
after 
taking office, 
the 
government 
announced 
its 
program, 
thus 
showing 
strong 
commitment 
for 
making 
significant 
progress 
quickly 
(Annex 
6). 
Supported 
by 
this 
2 
Page  11
operation, 
officials 
should 
be 
able 
to 
implement significant 
components 
of 
the 
PERHD, 
leading fiscal 
accounts 
to 
a 
sustainable path, 
structural reforms 
to 
solid 
ground, 
and protecting 
key 
social 
spending. 
The 
overall 
Multiyear 
Program 
of 
policy 
reforms 
agreed 
under 
this 
operation 
(and  the 
parallel 
Human 
Development 
operation) 
should 
also  deal 
with 
complementary 
aspects 
of 
this 
development 
agenda. 
Officials 
are  aware  that 
the 
credibility 
of 
their 
economic 
program 
does 
not 
depend 
merely 
on 
dollarization, 
but 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
sound 
policy 
framework 
that 
will 
provide 
an 
appropriate 
management 
of 
the 
economy 
in 
the 
event 
of 
future 
internal 
and/or 
external 
shocks, 
like 
the 
waning 
of 
the 
current 
petroleum 
boom. 
10. 
This 
initial 
single-tranche 
approach, 
under 
a 
multiyear  framework, 
is 
well 
suited 
to 
Ecuador’s 
situation 
and 
needs. 
The 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
Progress 
Report 
discussed 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
22 
June 
2000 foresaw 
a 
fast-disbursing adjustment 
operation 
in 
fiscal 
2002 
to 
support 
restoration 
of 
macrofinancial 
stability 
and 
growth 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
if 
strong  macroeconomic 
performance, 
including 
an 
IMF-supported 
program,  and  accelerated 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the public, 
financial,  and/or 
social 
sectors, 
took 
place. 
Because 
of 
cancellation 
of 
two 
agreed-telecom 
and 
tax- 
reforms, 
and 
delays 
in 
remaining 
conditions 
of 
disbursement 
of 
all 
tranches 
under 
the 
SAL, 
by 
mid-2002, 
it 
became 
clear 
that 
pending 
policy 
reforms 
would 
not 
be 
implemented 
under 
the 
previous 
Administration. 
In 
addition, 
the Ecuador 
Country 
Assistance 
Evaluation, submitted 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
25 
January 
2001, 
found 
that, 
historically, 
adjustment 
lending 
has 
not 
been 
a 
successful 
instrument 
in 
Ecuador 
and 
suggested 
that, 
at 
a 
minimum, 
further 
fast-disbursing 
lending 
should 
be 
extended 
only when 
major 
reforms  have 
reached the 
“sticky 
hard-to-reverse 
stage” 
that 
are 
typically 
featured 
in 
operations, 
with 
clearly 
accomplished 
milestones, 
policy 
requirements, 
and 
monitoring 
indicators. 
Finally, 
the 
Bank‘s 
Policy 
Notes 
presented 
to 
the 
incoming 
officials 
in 
a 
workshop 
in 
Quito 
on 
11 
January 
2003 
also 
suggested 
that 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
credibility 
to 
the 
Government’s 
program, 
officials 
needed 
to 
swiftly 
take 
actions 
on 
the 
fiscal 
front, 
or 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
program 
would not 
be 
sustainable. 
The 
lessons 
drawn 
and 
the need 
for 
a 
blueprint 
of 
key 
reforms 
for 
Ecuador make 
most 
suitable 
an 
initial 
single-tranche 
approach, 
but 
in 
a 
multiyear 
framework, 
in 
this 
operation. 
11. 
The 
short- 
and 
medium-term 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
FCCGL 
are 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
Government’s 
Letter 
of 
Development Policy 
(Annex 
%to 
be 
included). 
They

policy 
and

reforms 
(Annex

RECENT 
ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS 
12. 
Ecuador’s 
macroeconomic conditions 
are 
recovering 
from 
the 
twin 
crises, 
but 
continue 
to 
be 
fragile. 
Benefiting 
hm 
a 
positive 
external environment 
characterized 
by 
high 
petroleum 
prices, 
low 
intemational 
interest 
rates, 
and 
sigmficant 
flows 
of 
family 
remittances, 
GDP 
grew 5.1 
percent 
in 
2001 
and 
an 
estimated 
3.0 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Average 
annual 
inflation 
fell 
to 
38 percent 
in 
2001, 
and 
reached 
single 
digits 
by 
late 
2002 (Figure 
1). 
The recovery 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
increase 
in 
domestic 
demand 
(particularly  private 
demand), 
stimulated 
in 
turn 
by 
high 
petroleum 
prices, 
growing 
remittances, 
the 
increase 
in 
nominal 
”urn. 
and 
average salaries 
in 
dollars, 
which 
practically 
doubled between 
April 
2000 
and 
October 
2000, 
and 
a 
gradual 
reactivation 
of 
private 
credit, consistent 
with 
recovery 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
Construction 
of 
the 
new 
pipeline 
for heavy 
cmde 
oils 
(OCP) has 
attracted 
significant 
foreign 
investment. 
The 
initial 
inflationary 
impulse, 
followed 
by 
a 
slow 
deceleration 
of 
inflation, 
fits 
into 
the pattern 
observed 
in 
most dollatized 
economies: 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
domestic 
inflation 
tends 
to 
be determined 
by 
international 
inflation, 
but 
in 
the short-term, 
lags occur 
in 
relative 
price 
adjustment 
due 
to 
the 
control 
of 
certain 
managed 
prices 
belonging 
to 
the 
basic 
basket, 
and 
to 
the 
postcrises 
reactivation 
of 
domestic 
demand.

Economic recovery 
has 
contributed 
to 
partly 
improved 
social conditions. 
The 
beginning 
of 
economic 
recovery 
made 
possible 
a 
decline 
in 
urban 
poverty levels 
during 
2000-01. 
Following 
the 
sharp 
increase 
of 
nearly 
17 percentage 
points 
during 
1998-99 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
crises, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
recovery 
of 
about 
12 
points 
starting 
in 
2000, 
but 
still 
not 
reaching 
the rates 
seen 
in 
1997 
(Figure 
2). 
The 
same 
survey estimates 
how 
the 
decline 
in 
poverty, 
measured 
on 
the basis 
of 
income 
during 
2000- 
01, 
affected 
both 
rural 
areas 
and 
cities 
to 
an 
almost 
identical 
degree 
(Annex 
6). 
Coupled 
with 
intemational 
migration, 
economic 
recovery 
has 
also 
contributed 
to 
bringing 
employment 
and 
unemployment 
rates 
practically 
back 
to 
their 
January 
1998 levels, 
but 
underemployment 
continues 
to 
be 
three 
times 
higher, 
reflecting 
more 
profound 
changes 
in 
labor 
markets.

The 
fiscal 
stance 
remains vulnerable. 
Expansionary 
spending 
policies 
have 
partly 
been 
offset 
by 
increased 
and 
volatile 
revenues, 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
achieve 
medium-term 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
primary 
surpluses 
of 
the 
Non-Financial 
Public 
Sector 
(NFPS) 
have 
decreased 
from 
7.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000, 
to 
4.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
Primary 
surpluses 
have been 
almost 
exclusively 
the 
result 
of 
an 
increase 
in 
both 
petroleum 
and 
tax 
revenues, 
which 
have fluctuated 
irregularly 
between 
2 
percent and 
nearly 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
compared 
to 
1999. 
Unfortunately, 
they 
have 
covered 
a 
heavy 
burden 
of 
interest 
on 
public 
debt, 
which 
has 
left 
negative 
or 
meager 
positive global 
balances 
during 
these 
two 
years, 
exclusive 
of 
transfers 
to 
recapitalize 
commercial 
banks, 
floating 
debt, 
or external 
debt 
arrears. 
The 
primary 
surpluses 
would 
have 
been 
higher 
if 
not 
for 
the expansive 
behavior 
of 
current 
primary 
spending. 
Spending 
on 
salaries 
and 
on 
goods and 
services 
has 
almost 
doubled 
compared 
to 
predollarization 
levels-from 
about 
US$l 
billion 
and 
US$0.5 
billion, 
respectively, 
in 
1999, 
to 
about 
US$2 
billion 
and 
US$O.9 
billion, 
respectively, 
in 
2002-and 
capital 
spending 
remained 
high 
at 
6.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
15. 
Ecuador’s  external debt 
is 
principally 
to  official 
lenders. 
In 
2003, 
Ecuador 
has 
total 
net 
financial 
requirements 
of 
about 
US$2 
billion, 
which 
after 
including 
already 
scheduled 
financing, 
leaves 
a 
gap 
in 
financing 
of 
US$0.7 
billion 
(Table 
1). 
The 
largest 
share 
comes 
from 
multilateral 
and 
bilateral 
debts, 
which 
together 
represent 
more than 
90 
percent 
of 
total 
external 
debt 
amortization and 
two-thirds 
of 
total 
public 
debt amortization 
over the 
next 
three 
years. 
Scheduled 
external 
payments 
include 
repayment 
of 
arrears 
to 
the Paris 
Club 
in 
2003. 
Given 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
debt, 
Ecuadorian 
officials 
expect 
to 
fill 
the 
financing 
gap 
through a combination 
of 
(a) 
fiscal 
surpluses 
originating 
from 
expenditure 
cuts 
and 
additional income 
from 
oil 
and 
non-oil 
earnings; 
along 
with 
(b) 
a program 
of 
structural reforms that 
will 
allow 
the 
country 
to 
obtain 
rapidly 
disbursing 
and 
freely 
disposable 
external 
funds 
from 
the 
multilateral 
agencies; 
and 
(c) 
rollover 
of 
most 
of 
its 
domestic 
debt, 
with 
some 
repurchase 
coming 
from 
proceeds 
of 
its 
Fond0 
de 
Estabilizacidn, Inversidn Social 
y 
Reduccidn 
del 
Endeudamiento 
Pliblico 
(FEIREP). 
16. 
Ecuador’s 
external 
position 
is 
fragile. 
Following 
El 
Niiio 
and 
the 
strong 
capital 
outflow 
of 
1999 
that affected 
the 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
(LAC) 
Region 
and 
was 
a major factor 
in 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
crises, 
some 
relief 
of 
the 
external 
position took 
place 
in 
2000. 
That improvement 
followed 
the 
successful 
negotiations 
of 
the 
IMF 
SBA 
in 
March; 
the 
approval 
of 
financing 
by 
multilaterals, 
including 
the 
Bank, 
in 
June; 
the 
repurchasing 
of 
the 
old 
Brady 
Bonds 
and 
Eurobonds 
at 
a 
discounted value 
of 
60 
cents 
on 
the 
dollar 
in 
August; and the 
rescheduling 
of 
debt 
owed 
to 
the 
Paris 
Club 
in 
September. 
As 
a 
result, 
“excess 
freely 
disposable 
international 
reserves” 
went 
from 
negative-US$254 
million 
in 
1999-to 
positive  US$776 
million 
in 
2000, 
but 
then 
declined 
two 
years 
in 
a row, 
halving 
to 
about 
US$400 
million 
in 
2002. 
This 
result 
conceals 
very 
important 
changes 
in 
the 
components 
of 
the balance 
of 
payments. 
17. 
The 
fall 
in 
excess 
international 
reserves 
can 
largely 
be attributed 
to 
the 
sharp 
and 
sudden 
reversion 
of 
the 
current 
account 
surplus 
in 
the 
last 
two 
years. 
It 
went 
from 
a 
surplus 
of 
6.3 
percent 
in 
2000 
to 
a 
high 
deficit 
of 
5.0 
percent 
for 
2002. 
About 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
current 
account 
imbalance 
corresponds 
to 
a 
rising 
deficit 
in 
the 
trade balance. 
Several factors 
explaining 
the 
trade 
deficit 
are 
the 
“boom” 
in 
domestic demand (and 
imports) 
that 
often 
accompanies 
countries 
with 
an 
oil 
windfall 
and 
rapidly 
rising 
family 
remittances; 
diseases 
and 
difficulties 
in 
accessing 
European 
markets 
that 
have 
affected 
the 
exportable supply 
of 
Ecuadorian 
shrimp 
and 
bananas, 
respectively; 
some 
appreciation 
in 
the 
real 
exchange 
rate 
to 
precrisis 
levels; and 
the 
temporary 
surge 
in 
imports 
accompanying 
construction 
of 
the heavy crude 
oil 
pipeline 
(OCP), 
which 
is 
fully 
financed 
by 
foreign 
investment 
inflows 
in 
the 
capital 
account 
for 
about 
3 
percent 
of 
the 
2002 
GDP. 
The 
current 
account 
reversal 
hides, however, 
some 
positive 
developments, 
like 
the 
decline 
in 
net 
interest 
payments 
on external 
debt 
(nearly 
US$500 
million), 
and 
the 
growth 
in 
family 
remittances, 
which 
became 
the 
second-most-important 
source 
of 
foreign 
currency 
and 
represented about 
6.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002.

The 
financial 
system 
has 
recovered 
but 
remains 
vulnerable. 
Deposits 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
are 
stable, 
and 
credit 
to 
the 
private 
sector shows 
positive 
growth 
rates since the 
negative levels 
of 
1999. 
However, 
there are 
still 
areas 
that 
need 
improvement (Figure 
3): 
(a) 
real 
active interest 
rates 
are 
slightly 
positive, 
while 
passive rates 
remain 
negative 
and 
do 
not 
strengthen 
financial 
intermediation; 
(b) 
the expected 
decline 
in 
nominal 
interest 
rates 
following 
the 
elimination 
of 
exchange 
risk 
after 
dollarization 
has 
been 
late 
in 
coming 
and 
limited-barely 
3 
to 
4 
percent, 
and 
less 
than  the  nearly 
5 
percent 
decline 
in 
international 
interest 
rates-and 
has 
not 
provided sufficient 
stimulus 
for 
economic  recovery; 
(c) 
the 
liquidity 
of 
commercial 
banks  remains 
high-above 
30 
percent-and 
continues 
to 
fluctuate, 
which 
reflects 
the  Banks' 
concerns  about 
having 
enough 
provisions 
that 
would 
allow  them 
to 
meet 
their 
obligations 
in 
the  event 
of 
a 
run 
on 
deposits; 
and 
(d) 
a 
significant 
percentage-10 
percent-of 
the 
portfolio 
is 
delinquent and 
the 
highest 
proportion 
of 
credit 
continues 
to 
be 
concentrated 
in 
commercial 
credit,  the 
segment 
with 
the 
most 
delinquency,  a 
trend 
that 
reflects the 
difficulty 
that economic 
agents 
encounter 
in 
meeting 
their 
debts 
and 
not 
seeking 
rollovers, 
and the 
banking 
system's 
limited 
trust 
in 
granting medium-term 
credit 
for 
housing 
or 
microenterprises, 
despite 
dollarization.

The 
IMF 
and 
the 
Bank 
are providing 
technical 
and financial 
support 
in 
the 
banking 
sector. 
Key 
challenges 
are 
to 
complete 
audit 
and 
restructuring 
of 
private 
sector 
debt 
portfolios 
of 
eight closed 
banks 
held 
in 
the 
Deposit 
Guarantee 
Agency 
(AGD) 
and 
achieve 
the 
sale 
of 
Banco 
del 
Pacifico; 
strengthen 
banking 
supervision 
(including 
in 
the 
area 
of 
anti-money-laundering 
vigilance); 
approve 
effective 
bank resolution 
mechanisms; 
improve 
the 
interbank 
payments 
system, clearance, 
and 
settlement 
mechanisms 
including 
real time 
gross settlements 
for 
large value 
transactions; 
and 
create 
an 
effective 
central 
registry  that 
can 
facilitate 
scripless 
trading 
and 
ensure 
delivery 
versus  payment. 
Finally, 
a 
functional 
liquidity 
support 
mechanism  and 
credible 
deposit  insurance 
scheme 
should  be 
created. 
Whereas 
the 
SBA 
deals 
with 
the 
short-term 
commitments 
to 
liquidate pending portfolios held 
in 
the 
AGD 
and 
the 
liquidation 
of 
Banco 
del 
Pacifico, 
the 
Bank 
is 
supporting 
financial 
restructuring 
through 
its 
ongoing 
Financial 
Sector 
Technical 
Assistance 
Loan 
and 
additional financial 
sector 
advisory 
services. 
A 
joint 
Bank-Fund 
Financial 
Sector Assessment 
Program 
(FSAP) 
evaluation 
is 
scheduled 
for 
fiscal 
year 
2004.

Public 
debt remains 
high. 
The 
stock 
of 
public 
external 
debt was 
estimated 
at about 
60 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002, 
more 
than 
twice 
the 
level 
of 
exports 
and 
among 
the highest 
in 
Latin 
America. 
About 
four-fifths 
of 
total  public 
debt 
is 
external. 
Of 
this, 
about 
65 
percent 
is 
official 
debt40 
percent 
multilateral 
and 
25 
percent 
bilateral-making 
it 
somewhat  less 
vulnerable 
to 
changes 
in 
emerging 
markets 
and  offsetting 
the 
country's 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
international 
markets. 
Nearly 
two-thirds 
of 
domestic 
debt 
consists 
of 
bonds issued 
by 
AGD 
and 
the 
National 
Finance Corporation 
(CFN) 
to 
cover the 
costs 
of 
interventions 
during 
the 
banking 
crisis. 
The  burden 
of 
debt  service 
is 
excessive, 
creating 
continuous problems 
of 
illiquidity 
and 
making 
it 
very 
difficult 
to 
eliminate 
arrears. 
Approximately 
one 
of 
every three 
dollars 
entering the 
Treasury 
is 
used 
to 
pay debt 
service. 
At 
the end 
of 
2002, 
Ecuador 
also 
7 
Page  16
had 
problems 
with 
arrears 
to 
the 
Paris 
Club 
estimated at about 
US$l80 
million, 
and 
a scheduled 
amount 
of debt service 
of 
about 
8.1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(4.7 
percent 
in 
amortizations 
and 
3.4 
percent 
in 
interest 
for 
2003-04). 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
spread 
of Ecuadorian 
bonds (above 
1,850 
basis 
points) 
was 
the 
second 
highest 
in 
the 
region 
(Figure 
2). 
The outlook 
of 
the three 
major risk-rating 
agencies 
is 
that the country’s 
ability 
and 
desire 
to 
pay 
have 
improved 
with 
the 
new 
Government, 
but 
with 
a 
CCC+ 
(Standard 
& 
Poor’s) 
or 
Caa2 
(Moody’s) 
rating, 
Ecuador 
is 
still 
not 
eligible 
for 
a 
level 
of 
investment that 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
issue 
new 
sovereign 
bonds 
on 
international capital 
markets 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
However, 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
SBA, 
the 
clearance 
of 
most 
external 
arrears 
to 
Paris 
Club 
members, 
and 
the multilaterals’ 
initial 
public 
endorsements 
of 
the 
Government’s 
program 
have 
led 
Ecuadorian 
bonds spread 
to 
fall 
by 
about 
400 
basis 
points 
between 
end-December 
2002 
and 
April 
2003. 
111. 
THE 
GOVERNMENT’S 
PROGRAM 
AND 
REFORM 
AGENDA 
A. 
The 
Government’s Strategic 
Vision 
21. 
The 
Government’s 
strategy 
is 
to 
bring 
Ecuadorian 
citizens together 
to 
launch 
a 
concerted 
fight 
against 
poverty, through 
coordinated 
advances 
on 
the 
economic,  social, 
and 
governance 
fronts. 
On 
the economic front, 
the 
GOE’s 
strategy 
is 
anchored 
on 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and comprises 
reforms 
to 
stimulate 
production 
and 
commerce, 
improve 
basic  infrastructure, 
strengthen 
financial 
markets, 
and 
create 
more 
flexible 
and 
competitive 
input, 
especially labor, 
markets. 
On 
the 
social 
front, 
the 
GOE’s 
strategy 
is 
to 
reform 
social 
assistance, 
education,  health, 
and social security 
to 
better 
fight 
poverty. 
On 
governance, 
the GOE’s 
commitment 
is 
to 
fight 
corruption, 
improve 
public 
service 
delivery 
and 
transparency,  and increase 
overall 
security, 
which 
is 
broadly 
defined 
also 
to 
include 
judicial 
and 
environmental 
aspects. 
22. 
The 
new 
Administration 
announced 
its 
Program for 
Economic Restructuring 
and 
Human 
Development 
upon 
taking 
office 
on 
15 
January 
2003. 
The 
PERHD 
has 
two 
main 
pillars: 
economic 
policies 
and 
redistributive policies. 
It 
defines 
11 
social indicators 
for 
2003-07: 
poverty, 
extreme poverty, 
illiteracy, 
schooling, 
infant 
mortality 
rate, general 
mortality 
rate, 
population without 
access 
to 
health 
care, 
safe 
water 
coverage, 
sewerage 
coverage, degree 
of 
household overcrowding, 
and social 
spending 
(Annex 
4). 
It 
recognizes 
the 
precarious 
fiscal 
situation and 
declares a 
temporary 
“state 
of 
war” 
economy 
with 
respect 
to 
public 
finances. 
Short-term 
economic 
policies 
mainly 
encompass 
(a) 
an 
austerity 
Presidential 
Decree, 
“Norms 
for 
Patriotic 
Savings,” 
that 
severely 
restrains 
public 
expenditure 
to 
attack the 
immediate 
liquidity 
problem; 
a 2003 
budget consistent 
with 
such austerity norms; 
an 
increase 
in 
fuel 
prices 
by 
an 
average 
of 
20 
percent; 
(b) 
a 
tax 
reform; 
(c) 
a 
restructuring 
of 
the 
corruption-prone Ecuadorian 
Customs 
Corporation; 
(d) 
the setting-up 
of 
FEIREP 
for 
active 
debt 
reduction 
and countercyclical 
fiscal policy; 
and 
(e) 
an 
active 
public 
debt 
repurchasing program. 
The 
PERHD 
also 
ratifies 
the 
GOE’s 
intention 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency 
and 
Responsibility 
Law 
approved 
end-2002, 
and 
reinforces 
the 
importance 
of 
a 
SBA 
with 
the 
IMF, 
to 
strengthen the 
credibility 
of 
its 
overall 
macroeconomic 
framework 
and 
support 
its 
structural reforms 
(see 
Annex 
4). 
23. 
The 
PERHD 
also 
defines 
structural reforms 
to 
sustain 
economic 
recovery 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
These 
include 
civil 
service 
reform; 
completion 
of 
the 
financial 
sector 
reform;  creation 
of 
a 
Banking 
Liquidity 
Fund; 
full 
liquidation 
of 
closed 
banks; 
and 
new 
incentives 
to 
attract 
foreign 
investment, 
in 
particular 
in 
telecommunications, 
electricity, 
and 
the 
oil 
industry, 
starting 
with 
a 
transparent adjustment 
of 
tariffs 
to 
reflect 
the 
cost 
and 
quality 
of 
the service and the 
modernization 
of 
its 
regulatory 
framework. 
Institutional 
reforms 
also 
include anticorruption 
policies, 
modernization 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
pro-transparency 
and 
citizen participation 
programs. 
To 
do 
so, 
the 
GOE 
has 
organized 
Mesas 
Page  17
de 
Didogo 
and 
announced 
its 
intention 
to 
revise 
the 
decentralization framework, 
while 
engaging 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
design 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
public 
budget, 
but 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
very 
explicit 
about 
the 
strategy 
to 
accomplish 
such goals. 
24. 
Because 
some 
policies 
could 
have 
negative impacts, 
the 
PERHD 
includes 
redistributive 
social policies. 
Several recent 
measures 
will 
affect purchasing 
power, 
particularly 
of 
the 
poor.  Examples 
are 
fuel 
price 
increases, 
gradual 
adjustment 
of 
utility 
services, 
elimination 
of 
the 
gas 
subsidy 
and 
its 
replacement 
by 
a 
well-targeted 
mechanism, 
and 
freezing 
of 
wages 
of 
public 
servants. 
To 
offset 
these 
measures, 
the 
PERHD 
has 
approved 
measures 
of 
limited 
fiscal 
impact. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
(cash 
subsidy)  was 
raised 
from 
US$11.5 
to 
US$15 
per 
month; the 
pension 
of 
retirees 
was 
increased 
by 
US$5 
per 
month;  and 
a 
minimum 
pension 
of 
US$15 
per 
month 
was 
approved 
for 
people 
over 
68 
years 
of 
age 
who 
are 
not 
receiving 
the 
Bono 
SoZidurio. 
Officials 
are 
also 
proposing 
to 
replace 
the regressive 
gas 
subsidy 
by 
one  targeted 
toward 
the 
poorest 
and 
most  vulnerable 
groups, 
and, 
supported 
by 
the 
Programmatic 
Human 
Development Loan, 
to 
protect social 
spending 
and 
implement 
reforms 
in 
the social 
sectors 
and 
the 
social 
security 
system. 
Additionally, 
there 
is 
new 
emphasis 
being 
placed 
on 
developing 
active 
policies 
to 
generate 
economic opportunities 
(incomes) 
for 
the poor, especially indigenous 
and 
rural 
populations, 
though 
detailed proposals 
are 
still 
being 
developed. 
B. 
The 
Reform 
Agenda 
1. 
Why 
Are 
Adjustment 
and 
Structural 
Reform 
Still 
Needed? 
25. 
Adjustment 
policies 
and 
structural 
reforms 
are 
critical 
for 
correcting 
internal 
and 
external 
imbalances, 
creating 
room 
for 
pro-poor 
social 
policies, 
and 
supporting 
a 
solid economic 
recovery. 
Ecuador 
has 
limited 
policy 
choices 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the possible 
medium-term 
collapse 
of 
dollarization.  The 
country 
must 
counteract 
the 
rigidity 
involved 
in 
adopting 
the 
dollar 
as 
legal 
currency 
for 
circulation, 
savings, 
and 
domestic  transactions. 
With 
no 
control 
over  monetary 
or 
exchange 
rate 
policy, 
and 
no 
ability 
to 
“hide” 
fiscal 
imbalances 
and 
alter 
relative  prices 
by 
depreciating 
the 
domestic 
currency, 
Ecuador 
needs 
to 
simultaneously 
ensure 
macroeconomic 
stability 
exclusively 
through 
solvency 
and 
fiscal 
stability,  and 
introduce 
flexibility 
in 
goods and services 
markets 
to 
maintain 
the competitiveness 
of 
its 
products 
on 
domestic and 
foreign 
markets. 
26. 
A 
debt 
sustainability 
analysis 
indicates 
that 
Ecuador 
needs sizable 
primary 
fiscal 
surpluses 
to lead 
its 
debt 
along 
a 
sustainable 
path. 
From 
a 
fiscal 
sustainability 
perspective, 
given 
the 
initial 
situation 
of 
financing 
constraints 
and 
high 
public 
debt 
(60 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002), 
this 
requires 
making 
adjustments 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
primary 
surpluses 
in 
the 
fiscal 
accounts 
estimated 
at 
an 
average 
of 
4 
to 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
over the 
next 
years. 
This 
would 
bring 
debt 
below 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP 
at the 
end 
of 
the 
decade, 
while 
ensuring 
short-term 
liquidity 
and guaranteeing 
the 
country’s 
solvency 
for 
its 
public 
debt 
service 
obligations 
in 
the 
medium term 
(see 
Annex 
5). 
The fiscal 
adjustment 
would 
take 
into 
account the 
volatility 
of 
tax 
revenues 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
variability 
in 
petroleum 
prices. 
To 
offset 
it, 
particularly 
during 
a 
foreseeable 
scenario 
of 
price 
reductions, the 
application 
of 
automatic  stabilizers 
and 
better 
use 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
receipts 
during 
the 
current 
boom 
are 
projected. 
27. 
Increasing 
the 
flexibility 
of 
the 
market 
of 
factors 
of 
production, 
especially 
labor, 
is 
critical. 
Without 
exchange 
rate 
policy, 
there 
are 
limited 
instruments 
to 
respond 
to 
adverse shocks 
or 
to 
cushion 
public policy 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
real 
sector. 
Market 
rigidities, 
with 
high 
costs 
not 
only 
for 
production 
but 
for 
goods 
and 
services, 
might 
lead 
to 
negative effects 
on 
competitiveness, 
growth, and 
job 
creation, 
which 
could 
threaten 
dollarization’s  sustainability. 
The 
risk 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that, 
given 
inflexible 
markets-such 
as 
the 
formal 
labor 
market-adjustments 
to 
shocks 
occur 
primarily 
through 
reductions 
in 
amounts 
produced 
(and 
sold), 
with 
the 
contraction 
in 
demand based 
on 
inputs, 
particularly 
labor. 
This 
would 
not 
only 
create 
pressure 
to 
“abandon” 
the model, 
in 
view 
of 
increased unemployment, 
but 
would 
also 
increase 
9 
Page  18
commercial 
banks’ 
arrears 
as 
economic 
activity 
fell. 
This 
would 
threaten 
fiscal 
adjustment  goals 
and 
recovery 
of 
the 
banking 
system. 
Two 
external 
shocks 
would 
require  particular 
attention: 
frrst, 
devaluations 
or 
depreciations 
(discrete 
or 
continuous) 
of 
the currencies 
of 
Ecuador’s  trade partners; 
or 
second, 
appreciation 
of the 
dollar 
against other “strong”  currencies. 
In 
both 
cases, 
the 
“appreciation” 
of 
the 
dollar 
would 
have 
to 
be offset 
by 
increases 
in 
productivity 
and/or 
by 
deflationary 
adjustments 
in 
production 
and 
transaction 
costs 
to 
maintain 
competitiveness 
and 
avoid 
the loss 
of 
markets. 
28. 
In 
summary, the 
essential 
conditions 
for 
sustaining 
dollarization 
are 
to 
consolidate 
the 
fiscal 
stance 
and 
foster 
competitive growth 
based 
on 
more 
flexible markets, 
and 
rising productivity. 
2. 
The 
Challenge 
of 
Consolidating the 
Fiscal 
Stance 
29. 
The 
GOE 
has  demonstrated  an 
early 
commitment 
to 
fiscal 
adjustment,  despite 
the 
difficult 
economic, 
political, 
and 
social conditions. 
Important 
issues 
have been 
identified, 
and 
the 
Government 
has 
embraced a 
comprehensive development 
agenda. 
30. 
Strengthening the Fiscal 
Framework. 
Procyclical 
and discretionary 
policies 
have 
resulted 
in 
volatile 
revenue, 
expansionary 
spending, 
declining primary 
surpluses, 
and 
little 
credibility 
in 
fiscal 
management. 
In 
late 
January 
2003, 
the Government 
published 
an 
Executive 
Decree 
containing 
the 
norms 
(Reglamento) 
of 
key 
components 
of 
the 
Fiscal 
Tranparency, 
Stability 
and 
Responsibility 
Law: 
(a) 
multiannual 
budgeting, 
(b) 
quantitative 
targets 
for 
fiscal 
variables, 
(c) 
a 
Public 
Debt 
Reduction 
Plan, 
(d) 
management 
of 
the 
resources 
saved 
in 
the 
oil 
stabilization 
fund, 
and 
(e) 
budget 
transparency 
and 
citizen 
control. 
These 
norms 
should 
bring 
a 
medium-term 
strategic 
approach 
into 
budgeting, 
increase 
predictability 
of 
critical 
fiscal 
variables,  design a 
comprehensive debt 
management 
strategy, 
make 
sure 
that 
oil 
revenues saved 
in 
the 
oil 
fund 
are used 
for 
debt 
reduction,  and 
comply 
with 
the 
government’s 
main 
goal 
of 
eradicating 
corruption 
by 
increased 
disclosure 
and 
civil 
society 
empowerment 
in 
the 
social 
auditing 
of 
fiscal 
accounts. 
3 
1. 
Enhancing 
Revenue 
Management. 
Fiscal 
revenues are 
vulnerable 
to 
the 
variability 
of 
oil 
prices, 
which 
gives 
fiscal 
receipts 
a 
procyclical 
nature; 
the 
excessive 
number 
of 
preassigned 
taxes; 
and 
low 
collections 
of 
nonpetroleum 
taxes, 
which 
is 
a consequence 
of 
the 
low 
value-added 
tax 
(VAT) 
and 
the 
excessive 
number 
of 
exemptions, 
particularly 
on 
the 
VAT 
and 
the 
income tax 
(ISR). 
Each dollar drop 
in 
the 
price 
of 
a 
barrel 
of 
oil 
means 
a 
reduction 
of 
receipts 
of 
about 
0.2 
to 
0.3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
excessive 
use 
of 
distortions,  such 
as 
exemptions and 
earmarkings, 
is 
a 
result 
of 
“fine-tuning” 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
special 
interest 
 group^.^ 
The 
large number 
of 
taxes 
(more 
than 
SO) 
reduces 
tax 
efficiency 
because 
it 
makes 
it 
impossible 
for 
officials 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
taxes 
that 
are a 
priority. 
The 
deeply 
rooted 
practice 
of 
providing 
tax 
exemptions 
robs 
the 
tax 
system 
of 
transparency, 
equity, 
and 
efficiency. 
Failure 
is 
particularly 
acute 
in 
terms 
of 
meeting redistributive 
goals 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
VAT, 
and 
in 
promoting 
socially 
profitable 
processes 
in 
the 
case 
of 
low 
and corruption-prone 
tax 
collection 
by 
Customs. 
The 
excessive 
earmarking of 
taxes 
(over 
50) 
also 
impedes 
more 
efficient 
use 
of 
about 
1.7 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP 
of 
fiscal 
resources, 
and 
discourages 
tax 
collection 
by 
provincial 
or 
municipal 
governments, 
as 
they 
become accustomed 
to 
transfers 
from 
the 
Central 
Government. 
Under 
this 
operation, the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
reducing the 
volatility 
of 
fiscal 
revenues 
by 
increasing 
non-oil 
revenues, 
broadening the 
tax 
base, 
simplifying 
the 
tax 
structure, 
and 
promoting 
a 
more 
efficient 
allocation 
of 
fiscal 
revenue. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the 
multiyear 
reform 
program 
supports 
tax 
measures 
mainly 
encompassing, 
among 
others 
things, 
(a) 
a gradual 
elimination 
of 
most 
VAT 
and 
ISR 
tax 
exemptions, 
(b) 
simplification 
of 
the tax 
system 
with 
the 
elimination 
of 
most 
nuisance 
taxes, 
and 
(c) 
a 
gradual 
elimination 
of 
most 
unconstitutional 
2. 
In 
view 
of 
its 
impact 
on 
environmental protection, and the 
small 
size 
of 
the 
amounts 
involved, the 
principle 
of 
earmarking 
revenue 
is, 
however, appropriate 
for 
keeping an

earmarked 
taxes. 
And 
in 
tax administration, 
it 
mainly 
addresses 
(a) 
the 
setting 
of 
quantitative 
benchmarks 
to 
tax 
collection 
administered 
by 
the 
IRS, 
thus 
consolidating 
its 
positive 
performance 
of 
the last 
two 
years; 
and 
(b) 
it 
supports 
an 
improved 
tax 
collection 
by 
Customs. 
Under 
this 
operation, 
the 
Executive 
has 
submitted 
a 
draft 
bill 
to 
Congress 
aimed 
at 
improving 
tax 
collection 
by 
Customs 
through 
(a) 
a 
strengthened 
IRS 
role on 
the Customs board, 
(b) 
a 
complete restructuring 
of 
Customs, 
(c) 
rationalization 
of 
Customs 
personnel, 
(d) 
full 
and 
timely 
access 
to import 
bills 
by 
the 
IRS, 
(e) 
virtual 
crosschecking 
information 
with 
taxpayer files, 
(f) 
severe 
penalties 
for 
underinvoicing 
import 
bills, 
and 
(g) 
improved 
border control. 
32. 
Improving 
Public 
Expenditure Management. 
There 
are three 
related problems 
with 
public 
expenditure: 
it 
is 
inflexible 
(particularly 
on 
salaries), 
it 
is 
inertial, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
transparent. 
Budget 
rigidity 
is 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
fiscal 
discipline, 
since 
it 
captures 
most projected 
increases 
in 
earmarked 
tax 
revenues 
and 
thus 
will 
require further 
squeezing 
of 
discretionary 
spending-including 
counterpart 
funds 
for  investment 
financed 
by 
external 
sources-to 
comply 
with 
the 
3.5 
percent 
cap 
on 
real 
primary 
expenditure 
growth. 
Derived 
from 
it, 
inertial 
expenditure 
is 
perhaps 
the 
most 
serious 
obstacle 
to 
price 
stability. 
The 
lack 
of 
transparency prevents 
adequate 
control 
and 
public 
auditing, 
and 
encourages 
tax 
evasion. 
Expenditure 
rigidity 
is 
very 
severe 
and 
increasing. 
The 
discretionary  (unallocated) 
portion 
of 
the budget 
was 
about 
5 
percent of 
GDP 
in 
2002 and 
declined 
to 
4 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003. 
For 
its 
part, 
primary 
spending 
grew 
from 
19.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1999 
to 
21.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002, 
a 
period 
of 
presumed 
adjustment. 
Budget 
rigidity 
is 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
fixed 
public 
payroll, 
and 
tax 
earmarking-oil- 
and 
non-oil 
related-written 
into 
over 
50 
current 
legal 
regulations 
and 
mainly benefiting 
nonaccountable 
spending 
by 
sectional 
(subnational)  governments. 
The 
wage 
bill 
doubled 
in 
U.S. 
dollar 
terms between 
2000 
and 
2002 
and, 
even after 
applying 
the 
2003 
austerity 
measures, 
still 
must 
absorb 
a 
carryover 
of 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
from 
the 
wage 
increases 
and 
benefits 
approved 
by 
the 
previous 
government 
in 
2002. 
The 
budget lacks 
transparency 
because some 
fundamental 
modern tools 
are 
missing: 
there 
is 
no 
centralized 
public 
payroll, 
there 
is 
limited 
coverage 
and 
information 
registering 
of 
public 
expenditure 
by 
the 
Integrated 
Government 
Financial 
Management 
System 
(SIGEF), 
and 
there 
is 
an 
absence 
of 
controls 
on 
preassigned spending 
and 
resources assigned 
to 
public 
enterprises 
and 
subnational governments. 
To 
halt 
expansionary 
spending 
in 
the 
short term, 
the 
Government 
has 
issued 
an 
Executive 
Decree 
that 
freezes 
wages 
for 
regular 
civil 
servants, 
suspends 
overtime 
allowances,  reduces 
the 
President’s  salary 
by 
20 
percent, reduces 
the 
salary 
of 
government 
appointees 
by 
10 
percent, reduces 
the 
number 
of 
new 
positions 
to 
be 
filled, 
and 
restrains  spending 
on 
goods 
and 
services. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
fiscal 
retrenchment 
requires 
complying 
with 
the 
cap 
in 
real 
primary 
spending 
set 
up 
in 
the 
FI’SFU,. 
Measures 
to 
increase 
transparency 
under 
this 
operation 
will 
be 
addressed 
in 
a Transparency 
Plan 
with 
three components: 
(a) 
a 
SIGEF-based system 
to 
produce 
monthly, timely, and 
reliable 
reports 
on 
executed 
expenditure 
beginning 
in 
mid-2003, 
and 
consolidated 
NFPS 
financial 
statements 
through 
the Government’s  website 
(Portal) 
beginning 
in 
2004; 
(b) 
an 
e-government system 
to 
develop 
public 
procurement; 
and 
(c) 
a 
national public 
investment 
system. 
33. 
Taking 
Control 
of 
the 
Wage 
Bill. 
The 
wage 
bill 
accounts 
for 
about 
half 
of 
Central Government 
primary 
spending 
in 
2003. 
Ecuador’s 
current 
wage 
and 
personnel 
management systems generate three 
main 
problems 
(see 
Annex 
7). 
First, 
the 
proliferation 
of 
salary  components  has 
undermined 
the 
government’s 
control 
over 
the 
wage 
bill. 
The 
result 
is 
a 
payroll 
system 
with 
a 
myriad 
of 
separate 
components 
that make 
up 
the 
monthly 
salary, 
and 
no 
coherent 
control 
over pay 
policy. 
Second, 
there 
is 
no 
government 
office 
with 
a 
reliable 
and comprehensive 
picture 
of 
the 
number 
of 
public 
employees 
by 
ministry, 
department, 
agency, 
post, 
and 
grade, 
and 
with 
the capacity 
to 
track 
which 
employees 
have 
been 
removed 
from 
public 
service 
(with 
the 
payment 
of 
an 
indemnity) 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
do not 
return 
to 
the 
state’s 
employ. 
Third, 
there 
is 
no 
comprehensive 
human 
resources 
policy, 
since salary 
inequities 
and 
hiring 
discretion 
discourage 
staff 
that 
believe 
they 
are 
unfairly 
compensated 
relative 
to 
similar 
professionals 
employed 
in 
another 
part 
of 
government, 
particularly 
those 
in 
autonomous agencies.

34. 
Implementing 
civil 
service 
reform. 
Under 
this 
operation, 
the Government 
is 
committed 
to 
civil 
service reform, 
and 
it 
has 
completed 
a 
final 
draft 
of 
public 
salary 
unification. 
This 
bill 
will 
seek 
Congressional 
approval 
of 
a 
law 
collapsing nearly 
all 
salary components 
into 
a 
single 
base 
wage. 
It 
is 
an 
essential 
first 
step 
to 
reestablish 
government 
control 
over 
the  wage 
bill, 
make 
wage 
policy 
more 
transparent, 
and 
facilitate 
registration 
of 
public 
employees. 
The outgoing 
Administration 
submitted 
a 
draft 
law 
to 
Congress, 
but 
it 
was 
rejected 
in 
committee. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
law 
would 
be 
easiest 
in 
ministries that have 
already 
reduced 
salary categories 
from 
a 21-grade 
to 
a  14-grade 
pay 
scale. 
As 
a 
critical 
complementary 
step, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
submitting 
a 
bill 
on civil 
service 
and 
administrative 
career 
reform. 
The  rationalization 
of 
public 
employment 
implies 
staffing 
reviews. 
However,  the 
largest 
ministries 
(agriculture, 
social 
protection, 
education,  health, 
and 
public 
works) 
remain 
under 
the 
21-grade system 
and 
with 
no 
staffing 
reviews. 
Under 
its 
Program, 
by 
December 
2003 
the 
GOE 
is 
expected 
to 
complete 
a 
staffing review 
for 
these 
ministries 
so 
that 
implementation 
of 
the 
Unification 
Law 
may 
proceed 
swiftly. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
those 
reviews, 
certain 
staff may 
be 
identified 
as 
redundant. 
A 
lack 
of 
resources 
to 
pay 
indemnities 
would 
limit 
the 
government’s 
ability 
to 
dismiss 
redundant 
employees. 
Therefore,  a 
study 
would 
assess 
the cost 
and 
sources 
of 
funding 
to 
pay 
these 
indemnities,  and 
their 
impact 
on 
the 
payroll. 
Last, 
to 
control 
the 
wage 
bill, 
the  government 
would 
manage 
not only 
pay 
scales, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
personnel, 
as 
well. 
At 
present, 
information 
is 
woefully 
inadequate 
to 
this 
task. 
Thus, 
as 
a 
key 
complement 
to 
the salary 
unification, the 
Program 
calls 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
consolidated 
database 
for 
registering 
all 
public 
employees 
and 
their 
salary 
benefits. 
35. 
Achieving 
a 
Sustainable 
Public Debt. 
The 
liquidity 
and solvency 
of 
Ecuador’s 
public 
external 
debt 
are 
delicate. 
On 
one hand, 
Ecuador 
has 
immediate 
problems 
to 
resolve over 
arrears 
with 
the 
Paris 
Club, 
estimated 
at 
approximately 
US$lSO 
million 
in 
2002, 
and 
debt 
service 
of 
9.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
for 
2003 
and 
2004. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
(a) 
to 
reduce the 
debt 
to 
sustainable levels, 
Ecuador 
needs 
primary 
surpluses 
of 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP; 
and 
(b) 
to 
close the 
financial 
gap 
in 
the next 
two 
years, 
it 
will 
require 
additional 
resources 
of 
around 
4 percent 
of 
GDP 
(Annex 
5). 
Given 
its 
dollarized 
status, 
under the 
fiscal 
rule 
the 
GOE 
aims 
to 
(a) 
reduce 
the 
public 
debt-to-GDP 
ratio 
by 
16 
percent 
of 
GDP 
before 
2006 
under 
the 
fiscal 
rule, 
and 
(b) 
reduce 
the 
public 
debt-to-GDP 
ratio 
below 
a 
benchmark 
40 
percent. 
Moreover, 
when compared 
to 
other deeply 
indebted 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
Ecuador 
has 
limited 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
debt  management: 
it 
is 
strictly 
operational 
and 
not 
analytical, 
lacks 
transparency, 
is 
fragmented, 
and 
is 
poorly 
coordinated between the Finance 
Ministry 
and 
the 
Central 
Bank. 
Under 
this 
operation, 
the 
GOE 
has 
cleared 
100 
percent 
of 
all 
external 
public 
debt arrears 
accumulated 
up 
to 
February 
2003, 
and 
100 
percent 
of 
all 
domestic 
bonded 
public 
debt 
arrears 
accumulated 
up 
to 
March 
2003. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
set 
a 
Paris 
Club 
meeting 
to 
reach 
an agreement 
next 
June 
on 
all 
March 
2003-04 
external 
arrears. 
Under 
the 
Program 
supported 
by 
this 
operation, 
and 
also 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
fiscal 
law, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
preparing 
a 
Debt 
Reduction Plan 
that 
would 
set 
policies 
to 
clear 
its 
remaining 
arrears 
for 
2003, 
repay 
its 
debt 
with 
the 
Ecuadorian Social 
Security 
Institute 
(IESS), 
gradually 
repay 
expensive 
debt 
in 
Global 
bonds, 
as 
well 
as 
strengthen 
its 
institutional 
capacity, 
and 
make 
debt 
management 
transparent, 
with 
regular 
publication 
of 
commitments  and 
payments 
on 
debt 
service, 
including floating 
debt 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
fiscal 
law. 
36. 
The 
debt 
sustainability 
analysis 
is 
robust, even 
if 
the 
country 
faces 
a 
significant 
external 
shock. 
If 
oil 
prices 
fall 
significantly 
for 
several 
years, 
the Government 
could 
still 
reach 
its 
public 
debt-to- 
GDP 
benchmark, 
but 
two 
to 
three years 
later (Figure 
4 
and 
Annex 
5).

37. 
The 
overall 
net impact 
of 
the fiscal 
measures considered 
by 
the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
is 
projected 
to 
raise 
revenues 
of 
about 
US$0.5 
billion, 
equivalent 
to 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(Table 
2). 
The 
change 
in 
the 
domestic 
price 
of 
fuels 
will 
raise revenue 
by 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Tax 
measures 
would 
raise 
revenue 
by 
another 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
reversal 
of 
external 
tariff 
rates 
by 
the 
Consejo de 
Comercio Exterior 
e 
Znversiones 
(COmXI) 
will 
recover revenue 
for 
about 
0.3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
There 
is 
an 
inframarginal 
gain 
associated 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
nuisance 
taxes, 
but 
this 
action 
would 
facilitate 
tax 
collection. 
Since 
tax administration 
and 
collection 
by 
the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Service 
(SRI) 
has 
markedly improved 
over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
there are 
good 
reasons 
to 
expect 
that 
tax 
collection 
administered 
by 
the 
SRI 
will 
continue 
to 
increase 
slightly. 
However,  social 
compensation 
measures 
represent a 
fiscal 
cost 
of 
about 
0.4 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
whereas 
the 
carryover 
of 
last 
year’s 
wage increases, 
despite 
austerity 
measures, 
represents a 
fiscal 
cost 
of 
1.0 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003. 
In 
sum, 
the increase 
in 
the 
wage 
bill 
due 
to 
the 
inertial 
growth 
of 
the 
public 
payroll 
in 
2003 
will 
phase 
out 
about 
one-third 
of 
the 
additional 
revenue obtained 
from 
the 
adjustment 
measures. 
3. 
Fostering 
Growth 
through 
Competitiveness 
38. 
Developing 
a 
Competitiveness  Agenda. 
Competitiveness 
is 
instrumental 
to 
sustaining 
dollarization.  However, 
competitiveness abroad 
and 
the investment 
climate 
at 
home 
require 
adjustments. 
Nearly 
all 
global 
indicators 
show 
indisputable 
and 
consistent 
evidence 
that the 
competitiveness 
gaps 
are 
significant and growing. 
In 
2001, 
Ecuador 
ranked 
54’h 
out 
of 
62 
countries evaluated 
in 
terms 
of 
global 
competitiveness 
during 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum. 
In 
2002, 
Ecuador’s 
ranking 
deteriorated  even 
further 
when 
it 
was 
classified 
as 
73rd 
among 
80 
countries, 
with 
the 
highest 
relative 
percentage for 
innovation 
and 
the 
lowest 
in 
terms 
of 
business 
climate 
and 
respect 
for 
countries 
and 
for 
laws.  One 
of 
the 
first 
steps 
of 
the 
new Administration 
is 
to 
design 
a 
simplified 
agenda 
of 
policies 
and laws 
to 
strengthen 
competitiveness: 
revision 
of 
the 
Law 
of 
Competitiveness;  trade 
reform; 
pricing 
policies; 
a 
framework 
conducive 
to 
private 
participation 
in 
basic 
infrastructure; 
and 
strengthening the 
petroleum 
industry.

Accelerating 
Trade 
Reform. 
Trade 
reform 
to 
correct 
an anti-export 
bias 
is 
fundamental 
to 
promoting 
nontraditional 
exports. 
This 
bias 
is 
preventing 
modernization 
and 
competition 
based 
on 
profitability. 
Ecuador 
has seven 
import 
tariff 
rates 
ranging 
from 
0 
to 
35 
percent, 
with 
a 
simple 
average 
tariff 
of 
11.3 
percent. 
The external 
tariff 
approved 
by 
CAN 
covers about 
62 
percent 
of 
tariff 
items. 
The 
combination 
of 
high 
Ecuadorian 
tariffs 
for 
final 
products and 
tariff 
dispersion 
leads 
to 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
effective 
protection 
rates 
that 
force 
consumers, 
including 
the 
poor, 
to 
subsidize 
uncompetitive,  high-cost 
14 
Page  23
local 
producers. 
The 
anti-export bias 
is 
reinforced 
by 
the 
discriminatory application 
of 
nontariff 
barriers 
(NTBs). 
Import 
licenses and 
technical norms 
are the 
most 
important 
NTBs. 
On 
one 
hand, 
licenses are 
distributed 
in 
a 
discretionary 
manner. 
They 
are 
still 
applied 
to 
about 
1,600 
out 
of 
6,707 
tariff 
items, 
and 
about 
8 
percent 
of 
those 
are 
duplicated 
and 
concentrated 
in 
the 
health 
and 
agricultural 
sectors. 
Import 
licenses 
cover 
about 25 percent 
of 
all 
tariff 
positions, 
which 
account 
for 
about 
10 
percent 
of 
total imports 
into 
Ecuador. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
licenses 
contradict 
the 
norms 
of 
the 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
(WTO). 
On 
the other 
hand, 
there are 
757 obligatory 
technical 
norms and 
1,339 
optional 
norms used 
as 
obstacles against 
imports. 
About 
half 
of 
them 
are concentrated 
in 
five 
categories:  food, 
construction 
materials, chemicals, 
mechanical 
components, 
and 
oil 
products. 
Upon 
its 
accession 
to 
the 
WTO 
in 
1996, 
Ecuador signed the 
WTO 
Normalization 
Code, 
but 
has 
not 
applied 
it. 
The 
Government’s 
trade 
reform 
agenda 
intends 
to 
work 
on 
three 
fronts. 
First, 
it 
intends 
to 
simplify 
the 
Customs 
tariff 
to 
five 
rates 
of 
0, 
5, 
10, 
15, 
and 
20 
percent 
as 
agreed 
with 
other Andean 
countries. 
This 
is 
only 
an 
initial 
effort, 
since the 
recent 
Latin 
American 
tendency 
is 
toward 
tariffs 
below 
10 
percent, 
to 
slightly 
diminish 
tariff 
dispersion 
and reduce the 
effective protection 
rates. 
It 
would 
represent a 
positive 
step 
toward 
preparation 
of 
the 
future  Free 
Trade  Agreement 
of 
the  Americas. 
More 
important, 
supported 
by 
this 
operation,  the 
Government 
has 
unified 
100 
percent 
of 
duplicative 
import 
licenses. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
eliminating 
most 
of 
those 
import 
licenses that 
did 
not 
register 
commercial 
activity 
from 
1991 
through 
2000 
(about 
919 
tariff 
positions), 
and 
to 
setting 
up 
a 
simplified 
regime 
for 
import 
licensing, 
to 
reduce 
processing 
time 
from 
40 
to 
60 
days 
to 
24 
hours 
by 
December 
2003. 
Finally, 
the 
GOE 
will 
dismantle 
about 
10 
percent 
of 
existing 
technical norms per 
year 
previously 
evaluated, 
which 
do 
not 
comply 
with 
WTO 
regulations. 
40. 
Promoting 
Market-Pricing 
Policies 
and 
a 
New 
Regulatory 
Framework  for 
Private 
Participation. 
The 
sectors 
of 
water 
and 
sanitation, 
electricity,  and 
telecommunications 
confront 
problems 
such 
as 
low 
coverage 
(particularly 
in 
rural 
areas), 
low 
efficiency,  and 
poor 
quality 
of 
services, 
in 
part 
derived 
from 
pricing 
policies 
setting 
tariffs 
below 
real 
economic 
costs 
and 
incomplete 
institutional 
and 
regulatory 
frameworks. 
The national 
government 
would 
confront 
these 
challenges 
by 
seeking greater 
local, 
national, 
and 
international 
private 
sector 
participation, 
which 
can be 
achieved 
only 
with 
market 
tariffs, 
and 
by 
consolidating 
the 
regulatory framework. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
problems, the 
water 
and 
sanitation 
sector 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
low 
recovery 
of 
costs 
through 
charges, 
the 
high 
dependency 
on 
transfers 
from 
the 
Central 
Government 
to 
cover the deficit, 
and the 
lack 
of 
an 
integral 
national 
system 
of 
water 
resources. 
All 
water  and sanitation 
services come 
from 
decentralized 
providers 
that  depend 
on 
municipal 
governments, 
and the 
Central 
Government intends 
to 
use three 
main 
instruments 
to 
improve 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
and 
to 
extend 
coverage: 
(a) 
perfect 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional framework 
by 
restructuring 
the 
Subsecretariat 
of 
Drinking 
Water 
and 
Basic Sanitation 
(Subsecretada 
de 
Agua 
Potable 
y 
Saneamiento 
Bdsico, 
SAPYSB), 
and 
submitting 
to 
Congress a 
new 
Water 
and 
Sanitation 
Law; 
(b) 
reform 
the 
use 
of 
central 
transferences 
to 
introduce 
incentives 
for 
profitability 
among service providers; 
and 
(c) 
create a 
Water 
Fund 
inside 
MIDUVI 
to 
link 
transfer 
to 
the 
sector 
to 
performance-based 
criteria 
by 
local 
water 
companies. 
The  preparation 
of 
the  Water 
Law 
should 
ensure 
consistency 
with 
existing 
environmental laws 
and 
regulations 
(para. 45). 
41. 
The 
most 
urgent 
problems 
of 
the 
electricity 
sector 
are 
tariff 
adjustments 
and 
the financial 
unsustainability 
of 
the 
wholesale 
market. 
The 
electricity 
sector 
has 
gone 
through 
an 
incomplete 
reform 
process  since  1996  and 
is 
not 
financially 
sustainable. 
Reforms 
to 
separate 
electricity 
generation, 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
functions,  and 
put 
in 
place 
a 
wholesale 
energy 
market regulated 
by 
the 
National 
Electricity 
Council 
(CONELEC) 
and 
efficiently 
administered 
and 
monitored 
by 
the 
National 
Center 
of 
Energy 
Control 
(CENACE) 
are 
incomplete. 
The 
Solidarity 
Fund 
(FS) 
and 
local 
government 
owners 
of 
power distribution 
companies 
have 
failed 
to 
upgrade 
their 
management, 
permitting 
average 
losses 
of 
one-third 
of 
energy 
generated, 
as 
a 
combination 
of 
distribution 
losses 
and 
insufficient 
bill 
collection. 
Genuine 
reforms 
in 
the 
sector 
to 
mobilize 
badly 
needed 
private 
investment  and 
achieve 
sustainable 
efficiency  improvements  require 
political 
commitment. 
The 
Government 
Program 
is 
15 
Page  24
committed 
to 
the preparation 
of 
a strategy 
to 
reduce the 
financial 
deficit 
and 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
in 
the 
electricity 
sector, 
which 
would 
entail 
the 
main 
following 
elements: 
efficient functioning 
of 
mechanisms 
for 
effective payments 
to 
generators 
(fideicomisos); 
a strategy 
to 
resolve 
the 
situation 
of 
Emelec,  the 
Guayaquil 
distribution utility; 
debt 
restructuring 
for 
all 
government-owned 
companies 
in 
the 
sector; 
and 
a 
medium-term 
strategy 
for 
sustainable 
efficiency 
improvements 
in 
distribution 
and 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
sector. 
The 
Bank‘s 
PROMEC 
approved 
in 
2001 
to 
modernize 
electricity and 
telecommunications 
services 
in 
rural 
areas, 
is 
assisting 
with 
the 
regulatory 
framework, 
particularly 
in 
the 
wholesale 
market, 
and 
with 
electrification 
for 
poor 
rural 
households, 
as 
well 
as 
energy 
conservation 
through 
GEF 
support. 
The 
PROMEC’s 
project 
has 
a 
major 
social 
outreach component 
to 
build 
public 
support 
for 
further 
tariff 
adjustment 
toward 
reaching 
the  estimated 
economic 
cost 
of 
US 
10.4 
cents/kWh 
in 
average. 
These 
adjustments 
were 
initiated 
by 
the 
previous 
Administration 
and 
average 
tariffs 
reached about 
75-80 
percent 
of 
economic 
cost 
in 
2002. 
All 
customer categories are 
now 
charged a 
tariff 
that 
fully 
covers 
economic 
cost, 
except 
residential 
customers 
with 
consumption 
lower 
than 300 
kWh/month. 
Supported 
by 
this 
operation, 
the 
new 
Administration 
has 
decided 
to 
resume 
tariff 
adjustment 
for 
this 
category 
of 
customers, 
with 
a 
gradual 
adjustment 
of 
1.64 
percent 
per 
month, 
so 
that 
economic 
costs 
are 
reached 
for 
all 
customers 
over 
a three-year 
period. 
This 
gradual 
increase 
would 
represent 
only 
about 
2 
to 
3 
percent 
of 
total 
expenditure 
even 
for 
the 
poorest households. 
It 
should also 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
poorest households 
(about 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population) 
still 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
electricity. 
In 
sum, 
to 
confront 
these 
challenges, 
the 
multiyear 
Program 
supported 
by 
this 
operation 
supports 
continuous 
progress 
in 
the 
tariff 
adjustment-with 
the 
appropriate 
“lifeline”-type  protection 
for 
poorer 
households-until 
they 
fully 
cover 
their economic 
cost, 
and 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a strategy 
to 
eliminate 
the 
financial 
deficit 
of 
the 
electricity 
sector. 
42. 
The 
telecommunications 
sector 
is 
challenged 
by 
low, 
undustainable 
local  rates 
and 
a 
deficient 
regulatory 
framework. 
CONATEL 
signed 
with 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL 
concession 
contracts 
that 
authorized 
tariff 
increases 
to 
the 
price 
cap 
limits 
in 
December 
2001. 
However, the 
previous 
Government decided 
not 
to 
raise 
all 
tariffs 
to 
these 
limits. 
All 
commercial 
tariffs 
were adjusted 
to 
levels 
that 
eliminated 
cross-subsidies. 
However, the prices 
for 
residential 
local 
calls 
are 
still 
subsidized 
by 
long- 
distance 
calls. 
The 
new 
Government 
recognizes 
that 
these 
rates 
need 
to 
be 
adjusted, 
to 
eliminate 
cross- 
subsidies 
and 
to 
promote  competitive 
long-distance 
rates 
that 
will, 
in 
tum, 
increase 
Ecuador’s 
international 
competitiveness. 
Supported 
by 
this 
operation, 
the Government 
has 
devised 
a strategy 
to 
eliminate 
cross-subsidies 
in 
one 
year. 
All 
rates 
will 
be 
adjusted 
to 
the 
price 
cap 
limits 
set 
by 
CONATEL 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2003. 
In 
addition, 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL 
have 
recently 
created a 
new 
company, 
TELECSA, 
to 
provide 
mobile 
services 
in 
Ecuador. 
Recognizing 
that 
their 
operational 
indicators 
compare 
unfavorably 
against 
regional 
benchmarks, 
and 
that 
this 
new 
venture 
will 
require 
resources 
and expertise 
beyond 
the 
Companies’  capacities,  the 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a  strategy 
for 
attracting 
a 
private 
operator 
to 
invest 
in 
this 
new 
venture under 
this 
operation. 
The 
Government 
must 
act 
quickly 
to 
stop 
subsidies, 
especially 
to 
PACIFICTEL. 
Finally, 
the current 
Telecommunications 
Law 
is 
obsolete 
and 
has 
many contradictions, due 
to 
its 
multiple 
revisions. 
This 
gloomy 
regulatory 
framework 
is 
a 
disincentive 
for 
investors, 
because 
it 
gives the 
regulatory 
entities 
(CONATEL 
and 
SUPTEL) 
excessive 
discretion 
with 
respect 
to 
key 
decisions. 
Under 
its 
Multiyear 
Program, 
the 
GOE 
has 
already 
awarded 
a 
third 
mobile 
phone 
telephony license and approved 
a 
telecom 
sector strategy. 
Under 
such 
strategy, 
it 
is 
committed 
to 
(a) 
prepare  a  attract  a 
private 
investor 
to 
Telecsa, 
the 
new 
cellular 
phone  company  created 
by 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFITEL; 
(b) 
find 
a 
private 
administrator 
of 
these 
two 
companies; 
and 
(c) 
draft 
a 
new 
Telecommunications 
Law, 
to 
have 
a 
single 
sector 
authority, 
simplify 
entry 
into 
the  Sector, 
and 
eliminate 
the regulator 
discretional 
faculties.

Promoting 
Environmentally 
Sound 
Private 
Sector 
Investment 
in 
the 
Oil 
Sector. 
The 
strength 
of the 
oil 
sector 
is 
key 
for 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
in 
Ecuador. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
however, 
the 
government 
must 
address 
a 
set 
of 
distortions  constraining 
the 
sector. 
First, 
the 
sector 
has 
been 
hindered 
by 
(a) 
low 
production 
of 
the 
oil 
fields 
with 
the 
greatest 
reserves; 
(b) 
price 
and tax distortions 
on 
combustible 
fuels 
which 
in 
turn 
have 
caused 
investment 
in 
exploratory 
activity 
to 
flatten or 
decline; 
(c) 
judicial 
and 
fiscal 
instability 
under 
the  sector’s 
outdated 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
and 
(d) 
inadequate 
planning 
and 
management 
by 
PetroEcuador. 
Under 
PetroEcuador’ 
s 
monopoly, 
nondiscriminatory 
treatment-that 
would 
normally facilitate 
foreign 
companies’ 
access 
to 
markets-has 
discouraged 
foreign 
investment 
flows 
and 
refinery 
modernization, 
has 
depreciated 
product quality, 
and 
has 
elevated 
commercialization 
and 
marketing 
costs. 
New 
private 
investment 
and 
transport capabilities 
could 
easily 
enhance  PetroEcuador’s 
production,  especially 
in 
the 
fields 
operated 
by 
them 
where 
important 
oil 
reserves 
have 
been 
found. 
Since 
the  current 
Law 
of 
Hydrocarbons 
already  contains 
provisions  that 
would 
allow  private 
enterprises 
to 
participate 
with 
PetroEcuador, 
complementary 
legislation 
is 
recommended 
so 
as 
to 
end 
PetroEcuador’s 
monopoly, 
to 
promote 
greater 
competition, 
and 
to 
provide 
incentives 
to 
invest 
in 
refineries 
and new 
distribution 
and 
marketing installations. 
Second, 
weak 
environmental 
management 
within 
the 
oil 
sector 
continues 
to 
constrain 
sustainable  development 
activities: 
New 
oil 
exploration 
and 
production 
must 
incorporate 
state-of-the-art 
technologies developed 
by 
private 
companies, 
consultations 
with 
local 
communities, 
and 
the 
best 
available  environmental 
practices 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
serious 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts. 
44. 
Developing 
the 
Oil 
Sector. 
Support 
under 
this 
operation 
complements 
a 
set 
of 
ongoing 
Bank 
efforts 
in 
supporting 
sound 
development 
of 
the 
oil 
sector. 
The 
Bank 
is 
already 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
through 
an 
Energy 
Sector 
Monitoring 
and 
Assistance 
Program 
(ESMAP) 
Grant 
training 
of 
indigenous populations 
to 
negotiate 
on 
an 
informed 
basis 
with 
prospective 
oil 
investors.  Also, 
jointly 
with 
the 
CAF 
and 
IDB, 
the 
Bank 
is 
preparing 
an 
economic 
and 
financial 
analysis 
of 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Petroindustrial 
oil 
refinery. 
An 
Institutional 
Development  Grant 
approved 
last 
year 
supports 
a 
tripartite 
(government-community-oil 
industry) 
process 
of 
dialogue 
for 
development 
of 
regulations 
governing  consultation 
processes 
on  hydrocarbon  investments 
in 
indigenous  and  environmentally 
sensitive 
areas. 
In 
addition 
to 
these, 
through 
its 
Multiyear 
Program 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
reducing 
oil 
subsidies, 
making 
them 
more 
transparent, 
and 
enforcing 
environmentally 
friendly 
regulations 
to 
promote 
private 
sector 
participation. 
As 
a 
fust 
step, 
budget 
transfers 
to 
PetroEcuador 
have been 
reduced 
in 
2003 
and 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
further 
reduce 
them 
in 
2004, 
but 
with 
assurances 
that 
these 
cuts 
will 
not 
result 
in 
any 
decline 
in 
PetroEcuador’s 
funding 
to 
address 
environmental 
issues. 
Increased 
transparency about 
PetroEcuador 
management 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
publicly 
available 
external 
audits 
committed 
by 
the 
Government under 
this 
operation. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Government 
has 
already adjusted 
fuel 
prices 
as 
a 
first 
step 
toward 
a 
sustainable 
financial 
development 
of 
the 
sector. 
This 
action 
is 
providing 
greater 
fiscal 
income, 
eliminating 
contraband, 
and 
minimizing 
the government’s 
need 
to 
perform 
the 
onerous 
task 
of 
managing 
the 
price 
of 
combustible 
fuels. 
45. 
Enforcing Environmental 
Regulations 
in 
the 
Oil 
Sector. 
The previous 
measures 
would 
be 
complemented 
by 
a proper 
enforcement 
of 
recent environment regulations. 
The 
Law 
on 
Environmental 
Management 
was 
approved 
in 
July 
1999 
regulating 
the 
execution 
of 
industrial 
projects. 
Moreover, 
the 
Environmental 
Regulations 
on 
Hydrocarbon 
Operations were approved 
in 
February 2001 
to 
regulate 
the 
development 
of 
petroleum industry 
activities 
involving 
environmental 
and 
social 
management. 
Its 
main 
modification 
was 
the 
raising 
of 
environmental 
standards 
to 
international levels, 
with 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
injection 
of 
formation 
waters, 
emissions 
monitoring, 
and environmental 
auditing 
procedures. 
Finally, 
the 
Regulations 
for 
the 
Consultation 
and 
Participation 
of 
the 
Indigenous Populations 
in 
Hydrocarbon 
Activities 
were 
approved last December 2002. 
These 
clarify 
the 
rights 
of 
local 
communities, 
particularly 
indigenous 
peoples, 
to 
be 
consulted 
prior 
to 
the 
bidding 
process 
for 
new 
oil 
exploration 
and 
exploitation 
contracts, 
and 
prior 
to 
the 
start 
of 
the 
oil 
contract execution.  The Consultations 
intend 
to 
(a) 
collect 
the 
affected 
populations’ 
concerns about 
environment 
damage 
prevention, 
mitigation, 
control, 
compensation, 
17 
Page  26
and 
rehabilitation, 
as 
well 
as 
positive 
impacts that 
the 
project 
might 
bring 
to 
their 
area; 
and 
(b) 
assess 
the 
social and environment implications 
of 
new 
oil 
projects 
through 
the preparation 
of 
an 
Environmental 
Impact 
Study 
and 
Environment 
Management 
Plan 
in 
a 
tripartite 
dialogue among 
government, 
industry, 
and 
communities. 
These 
regulations  cover 
all 
new 
contracts 
to 
be 
developed 
by 
PetroEcuador 
andor 
private-foreign 
or 
domestic--enterprises 
established 
in 
the 
oil 
industry 
and 
are 
to 
be 
enforced 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mines 
and the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment. 
Under 
the 
FCCGL, 
the Government 
will 
prepare 
and 
publish 
the 
environmental 
studies 
and 
management 
plans 
required 
by 
such regulations under 
a 
consultative 
and 
participatory 
framework.

Increasing 
Labor 
Market 
Flexibility. 
Employment 
indicators 
show 
there  has 
been 
some 
recovery 
from 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
end-of-century 
crises. 
Formal 
employment declined 
until 
2000, 
then 
gradually 
rose 
to 
around 
the 1998 
level. 
This 
recovery 
is 
partial, however, and 
does 
not 
reflect 
migration. 
Half 
a 
million 
Ecuadorians 
(the 
most economically active population) 
have 
immigrated 
to 
other countries 
and 
there 
is 
continual internal 
migration 
from 
the 
country 
to 
the 
cities. 
The 
Underemployment rate remains 
three 
times 
higher 
than 
in 
1998, 
which 
reflects 
that 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
workers 
work 
less 
than 
40 
hours 
a 
week 
(visible 
underemployment), 
or 
are 
paid 
less 
than their 
stipulated 
wages 
(invisible 
underemployment). 
Such 
outcomes are 
partly 
a 
result 
of 
the 
Economic 
Transformation 
Law, 
because 
it 
simplified 
wage 
policy 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
introduced 
new 
and 
more 
flexible 
forms 
of 
hiring 
through 
hourly 
and 
temporary 
contracts. 
However, 
the system 
continues 
to 
be 
rigid. 
On 
one 
hand, 
the Sectoral 
Tables, based 
on 
the 
minimum 
wage established 
by 
the 
National 
Wages 
Council 
(Consejo 
NacionaZ 
de 
Salarios, 
CONADES), 
involve 
compulsory 
automatic 
indexing 
which, 
in 
case 
the parties 
do not 
reach an 
agreement, 
grants a 
minimum 
annual 
increase 
similar 
to 
the 
inflation 
rate projected 
for 
the 
following 
year. 
These 
increases 
not 
only 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
productivity, 
but 
also 
are 
hardly 
a reasonable 
basis 
for 
additional 
increases 
negotiated 
within 
each sector 
or 
as 
part 
of 
collective 
agreements. 
This 
indexing 
mechanism 
could 
help 
control inflation, 
but 
it 
is 
a serious obstacle 
to 
competitiveness 
when 
inflation 
stabilizes 
near 
international 
levels. 
47. 
Dollarization 
requires 
special 
attention 
to 
wage 
levels 
and 
market 
flexibility. 
Under 
the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
supported 
by 
this 
operation,  a 
consultative  process--called 
Mesas 
de 
Trabajo- 
has 
already 
been 
announced 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
(ML) 
for 
2003. 
It 
will 
include 
authorities, 
entrepreneurs, and 
worker 
organizations. 
There 
are 
10 
topics 
to 
be covered 
by 
such 
Mesas: 
labor policy, 
labor productivity, labor 
law 
enforcement, 
training, 
international 
labor 
law, retirement 
and 
pensions, a 
new 
Labor 
Code, 
a 
new 
Labor 
Procedures 
Code, 
terciarization,  and 
bargaining 
methods. 
In 
2004, 
future 
wage 
increases 
would 
be 
brought 
in 
line 
with 
the 
inflation 
rate. 
This 
would 
imply 
simplifying 
the 
wage 
negotiation 
process 
by 
no 
longer 
revising 
wages 
according 
to 
predicted 
inflation 
only, 
but 
to 
productivity; 
and 
minimizing 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Tablas 
Sectorides 
as 
reference indicators, 
in 
establishing 
a 
single 
minimum 
wage. 
In 
support 
of 
these 
activities, the 
GOE 
has 
also 
requested 
further 
analysis 
on 
the 
labor 
markets 
from 
the 
Bank. 
Three 
analytical 
instruments

C. 
The 
Medium-Term 
Macroeconomic 
Outlook 
48. 
Macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
faster 
growth 
are 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
Sustained 
recovery 
over 
the 
next 
four 
years 
will 
consolidate 
economic, 
fiscal, 
and 
financial 
stability; 
attract 
foreign 
investment; 
reduce 
the country’s 
risk; 
reduce 
poverty; 
and prevent deterioration 
of 
living 
standards 
during 
a 
difficult 
adjustment 
period. 
It 
can 
only 
be 
based 
on 
a 
multidimensional 
agenda. 
The 
medium-term 
outlook 
is 
based 
on 
the 
assumption 
that the 
economic 
program 
will 
be 
successful, 
and 
on 
sustained 
dollarization 
(that 
is, 
no 
major 
exogenous shocks 
to 
the 
present regime). 
Under 
the 
base 
case 
scenario 
the government 
would 
(a) 
slow 
expansionary  spending 
and 
increase 
non-oil 
tax 
revenues, 
to 
obtain 
sizable 
primary 
surpluses, 
repay 
its 
debt, 
and 
lower 
inflation; 
(b) 
induce 
a 
reduction 
in 
interest 
rates 
to 
slowly improve 
external 
competitiveness 
to 
foster private-foreign 
and 
domestic-investment 
and 
exports 
as 
the 
main 
sources 
of 
growth; 
(c) 
finish 
the 
new 
oil 
pipeline 
by 
end-2003, 
to 
increase 
oil 
exports 
starting 
in 
2004; 
(d) 
have 
a 
marginal 
growth 
of 
oil 
production 
in 
2003-barely 
2 
million 
barrels 
(lower 
than 
the 
official 
forecast 
of 
10 
million 
barrelsbas 
a 
result 
of 
the 
low 
investment 
by 
PetroProducci6n; 
(e) 
gradually 
restructure the 
banking 
system; 
(f) 
clear 
all 
its 
arrears 
in 
2003 
and 
avoid 
default 
over the 
next 
three 
years; 
and 
(g) 
provide 
full 
financing 
of 
the 
social 
expenditure 
identified 
by 
the 
PREN 
to 
bring 
adequate 
protection 
to 
the 
poorest, 
while 
minimizing 
the 
potentially 
negative 
short-term 
impact 
of adjustment 
measures, 
thus 
achieving 
minimum 
social and 
political 
consensus 
over the 
difficult 
measures 
to 
be 
adopted. 
49. 
The 
base 
case 
scenario 
assumes 
moderate 
growth 
with 
low inflation 
(Table 
3). 
In 
2003-05, 
key 
assumptions  are 
(a) 
growth 
averaging 
4 
percent, 
with 
single-digit 
inflation 
rates, 
converging 
to 
international 
levels; 
(b) 
a 
slow 
recovery 
of 
the 
U.S. 
economy 
beginning 
in 
the 
second 
semester 
of 
2003; 
and 
(c) 
a 
short-lived 
oil 
boom 
in 
2003, 
disappearing 
fully 
in 
2005 
with 
falling 
prices 
partly 
offset 
by 
new 
oil 
exports (Table 
3). 
As 
a 
result, 
on 
the 
internal 
balances, 
the 
NFPS 
primary 
surplus 
should 
average 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(for 
an 
NFPS 
overall 
balance 
surplus 
of 
1 
to 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
arising 
from 
the 
approval 
of  several 
tax 
measures 
in 
2003, 
temporarily 
increased 
oil 
revenues, 
and 
declining public 
spending- 
especially 
capital 
investment-in 
real 
terms. 
Compliance 
with all 
fiscal 
rules 
contained 
in 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency, 
Stabilization 
and 
Responsibility 
Law 
(Ley 
de 
Transparencia, 
Estubilizacidn 
y 
Responsabilidud 
Fiscal, 
FTSRL) 
is 
also 
assumed. 
On 
the 
external 
balances, 
the 
current 
account 
should 
fall 
to 
about 
2 
to 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
as 
temporary 
booming imports 
related 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
OCP 
disappear 
in 
2004, 
and 
the 
growth 
of 
family 
remittances,  despite  some 
loss 
of 
dynamism, 
remains 
positive. 
The  period 
ends 
with 
a gradual 
decline 
of 
the 
public 
debt-to-GDP 
ratio to 
the 
minimum 
sustainable 
ratio 
of 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2005, 
the 
benchmark 
set 
up 
in 
the 
fiscal 
rule, 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
active repayment 
of 
expensive domestic 
debt 
with 
the 
primary 
surpluses. 
Such 
ratio 
should 
continue 
declining over 
subsequent years. 
50. 
There are high 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
base 
case 
economic 
projections. 
Ecuador remains 
vulnerable 
to 
internal 
and  external 
shocks 
that, 
should 
they  materialize, 
could 
derail 
the 
economic 
program. 
First, 
the 
economy 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
terms-of-trade 
shocks, 
especially 
on 
oil, 
bananas, 
and 
shrimp. 
Second, 
remittance 
flows 
might 
fall 
faster 
if 
migration policies 
in 
labor-recipient 
countries 
like 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Spain 
get 
tougher. 
Third, 
global 
economic 
recovery 
could 
take 
longer  than 
projected. 
Fourth, and 
turning 
to 
domestic 
shocks, 
the 
projected 
increase 
in 
oil 
production 
and exports 
may 
not 
materialize 
if 
PetroEcuador 
performs 
poorly. 
Fifth, 
the 
schedule 
of 
fiscal 
and 
structural 
measures 
implied 
by 
the 
base 
case 
could 
take 
longer 
than 
planned. 
This 
would 
put 
the 
SBA 
at 
risk 
and 
would 
require 
renegotiating the 
program, 
with 
obvious 
implications 
for 
the 
loans. 
Sixth, 
if 
the 
projected 
external 
multilateral financing 
does 
not 
materialize, 
the 
Government 
would 
turn 
to 
domestic 
debt, 
thus 
raising 
interest 
rates 
and 
crowding 
out 
private 
investment. 
Seventh, 
until 
there 
is 
a 
final 
decision 
on 
the 
19 
Page  28
amount 
and 
modality 
of 
payment 
of 
the 
government’s  debt 
with 
the 
Social 
Security Institute, 
it 
remains a 
potential 
source 
of 
fiscal 
pressure. 
(Other 
risks 
of 
the 
loan 
are 
described 
in 
Section 
IV.)

IV. 
THE 
PROPOSED 
LOAN 
A. 
Rationale 
for Bank 
Involvement 
5 
1. 
The 
Bank 
has long 
supported Ecuador’s 
structural 
reforms. 
Political 
constraints 
and 
adverse 
circumstances 
have prevented 
several 
administrations 
from 
making 
Ecuador a good performer. 
The 
dollarization 
of 
the 
economy 
has 
left 
officials 
with 
fewer 
options. 
Not 
only 
is 
fiscal 
policy 
the single 
policy 
instrument available 
to 
deal 
with 
exogenous 
shocks, 
but 
structural reforms 
are 
the 
only 
tools 
to 
obtain and 
preserve gains 
in 
productivity, 
and 
bring flexibility to 
the 
factors 
of 
production, especially 
labor, 
under 
an 
eventual slowdown 
of 
the 
economy. 
52. 
Progress 
Under 
the  Previous 
Structural 
Adjustment  Loan. 
Ecuador 
signed 
a Structural 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(SAL) 
for 
US$151.2 
million 
in 
August 
2000. 
During 
2000-01, 
it 
made 
progress 
in 
supporting 
efforts 
to 
stabilize 
the 
economy, create 
an 
oil 
stabilization 
fund, 
modernize 
public 
financial 
management, 
protect 
priority 
social 
spending, 
and 
develop a targeting mechanism 
to 
improve 
the 
efficacy 
of 
social 
expenditure. 
The 
SAL 
had  a 
mixed 
performance 
in 
financial 
sector 
reforms, 
including 
improvement 
of 
the  regulatory  framework 
for 
intervention,  restructuring  and 
resolution 
of 
banks, 
restoring 
of 
intervened 
banks 
to 
private 
ownership, 
full 
restructuring 
of 
private 
sector debts 
owed 
to 
banks, 
and 
phasing 
out 
of 
offshore banking activities booked 
in 
Ecuador. 
However, 
little 
or 
no 
progress 
was 
achieved 
in 
three 
critical 
areas: 
tax  reform,  expenditure control, 
and 
private 
participation 
in 
telecommunications and electricity. 
In 
the 
first 
semester 
of 
2002, 
the 
agenda 
of 
structural 
reform 
was 
suspended 
and 
severe 
policy 
slippages 
occurred. 
The approval 
of 
large 
increases 
in 
the 
wage 
bill 
and 
social security benefits, 
the 
granting 
of 
new 
revenue 
earmarking and discretionary tax 
cuts, 
and 
the 
freezing 
of 
electricity 
and 
telecom 
tariffs 
in 
April, 
prevented the 
signing 
of 
a new Stand-By 
Agreement 
with 
the 
IMF 
and 
led 
to 
the 
cancellation 
of 
two 
floating 
tranches 
of 
the 
SAL 
geared 
to 
tax 
reform 
and 
public 
enterprise 
reform. 
Only 
upon 
arrival 
of 
the 
new Government 
did 
the 
country comply 
with 
the 
remaining conditions 
for 
disbursement, 
and 
the 
final 
tranche 
of 
the 
SAL 
was 
disbursed 
in 
early 
2003. 
B. 
Objectives 
and 
Sequencing 
53. 
The 
proposed single 
tranche 
loan, 
under 
a 
multiyear framework, 
will 
support the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
described 
previously 
(Table 
4) 
and 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development Policy 
(Annex 
3). 
The 
main 
objectives 
are 
to bring 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
reinitiate 
structural 
reforms 
to 
provide 
a 
sustained 
recovery 
with 
enhanced 
competitiveness, and 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
adjustment 
on 
priority 
social investment 
that 
protects vulnerable 
groups. 
This 
fiscal 
support 
would 
help 
solve 
the 
severe 
short- 
term 
liquidity 
problem, and 
create 
fiscal 
room for 
smoothing 
the 
social 
costs 
of 
adjustment 
both 
in 
this 
operation and 
in 
a 
parallel Human 
Development 
Sector 
Loan. 
The 
loan 
is 
based 
on 
structural 
reform 
measures 
that have 
been 
implemented 
by 
the 
Government 
prior to 
Board 
presentation.

Program, and 
as

the 
Bank 
also 
envisions 
two 
eventual Programmatic 
operations, 
to 
be 
prepared 
separately over 
the  next two 
years. 
The 
Government’s 
Program 
is 
built 
around 
FCCGL 
main 
goals: 
First, 
achieving 
fiscal 
consolidation through 
(a) 
a sound 
budget 
framework; 
(b) 
enhancing 
revenue management; 
(c) 
improving 
expenditure 
management 
with 
austerity,  transparency, 
and 
accountability, 
and 
tight 
control 
of 
the 
wage 
bill; 
and 
(d) 
prudent debt 
management; 
and 
second, 
promoting 
faster 
growth 
with 
competitiveness 
based 
on 
(a) 
competition 
and 
trade 
reform 
policies; 
(b) 
solid 
pricing 
and regulatory 
policies 
to 
attract investment 
in 
key 
basic infrastructure 
sectors; 
and 
(c) 
increasing 
labor 
market 
flexibility. 
While 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Program-supported 
by 
this 
operation-will 
focus 
on 
short-term 
adjustment 
aspects 
required 
to 
put 
the 
economy 
on 
a 
fiscal 
sustainability and 
debt solvency 
path, 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
will 
consolidate 
and deepen 
the structural 
reforms-labor, 
trade, 
pricing, 
and 
regulatory policies 
needed 
to 
attract 
private 
sector 
participation-in 
the 
medium 
term. 
This 
operation 
has 
also 
provided 
technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
design 
of 
sector 
policies 
and 
strategies,

that 
will 
lay 
the 
ground 
for 
reforms, 
and the 
implementation 
of 
consensus-building 
activities 
with

society; 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
policy 
tools 
that 
will

achievement 
of 
a transparent and

management. 
C. 
The 
Proposed 
Loan 
Components 
55. 
The 
proposed 
FCCGL 
covers 
the 
two 
areas 
discussed 
above: fiscal consolidation, 
and 
faster 
growth 
with 
competitiveness. 
Under 
the 
first 
area, 
the 
following 
components are considered: 
overall 
fiscal 
framework, 
revenue  management, 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
public 
payroll 
control, 
and 
public 
debt. 
Under 
the 
second 
area, 
the 
following 
components 
are 
included: 
competition  and 
trade 
policies, 
pricing 
and 
regulatory 
policies 
of 
basic 
infrastructure 
services 
for 
growth, 
and 
labor market 
flexibility. 
Although 
the 
Program 
has 
specific 
measures 
assigned 
to 
all 
areas, 
as 
indicated 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development  Policy, 
there 
is 
a 
reduced 
set 
of 
key 
prior 
actions 
adopted 
for 
this 
operation,  and 
benchmarks 
among 
an 
anticipated 
set 
of 
actions 
under 
the  second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the 
Multiyear 
Government’s Program. 
Those actions are 
interrelated 
and 
represent 
the 
blueprint 
of 
core 
policy 
actions 
of 
the 
overall 
Multiyear 
Government’s  Program. 
The 
list 
of 
future 
policy 
actions 
may 
be 
modified 
as 
the 
Government 
gains experience 
through further studying and 
implementing 
its 
reform 
agenda. 
56. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the Government’s 
Program, 
supported 
by 
this 
operation, 
emphasizes 
the 
first 
two 
objectives 
because 
they 
are 
most 
urgent: 
stability 
and 
fiscal 
consolidation. 
It 
defines 
an 
overall 
macroeconomic 
framework 
and 
a  comprehensive 
program 
that 
are  consistent 
with 
budget 
constraints. 
Specific policies 
on 
the 
revenue  side 
focus 
on 
tax 
administration: 
the 
modernization 
of 
Customs 
administration 
with 
IRS 
support. 
These 
measures 
would 
raise 
tax collection 
and 
facilitate 
crosschecking 
of 
taxpayer 
files 
with 
the 
IRS. 
Then, 
on 
expenditure 
management, 
it 
begins 
with 
the 
liquidity 
fiscal 
problem 
by 
issuing 
an 
emergency 
austerity 
Executive 
Decree 
and 
obtaining 
from 
Congress 
a 2003 
budget that 
is 
consistent 
with 
its 
norms. 
As 
prior 
action, 
officials 
have 
implemented 
the 
Decree, 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Fiscal 
Law, 
which 
proved particularly 
helpful 
during 
Congress’s attempts 
to 
increase 
the 2003 budget. 
Because the 
austerity Decree 
is 
insufficient 
to 
halt 
the 
main 
cause 
of 
expansionary 
spending, 
the 
wage 
bill, 
officials 
have also 
submitted 
to 
Congress a 
Public Wage 
Unification 
Law. 
On 
public 
debt, 
the 
clearance 
of 
external and domestic 
arrears 
accumulated 
up 
to 
February 
and 
March 
2003, 
will 
contribute 
to 
successful 
Paris 
Club 
negotiations 
next 
June. 
To 
complete 
fiscal 
measures, 
officials 
have 
prepared 
a Transparency Plan. 
The 
Transparency 
Plan 
should 
produce, 
in 
2003, 
timely 
and 
reliable 
reporting 
of 
executed expenditure, 
and 
from 
2004 
onward, 
the 
modernization and consolidation 
of 
NFPS 
accounts. 
This 
operation 
also supports 
implementation 
of 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
trade reform, 
and 
electricity 
and 
telecommunications. 
With 
respect 
to 
trade 
reform, 
the Government 
intends 
to 
reverse 
distortionary 
decisions that 
raised 
tariff 
dispersion 
and 
effective protection 
by 
end-2002. 
It 
has 
unified 
all 
import 
licenses,  and 
is 
committed 
to 
eliminating 
those that 
have been unused 
for 
several 
decades, 
a 
critical 
measure 
for 
complying 
with 
WTO 
standards. 
With 
respect 
to 
electricity 
and 
telecommunications, 
the 
Government 
has 
adjusted 
power 
rates, 
awarded 
a 
third 
mobile 
phone license 
and 
prepared 
a strategy 
to 
increase the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
public 
telephone  companies, 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL,  while 
finding 
a 
private 
investor 
for 
Telecsa, 
the 
third 
mobile 
phone 
company 
recently 
created 
by 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL. 
The phasing-in 
of 
the 
program 
recognizes 
that 
fiscal 
adjustment  can 
bring 
early 
credibility 
and 
achieve 
public 
savings  needed 
to 
finance 
investments 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
while 
structural 
changes 
in 
the  basic 
infrastructure 
sectors 
should 
first 
adjust 
prices 
toward 
reaching 
real 
economic reforms, 
while 
preparing the 
studies needed 
to 
engage 
in 
more 
complex 
regulatory 
reforms. 
57. 
The 
second 
phase 
of 
the  Government’s 
Program, 
scheduled 
for 
March 
2004, 
would 
preserve 
progress achieved 
in 
2003 
and 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
important  medium-term 
structural 
reforms. 
On 
the  revenue 
side, 
measures 
to 
broaden  the 
tax 
base, 
improve 
tax 
administration, 
and 
modernize 
Customs 
would 
contribute 
to 
effectively 
raising 
its 
collections 
by 
no 
less 
than 
7.5 
percent 
in 
annual terms. 
On 
the 
expenditure 
side, 
austerity 
measures 
would 
be 
extended 
and 
broadened 
to 
2004, 
to 
24 
Page  33
comply 
with 
a 
critical 
benchmark 
in 
the 
Fiscal 
rule:  compliance 
with 
the 
3.5 
percent 
ceiling 
in 
real 
primary 
spending 
growth 
in 
2003 and 2004. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
Government 
would 
reach 
a 
major 
milestone 
in 
human resource 
management 
reform, 
by 
completing 
the 
staffing reviews 
of 
ministries 
accounting 
for 
most 
of 
the 
national 
government’s 
labor 
force. 
In 
the 
transparency 
and debt-reduction 
areas, 
officials 
are 
also 
committed 
to 
implementing 
two 
respective plans satisfactorily, 
and 
in 
particular 
to 
strengthening 
their 
fiscal 
rules 
by 
devoting 
no 
less 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
resources 
transferred 
to 
FEIREP 
to 
debt 
reduction. 
On 
the 
growth 
and 
competitiveness 
front, 
a 
new Competition 
Law 
should be 
submitted 
to 
Congress 
by 
end-2003, 
and 
trade 
reform 
would 
continue, deepening 
the number 
of 
import 
licenses 
eliminated. 
Power 
tariff 
adjustments 
would 
proceed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the schedule 
set 
by 
CONELEC’s 
Decree 
up 
to 
85 
percent 
of 
economic 
costs. 
In 
addition, 
a 
private 
investor 
is 
expected 
to 
have invested 
in 
Telecsa 
by 
March 
2004. 
Finally, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
preparing 
a 
full 
assessment 
of 
labor market 
conditions under 
a 
consultative 
process 
in 
the 
second operation. 
Additional 
anticipated 
actions 
in 
the 
second 
operation 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Government’s 
program 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
fiscal 
framework; 
tax 
policy 
and 
administration; 
overall 
expenditure control; 
public 
wage 
bill 
control; 
public 
debt; 
competition 
and 
trade 
policies; 
pricing 
and 
regulatory 
policies 
in 
basic 
infrastructure-water, 
power, 
telecommunications, and 
oil; 
and 
labor 
markets 
reform. 
58. 
The 
third 
phase 
of 
the Government’s 
Program 
would 
emphasize 
achieving 
outputs. 
By 
March 
2005,  customs revenue 
would 
reach 
another 
7.5 
percent annual 
increase. 
Fiscal 
rules 
would 
be 
strengthened 
by 
devoting, 
again, 
no 
less 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
resources 
transferred 
to 
FEIREP 
to 
debt 
reduction. 
MEF 
would 
have  executed 
the 
budget 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
ceilings 
of 
the  extended 
austerity 
Decree and 
would 
have 
retaken 
control 
of 
the 
real growth 
of 
the wage 
bill 
in 
2004, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
inflation 
rate and 
public 
employment 
rationalization. 
On 
the 
structural 
front, 
further 
import 
licenses 
would be 
eliminated, 
and power 
tariffs 
for 
consumers 
under 
300Kw would 
reach 
90 
percent 
of 
their 
average 
economic 
cost, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
some 
low-income 
consumers, 
still 
benefiting 
temporarily 
from 
a reasonable 
social 
tariff. 
A 
private 
administrator 
would 
have been 
found 
to 
manage 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL 
by 
March 
2005. 
Following 
consultations, 
the 
Labor 
Ministry 
would 
have 
de-linked 
automatic  salary  adjustments 
from 
the 
inflation 
rate. 
All 
actions 
would 
have 
a 
renewed 
emphasis 
on 
accountability, 
transparency, 
and 
promotion 
of 
civil 
society 
participation. 
D. 
Links 
to Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
and 
Other 
Bank 
Operations 
59. 
The 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
for 
Ecuador 
has 
identified 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Government’s 
agenda: 
(a) 
consolidating 
the  macroeconomic 
framework 
to 
lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
diversified 
and 
sustainable 
growth 
and poverty 
reduction, 
(b) 
making 
needed 
structural 
reforms 
socially 
sustainable 
and 
mitigate their 
impacts 
on 
the 
poor 
and 
the 
vulnerable, 
and 
(c) 
strengthening 
governance 
and 
helping 
officials 
build 
an  accountable 
and 
efficient 
government  the 
services 
of 
which 
are 
accessible 
to 
all 
Ecuadorians. 
The 
present 
operation 
fits 
in 
the 
first 
pillar, 
the 
parallel 
Bank 
Programmatic operation 
on 
Human 
Development 
Sector 
Reform 
fits 
in 
the second 
pillar, 
and 
both 
operations 
propose 
measures 
to 
address 
institutional 
constraints 
(third 
pillar). 
These operations are scheduled 
jointly 
with 
the 
CAS 
for 
Board 
presentation 
on 
27 
May 
2003. 
60. 
The 
Programmatic 
loan 
on 
Human 
Development 
Sector 
Reform 
has 
complementary 
objectives 
to 
this 
operation. 
It 
aims 
to 
protect 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
during 
adjustment, 
and 
to 
support 
the 
design and 
implementation 
of 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
basic 
social 
programs, 
and promote 
consultation, 
transparency, 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
and 
priority 
programs. 
More 
specifically, 
it 
assures 
minimum 
levels 
of 
budgeted 
public 
spending 
in 
priority 
social 
sectors--education, 
health, 
and 
social 
welfare-and 
programs;  extends 
coverage 
and 
improves targeting 
of 
social 
services; 
and 
improves 
transparency 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
resources, 
and 
facilitates 
access 
to 
information 
by 
managers and 
usersheneficiaries.

Coordination 
with 
other 
Bank 
activities 
in 
Ecuador, 
currently  under  preparation 
and 
implementation, 
will 
be 
assured. 
Policy-based 
credits 
would 
be 
complemented 
by 
other 
instruments, 
such 
as 
technical 
assistance 
and investment credits 
directed 
toward solving 
some 
of 
the 
institutional 
problems 
or 
investment 
needs 
of 
the 
areas 
affected 
by 
this 
loan. 
Two 
Bank 
operations 
are 
related 
to 
this 
operation. 
The 
Public 
Sector 
Financial 
Management 
Technical 
Assistance 
project 
would 
provide 
assistance 
in 
introducing 
improved 
budget 
monitoring 
and 
consolidation through 
the 
SIGEF-Institutional 
system 
in 
several 
key 
autonomous 
agencies, 
and 
integrating 
these 
more 
fully 
into 
the 
SIGEF-Global 
network.  The 
Bank 
Project 
PROMEC 
in 
the 
electricity 
sector 
is 
providing 
assistance 
to 
the 
institutional 
modernization 
of 
the 
sector, 
and 
is 
implemented 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Inter-American 
Development 
Bank 
(IDB). 
On 
analytical 
and advisory activities,  the 
Bank 
has 
just 
completed 
a 
set 
of 
Policy 
Notes, 
covering 
18 
topics 
and 
underlying 
the design 
of 
the 
CAS 
and 
the 
two 
operations. 
A 
Public 
Expenditure Review, 
a 
Poverty 
Assessment, 
and a 
Labor 
Market Reform 
are 
also under preparation 
for 
fiscal 
2004; 
which 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
advancing the 
reform 
agenda 
to 
further 
stages 
based 
on 
their 
analytical 
underpinnings. 
62. 
This 
operation 
was 
prepared 
in 
parallel 
to 
and 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
IMF, 
which 
required 
an 
extraordinary  amount 
of 
bilateral 
technical dialogue 
and 
coordinated 
views 
with 
officials, 
who 
welcome 
such 
efforts. 
Topics 
of 
common 
preparation 
have 
been 
Fiscal 
law, 
Custom 
reform,  the austerity 
Decree, and a 
public 
sector 
wage 
unification 
law. 
Topics 
for 
further 
collaboration 
in 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the Government’s 
Program 
also 
involve 
tax 
and 
trade 
reform. 
Whereas 
the 
SBA 
mainly 
focuses 
on 
short-term 
measures 
to 
be 
adopted 
in 
the 
next 
13 
months, 
the 
GOE’s 
Multiyear 
Program 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank 
also 
endorses 
and 
brings 
continuity 
to 
key 
adjustment 
efforts 
over 
a 
longer 
term, 
while 
deepening 
reforms 
such 
as 
budget 
transparency,  debt 
management, 
and 
trade 
and 
oil 
sector 
reform, 
and 
providing 
assistance 
to 
areas 
where the 
Bank 
has 
technical 
and 
financing 
expertise,  such 
as 
Customs 
and 
budget 
modernization, 
civil 
service 
and 
labor 
market 
reforms, 
and private 
participation 
in 
basic 
infrastructure 
sectors. 
Finally, 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
IMF 
in 
the 
area 
of 
pension 
reform 
is 
expected 
with 
the  Bank’s 
Programmatic 
loan 
on 
Human 
Development, and continuous 
joint 
efforts 
in 
financial 
sector 
reform 
(see 
para. 
19). 
Collaboration 
with 
the 
IMF. 
63. 
Coordination 
with 
other 
multilateral 
institutions. 
Two 
other 
multilateral 
institutions-the 
IDB 
and the 
Corporucidn 
Andina 
de 
Foment0 
(CAFbhave 
also 
announced 
their 
intentions 
to 
contribute 
to 
financing 
a support package 
of 
about 
US$500 
million 
in 
2003 
to 
fill 
the 
fiscal financing 
gap. 
The 
IDB 
is 
preparing 
an 
operation 
in 
the social 
sectors, 
the 
matrix 
of 
policy 
actions 
of 
which 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
parallel 
to 
one 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
operations 
on 
human 
development. 
The 
IDB’s 
operation 
is 
mostly 
focused 
on 
strengthening 
the social 
safety net, 
protecting 
public 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
and 
promoting 
some 
structural 
changes 
in 
education and 
in 
labor 
markets. 
The 
Bank‘s 
and 
the 
IDB’s 
teams 
have been 
working 
closely 
to 
assure 
the 
maximum 
coordination between 
the 
two 
operations, 
including 
joint 
missions 
and 
meetings 
with 
Government 
officials 
to 
discuss 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
operations. 
The 
CAF 
has 
also 
offered 
fast-disbursing 
resources 
for 
fiscal 
adjustment 
and 
economic recovery. 
E. 
Arrangements 
for 
Management, 
Implementation, 
and 
Supervision 
64. 
The 
Government 
of 
Ecuador would be 
the 
Borrower 
of 
the 
proposed 
Adjustment 
Loan 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Finance 
(MEF) 
will 
be the 
principal 
executing 
agency 
and 
would 
have 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
coordinating 
and 
overseeing 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
Program. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
External 
Trade, 
Industrialization, 
Competitiveness  and 
Fishing 
(MICIP), 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Urban 
Development 
and 
Housing 
(MIDUVI), 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
(ML), 
the 
Development 
State 
Bank 
(BEDE), 
the 
Foreign 
Trade 
and  Investment 
Council 
(COMEXI), 
the  Power  Regulatory 
Council 
(CONELEC), 
the 
Telecom 
National  Council 
(CONATEL), 
the 
National  Council 
for 
Modernization 
(CONAM), 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mines 
(MEM), 
and 
the 
Internal 
Revenue Service 
(IRS) 
would 
26 
Page  35
also have 
key 
roles 
in 
executing 
the 
program, 
and 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
MEF 
in 
executing 
Program components 
under 
their 
respective 
jurisdiction. 
The 
MEF 
would 
be 
responsible 
for providing 
periodic 
reports 
to 
the 
participant’s 
public 
agencies 
on 
overall 
Program 
progress, and 
for 
informing 
the 
Government  and 
the 
Bank. 
The 
GOE 
and 
the 
Bank 
would 
consult 
on 
progress 
quarterly 
during 
implementation. 
The 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
loan would 
be 
December 31,2003. 
65. 
Ecuador 
has 
a 
poor 
record 
in 
implementing adjustment 
operations 
with 
Bank 
and 
IMF 
programs. 
However, 
the 
single 
tranche 
approach 
to 
adjustment 
lending 
bases 
Bank 
support 
on 
actions 
the 
Government 
has 
already 
taken, 
rather 
than 
on  conditions 
of 
future 
actions. 
This 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
for 
a new Government 
to 
build 
a track record 
by 
demonstrating 
its 
commitment 
to 
reforms, 
and 
for 
the 
Bank to 
provide financial 
support 
aligned 
to 
the 
strength 
and 
pace 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform. 
This 
single-tranche 
approach 
incorporates 
lessons 
learned 
from 
previous 
adjustment operation, 
and 
from 
the 
Operation 
Evaluation 
Department’ 
s 
1999 
Country 
Assistance 
Evaluation. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
would 
be 
monitored 
through 
frequent  missions (every 
two 
months)  and 
continuous supervision through 
videoconference 
technology 
facilities 
of 
the 
information 
system 
of 
the 
country 
office. 
Although 
supervision 
will 
mainly 
focus 
on 
fulfillment 
of 
policy 
results 
and 
benchmarks, 
the 
presence 
of 
policy 
reversals 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
other 
anticipated 
actions 
will 
also 
be 
assessed. 
Moreover, reviews 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
technical 
assistance 
and 
advisory 
services 
to 
be 
carried out 
during 
supervision 
missions, 
previously 
requested 
by 
officials.

Consultations 
with 
Stakeholders 
66. 
Consultations 
with 
civil 
society 
have taken 
place 
in 
stages. 
The preparation 
of 
the 
operation 
has 
opened 
extraordinary opportunities 
for 
an 
ongoing dialogue 
with 
civil 
society organizations 
(CSOs) 
on 
how 
best 
to 
involve 
the 
Bank‘s 
support 
in 
fiscal 
growth 
and 
poverty-reduction 
programs. 
Previous 
consultations 
took 
place 
at 
several 
stages. 
They 
accompanied 
implementation 
of 
the 
previous 
SAL 
during 
2002. 
Then, 
in 
January 
2003, 
a 
one-day 
workshop 
with 
the 
incoming officials, 
advisors, 
academia, 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
selected 
civil 
society representatives 
on 
the presentation 
of 
the 
Policy 
Notes 
provided 
a 
unique opportunity 
to 
exchange 
views openly 
and 
candidly 
on 
the 
country’s 
development 
agenda. 
A 
week 
after 
the 
Government 
took 
office, 
the 
Bank’s 
representative 
in 
Ecuador participated 
in 
the 
National 
Dialogue 
that 
has 
examined 
some 
of 
the 
topics 
considered 
by 
this 
operation. 
In 
February, 
CAS 
consultations 
took 
place 
with 
civil 
society 
in 
several 
parts 
of 
the 
country, 
providing 
valuable 
insights 
about 
the 
perception 
of 
civil 
society 
about 
the 
Bank‘s 
work 
and 
role 
in 
Ecuador. 
67. 
Outcomes 
of 
dialogue 
with 
civil 
society. 
Before 
setting 
definite 
loan policy 
priorities, 
on 
25 
March 
2003 
a 
one-day 
workshop, 
was 
held 
with 
NGOs, 
and indigenous 
and other 
CSOs 
in 
Quito. 
It 
examined 
the 
two 
parallel 
operations and 
solicited 
reactions 
and 
suggestions 
on 
the 
contents, sequencing, 
and 
risks 
of 
these 
operations. Results 
from 
the 
consultations revealed 
substantial 
common ground among 
participants, 
as 
well 
as 
some 
differences, and 
contributed 
to 
reshaping 
the 
loans 
in 
several 
ways, 
including 
(a) 
the 
importance 
of 
combining 
macroeconomic 
stability 
with 
fiscal 
responsibility, 
and 
of 
adopting 
measures 
to 
sustain economic 
recovery 
as 
the 
main 
vehicle 
for 
creating 
employment; 
(b) 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
Bank‘s 
approach 
to 
complement 
this 
operation 
with 
another addressing 
the 
social 
sector 
needs, 
but 
especially 
its 
structural 
programs; 
(c) 
the 
perception that decentralization 
is 
not 
among 
the 
first 
priorities 
of 
the 
new Administration,  and 
confmation 
that 
the 
GOE’s 
focus 
is 
on 
immediate 
fiscal 
emergency 
needs; 
(d) 
the need 
to 
adopt 
measures 
strengthening 
budget 
transparency, 
because 
this 
is 
the 
only 
tool 
that 
allows 
CSOs 
to 
actively participate 
in 
formulating 
the 
budget 
and 
to 
audit 
its 
implementation; 
(e) 
the 
disagreement 
of 
some 
CSOs 
with 
the 
GOE’s  decision 
to 
devote 
a large 
amount 
of 
oil 
resources 
to 
repaying 
debt, 
instead 
of 
financing 
social 
programs; 
(f) 
the 
need 
for 
ex ante 
dialogue 
with 
CSOs 
on 
specific 
incoming 
reforms, such 
as 
civil 
service 
and 
tax 
reform; 
and 
(g) 
the 
suggestion 
that dialogue 
with 
CSOs 
be 
institutionalized, and that 
the 
Bank 
and other 
donors 
take 
some 
leadership 
in 
encouraging the 
27 
Page  36
Government 
to 
organize 
consensus-building 
processes. 
Such 
consultations 
should 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
initial 
step 
in 
a 
continuous 
process 
of 
dialogue 
leading 
to 
continuing 
reforms 
in 
the 
upcoming 
months.

The 
program 
has 
been 
supported 
by 
sector 
Policy 
Notes 
that have 
illustrated 
the 
major 
issues 
affecting 
beneficiaries  and 
stakeholders. 
Therefore, 
with 
this 
background 
and 
consultative 
process that 
is 
envisioned, 
a 
specific 
social 
assessment 
is 
not 
being 
considered. 
Further 
consultations 
and 
preparation 
of 
the 
details 
of 
measures 
to 
be 
undertaken 
in 
Phases 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Program 
might 
constitute 
social 
assessments 
for 
these phases. 
In 
addition, under the 
First 
Programmatic 
Human 
Development 
Sector 
Reform 
Loan 
program, social objectives 
are 
being 
addressed 
and 
a 
follow-up 
social 
assessment 
is 
being 
scheduled 
in 
Phases 
2 
and 
3.

A 
weak 
policy 
and 
institutional 
environment 
compromises 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
lending 
and 
nonlending 
interventions. 
In 
weak 
environments adjustment 
lending 
can 
be 
a 
risky 
instrument. 
Notwithstanding 
recent 
progress, 
the 
Bank’s  Country 
Policy 
and 
Institutional 
Assessments 
Rating 
(CPIA) 
for  2002 for  Ecuador 
assigned 
a 
rating 
of 
2.5 
out 
of 
a 
possible 
6 
for 
the 
Quality 
of 
Budgetary 
and 
Financial 
Management. 
Ecuador 
was 
ranked 
26 out 
of 
the 
28 
countries 
rated 
in 
the 
Latin 
America 
and 
the Caribbean Region. 
Progress 
includes 
recent 
approval 
of 
two 
laws. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Public 
Financial 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
that 
supported 
the 
SAL 
of 
June 
2000, 
the 
Law 
of 
Fiscal 
Control 
and 
Auditing 
was 
approved 
in 
May 
2002. 
To 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
the 
Law 
of 
Fiscal 
Transparency, 
Stabilization, 
and  Responsibility 
and 
its 
enabling  regulations  received 
congressional 
approval 
by 
end-2002. 
Another 
important 
piece 
of 
legislation,  the 
Public 
Financial 
Management 
Law, 
is 
awaiting 
approval 
by 
Congress. 
This 
law 
would 
apply 
the 
principle 
of 
centralized 
standard 
setting and decentralized 
operations, 
enabling 
the various 
agencies 
to 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
their 
own 
financial 
management. 
Another 
important 
development 
has 
been the 
Integrated 
System 
of 
Financial 
Management 
(SIGEF), 
because 
successive 
Governments 
have 
viewed 
the 
modernization 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
as 
crucial 
to 
aligning 
expenditure 
more closely 
with 
policy 
priorities. 
Through 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Project 
(MOSTA), 
which 
ended 
in 
March 
2001, 
and the 
SAL 
referred 
to 
above, 
SIGEF 
was designed. 
It 
also 
included 
a 
debt 
management 
tool 
supported 
by 
SIGADE. 
National 
budgets 
are 
now 
being 
formulated 
in 
consultation 
with 
spending 
ministries. 
SIGEF 
has 
been 
implemented 
in 
over 
60 
entities 
including 
line 
ministries 
and their 
provincial 
offices, 
autonomous entities, 
sectional governments, 
and 
affiliated 
entities. 
A 
database 
consolidation 
module 
has 
been 
completed 
and 
it 
has 
been used 
to 
prepare 
consolidated 
financial 
accounts 
and

last 
two 
national 
budgets. 
Financial 
management. 
71. 
The 
risk 
of 
reversing reforms 
in 
financial 
management 
is 
high. 
On 
one 
hand,  a 
follow-up 
operation 
for 
SIGEF 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
February 
2002 
to 
consolidate 
financial 
management 
and 
control, 
expand 
its 
coverage, 
upgrade 
the 
technological 
base, 
develop the 
Contraloria General 
del Estado 
(CGE) 
audit 
capacity, 
and 
establish 
organizational 
functional 
support 
to 
ensure 
medium-term 
sustainability 
of 
the 
reform 
is 
still 
not 
effective. 
Failure 
to 
implement 
it, 
or 
implementation 
of 
a 
reduced 
scope, 
poses 
substantial 
risks 
to 
effective and 
reliable financial 
management 
and 
control 
by 
officials. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
several 
Bank-financed projects 
have experienced 
delays 
in 
implementation,  due 
to 
lack 
of 
counterpart 
funds 
or untimely 
allocations. 
Moreover, most Project 
Implementing 
Units 
possess 
financial 
management  arrangements 
that 
meet 
minimum 
Bank 
requirements 
and 
have 
received 
unqualified 
opinions 
on 
their 
annual 
financial 
statements. 
During 
fiscal 
2002, 
most 
projects 
did 
not 
comply 
with 
loan 
covenants 
regarding 
the submission 
of 
audit 
reports. 
Delays 
in 
the 
submission were 
attributed 
to 
lack 
of 
coordination 
between the 
projects 
and 
the 
CGE, 
and 
procedural 
delays 
in 
contracting 
of 
auditors and 
in 
28 
Page  37
the 
review 
of 
final 
audit 
reports 
by 
the 
CGE 
(prior 
to 
delivery 
to 
the 
Bank). 
To 
mitigate financial 
management 
risk, 
officials 
have 
agreed 
to 
prepare 
a 
Transparency 
Plan 
in 
this 
operation,  based 
on 
a 
revamped 
SIGEF,3 
which 
will 
adopt 
new 
measures 
and 
a 
chronogram. 
Key 
objectives 
of 
the 
plan 
are 
to 
produce 
monthly, timely, 
and 
reliable 
reports 
on 
executed expenditure; 
to 
consolidate 
fiscal 
accounts; 
to 
facilitate 
virtual 
access 
to 
fiscal 
accounts; 
and 
to 
support 
production 
of 
financial 
reports 
by 
public 
enterprises 
and 
Regional 
Development 
Organizations 
(RDOs). 
In 
addition, 
a 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
is 
planned 
for 
fiscal 
2004. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
assessment 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
Ecuador’s 
economic development 
by 
identifying 
weaknesses 
in 
Public Financial 
Management 
Systems 
and 
Practices, 
and 
making 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
efficiency, 
transparency, 
and 
accountability. 
Upon 
completion 
of 
the 
diagnostic  work, 
additional 
specific 
actions 
could 
be 
built 
into 
the 
Program 
Policy 
Matrix. 
Regarding 
audit 
arrangements, 
during 
2002, 
a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
was 
reformulated 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
the 
State 
(CGE), 
which 
enhances 
oversight 
of 
the independent audits 
of 
projects and aims 
at 
improving 
the timeliness 
and 
quality 
of 
audit 
reports. 
Also, 
during 
fiscal 
2003 
a 
Pilot 
Capacity 
Assessment 
of 
Private 
Audit 
Firms 
in 
Ecuador 
was 
conducted. 
The 
assessment 
revealed that 
there 
is 
unevenness 
in 
the 
institutional 
capacity, 
audit 
methodology, and 
engagement 
practices 
of 
fms, 
when 
benchmarked 
against 
international 
standards 
on 
auditing. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
assessment, 
recommendations have been 
made 
to 
the 
CGE 
on 
the 
acceptability 
of 
fms 
to 
conduct 
audits 
of 
Bank-financed 
projects. 
It 
is 
expected, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
risks 
to 
Bank 
funds 
posed 
by 
uneven 
quality 
of 
audits 
will 
be 
reduced. 
72. 
Procurement. 
The overall 
procurement 
risk 
of 
Ecuador’s 
portfolio 
is 
rated 
High 
in 
the 
Country 
Procurement Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR). 
Consequently, 
the 
GOE 
and 
the 
Bank 
have 
agreed 
on 
specific 
issues 
and  necessary 
reforms 
that  are essential 
to 
achieve  transparency, 
competition, 
economy, 
and 
efficiency 
in 
managing the 
public 
contracting 
system. 
These are 
included 
in 
the 
CPAR’s 
Action 
Plan 
that 
was accepted 
by 
the 
GOE 
in 
2000. 
The 
new 
Government 
has 
confirmed 
its 
commitment 
to 
achieving 
these 
objectives. 
A 
key 
reform 
included 
as 
a 
benchmark 
for 
the  second 
stage 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Program 
concerns 
a 
new 
procurement 
law. 
Key 
principles 
of 
the 
bill 
will 
include 
(a) 
streamlining 
procedures 
for  the procurement 
of 
works and 
goods, 
(b) 
incorporating revised consulting 
standards,  (c) 
facilitating 
the 
use 
of 
electronic technologies 
in 
public 
procurement, and 
(d) 
creating 
and 
implementing 
a 
national regulatory 
body 
to 
enforce 
the 
procurement 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
In 
addition,  the 
GOE 
is 
interested 
in 
developing 
an 
E-Government 
system 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
works, 
and 
services at 
all 
levels 
of 
government 
and, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
third 
phase 
of 
its 
Program, 
it 
has agreed 
to 
complete  the 
establishment 
of 
a 
COMPRA.NET 
system 
for 
electronic 
public 
bidding. 
Finally, 
a 
measure 
that 
will 
contribute 
to 
mitigating 
procurement 
risk 
under the 
program 
itself 
would be improved 
budgetary 
control 
through 
an 
improved 
SIGEF,  and 
strengthened 
capacity 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
General’s 
Office 
to 
audit 
ministry 
and  agency  accounts. 
Individual 
projects  have  generally  made 
their 
own 
provisions 
for 
procurement 
to 
minimize 
procurement 
risk. 
In 
the 
present Program, 
there 
is 
no 
specific  procurement 
against 
a 
“positive 
list,” 
with 
the exception 
of 
some 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
may 
be 
procured 
as 
part 
of 
the support 
for 
the 
eventual preparation 
of 
future 
operations. 
Procurement 
in 
this 
operation 
will 
simply 
follow 
the 
Bank’s 
guidelines. 
73. 
Eventual 
preparation of future Programmatic 
loans. 
Immediately 
following 
disbursement 
of 
this 
loan, 
the 
GOE 
would initiate work 
on 
the 
actions 
contained 
in 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
its 
Program. 
A 
detailed 
schedule 
of 
these 
activities and 
budget 
would 
be 
prepared 
with 
the Bank‘s 
support at 
~ 
3. 
A 
revamped 
SIGEF 
should 
include 
the 
following 
minimum 
modifications: 
(a) 
a 
consolidated budget 
for 
the 
Non- 
Financial 
Public 
Sector; 
(b) 
disaggregated 
reporting 
of 
actual 
revenues 
and 
executed 
expenditure 
by 
financing 
source 
and 
budgetary 
item, and 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
IMF 
Manual 
of 
Public 
Finance; 
(c) 
disaggregated 
and 
unified 
reporting 
of 
executed 
expenditure between Treasury and 
Budget 
at 
the 
MEF, 
to 
reflect floating 
debt; 
(d) 
an 
interface 
between 
the 
budget 
and 
public 
credit 
modules 
to 
have 
a 
common 
database; (e) 
a 
module 
for 
human 
resource 
management; 
and 
(f) 
a 
module 
for 
subnational governments. 
29 
Page  38
that 
time. 
Financing 
of 
these 
activities 
may be 
sought 
through 
the 
Project Preparation 
Facility 
of 
future 
Programmatic 
operations 
or, 
if 
possible, 
through 
PHRD 
grants. 
H. 
Loan 
Disbursement 
74. 
The 
single-tranche adjustment 
loan 
amounts 
to 
US$50 
million. 
The 
entire amount 
will 
be 
disbursed 
upon 
effectiveness,  soon 
after approval. 
The 
preparation 
of 
future 
Programmatic 
operations 
and the 
definition 
of 
their 
specific 
amounts, 
would 
be 
decided 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
country’s 
performance 
under 
the 
Bank‘s  country 
strategy and 
under the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program. 
The 
basis 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
these  loans 
will 
be 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
benchmarks 
described 
in 
the 
Policy 
Matrix 
of 
Reforms 
(Annex 
2). 
Disbursement 
arrangements 
for 
the 
present 
operation 
would 
follow 
the 
simplified 
procedures 
for 
SALs/SECALs 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
1 
February 
1996. 
The 
Borrower 
will 
open 
an 
account 
in 
Ecuador’s 
Central 
Bank 
(Banco 
Central 
del 
Ecuador). 
Once the 
Bank 
formally 
notifies 
the 
borrower 
that 
a tranche 
is 
available 
for 
withdrawal, 
the 
borrower may 
submit 
a 
simplified withdrawal 
application 
so 
that 
the proceeds 
of 
the tranche  are 
deposited 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
this 
account, 
for 
use 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Disbursements 
will 
not 
be 
linked 
to 
specific 
purchases, 
and 
supporting evidence 
for 
disbursements 
is 
therefore 
not 
required. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
loan 
may 
not 
be 
used 
to 
finance 
expenditures 
typically 
excluded under 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Although 
a 
routine 
audit 
of 
the  deposit  account 
would 
not 
be 
required, 
the 
Bank 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
request 
that 
an 
audit 
be 
conducted 
in 
accordance

I. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
75. 
The 
main 
overall 
benefit 
of 
the 
loan 
is 
to  contribute to  poverty  reduction 
in 
Ecuador 
through two 
complementary 
ways. 
First, 
the 
reform 
program 
will 
bring 
fiscal 
accounts 
to 
a 
more 
sustainable 
path. 
Most 
of 
the  proposed 
measures 
carry 
fiscal 
implications, 
which 
are estimated 
to 
produce 
initial 
net 
fiscal 
savings 
of 
about 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Fiscal 
reforms 
will 
also 
strengthen 
countercyclical 
fiscal 
institutions 
and 
rules; 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
collection 
by 
the 
IRS 
and 
Customs; 
contribute 
to 
reducing country 
risk, 
which 
should induce 
a 
fall 
in 
domestic 
interest 
rates 
and 
have 
a 
lasting impact 
on 
economic recovery; 
and 
free 
resources 
for 
financing 
priority 
social 
programs. 
Second, 
the 
reform 
program 
will 
accelerate 
economic 
growth 
through 
structural 
change 
aiming 
to 
increase 
productivity 
and 
flexibilize 
markets, 
especially  labor. 
As 
a 
result,  the 
loan 
will 
contribute 
to 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
and 
investment 
in 
basic 
infrastructure-water, 
power, 
telecommunications, 
and 
oil-sectors, 
attracted 
by 
a 
more 
competitive framework, 
a 
more 
open 
economy, 
sound 
pricing 
and 
regulatory 
policies, and 
more flexible 
markets. 
76. 
Results 
and 
Monitoring 
Indicators. 
The 
main 
specific 
outcomes expected 
from 
the 
Multiyear 
Government’s 
Program 
are 
derived 
from 
prior 
actions 
and 
benchmarks  agreed 
in 
the 
matrix 
of 
policy 
reforms 
(Annex 
2). 
On 
revenue 
management, 
Customs 
modernization and 
tax 
reform 
should lead 
to 
increased 
tax 
revenue 
collected 
by 
the 
IRS 
no 
less 
than 
7.5 
percent 
per 
year. 
On 
expenditure 
management, sustained 
implementation 
of 
austerity 
measures 
through 
2003 and 2004 
should lead 
to 
to 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
primary 
surpluses, 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
3.5 
percent 
cap 
on 
real 
primary 
spending 
of 
the 
Fiscal 
Law. 
On 
civil 
service 
reform, 
the 
unification 
of 
public 
sector wages and 
further 
measures 
taken 
to 
rationalize 
public 
employment 
should 
lead 
to 
negative 
growth 
of 
the wage 
payroll 
in 
real 
terms. 
On 
transuarencv 
measures, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Transparency 
Plan 
should 
produce 
virtual 
access 
to 
timely 
and 
reliable 
reports 
on 
executed 
NFPS 
consolidated 
expenditure 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
e- 
public 
procurement 
and 
national 
investment 
systems. 
On 
debt 
management, 
Ecuador 
has 
cleared 
most 
domestic 
and external 
arrears, 
and should 
allocate 
no 
less 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
FEIREP 
accumulated annual 
proceedings 
to 
debt 
reduction. 
On 
trade 
reform, 
all 
import 
licenses are 
unified 
and 
about 
20 
percent 
of 
30 
Page  39
them, 
considered 
as 
ineffective,  should 
be eliminated 
in 
a 
process 
of 
effective 
simplification 
of 
import 
licensing 
procedures. 
On 
power 
sector 
reform, electricity 
tariffs 
should 
continue 
adjusting, 
reaching 
no 
less 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
average costs 
by 
March 
2005. 
On 
telecom reform,  the 
strategy 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
ANDINATEL 
and 
PACIFICTEL 
should 
lead 
to 
effective 
investments 
by 
a 
private 
investor 
and 
the 
signing 
of 
management contracts 
of 
both 
companies 
with 
a 
private 
fm. 
Finally, 
on 
labor market 
reform, the concertation 
strategy 
of 
the 
Government should lead 
to 
effective 
salary adjustments 
below 
the 
inflation 
rate. 
The 
matrix 
also includes 
a 
full 
set 
of 
monitoring 
indicators. 
The social 
impact 
of 
the 
key 
measures 
adopted 
in 
this 
operation-tariff 
increases, 
reduction 
of 
subsidies, 
and 
so 
forth- 
will 
be 
evaluated 
in 
the 
poverty 
assessment 
work 
planned 
for 
fiscal 
2004. 
77. 
All 
prior 
actions 
under 
this 
operation have already 
been achieved, 
but 
the 
risks 
of 
policy 
reversals 
or 
weak 
implementation 
of 
the 
Multiyear 
Government's 
Program are 
high. 
Indeed, 
the 
Program 
faces a 
number 
of 
domestic 
and external 
risks 
that 
may 
pose a 
threat 
to 
fiscal 
stability 
and 
economic recovery. 
All 
risks 
mentioned 
below 
might 
lead 
Ecuador 
not 
only 
to 
fail 
to 
maintain 
a 
proper 
macroeconomic 
framework 
and 
to 
depart 
from 
the 
Program 
of 
reforms 
agreed 
under 
this 
operation, 
but 
also 
to 
abandon 
dollarization. 
In 
particular: 
0 
Political 
risk. 
Political 
opposition 
in 
Congress 
remains strong 
and 
coalitions 
are 
fragile. 
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
the 
new 
Administration 
is 
developing 
a 
continuous dialogue 
with 
members 
of 
Congress 
and 
political 
forces 
on 
a 
commonly 
agreed 
agenda. 
The 
Bank 
is 
assisting 
such conversations 
on 
an 
ad 
hoc 
basis 
and, 
in 
coordination 
with 
other 
donors, 
is 
supporting 
the 
approval 
of 
key 
Government 
bills 
submitted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
agenda 
of 
reforms, 
minimizing 
the 
need 
for new 
laws 
and 
contributing 
to 
creating 
consensus 
on 
reforms. 
As 
coalitions 
develop,  though, 
the 
reform 
agenda, 
priorities, 
and 
timing 
can 
depart 
from 
those 
outlined 
in 
Annex 
2. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
predict 
whether 
the 
actual 
program 
will 
be more 
or 
less 
robust 
in 
any 
given 
element 
than 
the one 
the 
Government 
has 
outlined 
here, 
but 
World 
Bank policy 
dialogue 
should 
help 
the 
Government 
to 
mitigate 
the 
risks 
of 
weaker 
program 
Outcomes. 
0 
Social 
risk. 
The 
fragile coalition 
that 
supported 
President GutiCrrez 
could 
break 
up, 
and ensuing 
political 
unrest 
could 
prevent the government 
from 
implementing 
key 
adjustment 
or 
structural 
reform 
measures. 
To 
mitigate 
social 
risk, 
the 
GOE 
is 
committed 
to 
developing 
a 
national 
dialogue 
with 
union 
and 
indigenous 
leaders. 
By 
increasing social 
spending 
and  enhancing 
the 
coverage 
and 
delivery 
effectiveness 
of 
basic 
public 
services, 
the 
government 
also 
hopes 
to 
limit 
the impact 
of 
its 
policy 
actions. 
These 
efforts 
are 
complemented 
by 
the 
Bank's 
continuous 
dialogue 
with 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society and assistance 
to 
the 
Government 
in 
formulating 
and 
implementing 
social programs 
aimed 
at 
protecting the 
poor 
and the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups, 
particularly 
with 
the 
financial 
support 
of 
the Programmatic 
Social Loan. 
0 
External 
risks. 
Given 
dollarization and 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
meaningful 
lender 
of 
last 
resort 
for 
the 
banking 
sector, 
external economic 
shocks-especially 
a 
severe 
decline 
in 
the 
price 
of 
oil, 
competitive 
depreciations 
by 
neighbouring 
countries, 
or 
partial 
sudden 
stops 
in 
capital 
flows 
to 
the 
region-might 
make 
a 
deflationary 
fiscal 
adjustment 
socially 
unbearable 
and 
put 
the 
fragile 
banking 
recovery 
at 
risk. 
To 
mitigate 
these 
external 
risks, 
the 
government 
is 
strengthening 
its 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
shocks 
countercyclically 
by 
improving 
its 
institutions 
to 
develop 
a 
countercyclical 
policy 
and replenishing 
the 
oil 
stabilization 
fund 
(FEIREP), 
clearing 
arrears 
and 
repaying 
debt, 
increasing the 
share 
of 
non-oil 
fiscal 
revenues, 
diversifying 
non-oil 
exports, 
strengthening 
prudential 
regulations 
and 
creating 
a 
liquidity 
fund 
for 
commercial 
banks, 
increasing 
labor 
market 
flexibility, 
and 
encouraging 
competitiveness and 
private 
participation 
in 
key 
investment 
sectors.

Debt overhung 
risk. 
High 
debt service 
could 
affect 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and 
impede Ecuador 
from 
fully 
clearing 
past 
arrears, 
or 
could 
engender 
the 
accumulation 
of 
new 
arrears 
in 
the 
near term. 
To 
mitigate 
its 
debt-overburden 
risk, 
the 
Bank 
is 
assisting 
Ecuador 
in 
resuming 
bilateral 
debt 
rescheduling 
agreements 
with 
the Paris 
Club, 
defining 
a 
comprehensive 
debt-reduction 
strategy, 
and 
strengthening 
debt 
management. 
0 
Zmplementution 
risk. 
Given 
Ecuador’s 
past performance, there 
might 
be 
a 
strong need 
to 
support 
limited  local 
capacity 
of 
officials 
in 
developing 
such 
a 
comprehensive 
program rapidly 
and 
successfully. 
To 
deal 
with 
such 
risk, 
the 
Bank 
intends 
to 
strengthen 
field 
supervision, 
develop 
joint 
supervision  missions 
with 
the 
MI?, 
and  combine 
several 
additional 
instruments 
including, 
for 
example, 
technical 
assistance, 
advisory 
services, 
and 
grants 
for 
building 
capacity and 
training.

Quito,

April 
28,2003 
Mr. 
James 
D. 
Wolfensohn 
President 
The 
World 
Bank 
Group 
Washington, 
D.C. 
20433 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn: 
1. 
This 
letter  outlines 
the 
Government's 
program 
of 
reforms 
to 
revert 
the 
deterioration 
in 
Ecuador' 
s 
social, 
economic, 
and 
financial 
conditions 
experienced 
in 
recent 
years,.and 
place 
the 
economy 
in 
a 
sustainable 
growth path 
with 
greater 
equity 
and opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
This 
multiyear program 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
through 
an 
Adjustment 
Loan 
for 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
and 
its 
posible 
follow 
up 
operations, 
and the Programmatic 
Loan 
for 
Human 
Development 
Sector. 
It 
also 
has 
the support 
from 
an 
IMF 
Stand 
By 
Arrangement, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
IDB 
and 
CAI; 
through related 
operations. 
The 
Annex to 
this 
letter 
summarizes the 
detailed 
key 
measures 
already 
implemented 
by 
the Govemment under 
this 
operation, and 
those 
that 
it 
plans 
to 
adopt 
in 
the 
future. 
The 
Inherited 
Economic 
and 
Social 
Situation 
2. 
When 
the 
Govemment 
of 
President  Gutierrez 
took 
office 
last 
January, 
it 
encountered a 
very 
difficult 
economic and 
social 
situation. 
Ecuador 
experienced a 
difficult 
period 
in 
the 
last 
decade 
owing 
to 
the 
oil 
price 
slump 
in 
late 
199Os, 
damage 
from 
the 
El 
Niiio, 
and 
disease 
in 
the 
shrimp 
industry 
which 
compounded 
structural 
weaknesses 
and 
led 
to 
economic stagnation, 
hyperinflation, 
and 
banking 
crisis. 
Ecuador 
became 
one 
of 
the countries 
in 
the 
world 
with 
the most 
poverty 
and 
inequity. 
Poverty 
increased substantially 
to 
56 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
1999, 
with 
21 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
extreme 
poverty. 
The 
rural 
areas, 
where 
most 
of 
the 
indigenous 
population live, 
were the 
most 
affected. 
About 
half 
a 
million 
Ecuadorians were 
forced 
to 
emigrante 
to 
other countries. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
forty 
percent 
of 
Ecuador's 
national income 
is 
concentrated 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
ten 
percent 
of 
the 
population; 
an 
unacceptable 
situation 
that 
must 
be 
gradually 
corrected. 
3. 
The 
dollarization 
of 
the 
economy 
in 
January 
2000 
gradually 
reversed the 
accelerated 
growth 
of 
inflation 
that 
took 
place 
since 
1998 
and 
helped restore 
confidence 
on 
the 
banking 
system. 
The 
recovery 
in 
oil 
prices, the 
rapid 
growth 
in 
domestic 
demand,

Crudos 
Pesados, 
OCP), 
and 
higher public 
sector 
spending 
helped 
raise 
GDP 
growth 
to 
5.1% 
in 
2001. 
However, 
in 
2002 
the 
GDP 
growth 
slowed again 
to 
3 
percent,  and 
the 
current account 
of 
the balance-of-payment 
registered a 
deficit 
equivalent 
to 
-5% 
of 
GDP, 
owing 
in 
part 
to 
weakened 
fiscal discipline 
(especially 
large 
increases 
in 
the 
wage 
bill 
), 
and 
suspension 
of 
structural 
reforms. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2002, 
the 
country 
was 
facing 
a 
public 
external 
debt 
equivalent 
to 
60% 
of 
GDP 
and more 
than 
twice 
the 
level 
of 
exports 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
and 
a 
serious 
liquidity 
problem: a 
US$2 
billion 
financing shortfall 
for 
2003, 
arising from: 
i) 
US$750 
million 
in 
arrears 
on 
wages 
and 
salaries 
agreed 
to 
by 
the 
previous 
administration 
(approximately 
US$400 
million 
of 
which 
would 
be 
illegal 
to 
disavow, 
plus 
US$350 
million with 
respect 
to which 
a 
political 
commitment 
has 
been 
made, 
which 
will 
be 
withdrawn); 
ii) 
an 
unfinanced 
46% 
increase 
in 
public 
sector remunerations 
for 
2003; 
and 
iii) 
amortizations and interest 
on 
the 
internal 
and 
external 
debt 
contracted 
in 
previous 
years. 
The 
Government’s 
Program 
4. 
Upon 
taking 
office 
on 
January 
15,2003, 
the 
new 
administration 
announced 
its 
Program 
for 
Economic Restructuring and 
Human 
Development 
(PERHD). 
The 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
Program 
are: 
promoting 
growth 
with 
stability,  reducing 
poverty, 
and  eradicating 
corruption. 
It 
aims 
to 
solve 
immediate 
liquidity 
problems 
and 
deepen 
fiscal 
solvency; support 
competitive 
production policies 
by 
introducing 
flexibility 
in 
goods 
and 
services 
markets and increase the 
productivity 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production; and promote 
social development 
and 
reduce 
poverty. 
The 
PERHD 
establishes 
key 
targets 
to 
be 
achieved 
during 
2003-07. 
Specifically, 
the 
Government’s 
program 
seeks 
inter 
alia 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
from 51 
percent 
to 
38 
percent 
by 
2007; 
reduce 
the 
illiteracy 
rate 
from 
10 percent 
to 
8 
percent; reduce 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
population 
without 
access 
to 
healthcare 
from 
23 
percent 
to 
17 
percent; 
generate 
an economic 
growth 
rate 
averaging 
more 
than 
5 
percent 
annually 
during 
2003-07; 
and 
succeed 
in 
rapidly 
reducing 
inflation 
rates 
to 
international 
levels. 
In 
the 
social 
areas, 
among 
the 
different 
measures 
being 
contemplated,  the 
Government 
plans 
to 
finance  the 
Frente 
Social’s 
poverty- 
reduction 
program,  strengthen the 
provision 
of 
basic  services 
and 
the 
social 
protection 
system, 
and 
target subsidies 
on 
the 
poorest and 
most 
vulnerable 
sectors. 
5. 
On 
the 
economic 
front, 
the 
most 
urgent 
task 
is 
addressing the 
liquidity 
crisis, 
reestablishing 
fiscal 
discipline, 
and 
strengthening 
fiscal 
and 
debt 
management, 
all 
preconditions 
for 
the 
resumption 
of 
growth. 
In 
addition,  the 
PERHD 
includes 
comprehensive  structural 
reforms 
to 
ensure 
that  economic  recovery  can  be 
sustained 
in 
the 
medium-term. 
The 
areas 
that 
will 
receive 
priority 
are: 
tax 
reform; 
civil 
service 
reform; 
public 
enterprise 
reform 
(water, 
electricity, 
telecommunications),  the 
oil 
industry, 
and 
labor 
markets. 
All 
these 
areas 
are 
covered 
in 
the 
multiyear program 
supported 
under 
this 
operation.

“ISTERIO 
DE

Y 
FINANZAS 
6. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
completing 
financial 
sector 
reform. 
Under 
the 
program 
recently 
signed 
with 
the 
IMF, 
it 
is 
committed 
to: 
liquidate 
8 
closed banks 
administrated 
by 
AGD; 
contract 
international 
firms 
to 
administer 
Filanbanco 
and 
AGD 
liquidation 
trusts 
funds; 
bring 
Banco 
del 
Pacifico 
to 
the 
point 
of 
sale; 
conduct 
an 
assessment 
of 
the operating 
procedures 
and 
actuarial 
balances 
of 
the 
social security 
system 
(IESS, 
ISSFA, and 
ISSPOL); 
and 
return 
to 
depositors 
all 
blocked 
deposits 
in 
Filanbanco 
and 
AGD. 
7. 
The 
Government 
is 
firm 
in 
its 
intention 
to 
eradicate corruption, 
modernize 
the 
state 
and 
make 
rapid 
progress 
in 
promoting 
transparency 
and 
citizen 
participation. 
Some 
specific 
measures 
in 
this 
direction 
have 
been 
included 
in 
our 
economic 
program 
detailed 
below; 
other  actions 
are 
still 
being 
developed 
in 
close 
consultation 
with 
the 
civil 
society. 
Austerity and 
Poverty 
Alleviation 
8. 
The 
Government 
has 
declared 
the 
economy 
in 
a 
temporary 
“state 
of 
war” 
to 
mobilize 
an 
all-out 
austerity 
effort  to 
address 
the 
serious 
liquidity 
problems, 
redress 
the 
fiscal 
imbalances, 
and 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
renewed 
economic 
growth. 
Concurrently, 
it 
is 
taking 
measures 
to 
protect 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups 
from 
the negative 
impact 
of 
the 
stabilization 
measures 
adopted. 
9. 
Austeritv. 
Immediately upon 
taking 
office, a 
set 
of 
corrective 
measures 
were 
put 
in 
place, 
namely: 
a) 
an 
austerity 
program 
that  severely  restrains 
public 
expenditure 
including: 
i) 
freezing 
of 
wages 
for 
regular 
civil 
servants; 
ii) 
suspension 
of 
overtime 
allowances; 
and 
iii) 
10 
percent 
salary 
reduction 
of 
civil 
servants 
with 
monthly 
earnings 
above 
US$l,OOO; 
b) 
a 
2003 budget consistent 
with 
the 
austerity 
program 
and 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency, 
Stability 
and Responsibility 
Law 
(FTSRL,); 
c) 
an increase 
in 
fuel 
prices 
by 
an 
average 
of 
20 
percent; 
d) 
the 
setting-up 
of 
Fond0 
de 
Estabilizacibn, 
Znversibn 
Social 
y 
Reduccibn 
del 
Endeudamiento 
Pliblico 
(EIREP) 
for 
active 
debt 
reduction 
and counter-cyclical 
fiscal policy; 
and 
e) 
an 
active 
repurchasing 
public 
debt 
policy. 
10. 
With 
the 
measures 
adopted 
and 
the  expected  support 
from 
multilateral 
organizations, 
the 
Government 
will 
be able 
to 
close the 
financing 
gap 
in 
2003. 
Of 
total 
financial 
requirements 
of 
about 
US$2 
billion, 
after 
including 
already 
scheduled 
financing,  about US$0.7 
billion 
remained 
unfinanced. 
Itwill 
fill 
the 
financing 
gap 
through  a 
combination 
of 
a) 
fiscal 
surpluses 
originating 
from 
expenditure cuts 
and 
additional 
income 
from 
oil 
and 
non-oil 
earnings; 
b) 
rollover 
of 
most 
of 
the domestic 
debt, 
with 
some 
repurchase 
coming 
from 
proceeds 
of 
its 
FEXREP; 
c) 
support 
from 
multilateral 
agencies, 
including 
the 
World 
Bank, 
and 
d) 
prompt 
payment 
on 
external 
arrears 
accumulated 
up

Protecting 
the 
Poor. 
Some measures 
taken 
by 
the Government 
to 
address 
the 
liquidity 
problem 
will 
have a 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Among 
these 
are the 
utility 
services 
and 
fuel 
prices 
increases 
and 
the 
freezing 
of 
wages 
of 
public 
servants. 
Therefore, 
the 
Government 
has 
introduced 
a 
set 
of 
compensatory 
measures 
to 
protect 
the 
income 
of 
poor, 
namely: 
a) 
an increase 
in 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
(cash 
subsidy) 
from 
US$11.5 
to 
US$15; and 
b) 
an increase 
in 
pension 
of 
retirees 
by 
US$5 
per 
month. 
In 
addition,  the Government plans 
to 
substitute 
the 
regressive 
gas 
subsidy 
by 
one 
targeted 
on 
the poorest and 
most 
vulnerable 
groups; 
protect 
social  spending 
from 
budget 
cuts, 
and 
implement 
a 
number 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The 
World 
Bank 
Programmatic 
Loan 
for 
the 
Social 
Sectors 
will 
support 
some 
of 
these 
measures. 
Additionally, 
the 
Government 
is 
developing 
policies 
to 
generate 
economic  opportunities 
for 
the 
poor, especially 
the 
indigenous and 
rural 
population, 
who 
were 
the 
most adversely 
affected 
by 
the 
crisis. 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and Debt 
Sustainability 
12. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
dollarization, and 
is 
fully 
aware that 
for 
this 
regime 
to work 
in 
favor 
of 
Ecuador's development, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
among other 
things, 
to 
maintain 
a 
strong 
fiscal 
stance 
and 
bring 
the 
external 
debt 
to 
manageable levels.  Therefore, 
improved public 
sector 
and 
debt 
management 
areamong 
its 
top 
priorities. 
13. 
Fiscal 
Discidine 
and 
Transuarencv. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency, 
Stability 
and 
Responsibility 
Law 
(FI'SRL) 
approved 
in 
2002 and 
to 
improve 
transparency. 
The 
FTSRL 
establishes a 3.5% 
cap 
on 
annual 
real primary 
spending 
growth 
of 
the 
Central 
Government and 
calls 
for 
an annual 
reduction 
in 
non-oil deficit 
of 
the 
Central 
Government 
of 
0.2% 
of 
GDP 
per 
year. 
In 
late 
January,  the 
Government 
issued 
the 
regulations 
for 
the 
FI'SRL 
(Executive Decree 
No. 
1221) 
with 
respect to: 
a) 
pluri-annual 
budgeting; 
b) 
quantitative benchmarking 
of 
fiscal 
management; 
c) 
public 
debt 
reduction 
plan; 
d) 
investment 
by 
public 
enterprises; 
e) 
management 
of 
the 
oil 
stabilization 
fund; 
and 
f) 
fiscal 
transparency 
and 
citizen's control. 
The 
Government 
plans 
to 
adhere 
closely 
to 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency 
Law 
and 
its 
regulations. 
In 
this 
context, 
it 
will 
issue 
an 
Executive 
Decree 
defining 
the 
technical 
norms 
to 
determine 
the 
exact 
amount 
of 
revenues 
to 
be transferred 
to 
the 
Fondo 
de 
Estubilizucibn, 
Znversibn 
Social 
y 
Reduccibn 
del 
Endeudumiento 
Pliblico, 
EIREP. 
In 
addition, 
beginning 
in 
2004, 
it 
plans 
to 
prepare and 
publish 
its 
first 
pluri-annual 
budget 
for 
2004-07. 
14. 
The  Government 
is 
developing 
a 
Transparency 
Plan 
that  includes  the 
modernization 
of 
the 
integrated 
financial 
management  (SIGEF), 
the 
public 
procurement, 
and 
the 
public 
investment 
systems. 
Regarding 
the 
SIGEF, 
the 
objective 
is 
to 
be able 
to 
count 
with 
more 
timely,  detailed 
information 
on 
fiscal, 
48

REPUBLICA DEL 
ECUADOR 
"ISTERIO 
DE 
ECONOMIA 
Y 
FINANZAS 
debt 
and 
human 
resources 
developments 
to 
improve 
decision-making  and 
transparency. 
Based 
on 
the 
information 
collected 
by 
SIGEF, 
the  Government 
plans 
to 
produce 
monthly 
reports 
and 
make 
this 
information 
available 
on 
the 
internet. 
Before 
March 
2004, 
it 
also 
expects 
to 
have 
published 
the 
financial 
statements 
of 
Petro-Ecuador, 
the 
electricity 
and telecom 
public 
enterprises, 
and 
the 
Regional 
Development  Organizations 
on 
the 
internet. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy and Finance 
(MEF) 
will 
issue 
a technical 
directive defining 
the 
norms and 
chronogram 
of 
the 
annual reports 
to 
be 
submitted 
by 
these 
public 
entities. 
15. 
To 
increase 
transparency 
and efficiency,  prevent 
corruption, 
and 
facilitate 
social 
auditing, 
the 
Government intends 
to 
modernize 
the 
procurement 
system. 
Accordingly, 
it 
will 
submit 
to 
Congress 
a 
new 
draft 
Procurement 
Law 
before 
March 
2004 
that 
will 
streamline 
current 
procurement 
procedures; 
incorporate 
revised 
consulting 
standards; 
use 
electronic 
technologies 
in 
public 
procurement; 
and 
create 
a 
national regulatory 
body 
to 
ensure 
a 
proper 
enforcement 
of 
the 
legal 
framework. 
In 
this 
context, 
MEF 
plans 
to 
establish a 
system 
to 
facilitate 
electronic 
procurement. 
16. 
On 
the 
public 
investment 
system, 
the 
Government plans 
to 
develop a web- 
supported 
system 
to 
manage 
pre-investment 
analysis, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
investment 
projects, and procedures 
for 
facilitating 
citizen's 
participation 
and 
social 
auditing. 
17. 
Improved 
Fiscal 
Performance. 
Fiscal 
revenue 
is 
characterized 
by 
high 
volatility, 
mainly 
due 
to 
continuous 
changes 
in 
oil 
prices 
and 
tax 
laws,  an 
excessive 
number 
of 
earmarked 
revenues; 
and 
increasing, 
albeit 
still 
low 
when 
compared 
to 
their potential, tax revenues 
from 
non-petroleum 
taxes 
owing 
in 
part 
to 
the excessive 
number 
of 
exemptions, 
particularly 
on 
the 
VAT 
and 
the 
income 
tax 
(ISR). 
The 
large number 
of 
taxes 
(more than 
80), 
most 
of 
which yield 
little 
revenue, 
has 
a negative 
impact 
on 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax administration. 
18. 
To 
correct 
these 
problems the 
Government 
will 
implement 
a comprehensive 
tax 
reform 
by 
mid 
2003. 
Specific 
measures 
to 
be  adopted 
are 
still 
under 
consideration, 
but 
reform 
should 
include 
a 
mix 
of 
the 
elimination 
of 
some 
tax 
exemptions,  the 
elimination 
of 
most 
nuisance 
taxes-without 
affecting 
those 
earmarked 
for 
maintenance 
of 
environment protected 
areas; 
and other tax 
policy 
measures, 
like 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
tax 
on 
luxury 
vehicles. 
19. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
strengthening  tax 
administration. 
It 
is 
further 
improving 
the 
tax 
system 
and 
addressing the 
serious 
inefficiency 
and 
mismanagement 
affecting 
the 
Customs Service.  Measures 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
short-run include: 
a) 
introduction 
of 
a 
Simplified 
Tax 
Regime 
(STR-Rdgimen 
49 
Page  58
REPUBLICA 
DEL 
ECUADOR 
MINISTERIO 
DE 
ECONOMIA 
Y 
FINANZAS 
Impositivo 
Simplificado 
Ecuatoriano 
or 
RISE) 
that 
will 
allow 
expansion 
of 
the tax 
base 
by 
collecting 
a 
minimum 
tax 
on 
the 
informal 
sector, 
especially 
small 
producers 
and 
retailers, and creating an enlarged 
registry 
of 
taxpayers 
that 
would 
allow 
enhanced 
cross-checking 
for 
tax 
purposes; 
and 
b) 
a 
thorough 
reform 
to 
Customs 
including 
strengthening 
SRI 
role 
on 
Customs  Board, 
rationalizing 
Customs 
personnel, 
and 
introducing 
severe 
penalties 
for 
under-invoicing 
import 
bills, 
and 
improving 
border 
control. 
The  Government 
also 
plan 
to 
give 
in 
concession 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
certain 
Customs 
services, 
de-concentrate 
SRI 
administration, and 
eliminate 
loopholes 
affecting 
tax 
collection 
by 
Customs. 
20. 
Exuenditure  Rationalization. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
austerity 
measures 
already 
implemented, 
which 
the 
Government 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
2004, 
the Government 
intends 
to 
reduce 
growth 
of 
the 
wage 
bill, 
bringing 
wage 
expenditures 
in 
line 
with 
fiscal 
constraints. 
The 
wage 
bill 
accounts 
for 
about 
half 
of 
primary 
spending 
of 
the 
Central 
Government 
in 
2003. 
The 
public 
sector 
wage system 
is 
fragmented 
and 
lacking 
adequate 
information 
to 
enable a 
rational 
public 
wage 
policy. 
To 
correct 
these 
problems,  the  Government  intends 
to 
introduce 
a comprehensive 
civil 
service 
reform 
in 
consultation 
with 
all 
interested 
parties. 
In 
this 
context, 
it 
will 
submit 
to 
Congress 
a 
Public 
Sector Wage 
Unification 
Law 
that 
will 
include 
the 
consolidation 
of 
all 
salary 
supplements 
of 
Central 
Government 
civil 
servants. 
During 
2003, 
and 
in 
parallel 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
new 
draft 
Civil 
Service 
Law 
and 
Administrative 
Career, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
complete 
staffing 
reviews 
to 
register 
all 
civil 
servants 
positions, 
starting 
with 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education, 
Public Works, 
Agriculture 
and 
Social 
Welfare; 
verify 
vacancies and 
evaluate 
functions 
with 
responsibilities 
in 
Central 
Government 
entities 
already 
having 
14 
salary 
steps. 
21. 
With 
the revenue enhancing and expenditure 
reducing 
measures 
outlined, 
the 
Government 
expects 
to 
be able 
to 
increase tax 
revenues 
in 
the 
next 
two 
years 
by 
at 
least 
7.5% 
and 
comulv 
with 
the 
3.5%  ceiling: 
on 
real 
mimaw 
wending: 
of 
the 
Central 
Government 
in 
2004 
set 
in 
the 
fiscal 
law. 
22.Debt 
Management. 
The 
burden 
of 
public 
debt 
is 
a 
major  impediment 
for 
sustained 
growth 
and 
poverty alleviation. 
The 
Government gives 
priority 
to 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
debt 
burden 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Fiscal 
Law 
because 
it 
will 
ameliorate the 
liquidity 
problems, 
improve 
the 
country’ 
s 
standing 
in 
international 
markets, 
reduce 
the 
country’s 
financing 
cost, 
and 
will 
make possible 
diverting 
resources 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
poverty. 
The 
Government 
has 
cleared 
all 
existing 
external 
debt 
arrears 
accumulated 
up 
to 
February 
28, 
2003, 
and domestic 
bonded 
debt 
arrears 
accumulated 
up 
to 
March 
31, 
2003. 
Before 
March 
2004, 
and 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Fiscal 
Law, 
it 
will 
prepare  a 
Debt 
Reduction  Plan 
and 
gradually reduce 
public 
debt 
through 
repurchases 
with 
the proceeds 
of 
FEIREP. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
allocate 
70% 
of 
the 
resources 
50 
Page  59
REPUBLICA DEL 
ECUADOR 
MINISTEN0 
DE 
ECONOMIA 
Y 
FINANZAS 
accumulated 
in 
the 
FEIREP 
for 
debt 
reduction 
in 
2003 
and 
2004. 
As 
called 
for 
by 
the 
Fiscal  Law, 
the 
Government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
strengthen 
its 
debt 
management capacity and make 
debt 
management transparent. 
Structural 
Sector 
Reforms 
23. 
The 
country’s  capacity 
to 
improve 
competitiveness 
and 
enhance 
productivity 
will 
determine 
whether 
Ecuador  can  achieve 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Moreover, 
productivity growth 
is 
critical for 
the sustainability 
of 
the 
dollarization 
regime. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Ecuador’s  competitiveness 
has 
deteriorated 
significantly. 
Therefore, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
reverse 
this 
trend 
and  implement 
an 
ambitious 
structural 
reform 
agenda 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
competition 
and 
trade 
reform, 
basic 
infrastructure 
(water, 
electricity, 
telecommunications), 
oil 
industry, 
and 
labor 
markets. 
24. 
Competition 
and Trade 
Reform.  The 
Government  believes  that 
promoting 
sound 
competition 
through clearly 
defined, and enforceable “rules 
of 
the 
game”, 
without 
discrimination 
or 
favoritism, 
will 
help 
modernize  our 
productive 
infrastructure 
and 
enhance 
its 
competitiveness, 
with 
benefits 
accruing 
to 
all 
Ecuadorian 
consumers. 
Ecuador’s competitiveness 
gap 
is 
significant. 
In 
2002, 
Ecuador 
ranked 
73rd 
among 
80 
countries 
evaluated 
in 
terms 
of 
global 
competitiveness 
by World 
Economic Forum, 
with 
the highest 
relative 
percentage 
for 
innovation 
and 
the 
lowest 
in 
terms 
of 
business 
climate 
and respect 
for 
the 
rule 
of 
law. 
To 
begin 
addressing 
these 
problems, the 
Government 
plans 
to 
introduce a 
new draft 
Law 
of 
Competition 
in 
order 
to 
create 
a 
single 
regulatory 
entity, 
clarify 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Council 
(Consejo 
Consultivo), 
and 
stipulate 
anti- 
monopolistic 
regulations. 
To 
further promote 
the 
country’s 
competitiveness 
on 
the  basis 
of 
quality 
and 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
in 
Ecuador, 
the 
Government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
submit 
to 
Congress 
two 
new 
initiatives: 
a draft 
Law 
of 
Administrative 
Simplification 
before 
March 
2004, 
and a 
draft 
Law 
of 
Production Quality 
before 
March 
2005.. 
25. 
On 
trade, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
reduce the 
existing 
anti-export 
bias 
that 
is 
hampering 
the 
development 
of 
nontraditional 
exports. 
This 
anti-export 
bias 
has 
been 
generated 
by 
the 
discriminatory 
support 
given 
to 
certain 
nonproductive 
sectors 
that  have been especially 
favored 
by 
nontariff 
barriers 
(NTBs). 
The 
discriminatory 
use 
of 
nontariff 
barriers,  the 
most 
important 
of 
which 
are 
the 
import 
licenses  and 
technical 
norms, 
reinforces 
the 
anti-export 
bias. 
Import 
licenses 
still 
apply 
to 
about 
25 
percent 
of 
tariff 
positions 
affecting 
Ecuadorian 
imports and 
are 
distributed 
in 
a 
nontransparent manner.  There 
are 
23 
18 
technical 
norms 
and 
of 
those, 
885 
are 
obligatory and 
infringe 
WTO 
regulations.

26. 
COMEXI 
has 
already 
issued 
a 
resolution 
reverting 
selective 
import tariff 
concessions 
adopted 
last 
year 
and 
unified 
all 
import 
licenses. 
Then, 
it 
will 
eliminate 
at least 
10% 
of 
the number 
of 
licenses 
in 
2003 and 
2004. 
COMEXI 
and 
MEIF 
will 
prepare a comprehensive Trade 
Policy 
Strategy 
compatible 
with 
WTO, 
ALCA 
and 
free 
trade arrangements, 
which 
will 
encompass: 
a) 
tariff 
reductions 
with 
a 
view 
of 
unifying 
the 
majority 
tariffs 
in 
five 
categories 
(0, 
5, 
10, 
15 
and 
20 
percent); 
b) 
non-tariff 
barriers; c) 
norms 
of 
origin 
and anticompetitive 
practices; 
and 
d) 
agricultural 
products, 
services 
and 
investment. 
27. 
Water 
Sector. 
Ecuador 
still 
lacks 
a 
comprehensive 
water 
resource 
management 
policy 
framework. 
The 
sector 
confronts several 
problem including 
low 
coverage 
(particularly 
in 
rural 
areas), 
low 
efficiency, 
and 
poor quality 
of 
services. 
These 
problems 
are 
derived 
in 
part 
from 
the 
low 
user charges 
and 
high 
dependency 
on 
transfers 
from 
the 
Central 
Government. Since water 
and 
sanitation 
services 
are 
provided 
by 
decentralized  entities  that 
depend 
on 
municipal 
governments, 
to 
improve 
the 
quality  and 
efficiency 
of 
services 
and 
assuring 
increased 
coverage, 
the 
Government 
intends 
to 
restructure 
SAPYSB, 
changing 
its 
role 
from 
an 
implementing 
agency 
to 
the 
sector’s 
policy-setting 
body, and 
submit 
to 
Congress 
a new Water 
and Sanitation 
Law 
which 
will 
include 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
independent 
regulatory entity. 
The 
Government also 
plans 
to 
set 
up 
a Water 
Fund 
inside 
MIDUVI 
and 
assigns 
the 
budget allocations 
needed 
to 
provide 
water 
sector 
financing 
according 
to 
uniform, 
performance-based 
criteria. 
28. 
Electricitv 
sector. 
The 
key 
challenge the Government face 
in 
the 
electricity 
sector 
is 
to 
ensure 
its 
financial 
viability. 
Therefore, the Government 
is 
adjusting 
electricity 
tariffs 
until 
they reach 
their 
economic 
cost. 
The 
adjustment 
will 
be 
gradual 
to 
minimize 
their 
impact 
on 
lower 
income 
consumers. 
CONELEC 
has 
issued 
a 
Ministerial 
Decree 
to 
adjust 
electricity 
tariffs 
for 
residential 
consumers 
under  300Kwh/month, 
and 
is 
committed 
to 
cover 
at 
least 
90% 
of 
estimated 
economic 
costs 
by 
March 
2005. 
In 
addition, 
CONAM, 
CONELEC, 
and 
the 
Solidarity 
Fund 
will 
prepare a 
strategy 
to 
improve 
sector 
efficiency. 
29. 
Telecommunication 
sector. 
The 
challenges 
facing 
this 
sector 
include 
low 
local 
rates 
for fixed 
telephone service 
and 
institutional 
fragmentation 
owing 
to 
a 
deficient 
regulatory  framework. 
To 
address 
these 
problems, 
the 
Government 
awarded a 
third 
mobile 
telephone 
license 
band 
and 
prepared 
a Strategy 
for 
the 
telecommunications Sector. 
Before 
March 
2004, 
it 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
prepare a 
new draft 
Telecommunications 
law 
to 
strengthen 
the 
regulatory framework, 
create 
a  single 
sector 
authority, 
encourage 
greater 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
sector, 
including 
Telecsa, 
the 
third 
mobile 
license company. 
Before 
March 
2005, 
the 
Government 
will 
have 
signed 
management 
contracts 
with 
private 
administrators 
of 
Andinatel 
and 
Pacifictel 
and 
select 
a 
private 
investor 
for 
the 
third 
mobile 
license.

30. 
Oil 
Sector. 
The 
oil 
sector 
is 
crucial 
for 
the 
country’s  economic 
growth 
but 
its 
recent 
contribution 
has 
been 
well 
below 
potential 
because 
it 
suffers 
from 
several 
weaknesses. 
Among 
these 
are 
price 
subsidies, 
which 
together 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
judicial 
and 
fiscal 
stability 
and outdated 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
have 
deterred 
foreign 
investment. 
This 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
low 
production 
of 
fields 
with 
the 
greatest reserves 
and 
a 
low 
level 
of 
exploratory 
activity. 
Oil 
resources 
by 
PetroEcuador should 
also 
be 
managed 
with 
transparency. 
. 
To 
begin 
addressing 
these 
problems, 
the 
Government 
has 
increased the 
price 
of 
fuels  and 
has 
a 
commitment 
to 
keep 
adjusting 
fuel 
prices 
according 
to 
market 
conditions. 
To 
promote 
austerity, 
accountability 
and 
efficiency,  and 
reduce 
subsidies, 
it 
has 
reduced 
the budgetary allowance 
to 
PetroEcuador 
by 
US$lOO 
million 
in 
2003- 
while 
the 
public 
enterprise 
preserves 
the  budget  allocated 
to 
comply 
with 
environmental 
regulations-and 
plans 
to 
conduct 
an 
external 
audit 
of 
PetroEcuador, 
the 
result 
of 
which 
will 
be 
made 
public 
before 
March 
2004. 
Before 
March 
2005, 
the Government 
will 
further 
reduce the budget 
to 
PetroEcuador and 
verify 
that the recommendations 
of 
the 
environmental 
management 
plans 
required 
by 
environmental 
regulations 
are 
properly 
implemented. 
31. 
Labor 
Market. 
The 
Government 
is 
fully 
aware that 
the 
dollarization 
of 
the 
economy requires 
a 
flexible 
labor 
market. 
The 
existing 
wage 
setting 
mechanism, 
the so-called Sectoral 
Tables, 
which 
are 
based 
on 
the 
minimum 
wage 
established 
by 
the 
National 
Wages 
Council 
(Consejo 
Nacional 
de 
Salarios, 
CONADES), 
involves compulsory 
automatic 
indexing 
which, 
in 
case 
the parties 
do 
not 
reach 
an 
agreement, 
grants 
a 
minimum 
annual  increase 
similar 
to 
the 
inflation 
rate 
projected 
for 
the 
following 
year. 
These increases are 
not 
related 
to 
productivity 
but 
are 
the  basis 
for 
additional 
increases 
negotiated 
within 
each 
sector. 
This 
system 
not only 
undermines 
the 
country’s competitiveness, 
but 
also rest 
flexibility 
to 
the 
formal 
labor 
market, that 
has 
to 
comply 
with 
such 
compulsory 
adjustments 
Accordingly, 
the Government plans 
to 
make 
a detailed 
assessment 
of 
the 
labor 
market 
problems 
in 
consultation 
with 
workers and employers, 
and 
establish 
a 
new 
salary 
adjustment mechanism before 
March 
2005.

Fighting 
Corruption and 
Transparency 
32. 
Corruption 
is 
an 
enemy 
that 
undermines 
the 
possibilities 
for 
human 
development 
in 
Ecuador. 
The 
Government 
of 
President 
Gutierrez 
is 
firm 
in 
its 
intention 
to 
eradicate 
corruption  and 
make 
rapid 
progress 
in 
promoting 
transparency 
and 
citizen 
participation. 
It 
is 
calling 
on 
all 
Ecuadorians 
to 
mobilize 
and 
work 
together 
against 
instability, 
stagnation, 
poverty, unemployment, 
hunger, 
and 
corruption. 
The 
Mesas 
de 
Didogo 
(Dialogue 
Meetings) 
are 
engaging 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
design and 
monitoring 
of 
public 
policies. 
Concluding 
Considerations 
The 
multiyear 
reform 
agenda 
outlined 
above 
is 
ambitious, 
but 
it 
is 
what 
Ecuador 
requires 
in 
order 
to 
revert 
the 
recent  deterioration 
in 
economic 
and 
social 
conditions. 
The 
Government 
is 
determined 
to 
seek 
the 
political 
consensus 
and 
to 
mobilize 
the 
support 
of 
all 
groups 
of 
society 
to 
execute 
it 
successfully. 
It 
is 
developing 
a permanent dialogue 
with 
members 
of 
Congress 
and 
political 
forces 
on 
the 
legislation 
submitted 
to 
support the reforms. 
At 
the 
same 
time, the 
national 
dialogue 
will 
take 
into 
account 
the 
opinion 
of 
union 
and 
indigenous 
leaders. 
Compensatory 
measures 
introduced 
together 
with 
increased coverage 
and 
delivery 
effectiveness 
of 
basic 
public 
services 
will 
help 
minimize 
the 
negative impact 
of 
some 
policy 
actions 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Without 
underestimating 
the 
challenges, 
the Government 
is 
determined 
to 
place Ecuador 
on 
a 
path 
of 
sustained 
growth 
and 
redress 
its 
long-standing inequities.

yours,

2003-07 
Background 
Ecuador’s 
situation 
in 
the 
world 
context: 
0

0 
0 
Only 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
world’s 
countries 
have 
more 
poverty 
and 
inequity than 
Ecuador. 
Seventy 
percent 
of 
the 
world’s 
countries 
are 
developing more 
rapidly 
than Ecuador. 
Corruption 
is 
an enemy that 
undermines the 
possibilities 
for 
human development 
in 
Ecuador. 
This 
situation 
could 
change 
if 
Ecuadorians 
agree 
to 
work 
together  against 
instability, 
stagnation, 
poverty, 
unemployment, hunger, 
and corruption. 
Key 
social 
statistics that 
call 
us 
to 
action.

Poverty. 
We 
define 
poverty 
as 
the 
lack 
of 
money 
to 
purchase 
food 
and 
basic commodities, 
and 
it 
affects 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
Ecuadorian population. 
Measures 
to 
effectively 
combat 
poverty 
and corruption 
have been 
formulated and 
will 
be 
immediately 
executed. 
Inequity. 
Forty 
percent 
of 
Ecuador’s 
national 
income 
is 
concentrated 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
10 
percent 
of 
the population. 
Strong 
action aimed 
at 
distributing 
wealth 
must 
be 
immediately 
taken. 
Social 
spending stagnation. 
Urgent 
actions 
and 
decisive 
reforms 
are 
needed 
so 
that Ecuador 
can consolidate 
its 
economy and 
finance 
a 10-percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
illiteracy 
rate and 
a 
25- 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
population without 
access 
to 
healthcare.

Priorities 
The 
serious 
liauiditv 
problem inherited 
from 
the 
former Administration: 
a

shortage 
for 
2003, 
arising 
from: 
0 
US$750 
million 
in 
arrears 
on 
wages 
and 
salaries 
agreed 
to 
by 
the 
previous 
Administration 
(approximately 
US$400 
million 
of 
which would 
be 
illegal 
to 
disavow, 
plus 
US$350 
million 
with

What 
is 
the Government 
doing 
to 
correct 
it? 
It 
has 
declared a 
“war  economy” 
with 
respect 
to 
public 
finances 
by 
issuing 
an 
austerity 
decree, 
effective 
in 
February 
2003, 
which 
provides 
for 
the 
following: 
0 
A 
20-percent 
reduction 
in 
the remunerations 
of 
the President 
of 
the 
Republic 
and 
of 
any 
other 
public 
officials 
who 
serve 
in 
positions 
that 
are 
freely 
revocable, 
and 
whose 
overall 
incomes 
are 
more 
than 
US$l,OOO 
per 
month. 
This 
provision 
also covers 
officials 
serving 
abroad. 
Fill 
only 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
freely 
revocable 
vacant 
positions 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
Prohibit 
all 
increases 
in 
remunerations 
of 
public 
servants 
during 
2003. 
Gradually 
reduce the 
number 
of 
public 
servants 
until 
an 
optimal 
size 
of 
the 
public 
labor 
force 
is 
reached. 
The 
Austerity 
Decree 
also 
includes 
about 
a 20-percent increase 
in 
fuel 
prices, 
which 
will 
affect 
the

Table 
A.4.1 
outlines 
these 
ambitious 
but 
realistic 
goals 
for 
2003-07. 
THE 
MACROECONOMIC 
FRAMEWORK FOR 
2003 
(SUPPORTED 
BY 
THE 
IMF 
STAND-BY 
ARRANGEMENT) 
In 
2003,  there 
will 
be 
moderate 
growth 
in 
economic 
activity, 
the current 
account 
deficit, 
and 
consumption. 
Growth 
of 
3.5 
percent 
is 
forecast (due 
mainly 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
oil 
exports 
through 
the 
OCP), 
and 6 
percent 
inflation 
is 
forecast. 
Austerity 
is 
required 
of 
the 
public 
administration 
to 
maintain 
a 
high 
primary 
fiscal 
surplus 
starting 
in 
2004. 
Meanwhile,  additional income 
from 
oil 
exports 
will 
be 
used 
to 
reduce 
public 
debt, 
which 
will 
create 
confidence 
in 
financial 
markets, 
reducing 
the 
risk-spread 
index. 
Fiscal 
Policy 
Fiscal policy 
will 
be 
aimed 
at 
(a) 
relieving 
immediate 
pressure 
on 
liquidity 
and dealing 
with 
the 
debts 
left 
unpaid 
by 
the 
previous 
government, 
(b) 
strengthening the 
fiscal 
position, 
(c) 
stabilizing 
the 
income 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
strengthening social 
programs, 
and 
(d) 
flexibilizing 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
establishing 
spending 
priorities. 
Prim 
surplus: 
The 
primary 
balance 
of 
the 
Non-Financial Public 
Sector 
(NFPS) 
will 
rise 
from 
4.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
to 
5.2 
percent 
in 
2003. 
An 
overall 
NFPS 
balance 
of 
$509 
million 
is 
projected, 
leading 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
debt 
coefficient 
equivalent 
to 
59 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002, 
and 
52 
percent 
in 
2003. 
NFPS 
income: 
This 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
by 
0.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(26.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003), 
due 
to 
reorganizational 
measures 
taken 
by 
the government, 
such 
as 
raising 
the 
price 
of 
fuels 
by 
25 
percent 
($400 
million) 
and eliminating 
the 
selective cuts 
to 
import 
tariffs 
($30 
million) 
made 
by 
the previous 
Administration. 
Subsidies, 
including 
the 
prices 
of 
public 
services, 
will 
be 
reduced 
and approval 
will 
be 
sought 
in 
August 
for 
laws 
on 
public 
sector wage 
unification 
($20 
million 
more 
for 
the 
social security 
system 
in 
2003). 
Stabilization 
of 
NFPS 
unman, 
expenditure 
at 21.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
is 
projected 
for 
2003, 
through 
the 
22 
January 
decree 
on 
fiscal 
austerity, 
freezing 
wages 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
year, 
eliminating 
overtime 
provisions, 
a 
10 
percent 
reduction 
in 
remunerations 
of 
more 
than 
$1,000 
to 
freely 
transferable 
public 
employees, 
and 
a 
10 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
posts 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
new 
government. 
Spending 
on 
NFPS 
remuneration 
will 
come 
to 
$2.251 
billion 
(a 
$260 
61 
Page  70
million 
rise) 
due 
to 
increases 
in 
2002. 
Expenditure allocated 
to 
PetroEcuador 
has 
been reduced 
to 
$100 
million. 
Spending 
on 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
will 
increase. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
will 
be 
$15 
per 
month 
and social 
assistance 
to 
the 
elderly 
poor 
will 
rise 
$5 
per 
month per 
person, 
starting 
in 
January 2003, 
at 
a 
total 
cost 
of 
$60 
million. 
To 
cover 
the 
25 
percent increase 
in 
IESS 
pensions 
in 
2003, 
this 
institution 
will 
suspend 
loans 
for 
surgery, 
reducing 
operations 
from 
$158 
million 
in 
repayable 
loans 
to 
$40 
million 
in 
2003. 
Strengthening 
the social 
security 
system: 
With 
technical 
aid, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
social 
security 
funds 
will 
be 
assessed 
(IESS, 
ISSFA, 
ISSPOL) 
to 
determine 
a strategy 
for 
reforming 
them. 
Focusing 
the 
gas 
subsidy: 
With 
IDB 
assistance, 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
database 
will 
be 
improved, 
focusing 
aid 
and eliminating 
the domestic 
gas 
subsidy 
($40 
million 
in 
2003). 
The 
NFPS 
reauires 
$2 
billion 
in 
financing 
in 
2003: 
This 
consists 
mainly 
of 
debt 
payments 
($1.2 
billion, 
including 
the 
repurchase  of 
$29 
million 
in 
debt 
through 
the 
FEIREP); 
and 
unreschedulable 
late 
foreign 
and  domestic  debt  payments 
($100 
million 
and  $400 
million, 
respectively). 
Financing 
will 
be 
based 
on 
fiscal 
surplus 
($500 
million); 
rollover 
of 
domestic debt 
that comes 
due 
during 
the year 
($400 
million);  financing 
for 
projects 
($300 
million); 
and 
$600 
million 
in 
extraordinary 
financing  ($130 
million 
from 
the 
World 
Bank; $100 
million 
from 
the 
IDB 
and the 
CAS, 
respectively; $160 
million from 
the 
IMF; 
and $150 
million 
in 
debt rescheduled 
with 
the Paris 
Club 
and other 
official 
creditors). 
Oil 
will 
not 
be 
provided 
as 
a guarantee 
for 
any 
loans. 
The 
2003 
budget 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
economic program, 
based 
on 
a wage freeze and 
crude 
oil 
at 
$18 
per 
barrel. 
If 
oil 
income 
falls below 
this 
estimate, spending cuts 
will 
compensate 
for 
the 
deficit. 
If, 
on 
the contrary, 
it 
is 
greater, 
it 
will 
go 
to 
the 
FEIREP 
or 
will 
be 
used 
to 
reduce 
public 
debt. 
Extra 
funds 
contributed 
to 
the 
social security 
system 
will 
be 
saved 
and 
used 
to 
capitalize 
assets. 
To 
protect 
income, 
the government 
will 
pass 
the 
new 
Tourism 
Act. 
Structural 
Reforms 
Three 
structural reforms 
that 
will 
lead 
to 
a 
healthy 
fiscal 
situation 
in 
the 
medium term 
are: 
Law  on 
Customs 
Reform: 
Aimed 
at 
restructuring 
Customs 
Office 
administration  and 
personnel, 
enabling 
the 
IRS 
to 
update  the  customs 
information 
system 
and 
administer 
customs. 
Law 
on 
Wage 
Unification 
and 
Civil 
Service 
Reform: 
This 
will 
enable 
the 
different 
remunerative 
components 
to 
become 
part 
of 
a 
single 
wages 
account. 
Implementation 
will 
require 
four 
years. 
The 
Law 
on 
the 
Civil 
Service 
and 
Administrative 
Careers 
will 
be 
reformed 
to 
reduce the number 
of 
public 
sector employees 
and the 
nominal 
wage 
mass 
in 
2004. 
Law 
on 
Tax Reform: 
Aimed 
at 
better 
allocation 
of 
public 
spending 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
tax 
base. 
This 
will 
be 
based 
on 
(a) 
eliminating 
any preallocation 
of 
income 
not 
stated 
in 
the 
Constitution, 
(b) 
eliminating fiscal 
exemptions, 
(c) 
eliminating 
small 
taxes 
that 
provide 
little 
income 
but 
have 
a 
high 
administrative 
cost, 
(d) 
increasing 
collection 
of 
the 
vehicle 
tax, 
(e) 
reducing 
the 
base 
income tax 
rate, 
and 
(f) 
eliminating 
“fiscal 
shields.” 
These 
reforms 
are 
aimed 
at 
creating 
a sustainable 
fiscal 
surplus 
to 
reduce 
public 
debt. 
The 
OCP, 
which 
will 
begin 
operations 
in 
the last 
quarter 
of 
2003, 
has 
the capacity 
to 
double 
petroleum 
exports, 
which 
supports 
higher medium-term projections 
of 
growth 
and 
exports. 
New 
income 
will 
be 
administrated 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
Organic 
Law 
on 
Responsibility, 
62 
Page  71
Stabilization, 
and Fiscal 
Transparency  (September 
2002), 
will 
become 
part 
of 
the 
Fondo 
de 
Estabilizacidn, 
Znversidn 
Social 
y 
Reduccidn 
del Endeudamiento Ptiblico 
(FEIREP), 
and 
will 
be 
distributed 
as 
follows: 
10 
percent 
for 
social 
spending, 
20 
percent 
to 
deal 
with 
contingencies, 
and 
70 
percent 
to 
repurchase 
debt. 
The 
debt 
coefficient 
will 
drop 
from 
59 
percent 
of 
GDP 
at end- 
2002 
to 
40 
percent 
in 
2006. 
Measures 
for 
the 
Financial 
System 
Filanbanco 
and 
eight 
other 
closed banks 
now 
under 
AGD 
administration 
will 
be 
liquidated. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
February 
contracts 
will 
be signed 
to 
administer 
the 
Filanbanco 
trust 
and 
to 
recover 
or 
sell 
its 
loans 
portfolio. 
The 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
of 
the banks 
will 
be 
part 
of 
another 
trust 
that 
will 
distribute 
them 
among the 
creditors. 
The return 
of 
deposits and other 
liabilities 
will 
begin 
in 
March 
and 
end 
in 
December  2003 
for 
all 
banks. 
The 
government 
will 
eliminate 
all 
legal 
obstacles 
to 
the 
liquidation 
of 
the 
other 
10 
banks 
in 
the 
AGD. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the restructured 
portfolio 
of 
these 
banks 
will 
be 
auctioned, 
generating 
resources 
to 
be 
used 
to 
return 
frozen 
deposits 
and 
to 
cancel obligations. 
State 
Banco 
del 
Pacific0 
will 
be 
privatized. 
Other 
Structural 
Measures 
To 
improve 
productivity, 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
telephone 
and 
electric 
distribution 
companies 
will 
be 
increased. 
These 
companies 
will 
be 
administered 
by 
private 
international 
companies at 
the 
end 
of 
June. 
The 
regulatory officials 
have decided 
to 
adjust 
rates 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis 
to 
match 
production 
costs. 
With 
the technical 
aid 
of 
the 
IDB 
and 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
rate 
structure 
will 
be 
standardized at 
the 
end 
of 
June 
2003. 
An 
economic  and 
environmental 
study 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
an 
action 
plan 
and 
schedule 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
production, 
distribution, 
and 
sale 
of 
petroleum 
and 
its 
derivatives, 
before the end 
of 
June 2003. 
The 
government 
will 
promote fiscal 
transparency 
by 
publishing 
information  (monthly  fiscal 
statistics) 
that 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
monitor 
implementation 
of 
the economic 
program through 
the 
webpages 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
the

A 
Public 
Debt 
Sustainability 
Analysis 
of 
Ecuador 
Despite 
the 
economic  turnaround 
in 
recent 
years, 
since 
Ecuador’s 
default 
in 
1998  the 
government’s 
credibility 
has 
yet 
to 
recover 
to 
its 
precrisis levels. 
While 
dollarization 
has 
brought 
stability 
and 
a 
return 
in 
confidence 
to 
the country, 
spread 
levels 
still 
remain 
high. 
Within 
Latin 
America, 
Ecuador 
spread 
levels 
are close 
to 
politically 
volatile 
Venezuela, 
and 
below 
Argentina. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
commitment 
to 
addressing 
its 
debt situation, 
in 
June 
2002,  the 
government 
passed 
a 
Fiscal 
Law 
that requires 
the 
public 
debt-to-GDP 
ratio 
to 
fall 
16 
percent 
in 
the 
next four 
years, 
then 
to 
below 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP 
afterward, 
and 
to 
remain 
at 
this 
level. 
This 
step 
marked 
the 
first 
time 
that 
the government 
had 
made such a 
strong 
commitment 
to 
reducing 
its 
debt burden. 
In 
this 
annex, 
we 
examine 
Ecuador 
debt 
sustainability 
based 
on 
the 
reform 
program outlined 
in 
the 
report. 
Overall, 
Ecuador’s 
critical 
debt 
situation 
is 
expected 
to 
improve 
and 
its 
40 
percent 
target 
should 
be 
reached 
well 
in 
advance 
of 
2010. 
However, 
to 
maximize 
fiscal 
resources 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
this 
will 
require 
tight 
fiscal 
discipline 
and 
initial 
high 
fiscal 
surpluses 
of 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
high 
surpluses serve 
two 
purposes: 
first, 
they  reduce the 
additional 
financing 
burden 
caused 
by 
new 
debt 
creation, 
and 
second, 
by 
demonstrating 
the 
government’ 
s 
commitment 
to 
address 
its 
debt, 
regain credibility 
and reduce 
the country’s 
risk 
premium 
and 
interest 
rates. 
By 
obtaining early 
high 
initial 
surpluses, 
the 
government 
will 
in 
the 
longer 
run 
free 
up 
more 
resources 
for 
additional social 
spending. 
Although 
the 
outlook 
is 
positive, 
several 
risks 
remain 
high 
because 
the debt 
profile 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
oil 
price 
changes 
and 
fiscal 
slippages. 
THE 
MODEL 
The 
model 
begins 
with 
the government’s 
amortization 
schedule and 
initial 
assumptions 
on 
the 
overall fiscal 
balance. 
Interest payments 
are 
calculated 
based 
on 
the 
current 
debt 
levels 
and 
projected 
new 
debt. 
A 
primary 
surplus 
is 
estimated.  Revenues 
and 
primary 
expenditures 
up 
to 
2005  are 
taken 
from 
the  Base 
Case 
projections. 
Beyond 
2005, 
a 
trajectory 
of 
government 
expenditure 
(based 
on 
the 
fiscal 
laws) 
and 
non-oil 
revenues 
(fixed 
at 
22 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
is 
assumed. 
To 
reach the 
primary 
surplus, 
the 
difference 
between the 
trajectory 
and 
the 
primary 
balance 
is 
identified 
as 
extra 
fiscal 
effort, 
and 
this 
can 
take 
place 
as 
either 
decreased 
expenditure 
or 
increased revenue 
collections. 
From 
the 
overall fiscal 
balance, 
amortizations 
are subtracted 
and the remainder 
is 
the needed 
additional 
financing. 
Hence 
the 
total 
fiscal 
burden 
on 
the 
government 
is 
the 
amount 
of 
extra 
fiscal 
effort 
needed 
plus 
the 
additional 
financing. 
The model 
also 
examines 
how 
funds 
from 
the 
FEIREP 
will 
be 
used 
to 
pay 
back 
debt. 
Main 
assumptions. 
GDP 
growth 
of 
4 
percent 
during 
2004-05, 
and 
thereafter 
3.5 
percent. 
Inflation 
rates 
follow 
the 
trend 
of 
the 
Organization 
for 
Economic 
Cooperation 
and 
Development 
country 
levels 
by 
2005. 
The 
average 
oil 
price 
assumption 
is 
$18 
per barrel 
during 
2003-10. 
Base 
Case. 
In 
the 
first 
few 
years 
the government 
faces 
a 
high 
amortization 
schedule 
during 
which, 
even 
with 
primary 
surpluses, 
will 
also 
require 
additional 
financing. 
If 
the 
Government 
produces 
high 
initial 
primary 
surpluses, 
this 
would 
allow 
it 
in 
later 
years 
to 
produce 
a 
lower level 
of 
primary 
surpluses 
than 
it 
is 
currently  projected 
to 
produce, 
that 
is, 
its 
fiscal 
effort 
might 
become negative. 
In 
other 
words, 
starting 
in 
2006 
the government 
will 
have 
more 
resources 
freed 
for 
increased 
social 
expenditures. 
64 
Page  73
However, 
maintaining 
high 
primary 
surpluses 
will 
not 
be 
an 
easy 
task. 
The 
next 
three 
years 
will 
be 
critical 
in 
terms 
of 
finding 
financing 
to 
cover 
amortizations 
and 
increases 
in 
public 
wage 
expenditures 
in 
2002, 
which 
will 
add 
pressure 
to 
fiscal 
accounts 
from 
2003 
forward. 
Because 
capacity 
to 
absorb 
new 
domestic 
debt 
is 
limited, 
and 
weak  congressional 
backing 
hampers 
government 
credibility, 
it 
will 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
its 
own 
performance 
for 
obtaining 
primary 
surpluses. 
MAIN 
RESULTS 
OF 
THE 
BASE 
CASE 
Into 
the 
medium 
term, 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
heavy 
amortization 
schedule, 
Ecuador’s 
debt 
levels should 
achieve 
its 
debt  objective 
of 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
It 
could 
reach 
this 
amount 
by 
2005-06. 
However, 
doing 
so 
will 
require 
primary 
balances 
of 
around 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003-04. 
As 
amortization levels 
decline, 
financing 
needs 
will 
fall 
from 
2.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003 
to 
0.7 
percent 
in 
2010, 
at 
which 
time 
they 
can 
be 
readily 
absorbed 
domestically. 
Although 
the 
Fiscal 
Law 
cap 
on 
expenditure 
growth 
does 
little 
to 
reduce 
debt, 
it 
helps 
prevent 
debt 
creation 
by 
restraining 
expansionary 
spending. 
Real 
GDP growth 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
in 
line 
with 
the 
maximum 
increase 
in 
expenditure growth. 
This 
would 
prevent 
any 
further erosion 
of 
the 
fiscal 
accounts, 
to 
which 
the 
debt 
analysis 
is 
highly 
sensitive. 
Finally, 
it 
also 
appears 
that 
FEIREP would 
have 
limited 
impact 
on 
reducing 
debt. 
First, 
the 
government 
has 
revised 
what 
it 
believes 
will 
be 
peak 
pipeline 
usage 
to 
600,000 
barrels 
per 
day, 
which 
is 
200,000 
barrels 
below original 
projections. 
This 
inevitably 
will 
reduce 
the 
expected 
windfall 
in 
government 
oil 
revenues. 
Second, 
funds 
entering 
into 
the 
FEIREP 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
marginal 
oil 
production 
increases 
incurred. 
If 
the 
OCP 
reaches 
full 
capacity 
within 
a 
short 
time, 
a 
potential 
$178 
million 
annually 
will 
be 
available 
for 
external 
debt 
repurchase. 
However, 
problems 
in 
resolving 
the 
VAT 
tax 
dispute 
between 
the 
government and 
the 
oil 
companies 
have 
delayed 
investment 
in 
the 
oil 
fields. 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
lower 
marginal 
increase 
in 
productions 
makes 
external 
debt 
repurchase 
more 
modest 
at 
just 
$250 
million 
during 
2004-07,  compared 
to 
a 
potential 
$712 
million. 
Sensitivity 
to 
a 
Fall 
in 
Oil 
Prices 
in 
a 
Low 
Case 
Scenario 
In 
a 
low 
case 
scenario 
for 
2004 
to 
2010, 
we 
assume 
a 
$6 
drop 
in 
average 
oil 
prices 
(from 
US$18 
per 
barrel), 
which 
lowers 
average 
GDP 
growth 
by 
about 
0.5 
percent 
per 
year 
from 
the 
base 
case. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
poorer 
oil 
revenues, 
fiscal 
balances 
and 
debt 
sustainability 
worsen. 
The 
overall 
surplus 
falls 
into deficit 
and 
the 
primary 
surplus 
declines. 
Without 
a 
high 
primary 
surplus 
to 
cover amortization, 
this 
results 
in 
higher 
annual 
financing 
needs 
of 
about 
of 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
over 
the 
base 
case. 
High 
financing 
needs 
would 
increase the 
country’s 
risk, 
which 
would 
lead 
to 
higher 
interest 
rates 
and 
make 
new 
debt 
more costly.  Increased 
financing 
needs 
would 
also raise 
the 
debt 
stock. 
Although 
the 
government 
would 
still 
achieve 
its 
40 
percent 
debt-to-GDP 
target, 
this 
would 
be 
delayed 
by 
two to 
three 
years. 
Moreover, under 
this 
low 
oil 
price-lower 
growth 
scenario, 
the 
debt 
ratio 
would 
fail 
to 
decline 
by 
16 percentage 
points 
by 
2006, 
another 
benchmark 
of 
the 
Fiscal Law. 
Lower 
oil 
prices 
(assuming 
production 
remains 
the 
same) 
would 
put 
less 
money 
into 
the 
FEIREP 
and 
by 
2010 
the 
cumulative 
FEIREP 
debt 
buyback 
would 
be 
about 
44 
percent 
less 
than 
in 
the 
base 
case. 
In 
addition, 
if 
a 
key 
fiscal 
constraint introduced 
by 
the 
Law 
of 
65 
Page  74
Fiscal 
responsibility 
is 
relaxed, 
and 
expenditures 
grew 
a 
real 
3.5 
percent 
per 
year, 
this 
would 
result 
in 
an 
additional 
financing 
need 
of 
US$600 
million 
during 
2004-10. 
CONCLUSIONS 
By 
tightening 
the 
fiscal 
stance 
now, 
Ecuador 
stands 
to 
achieve considerable gains 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Furthermore, 
given 
the 
volatility 
of 
oil 
prices, the 
more fiscal 
space 
the government can 
create, 
the better 
it 
will 
be 
able 
to 
deal 
with 
external 
shocks. 
Moreover, 
the 
private 
sector 
would 
also 
benefit 
from 
the 
spillover 
effects 
of 
a 
more credible 
and 
fiscally 
prudent 
fiscal 
management. 
Interest 
rates, 
currently very 
high 
for 
a 
dollarized 
economy, 
would 
come 
down 
and 
help 
boost 
investment 
and 
improve 
competitiveness. 
Although 
Ecuador’s 
debt targets 
set 
up 
in 
the 
Fiscal 
Law 
are achievable, 
they 
are 
insufficient 
given 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
a 
dollarized 
economy. 
While 
the 
law 
caps 
the debt 
ratio 
at 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
the 
government 
should 
strive 
to 
bring 
down 
this 
ratio 
even 
further, 
lowering 
the 
country’s 
risk 
premia 
and interest 
rates, 
which 
will 
be 
key 
to 
keeping 
the 
country competitive. 
From 
our 
analysis, 
lowering 
the 
debt 
ratio would be 
feasible, 
and Ecuador 
could 
bring 
its 
ratio 
down 
to 
30 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2008. 
Moreover, 
beyond reducing 
its 
debt 
ratio, 
the country 
also 
has 
to 
develop the 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
better 
manage 
and 
direct 
its 
debt 
portfolio,

A 
Poverty 
Profile 
for 
Ecuador 
Trends 
in 
Poverty 
in 
Ecuador 
Although 
the 
sources 
of 
information 
are 
not 
always 
strictly 
comparable 
(especially 
in 
terms 
of 
income and 
consumption), 
there 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
a 
continuous 
reduction 
in 
poverty between 
1990 
and 
1997,  serious 
increases 
in 
poverty 
rates 
during 
the 
1998-99 
crisis,  and 
a 
partial 
recovery 
in 
the 
2000s. 
In 
Ecuador 
there 
are  a 
number 
of 
primary 
surveys 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
distribution 
of 
poverty 
and 
how 
it 
has 
changed 
over 
time. 
First, 
calculations 
of 
poverty 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
consumption 
can 
be 
based 
on 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Surveys 
(ECVs) 
of 
1995, 1998, 
and 1999 (the 
next 
ECV 
is 
planned 
for 
2003). 
These surveys 
cover 
both rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
Table A.6.1 
shows 
clear 
increases 
in 
poverty 
and 
extreme 
poverty 
as 
measured 
by 
consumption 
during 
1995-98, 
and 
again 
during 
1998-99. 
During 
1995-99 
the 
number 
of 
poor 
people 
increased 
by 
65 
percent, 
while 
the 
poverty 
gap 
and 
the  severity 
of 
poverty 
also  increased 
significantly, 
in 
both 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas.

--------- 
As 
for 
poverty 
measured 
by 
income, 
calculations 
can 
be 
based 
on 
two 
sources, 
the 
first 
of 
which 
is 
the 
Urban 
Survey 
on 
Employment, Underemployment 
and 
Unemployment. 
This 
survey 
has 
been 
carried out 
annually 
since 1987. 
Until 
1999 
it 
covered 
only 
urban 
areas, 
but 
since 
2000 
it 
has 
covered 
both 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas. 
In 
addition, 
since 
March 
1998, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
has 
been 
carrying 
out 
a 
monthly 
survey 
of 
employment 
in 
the 
three 
main 
cities 
in 
the 
country 
(Cuenca, 
Guayaquil,  and 
Quito). 
Measuring 
poverty 
by 
income 
has 
serious  disadvantages 
compared 
to 
measuring 
it 
by 
consumption: 
in 
general, 
income 
fluctuates 
cyclically 
(especially 
in 
rural 
areas) 
and 
is 
more 
subject 
to 
errors 
in 
measurement. 
In 
Ecuador, however, the 
measurement 
of poverty 
by 
income 
is 
essential 
in 
order 
to 
trace trends 
in 
poverty 
since 1999. 
To 
calculate 
poverty 
by 
income, 
the 
Sistema 
Integrado 
de 
Indicadores 
Sociales  del 
Ecuador 
(Integrated System 
of 
Ecuadorian 
Social 
Indicators,  SIISE) 
has 
set 
the 
poverty 
line 
at 
US$2 
per 
person 
per 
day. 
The 
advantage 
of 
this 
is 
that 
it 
facilitates 
comparisons 
with 
other 
countries. 
Figure 
A.6.1, 
based 
on 
the 
Urban 
Surveys 
on 
Employment, Underemployment 
and 
68 
Page  77
Unemployment, 
shows 
a clear 
reduction 
in 
poverty 
during 
1990-97, 
a 
sharp 
increase 
in 
1998 
and 
1999, 
and 
a 
drop 
since 
then 
(though 
not 
to 
pre-1997 
rates). 
Figure 
A.6.2, based 
on 
Central 
Bank 
surveys, 
shows a 
similar 
trend, 
with 
increases 
in 
poverty 
between 
July 
1998 
and July 
2000, and 
falling 
since 
then. 
Finally, Figure 
A.7.3 
shows 
that 
the 
drop 
in 
poverty 
measured 
by 
income 
between 
2000 
and 2001 
has 
affected 
both 
the 
country 
and 
the 
cities.

Ecuador 
and 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
The 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
are 
a 
set 
of 
goals adopted 
by 
the 
international 
community 
to 
be 
met 
by 
2015. 
These goals 
cover poverty, 
malnutrition, 
mother-child 
health 
care, 
education, 
gender 
equality, 
and 
environmental sustainability. 
Although 
no 
information 
exists 
on which 
to 
base 
forecasts 
for 
all 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
for 
Ecuador, 
estimates 
of 
econometric 
models 
based 
on 
reasonable 
suppositions can 
be 
made 
to 
predict 
some 
welfare indicators. 
A 
calculation 
based 
on 
2.7 
percent 
annual 
growth 
in 
GDP 
(the basic 
World 
Bank 
scenario) shows 
that Ecuador 
would “likely” 
reach 
its 
goals 
in 
primary 
education (100 
percent coverage) 
and 
69 
Page  78
malnutrition 
(50 
percent reduction); 
would 
“possibly”  reach 
its 
goals 
in 
mortality 
among 
infants 
and 
children 
under 
5 
years 
of 
age 
(66 
percent reduction), 
and sanitation 
(50 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
population without 
access 
to 
potable 
water); 
and 
would 
“very 
unlikely” 
reach 
its 
poverty- 
reduction 
goals 
(50 
percent 
reduction 
in 
poverty 
and extreme 
poverty). 
The likelihood 
of 
meeting 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
is 
very 
closely 
linked 
to 
the 
rate 
of 
GDP 
growth. 
Table 
A.6.2 
shows the 
predicted 
changes 
in 
two 
health 
indicators (infant 
mortality 
and 
mortality 
among 
children 
under 
5 
years 
of 
age), 
two 
education  indicators 
(the 
illiteracy 
rate 
and 
the 
net 
rate 
of 
secondary education), and 
an 
indicator 
of 
monetary 
poverty 
(the 
percentage 
of 
people 
whose 
income 
is 
below 
the 
poverty line) 
in 
three scenarios 
corresponding 
to 
GDP 
growth 
rates 
of 
2,4, 
and 
6 
percent. 
The 
table 
shows 
that 
all 
welfare 
indicators-particularly 
the 
poverty 
rate-are 
very 
sensitive 
to 
the rate 
of 
economic 
growth. 
It 
is 
abundantly clear 
that 
Ecuador 
needs 
high 
rates 
of 
sustained 
growth 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
in 
its 
various 
manifestations.

Labor 
Markets 
in 
Ecuador 
Ecuador’s 
labor 
market 
was 
characterized 
by 
a tenuous 
creation 
of 
employment 
in 
the 
formal 
sector 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
notable deterioration 
in 
most 
of 
the 
indicators 
during 
the  1998 crisis, 
followed 
by 
a 
very 
timid 
recovery  after 
1999. 
This 
is 
nonnegligible given 
that 
emigration 
increased 
noticeably 
after 
1998 
(approximately 
200,000 
people 
have 
emigrated 
during 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
doubling 
the 
number 
of 
Ecuadorians 
who 
live 
and 
work 
outside the country). 
This 
probably 
relieved 
the pressure 
on 
the 
labor 
market. 
In 
fact, 
official 
calculations submitted 
by 
the 
Sistema 
lntegrado 
de Indicadores 
Sociales 
del 
Ecuador 
(Integrated System 
of 
Ecuadorian 
Social 
Indicators, 
SIISE) 
indicate 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
unemployment 
might 
be 
between 
0.5 
and 
2 
points 
higher 
than 
the 
current 
percentage 
if 
all 
these 
people 
had 
not 
emigrated. 
The 
data 
on 
real 
earnings are 
more confusing 
in 
that  they  depend 
on 
assumptions 
regarding 
inflation. 
Calculations 
according 
to 
the 
latest 
revision 
submitted 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Ecuador 
show that 
real labor 
income 
increased 
an 
average 
of 
20 
percent 
during 
the 
2000s. 
The 
increases 
were 
higher than 
average 
for 
the 
informal 
sector 
and 
among employers and 
independent workers, 
and 
lower 
than 
average 
for 
the 
formal 
sector and 
for 
salaried workers. 
Similarly, 
we 
can 
see 
deficient 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
employment and 
a 
significant recovery 
in 
terms 
of 
real 
earnings 
since 
the 
1998 
crisis, 
with 
potential 
effects 
on 
competitiveness 
to 
the 
point 
that 
it 
does 
not 
reflect 
true 
changes 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
labor 
force. 
Problems 
in 
the 
Private 
Market 
In 
this 
context 
of 
limited 
creation 
of 
employment 
in 
the 
formal 
sector 
and 
positive 
growth 
in 
real 
earnings, 
two 
aspects 
stand 
out 
that 
merit 
greater attention. 
First, 
salary 
negotiation 
is 
a 
complex 
process 
for 
Ecuador, 
both 
because 
it 
involves many 
agents 
who 
negotiate 
at 
different 
levels 
and 
times 
and 
because, 
until 
recently, salaries represented 
only 
part, 
and 
sometimes a 
very 
small 
part, 
of 
what 
workers 
received 
because 
the 
rest consisted 
of 
supplements 
and 
allowances. 
Second, 
formal 
employment 
has 
over 
the 
last 
10 
years 
been 
subject 
to 
what 
is 
commonly 
called 
66 
outsourcing,” 
or 
the 
growing 
use 
of 
so-called “temporary 
employment 
agencies” 
through 
which 
temporary 
employees  are 
hired  to 
do 
permanent 
work, 
thus 
avoiding 
the  payment 
of 
the 
contractual 
obligations 
that 
a permanent 
employee entails. 
Congressional 
ratification 
of 
Ecuador’s 
Economic Transformation 
Law 
(also 
known 
as 
TROLE 
I) 
in 
2000 
sought 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
matters 
by 
simplifying 
pay 
policy 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
(“salary 
unification”) 
and 
introducing 
more 
flexible 
and 
modern 
hiring 
methods,  such 
as 
hourly 
and 
temporary 
contracts. 
The new 
Social 
Security 
Law 
also 
provided 
that 
all 
workers,  regardless 
of 
the nature 
of 
their 
contracts, 
must 
contribute 
to 
Social 
Security, 
thus 
equalizing 
to 
some 
extent the 
contractual obligations 
of 
“regular” 
workers and 
those 
hired 
through 
temporary 
agencies. 
Setting 
Salaries, 
Salary Unification, 
and 
Incentives 
for 
Creating 
Formal 
Jobs 
Salaries are 
set 
at three 
different 
levels: 
0 
The National 
Council 
on 
Salaries 
(CONADES) 
regulates 
the 
base salary 
and 
annual increases 
to 
it. 
When 
no 
agreement 
is 
reached 
between employers 
and workers’ 
representatives 
within 
the 
CONADES 
framework,  the 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
establishes 
an 
annual 
increase 
in 
the 
base 
salary equal 
to 
expected 
inflation 
in 
the 
upcoming 
year. 
Minimum 
salaries 
specific 
to 
each 
occupation (and 
thus 
the 
relative 
minimum 
salaries 
for 
each occupation) are established 
in 
each sector 
though 
fixed-salary 
programs 
called 
“sectoral 
tables” that 
employers and workers’ 
representatives 
renegotiate 
periodically. 
In 
the 
past, 
the 
tables 
had 
to 
be 
updated 
annually, 
but 
this 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
case. 
Except 
in 
the 
petroleum, 
0 
71 
Page  80
electricity, 
and 
telecommunications 
industries, 
the 
tables 
seem 
to 
be 
binding, 
that 
is, 
workers 
receive 
salaries 
according 
to 
the 
levels 
specified 
by 
the tables. 
Employers 
and workers’ 
representatives 
can 
agree 
on 
additional 
salary  increases 
through 
“collective 
agreements” 
by 
sector 
or 
by 
company. 
0 
The interaction 
between 
the tables and decisions made 
through 
CONADES 
and the 
agreements 
has 
multiple 
effects: 
0 
The 
tables, 
by 
setting 
relative 
salaries, 
have the 
ability 
to 
automatically 
transmit 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
minimum 
salary 
to 
the 
entire 
salary 
distribution. 
This 
situation 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
desirable. 
Although 
it 
may 
be 
considered reasonable 
to 
index 
the 
minimum 
salary 
according 
to 
inflation 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
buying 
power 
of 
those 
less 
favored 
by 
the distribution, 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
that 
this 
is 
the best 
method 
for 
all 
salary levels. 
The 
tables 
do 
not 
reflect 
differences 
in 
productivity 
between 
companies 
in 
a 
single 
sector 
and 
thus 
create  considerable  salary 
rigidity 
at 
a 
time  when 
dollarization 
has 
diminished 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
Ecuadorian 
companies. 
In 
addition, 
renegotiation 
could 
create 
a 
tool for 
unfair 
competition 
between large 
and 
small 
companies 
in 
the 
same 
sector, 
given 
that 
the 
former 
are 
more productive than 
the  latter, 
and 
have 
more decisionmaking 
power 
in 
the 
process. 
Increases 
in 
the 
minimum 
salary that 
are 
indexed 
to 
projected 
inflation 
are 
desirable 
in 
a 
period 
of 
rapidly 
declining inflation, 
but 
once 
prices 
stabilize 
they can 
cause 
inflationary 
pressures. 
This 
situation 
could 
be exacerbated 
by 
the 
fact 
that the 
agreement 
can propose 
additional 
salary 
increases 
and 
at  the 
same 
time 
follow 
what 
is 
stipulated 
by 
CONADES 
if 
the  economic 
conditions 
of 
the 
sector 
and 
of 
the company 
so 
require. 
0 
0 
In 
summary, 
the 
system 
seems 
too 
rigid, 
leaves 
little 
room 
for 
differences 
in 
productivity 
to 
be 
reflected 
in 
differences 
in 
salary, 
and 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
modify 
relative 
salaries 
between 
employees 
and 
companies. 
In 
this 
context,  Congress 
approved 
salary 
unification 
in 
2000 
(TROLE 
I). 
The 
law 
establishes 
that, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
13” 
and 
14” 
salaries, 
all 
existing 
allowances 
should 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
minimum 
salary, 
the 
purpose 
being 
to 
try 
to 
expand 
the 
tax 
base 
for 
Social 
Security  and  other  employment-related 
taxes  that  are 
traditionally 
paid 
exclusively 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
salaries. 
Given 
that 
in 
practice 
these changes 
will 
increase 
the cost 
of 
employment 
for 
employers, 
they 
will 
be 
implemented over 
five 
years, 
so 
that 
in 
each 
year 
during 
that 
period 
the 
base 
salary 
will 
incorporate 
20 
percent 
of 
all 
nonsalary 
components 
of 
the 
workers’ 
pay. 
The 
effective 
increase 
in 
labor 
costs, 
combined 
with 
a 
somewhat 
rigid 
salary-setting  system 
(which 
will 
be 
still 
more 
rigid 
once 
the 
discretionary element 
involved 
in 
the 
special 
allowances 
disappears), 
may 
partially explain 
why 
the 
creation 
of 
formal 
employment 
has 
been 
limited 
since 
2000 
compared 
to 
the creation 
of 
informal 
employment. 
Outsourcing 
and 
Flexibility 
in 
the 
Labor 
Market 
Since the 
emergence 
of 
temporary 
employment 
agencies, 
employers 
have 
made 
extensive 
use 
of 
them, 
far 
beyond 
their 
cyclical 
needs, 
as 
some 
companies  are 
now 
operating 
exclusively 
with 
“temporary 
workers.” 
The 
result 
of 
this 
situation 
is 
that  the  country 
now 
has  some 
2,000 
temporary employment 
agencies 
employing 
approximately 
10,000 
workers, that 
is, 
between 
5 
and 
10 
percent 
of 
formally 
employed 
 worker^.^

Preliminary 
data 
obtained 
from 
Ecuador’s 
representative 
to 
the 
International Labour 
Office. 
To 
date, 
Ecuador 
has 
no reliable 
and systematic 
sources 
on 
information 
on 
outsourcing. 
72 
Page  81
Termination 
costs 
in 
Ecuador 
are 
similar 
to 
those 
in 
Peru, 
Bolivia, 
and 
Colombia 
(approximately 
equal 
to 
3.5 
to 
4 
months 
of 
average 
monthly 
salary), 
but 
much 
higher 
than 
termination 
costs 
in 
other  countries 
in 
the 
region 
such 
as 
Argentina, 
Paraguay, 
and 
Uruguay 
(2 
to 
2.5 
months 
of 
average 
monthly 
salary), 
most 
European 
countries,  and the 
United 
States. 
This 
suggests 
that 
these 
costs 
may 
be part 
of 
the reason 
why 
temporary 
employment 
agencies 
are 
popular. 
Another 
reason 
why 
companies 
use 
temporary  employment 
agencies 
seems 
to 
be 
in 
order 
to 
avoid paying 
employees the 
profit 
sharing 
that 
is 
due 
to 
them 
by 
law 
(employers 
are 
obligated 
by 
law 
to 
pay 
workers 
up 
to 
15 
percent 
of 
all 
company 
profits). 
Although 
all 
workers 
are 
entitled 
to 
this, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
they 
are 
temporary 
or 
permanent, the 
threat 
of 
losing 
work 
is 
enough 
to 
keep 
the demands 
of 
temporary workers 
to 
a 
minimum. 
This 
in 
turn 
explains 
why 
outsourcing 
did 
not 
decrease 
despite the 
introduction 
of 
hourly 
and 
temporary 
contracts 
in 
2000 
(although 
companies 
are 
allowed 
to 
hire 
temporary 
employees 
for 
up 
to 
40 
percent 
of 
their 
total 
work 
force, 
regardless 
of 
the 
company’s 
type 
of 
activity). 
In 
addition,  temporary 
employees 
often 
receive 
salaries 
below 
the 
legal 
minimum 
and 
are 
completely denied 
special 
allowances. 
This 
could partially 
justify 
the 
increase 
noted 
in 
invisible 
underemployment. 
Finally, 
the 
fear 
is 
that 
outsourcing 
has 
contributed 
to 
a general 
deterioration 
of 
relations between 
employers  and 
employees, 
and 
to 
the 
decrease 
in 
training 
plans 
and other 
types 
of 
company 
investments 
in 
human 
capital, 
although 
once again the 
quantitative 
data are 
limited. 
The 
second 
situation 
could 
have 
serious 
consequences 
in 
an 
era 
when technology and 
skills 
complement 
each 
other and 
when 
growth 
in 
productivity 
seems 
to 
depend 
more 
on 
the 
simultaneous 
accumulation 
of 
both 
factors 
rather than 
the replacement 
of 
one 
by 
the other. 
In 
sum, 
although outsourcing 
has 
prevented 
later 
increases 
in 
informal 
employment, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
does 
not 
have 
had 
the 
principal 
characteristics 
of 
formal 
employment: 
the 
right 
of 
workers 
to 
a 
minimum 
salary 
and 
some 
type 
of 
protection,  and 
the 
right 
to 
join 
unions and 
receive 
appropriate 
training.

Compiled 
with 
data 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Finance. 
The 
Wage 
Bill. 
Although public 
employment 
increased 
only 
modestly 
from 
1998 
to 
2002, 
the government 
wage 
bill 
fluctuated dramatically 
over 
the 
same 
period.  Rampant 
inflation 
produced 
a 
sharp 
decline 
(more 
than 
70 
percent!) 
in 
the 
real 
value 
of 
base 
wages 
during 
1997- 
99.8 
Following 
dollarization 
in 
2000, 
the 
deterioration 
in 
real 
wages 
was 
halted, 
and 
was 
reversed 
through 
significant 
wage 
increases 
in 
March 
and 
May 
of 
that 
year, 
plus 
a 
50 
percent 
increase at 
the 
start 
of 2002. 
These 
increases 
in 
base 
wages 
were 
not 
excessive 
considering 
the 
prior 
decline 
in 
real 
purchasing 
power.g 
However, 
base 
wages are 
merely 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
wage 
story 
in 
Ecuador. 
A 
multitude 
of 
monetary  allowances have been 
added 
over the 
years, 
such 
that an 
employee’s  salary 
may include 
from 
20 
and 
30 
separate 
items. 
Table 
A.8.3 
shows 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
base 
pay 
and 
allowances 
for 
a sample 
of 
six 
government ministries/departments 
for 
which 
we 
have 
fairly 
reliable 
data. 
In 
each 
of 
these, 
base 
wages 
account 
for 
less 
than 
one-quarter 
of 
the 
government’s 
personnel 
expenditures. 
The 
lion’s 
share 
of 
expenditures 
is 
accounted 
for 
by 
7 
The 
other 
eight 
are 
lawyers, 
managers, 
architects,  economists, 
civil 
engineers, 
chemical 
engineers, 
geological 
engineers, 
and 
journalists. 
While 
doctors enjoy their 
own 
pay 
scale, 
the 
remaining eight 
share 
a 
common 
pay 
and 
grading 
system.

Sucre/US$ exchange rates 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank’s 
Boletin 
Anuario 
No. 
24, 2002, 
p. 
154. 
Even 
as 
Ecuador’s 
GDP 
fell by 
more 
than 
5 
percent 
during 
1998-2000, 
the 
Central Government’s 
personnel 
expenditures 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
shrank 
from 
7.7 
percent 
to 
5.2 
percent.

Even 
after 
the 
2000 
increases, 
civil 
servants’ 
base 
salaries 
were 
equivalent 
to 
only 
one-half their 
1997 
value 
for 
those at 
the 
bottom 
on 
the salary 
scale, 
and 
just 
one-third 
for 
those 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
scale.

pagos complementarias 
(for 
example, 
decimotercer 
salario, 
various 
bonificaciones). 
And 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Livestock, 
increases 
in 
the 
total 
ministry/department 
wage 
bill 
during 
2001-02 
far 
exceed 
the percent increase 
in 
base wages. 
The 
Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
the Proposed 
Reform 
Law 
It 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
calculate the 
cost 
of 
salary 
unification.  The 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
estimated 
that 
it 
would 
cost 
US$240 
million 
to 
bring 
all 
public 
employees 
under 
the 
new 
pay 
scale. 
That 
is 
twice 
the 
estimate produced 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Finance 
of 
what 
it 
would 
cost 
to 
bring 
all 
public 
employees 
under the 
existing 
14-grade 
pay 
scale." 
Three factors 
will 
determine 
the 
final 
cost: 
e 
The 
actual 
monthly 
wages 
received 
by 
employees 
in 
a 
ministry 
or 
department 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
salary 
unification. 
The 
real 
wage increase 
will 
be 
considerably 
less 
than 
the 
difference 
between 
the present 
and 
future 
wage 
scales, 
because 
the 
state 
is 
already 
paying 
salaries 
well 
above 
the current 
base 
wage due 
to 
accumulated allowances. 
If 
an 
employee 
already 
receives 
a 
higher 
monthly 
wage 
(including 
allowances) 
than he 
or 
she 
is 
entitled 
to 
under 
the 
new 
pay 
scale, 
that 
individual 
will 
not 
receive 
any wage increase whatsoever." 
Many 
employees 
will 
be 
reclassfled 
in 
the 
course 
of 
salary 
unflcation, 
but 
the 
question 
is 
how  many 
and 
to 
what 
levels. 
Staff 
whose 
qualifications and 
job 
activities 
are 
not 
consistent 
with 
their 
current post 
will 
be 
downgraded, 
or 
upgraded 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be. 
It 
would 
be 
too 
painful 
politically 
and 
administratively 
to 
reduce 
their 
salaries, 
as 
well. 
But 
these 
employees 
would 
have 
their 
wages 
frozen 
until 
the 
job 
they 
are 
performing 
is 
entitled 
to 
a 
wage 
increase  above 
their 
current 
level. 
OSCIDI 
estimates 
that 
in 
the 
ministries 
and departments 
they have 
restructured, 
nearly 
half 
of 
the 
employees 
in 
those 
institutions 
were reclassified. 
The number 
of 
employees 
who 
are not 
needed 
to 
perform 
the 
department's 
functions 
who 
can 
be 
dismissed 
with 
an 
indemnity  payment. 
How 
many 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
the 
maximum 
indemnity 
of 
US$lO,OOO? 
How 
many one-time 
indemnity 
payments can 
the 
state 
afford 
in 
the short 
term 
to 
reduce 
its 
long-term 
obligations? 
e 
e 
The 
law 
should 
aim 
to 
be 
fiscally neutral 
in 
the 
short term, 
while holding 
out 
the prospect 
for 
modest 
but 
real 
reductions 
in 
the 
wage 
bill 
over 
the 
medium 
and 
long 
term. 
The 
potential 
for 
savings 
through staff 
reductions 
(to 
mitigate 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the wage 
increase) 
and 
efficiency 
gains 
through 
reassignment are considerable.  Conversely, 
the cost 
of 
inaction 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
high. 
10. 
11. 
Memorando 
No. 
SIP-DM-2002-236. 
The 
precise 
estimate 
was 
US$119.9 
million. 
The  draft 
law 
recognizes that 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
legally  or 
politically  to 
reduce 
a current 
employee's 
salary. 
Thus, 
the 
new 
base 
wage 
will 
be 
calculated 
by 
dividing all 
the 
payments 
an 
employee receives (except 
for 
the 
13th 
salary, 
14th 
salary, 
length 
of 
service 
bonus, 
and 
a 
bonus 
for 
relevant 
academic 
degrees) 
by 
12 to arrive 
at 
his 
or 
her 
new 
base 
wage.
