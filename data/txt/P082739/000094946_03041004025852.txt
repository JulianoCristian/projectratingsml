I. Country and Sector Background
1.     Since its return to democracy in 1979, Ecuador has been characterized by higil external
vulnerability, weak macroeconiomic performance, and poor governaice. Successive external
shocks-tied to reductions in petroleum prices or wide fluctuationis in the coulitry's capital flows
as in 1998-and natural disasters have been combined with poor macroeconiomic management
reflected in higih fiscal deficits and public accumulation of exterinal debt These developments
have often been accompaniied by very higih rates of inflationl and foreign exchanige instability,
leading the country to four severe recessions-1982-83, 1987, 1989, and 1998-99; three
hyperinflationary periods-1983, 1988-1993, and 1999-2000; various episodes of payment
moratoriulims; and recent twin exchanige rate and bankinig crises that led to dollarization and
destroyed 20 banks holdinig 50 percent of bank deposits Misguided policies were also the result
of unstable govermilenit administrationis and poor governanice. For instanice, in 23 years, Ecuador
had 29 finance ministers whio remained in office an average of less thani 10 months, and it was
perceived as the Latin American counitry with the least control over corruption.

2.     The twin crises of 1998-99 had a devastating effect on the poor. During 1995-99, the
number of poor people grew by more thani 2 millionl and the headcoiint poverty index nearly
doubled from 34 to 56 percent of the population. Similarly, the number of people living In
extreme poverty (income insufficient to cover a basic basket) increased from 12 to 21 percent
(Annex 6). The crises hit rural areas most severely, especially those in the highlands, where the
poverty rate increased by 7 percentage points durinig 1998-99 alone These indicators reveal the
depth of the crises and the greater vulnerability of the rural-mostly indigenious-poor in dealing
with their income losses  The crises also led to emigration of more than 300,000 people-3
percent of the labor force-since 1997, making the counltry a significant recipient of family
remittances, although at the price of eroding the country's hiuman capital, and its rural social
capital
3.     Ecuador- dollarized not by choice but as a last-resort for dealing with its twin crises that
occurred in 1999. The country did not meet the preconditions for successful dollarization,
including a solid fiscal position, a sustainable public debt, a diversified export structure to
accommodate trade shocks , a sufficient level of international reserves to accommodate capital
outflows, a sound and competitive banking system, flexible factor markets-particularly labor
and real estate-to preserve the competitiveness of the nontradable goods sector, and a climate to
attract investment Despite these impediments, dollarization allowed Ecuador to achieve critical
objectives in the short term: it uLIveiled the serious fiscal, real, and financial imbalances that
plagued its economy in the late 1990s; it brought down hyperiniflationi; and it helped to restore
confidence in the banking system.
4.     Ecuador is at a turning point. Its stability and economic recovery are promising, but its
fiscal and external positions remain vulnierable. These vulnerabilities are due to its rigid response
to real or financial external shocks-typical of dollarized economies with only fiscal policy as an
instrument-in a context of highly volatile and oil-dependent fiscal revenues, expansionary
spending policies, and heavy external indebtediness that have resulted in declining fiscal surpluses
and high balance of paymenits deficits  For their part, the structural reforms that should
accompany dollarization are either absent or inconclusive. Fiscal adjustment is among those
inconclusive ones, as is the strengtheninig of the finanicial system, while the promotion of private
investment In the petroleum sector remains absent. Other reforms that have not been carried out
include trade reform, and deepeninlg competitiveniess and private infrastructure
II. Objectives
5.     The FCCGL is the Bank's initial response to the new Government's commitment to
correct an unlsustainiable fiscal position and achieve high growth for poverty reduction. The
comprehensive Multiyear Governmniet's Program to be supported by the FCCGL has two pillars:
(a) fiscal consolidation with social expenditure protection, and (b) faster growth with improved
competitiveniess Specific objectives of the loan are to (a) improve tax policy and adminlstration,
(b) reverse expansioniary spendinig and improve budget transparency, (c) regain control of the
public payroll, (d) clear arrears and improve public debt management, (e) support trade reform,
(f) promote competitive pricing and regulatory policies, and (g) increase labor flexibility These
objectives are complemenited by a parallel programm1latic operation in the social sectors
6      To reach these objectives, this operation will address fiscal consolidation, social spendinig
protection, and faster growth with competitiveness. Initially the following componenits are
considered: overall fiscal framework, revenue maniagemenit, public expenditure management,

fiscal equilibrium and decentralization, and public debt Next, the followilg componelnts will
nclude  competition/trade policies, and pricing/regulatory policies of basic infrastructure
services
7.     The FCCGL is not intended to deal exhaustively with all areas where action could
improve Ecuador's fiscal and competitive outlook.  Rather, it is conceived as a first-step
packaged that will enable Ecuador to focus on stabilizing fiscal programs leading to a strong and
competitive public finance.
Ill. Environmental Aspects
8.     This Program does not trigger OD 8.60 on Environmenltal Assessment since it is
structural adjustment loan. Therefore, an environmliental rating is not required.
