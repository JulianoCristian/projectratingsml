The main objectives are to\n            bring fiscal sustainability, reinitiate structural reforms\n            to provide a sustained recovery with enhanced\n            competitiveness, and mitigate the impact of adjustment on\n            priority social investment that protects vulnerable groups.\n            This fiscal support will help solve the severe short-term\n            liquidity problem, and create fiscal room for smoothing the\n            social costs of adjustment.  The loan is based on structural\n            reform measures that have been implemented by the Government\n            prior to Board presentation.  The project covers two areas:\n            fiscal consolidation, and faster growth with\n            competitiveness.  Under the first area, the following\n            components are considered: overall fiscal framework, revenue\n            management, public expenditure management, public payroll\n            control, and public debt.  Under the second area, the\n            following components are included: competition and trade\n            policies, pricing and regulatory policies of basic\n            infrastructure services for growth, and labor market flexibility."}, "docdt": "2003-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
