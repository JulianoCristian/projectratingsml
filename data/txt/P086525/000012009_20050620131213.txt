Description  Brazil has two main retirement systems that operate on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
             basis: a system for private sector workers (RGPS) and a system for public sector
             workers at the federal and subnational levels o f government (RPPS). Duringthe
             1990s the country experienced a rapid increase in pension expenditures and
             deficits, caused by generous benefits and lax eligibility criteria that were
             introduced to a large extent by the 1988 Constitution. These pension deficits
             contributed to large fiscal deficits and a rapid build up o f public debt in the
             1990s.     A crisis in 1998-1999 prompted the Government to initiate a
             comprehensive program o f fiscal reforms, designed to ensure fiscal and
             macroeconomic stability and improve the efficiency of taxes and expenditures.
             These fiscal reforms have included major reforms to the RGPS, the RPPS, and
             also to the voluntary private pension pillar.

             The first two major pension reforms took place in 1998 and 1999, through
             Constitutional Amendment No. 20 and Law 9876. These early reforms removed
             the generous RGPS formula from the Constitution and introduced a number o f
             changes to the two regimes, including minimum vesting and age requirements
             for public sector workers, and a new benefit formula and benefit ceiling for
             private sector workers. These two reforms halved the projected long-run deficit
             o f the RGPS, from 12 to about 6 percent o f GDP in2050. The long-run deficit
             o fthe RPPS was also reduced, although by a smaller amount.

             The third major reform took place in December 2003, through Constitutional
             Amendment No. 41, introducing several important changes to the RPPS that
             imply a greater harmonization with the stricter rules and conditions in the
             RGPS. The reform to the RPPS includes stricter retirement rules, new old age
             and survivor benefit formulas, a new indexation formula, and an 11 percent
             contribution on all benefits.      The reform introduces particularly stringent
             conditions on new civil servants hired after December 2003 and civil servants
            who do not meet the new eligibility criteria.       These employees will have to
             either postpone retirement or accept heavy penalties. The reform will arrest the


                                            i

growth of RPPS expenditures and deficits, generate some savings over the next
decade, and reduce significantly the net present value o f RPPS imbalances,
especially at the level of states andmunicipalities.

The reform also includes the possibility for federal and subnational governments
to impose a benefit ceiling on public sector retirees equal to the RGPS ceiling,
provided that they create a complementary pension fund for the new civil
servants or workers who do not comply with the new rules. To avoid future
pension liabilities associated with the new complementary funds, the
Government has drafted a law on the new complementary funds that stipulates
that these funds have to operate on a defined contribution basis, will be subject
to the same regulatory framework as all pension funds, and should have sound
mechanisms for addressing risks such as morbidity, longevity, and investment
risks. The draft law should be submitted to Congress in2005.

The Government is aware that the pension system will need further reforms,
especially the RGPS. However, the Government believes that it does not have
the conditions to propose another major reform to the Brazilian society and
Congress in the short-run, especially considering that a major reform has just
been passed and that every major reform requires a Constitutional Amendment
approved by a three fifths majority in Congress. For this reason, the
Government's strategy entails in the first stage comprehensive administrative
reforms to the RGPS, designed to reduce deficits by eliminating inefficiencies
and fraud.     These administrative reforms include the creation o f a new
Secretariat for Social Security Revenues with expanded powers, the introduction
o f a risk-based management system, and the recertification o f old age
pensioners. These reforms should be fully implementedduring2005 and 2006.

The Government also plans to implement a comprehensive reform to the
disability scheme in 2006, in order to contain the growth o f disability-related
expenditures. The Government has already taken the first steps, by approving a
national program for health and safety at the workplace. This program, which
will also be fully implementedin2006, will address the highincidence o f work
injuries, believed to be an important cause o f the recent increase in disability-
related expenditures. However, the Government i s aware o f the need to design
and implement a more comprehensive reform o f the disability scheme, and i s
initiating a full diagnosis o f the disability programs, in order to be able to
implement a well-designed reform during2006.

In addition to the recent reforms to the RPPS and the initial steps to reform
further the RGPS, the Government has also strengthened the regulatory
framework o f the voluntary private pension system and expanded coverage.
This effort is being made on the recognition that the RGPS and RPPS reforms
will entail reductions in benefits, and that workers must have access to sound
complementary schemes o f retirement income. The voluntary pillar comprises
closed (occupational) and open pension funds, and i s dominated by the closed
pension funds, which manage assets of about 17percent o f GDP.


                                 11

           The regulatory framework for the closed pension funds has been substantially
           strengthened in the past years, through Laws 108 and 109 enacted in 2001, and
           several secondary regulations, including a landmark regulation issued in 2004
           that strengthens the corporate governance o f pension funds. In 2004 the
           Government also removed severe tax distortions and introduced an EET tax
           regime that exempts contributions and investment income and taxes benefits.
           This regime is followed in most OECD countries and should contribute to the
           expansion o f coverage. The authorization in 2004 o f the first pension hnds
           sponsored by professional associations and operating on a defined contribution
           basis should also contribute to an expansion o f coverage. Finally, in early 2005
           the Government submitted a draft law to Congress that creates a new
           autonomous pension supervision agency, charged with the supervision o f the
           whole occupational pension system, including the new hnds for civil servants.

           The Bank has supported the fiscal reforms o f the Brazilian Government through
           five development policy loans. The first three loans were special loans prepared
           at the end o f the 1990s in a situation o f crisis.    They included two loans
           supporting the 1998 and 1999 pension reforms and one loan supporting the
           reform o f the state finances and the public administration reform. The last two
           loans were programmatic loans supporting fiscal reforms outside the pension
           area, including the approval o f the keyLaw o f Fiscal Responsibility.

           The proposed loan would support the recent round o fpensionreforms and plays
           an important role in the Country Assistance Strategy endorsed by the Board in
           December 2003. The proposed loan i s considered to be part o f the cluster o f
           fiscal reform loans, but will be the first programmatic fiscal reform loan
           dedicated to social security reform.       The loan would include three main
           components: (i)    the December 2003 reform to the RPPS; (iii)initiation o f
           comprehensive administrative reforms to the RGPS, including the recertification
           of pensioners, and initiation o f disability reform through approval o f National
           Program o f Health and Safety at the Workplace; (iii)improvements in the
           regulatory and supervisory framework for private pension funds, including the
           creation o f an autonomous pension supervision agency.

Benefits   The reform to the pension system for public sector workers (RPPS) supported
           by the proposed operation will arrest the growth o f RPPS pension expenditures
           and deficits, generate some fiscal savings during the next decade, and will
           reduce significantly the net present value o f future RPPS deficits, especially at
           the level o f states and municipalities. Therefore, the reform will contribute
           significantly to long-run fiscal andmacroeconomic stability.

           The reform to the RPPS will also have a positive impact on the reduction o f
           poverty and income inequalities.        First the reform does not affect the
           redistributive components of the Brazilian pension system, which are in the
           RGPS, not the RPPS. Second, all the components o f the RPPS reform were
           designed so as to protect lower income public sector pensioners.        Third, by


                                          111
                                          ...

           arresting the growthof pension expenditures and deficits inthe RPPS, caused in
           good part by generous benefits, the reform will prevent a compression o f
           expenditures in areas with much greater impact on poverty and inequality
           reduction and growth, such as education, health, basic infrastructure and well-
           targeted social programs.      Fourth, by generating some savings in the first
           decade, the reform will open some room for a relocationo f expenditures to these
           areas, or for an increase inthe primary surplus and a reductioninpublic debt.

           The reforms to the voluntary pension system will also generate important
           benefits, as the private system will play an increasing role in retirement
           provision. By strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for
           private pension funds these reforms will reduce the risk o f further fiscal
           liabilities to the Government while also contributing to an expansion o f
           coverage, improving the welfare of a growingnumber ofBrazilian workers.

Risks      The major risks related to Government reforms and the proposed loan include
           the following: (i)   continued high growth o f disability expenditures; (ii)     high
           Government expenditures with the complementary pension funds o f civil
           servants, due to large contributions or substantial retention o f actuarial risk; (iii)
           retroactive changes to the December 2003 reform.

           These risks are either modest or are being mitigated by appropriate policies.
           The risk o f further increases in disability expenditures is significant, but being
           mitigated by the first reform steps, and a more comprehensive reform plm'ed
           for 2006. The risk o f fiscal imbalances due to large expenditures with the
           complementary funds i s moderate, because Government contributions will only
           apply to the portion of wages above the ceiling, and because the risk o f
           contingent fiscal liabilities arising from the absorption of actuarial risks i s being
           mitigated by the creation o f the new autonomous supervision agency, and the
           Government plans to strengthenfundingrules o fpension funds.

           The risk o fretroactive changes to the December 2003 reform exists because o f a
           proposal in Congress to soften some o f its components, especially the transition
           rules for retirement. The proposed changes could weaken the projected short-
           and medium-term savings for the federal government by up to 20 percent.
           However, some o f the proposals could have positive savings effects inthe short-
           and medium-runs for subnational governments. Inthe long-run, the effect o f the
           proposed changes would be mostly negative, but this i s also the time when
           major savings of the December 2003 reform should be delivered. Overall, the
           risk of a major reversal o f the December 2003 reform i s considered moderate,
           because the changes that are likely to be passed will not dilute the impact o f the
           reform ina substantive way, especially inthe longer-term.

                     IBRD PROGRAMDOCUMENT FORA PROPOSED
     PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL REFORMLOAN- SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
                                            TO BRAZIL

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Duringthe 1990s Brazil's pension system sufferedfrom large and increasing imbalances,
as indicated by the sharp increase in pension expenditures and deficits-pension         expenditures
increased from 4 to 11percent o f GDP, whereas pension deficits increased from 1-2 to 5 percent
o f GDP duringthe decade. Both expenditures and deficits have continued to increase since 2000,
although at a smaller pace-to        11.7 and 5.5 percent o f GDP in 2004, respectively.         The
emergence o f large imbalances inthe pensionsystem inthe 1990swas due to a good extent to the
1988 Constitution, which expandedhrther benefits and relaxed further eligibility requirements,
which were already generous by international standards.

2.      The expansion o f pension expenditures and deficits created increasing difficulties for the
achievement o f fiscal and macroeconomic equilibrium, and for the design o f sound development
andpoverty alleviation policies. These expenditures contributed to large fiscal imbalances at the
federal and sub-national levels and to a sharp increase in public debt during the decade-from
around 30 to 50 percent o f GDP. The large volume o f pension expenditures also reduced the
availability o f scarce fiscal resources for education, health, basic infrastructure, and other social
programs, and also contributed to a heavytax burden.

3.      Since 1999 the Brazilian Government has implemented several rounds o f fiscal reforms,
designed to restore fiscal and macroeconomic equilibrium, and to improve the efficiency and
social impact o f fiscal expenditures and revenues.       These fiscal reforms have included the
extensive restructuring o f sub-national debt followed by strict conditions on the management o f
sub-national finances, the introduction o f the Law on Fiscal Responsibility-a      legal landmark in
Brazil that has changed the way public officials behave and operate, several improvements inthe
public debt management framework, and initial tax reform measures.

4.      Pension reforms have proved more difficult to implement than other fiscal reforms, not
only because o f the well-known technical and political complexities involved (which exist in
every country), but also because inthe case o f Brazil most pension rights have been enshrined in
the Constitution. Therefore, major reforms require a Constitutional Amendment approved by a
three fifths majority in Congress to be implemented. Despite these difficulties, the process o f
fiscal reform has also included important pension reforms, both at the end o f the 1990sandinthe
past two years.

5.      The Bank has supported these fiscal reforms through policy lending and technical
assistance.   Policy loans have comprised three loans supporting fiscal reforms outside the
pension area, and two loans supporting pension reforms inthe late 1990s, particularly reforms to
the pension system for private sector workers. The first three policy loans were special loans
prepared in the late 1990s in a scenario o f crisis, and not classified formally as programmatic,
because this instrument had not been approved by the Board at that time. Since 2000 the Bank
has extended two programmatic loans, which have supported fiscal reforms outside the pension
area.



                                                  1

6.      The proposed Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan- Social SecurityReformwould support
primarily the reform to the pension system for public sector workers, introduced through
Constitutional Amendment no. 41 o f December 2003. One important component o f the reform
was legally challenged, but ultimately confirmed by a Supreme Court ruling in August 2004.
The proposed loan would also support initial steps to reform further the pension system for
private sector workers, and reforms to the complementary pension system (the voluntary pillar).
The reforms supported bythe proposed loan constitute important steps that will contribute to the
containment o f pension expendituresand deficits, and to the objectives o f the fiscal reforms that
the Bank has been supporting inrecent years. The proposed policy loan-and         the assistance to
pension reform more generally-also       plays a central role in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Brazil, endorsed bythe BoardinDecember 2003.

                                 11.     COUNTRYCONTEXT

                        A.     RecentEconomicDevelopmentsinBrazil
7.      Brazil started the decade after a successful adjustment from a crisis in the late 199Os,
caused by growing internal and external imbalances, rising levels o f debt, an overvalued
exchange rate, and a hostile external environment.        The adjustment included an impressive
turnaround of the primary fiscal balance by more than 3 percent o f GDP, the move to a floating
exchange rate regime, and the adoption o f inflation targeting by the Central Bank. The country
also had launched important reforms, including an impressivereform o f the finances o fBrazilian
states and municipalities, the approval o f the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility and the reform o f the
pension system for private sector workers.

8.      In2000 the country seemed to enjoy the first h i t s ofits stabilization and reform efforts,
as indicated by a GDP growth rate o f more than 4 percent, the returno f inflation to single digit
levels, despite a sharp devaluation o f the currency, a reduction inthe current account deficit, and
reductions inthe levels of internal and external indebtedness.

9.      These initial reform efforts proved insufficient to address the turmoil incapital markets in
2001 and2002, however, caused by the Argentine crisis, andmarket concerns about the course o f
economic policy following th'e possible victory o f candidate LuisLnhcio Lula da Silva inthe 2002
elections. The increasing uncertainty led to an interruption in capital flows, a sharp currency
depreciation, and the increase in borrowing spreads to more than 2,500 basis points. The
depreciation led in turn to an increase in the ratios o f external and public debt to GDP (a large
share o f public debt was denominated in foreign exchange), and pressed inflation again to two
digit levels.   The uncertainty also led to drops in investment and consumption and to a
deceleration ineconomic activity (Table 1).

10.     The current administration took office inJanuary 2003 and addressed the market turmoil
by demonstrating a strong commitment to fiscal and macroeconomic stability, and building
consensus for another long overdue pension reform and other structural reforms. As shown in
Table 1, the primary surplus o f the consolidatedpublic sector was increased further to 4.3 and 4.6
percent o f GDP in2003 and 2004, respectively, above the targets inthe budget, and inthe Stand-
by arrangement with the IMF, initiated in September 2002.            In December 2003 Congress
approved a reform to the pension system for public sector workers that improved further the
medium- and long-run fiscal scenarios. Other important reforms in 2004 included the approval
o f a new Bankruptcy Law and the Law on Public-Private Partnerships.

11.      The demonstrated commitment to fiscal and macroeconomic stability and to important
reforms restored credibility, resulting in a resumption of capital flows, a currency appreciation,
and a steady reduction inborrowing spreads to about 450 basis points. The strong fiscal policy,
the Central Bank's commitment to lower inflation targets, and the currency appreciation all
contributed to an effective decline in inflation to single digit levels in2004. As shown inTable
1, the increase in exports in 2003 and 2004 was spectacular, triggered in part by the real
depreciation, and resultedin a sharp improvement inthe external accounts. In2004 the trade and
current account surpluses reached 5.6 and 1.9 percent o f GDP, respectively, the largest surpluses
on record.

12.      The impressivegrowth o f exports also led the recovery o f economic activity inthe second
half of 2003, contributing significantly to the GDP growth rate o f 5.2 percent in2004, the highest
growth rate since the early 1990s. The recovery o f investment and private consumption in2004
also contributed to the high growth rate, and indicated that the base o f recovery hadbroadened.
The ratios of public and external debt to GDP declined significantly, as a result o f the
improvements in the fiscal and current account balances, the currency appreciation, and the
recovery o f economic activity.          Brazil entered 2005 enjoying stable conditions, and having
observed all the performance criteria inthe tenth and final review o f a Stand-by arrangement with
the IMF, conducted inMarch 2004.

                     B.      MacroeconomicOutlookandDebtSustainability
13.      GDP growth is expected to decline to about 3.5-4 percent in 2005 and 2006, due to the
tightening o f monetary policy by the Central Bank in the second half o f 2004 and the fact that
Brazil's investment ratio has recovered but continues to be low, relative to other high growth
countries and its own historical record. Inflation increased somewhat inthe second half o f 2004,
but is expected to decline to about 5 percent in 2005 and to lower levels in 2006, due to the
Central Bank's demonstrated commitment to its inflation targets and the reasonable fiscal targets
for 2005 and 2006.

14.      The Government has set minimum primary surplus targets of 4.25 percent o f GDP for
2005-2007. These levels o f primary surpluses, combined with the expected GDP growth rates
and levels o f interest rates, should lead to further drops in the ratio o f public debt to GDP,
although these drops should be more moderate than those observed in2004. The performance o f
external accounts continued strong in the first months o f 2005, but the current account surplus
should decline in 2005 and 2006, due primarily to the continued recovery o f economic activity,
investment and imports. However, these projected current account surpluses, combined with
some expected recovery o f net direct investment and continued growth o f GDP and exports
should leadto further drops inthe ratios o f external debt to GDP and to exports.

15.      Overall, the Brazilian economy has become more resilient and less vulnerable to shocks
than at the start o f the decade. As shown in Table 2, most indicators o f vulnerability show an
impressive improvement over the past five years, especially the indicators o f external
vulnerability. The ratio o f gross external debt to GDP dropped from 40 percent at the start o f the
decade to 33 percent in 2004 and i s expected to decline to 28 and 25 percent o f GDP inthe next
two years. The drop inthe ratio of gross extemal debt to exports has been even more impressive.
This indicator was halved over the past five years and is expected to drop below the 200 percent
threshold in 2005. The ratio of debt service to exports has also been halved, while the ratio o f
gross reserves to short term debt has doubled and should reach the 100percent threshold in2005.

16.      The main vulnerability of the Brazilian economy continues to be its large public debt.
Although net public debt i s expected to decline fbrther to about 50 percent o f GDP in2005, this
ratio i s still considered to be high, and i s the major reason why the country continues to be rated
below investment grade, and continues to pay relatively high borrowing spreads (Table 2).
Moreover, although the structure o f public debt has improved, with a decline in the share of
foreign-exchange denominated debt, this has been achieved at the cost o f some reduction in the
average maturity to about 28 months and an increase inthe share of floating rate debt, exposing
the Government to the risk o f interest rate increases. This reveals the needto keep pursuing tight
fiscal policies in order to achieve further reductions inthe net debt ratio. Furthermore, the fiscal
efforts in 2005 and future years should be based on efforts to contain expenditures, as the share
o f consolidated revenues to GDP (federal, state andmunicipalgovernments) i s almost 34 percent
o f GDP, revealing a heavy tax burdenfor a middle income country.

17.      Brazil's external financing requirements have declined significantly since 2000, in line
with the improvement inthe extemal accounts. As shown inTable 3, financing requirements are
expected to increase in 2005 and 2006, due primarily to the expected decline in the current
account surpluses, but will remain substantially smaller than the levels at the start o f the decade.
Borrowing needs should average US$25 billion in 2005 and 2006, based on amortization

projections and reasonable assumptions about net direct investment and portfolio flows. The
Government's externalborrowing needs amount to roughly one fourth ofthe total.

18.      As mentionedbefore, inMarch 2005, the Government completed successfully a US$41.8
billion Stand-by arrangement with the IMF initiated in September 2002, of which it drew only
US$26.2 billion. The Government concluded that the Brazilian economy hadbecome much less
vulnerable to external shocks and that both the public and private sectors could meet their
borrowing requirements ininternational capital markets without the need for further support from
the IMF, a decision that was endorsed by the IMF management (Annex 6). The Government has
also indicated that it will continue pursuing the same sound fiscal policies that were followed
under the IMF Stand-by, and that paved the way for the recovery and the sharp improvement in
all vulnerabilityindicators, including the ratio o fpublic debt to GDP.

              111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PENSIONREFORMPROGRAM

                    A.      The Emergenceof Pension Imbalancesinthe 1990s
19.      Brazil has two public and mandatory retirement regimes that operate on a pay-as-you-go
(PAYG) basis: the RGPS (Regime Geral de Previdsncia Social) for private sector workers and
the RPPS (Regime Pr6prio de Previdsncia Social) for public sector workers at the federal, state
and municipal levels of government. The actual number o f workers contributing to these two
programs is less than40 percent o f the labor force, reflectingthe highdegree o f informality. This
coverage ratio i s higher than the average ratio in Latin America, but lower than ratios in the
OECD. However, coverage o f the elderly i s much higher, amounting to about 85 percent o f the
population above 65 years o f age, reflecting special quasi-contributory programs managed by the
RGPS, especiallyinthe rural areas.

20.      In addition to the two mandatory public pension regimes, workers can contribute on a
voluntary basis to private pension finds, which can be either closed or open. Closed finds are
sponsored by employers or professional associations, while open funds are offered by insurance
companies and other financial providers. The assets o f closed funds account for 17 percent o f
GDP, or thebulk of totalpension assets. The closedpension funds are supervisedbythe Secretariat
o f Complementary Pensions (SPC) in the Ministry o f Social Security (Ministerio de Previdsncia
Social-MPS).      Starting in July 2005, the closed funds will be supervised by a newly created
autonomous agency, the SuperintendenciaNacional de Previdencia Complementar (PREVIC).

21.      Pension expenditures increased significantly during the 1990s, from about 4 percent o f
GDP in 1990 to almost 12 percent o f GDP in 2004 (Figure 1). This outcome was due to
increases in expenditures in both P A Y G schemes. The increase in RPPS expenditures was
initially more pronounced in the states and municipalities, which were allowed to create new
pension systems in the early 1990s. Pension deficits were small in the early 1990s but have
increased in line with the increase in expenditures, reaching 5.5 percent o f GDP inrecent years
(Figure 1). The increase in pension expenditures was due primarily to the 1988 Constitution,
which increased benefits that were already generous and relaxed further eligibility rules which
were already liberal. As a result, Brazil has today disproportionately large pension expenditures
for its level o fper capita income and relatively young demographic structure.

                             B.      The 1998 and 1999 PensionReforms
22.      The sharp increase in pension expenditures and deficits in the 1990s contributed to an
overall increase in fiscal deficits and to a substantial increase inpublic debt, leading to a crisis at
the end o f the decade. The crisis prompted the Government to launch a comprehensive program
of fiscal reforms which included pension reforms.              The first important step was taken in
December 1998through Constitutional Amendment No. 20, which removed the generous benefit
formula from the Constitutional text, opening the way for further reforms. It also introduced
several specific changes, such as a benefit ceiling inthe RGPS indexed to inflation, a minimum
age o f retirement in the RPPS (60-55 for men and women respectively) with a period o f
transition, and a minimumvestingperiod o f 10years to receive higher RPPS benefits.

23.      The second important step took place inNovember 1999, involving a major reform to the
RGPS. This reform was centered in a new benefit formula called the Futor Previdencicirio that
rewards years of contribution and will result in a decline in replacement ratios relative to the
previous replacement ratio o f 100 percent. The 1998 and 1999 reforms are projected to halve
long-run RGPS deficits-from              12 to 5-6 percent o f GDP in2050, as shown inTable 4.

24.      RGPS expenditures have increased by 1.2 percent o f GDP since the 1998 and 1999
reforms, but this increase does not reflect a failure o f the reforms. As shown inTable 5 (andin
more detail inAnnex 2), the savings o fthe reforms are reflectedinthe modest increase inold age
benefits, and most particularly inthe decreaseinbenefits generated bythe lengtho f service (LoS)
rule, which was the main object o f the 1998 and 1999 reforms.2 Half of the increase in RGPS
expenditures since the reforms has been due to increases in disability-related pension
expenditures that were not predicted at the time o f the reform. Other factors include survivor
benefits and social assistance benefits.                  The unexpected increase in disability-related
expenditures has resulted from flaws in the system o f disability benefits that have become
apparent inrecent years, and that are also examined inmore detail inAnnex 2.

TheRationalefor the December 2003 Reform to the RPPS

25.      The third important step took place in December 2003, through Constitutional
Amendment No. 41, and involved a reform to the RPPS. The importance assigned by the Lula
Government to the RPPS reform was stronglyjustified for at least three reasons. First, although
the RGPS remained actuarially imbalanced, it had been reformed in the late 1990s, and such
reforms had already entailed a significant reduction inbenefits and replacement ratios. Second,
federal and subnational governments had been making an effort to generate primary surpluses
since 1999, in order to restore fiscal equilibrium and open room for expenditures in education,
health, basic infrastructure, and targeted social assistance. However, pension expenditures and


 Workers inBrazil can retire under the length o f service rule o f 35 and 30 years for men and women, respectively,
or by the age rule o f 65 and 60, respectively. The length o f service rule accounts for most o f old age benefits. The
age rule is primarily a redistributional program.

deficits continued to increase, imposing an increasing burdenon the public finances. Third, the
much more generous RPPS benefits implied large regressive transfers and social inequities inthe
pension system, contributing to Brazil's extreme income inequalities.

26.     The burden imposed by the RPPS on the public finances is illustrated inTables 6 and 7.
As shown in Table 6, between the late 1990s and the early 2000s federal and subnational
governments increased their average primary surplus from 0.4 to 2.9 percent o f GDP, while their
combined pension deficits increased from 3.6 to 4 percent o f GDP.3 These contrasting trends
implied increasing limits on other essential fiscal expenditures and/or the imposition o f an
increasingtax burden on the economy.

27.     The federal government generated most o f the primary surpluses, but subnationals also
made strenuous efforts to adjust their finances. As shown in Table 7, during the early 2000s
subnationals made an effort to comply with the 60 percent limit on the ratio o f personnel
expenditures to own revenues (personnel expenditures include pensions) that had been imposed
as a condition for the restructuring o f their debts, and by the Law o f Fiscal Re~ponsibility.~
However, the rapidly maturing pension systems generated increasing numbers o f pensioners,
forcing subnationals to contain severely wages and active personnel. This situation, reflected in
the increase in pension expenditures in personnel expenditures, implied that subnationals were
strugglingto maintain the delivery o f essential services to the population, hrther contributing to
inequities. By 2003, the fiscal situation of subnational governments had reached a critical level,
with most state governors pressing the federal government for a reform to the RPPS. Actuarial
simulations presented below indicate that RPPS deficits would continue increasing in the
absence o freform, due primarily to growing imbalances inthe pension systems o f subnationals.

28.      The inequities produced by the Brazilian pension system also became more apparent
during the early 2000s, and constituted another argument for the RPPS reform. As shown in
Table 8, these inequities are clearly revealed by the disproportion between the numbers o f
beneficiaries and the volumes o f expenditures. While the beneficiaries in the combined RPPS
schemes o f the federal, states and municipal governments account for only 13 percent o f total
beneficiaries, they are responsible for 42 percent o f total pension expenditures and 72 percent o f
total pension deficits. The disproportionately large expenditures and deficits in the regime for
civil servants are primarily due to much higher average benefits, also shown in Table 8. The
muchlower benefits inthe RGPS reflect inpart the redistributive elements o fthe system such as
the minimumpension, especially the minimumpension inthe non-contributory rural scheme.




 The total primary surplus o f the consolidatedpublic sector shown inSection I1i s larger, because it includes the
surplus o f public sector companies.
 The Bank supported the fiscal reforms inthis period by two Development Policy Loans, the Special Fiscal and
Administrative Reform Loan, and the Programmatic FiscalReformLoanI(see Section IV).

The Components of the December 2003 Reform to the RPPS

29.     The RPPS reform was introduced inDecember 2003 through Constitutional Amendment
No. 41. The reform includes stricter rules for retirement in the public sector, less generous
benefit and indexation formulas, less generous survivor pensions, the possibility for imposing an
overall benefit ceiling subject to the creation o f a complementary pension fund, overall wage and
benefit caps on current pensioners, and the imposition o f an 11percent contribution on all public
sector retirees. The components o f the December 2003 reform are briefly explained inBox 1.

30.     The reform introduces particularly stringent conditions for new civil servants hired after
its approval, and implies a partial harmonization o f the PAYG systems for private and public
sector workers. The reform also has a significant impact on the large numbers o f workers who
had not acquired the right to retire and have not complied with the eligibility rules. These
workers will have to either postpone retirement or retire early facing heavy penalties. Current
pensioners, workers who have already acquired the right to retire, or are inconditions to comply
with the new eligibility rules, will contribute to the reform effort by paying the new contribution
o f 11percent above the threshold. The reform will not affect militarypersonnel, the police and
firefighters.

1) Stricter Rules for Retirementin the Public Sector. The introduction o f penalties ranging from 3.5
to 5 percent o f the wage base for each year o f retirement prior to the normal retirement age o f 60 for men
and 55 for women; the abolition o f proportional retirement provisions for those who did not have the
right to retire from this program before the reform; the increase inthe required years o f service in the
public sector from 10 to 20 years, and inthe last position from 5 to 10 years.
2) New Benefit Formula. The change o f the pension base, from the last wage to the average o f 80
percent o f the highest real wages after 1994;
3) New IndexationRule.The switch from wage to price indexationo fbenefits;
4) Rules on AcquiredRights. Measures (1)-(3) do not apply to workers who had already acquired the
right to retire, under the old rules. Measures (2)-(3) do not apply to workers who meet the new stricter
conditions for retirement described in(1).
5) Survivor Pensions. A reduction in survivor's pensions-from          100 percent o f the original pension to
70 percent above a threshold o f 2,400 Reais per month;
6) Impositionof Contributions/TaxonRPPSPensioners.The introduction o f a contribution rate o f 11
percent for pensioners, on the benefit portion above the threshold o f 2,400 Reais per month;
7) Imposition of Benefit Ceiling combined with Creationof Complementary PensionFunds. The
introduction o f a benefiticontribution ceiling equal to the respective ceiling in the RGPS, provided that
the employer (the federal, state, or municipal Government) creates a complementary defined contribution
pensionfund;
8) OverallWage and BenefitCaps. Maximum wage andbenefit levels were introduced, and definedby
the salary o f the respective leaders o f the executive, judicial and legislative branches o f the federal and
subnational governments;
9) MinimumSubnational Contribution.The introduction o f a minimumcontribution o f 11percent for
all active state and municipal civil servants;
10) RGPSCeiling. The RGPS contributiodbenefit ceiling was raisedto 2,400 Reais per month.


TheProjected Fiscal Impact of the December 2003 Reform

3 1.     The impact o f the 2003 reform was evaluated separately for the federal and subnational
pension regimes, due to their different age, gender and occupational structures. As shown in
Figure 2, RPPS deficits would increase at all levels o f government inthe absence o f reform, but
the increase would be more pronounced in the case o f subnationals.                      The immaturity o f
subnational pension systems i s one of the major reasons o f their larger projected deficits. For
example, the dependency ratio, defined as the number o f pensioners per 100 contributors, i s
currently 80, 37 and 20 percent in the federal, state, and municipal schemes, respectively. The
differences in system maturity are also reflected inthe ratio o f survivors to members (both active
and retired), which i s currently 29 percent for the federal RPPS and only 15 and 6 percent for the
states andmunicipalities, respectively.

32.      Another explanation for the different projected deficits i s the much higher proportion o f
female workers inthe states and municipalities (mostly teachers and doctors). Female employees
become eligible for retirement up to 5 years younger having worked 5 years less. Furthermore,
their life expectancy at retirement is about 7 years longer. Therefore, subnational pensionsystems
produce new beneficiaries at a greater frequency and have to pay benefits for longer periods.
Teachers, who constitute around 60 percent o f all employees, also become eligible for benefits up
to 5 years earlier, which results ina long duration o fretirement for female teachers.

                                                       11

33.      The December 2003 reform reduces long-run deficits at all levels o f Government, but has
clearly a stronger impact on subnational pension systems, as shown inFigure 2. This difference
i s due to two major factors. First, the share of employees not affected by the reform i s much
larger at the federal government.             For example, the military represent 39 percent of active
workers inthe executive branch o fthe federal government, while policemen and firefighters (also
excluded from the reform) constitute a much smaller share of the executive branch o f the states
and municipalities.          Second, many o f the specific reform measures affect more strongly
subnational civil servants.          For example, given the shorter careers o f female teachers, the
measures that increase vestingrequirements and retirement age affect states and municipalities to
a larger extent.

34.      Most o f the savings in the short- and medium-runs come from the reduction in survivor
pensions, due especially to the change from wage to price indexation of newly awarded survivor
benefits. Another significant source o f savings, especially at the subnational level, is the stricter
retirement conditions-given           the harshness o f penalties for early retirement, the simulations
assume that workers will postpone retirement.5 The contributions imposed on pensioners will
produce some immediate revenues and short-run savings as well. These effects should result in
average savings relative to the pre-reform scenario o f about 0.2-0.3 percent o f GDP per year over
the next 10 years inthe federal scheme, and about 0.5-0.7 percent o f GDP per year inthe states
and municipalities in the same period. The reform i s also projected to generate savings relative
to the base year, although these savings are projected to be more modest at about 0.2-0.3 percent
of GDP at all levels o f Government.

35.      The December 2003 reform has clearly a stronger impact in the long-run, as shown in
Figure 2. This is because the reform imposes stringent conditions on new civil servants, as
mentioned before. Their entry level pensions will be lower, due to a less generous benefit
formula (which i s closer to the RGPS formula) and these pensions will be adjusted by a less
generous indexation rule as well. Although the December reform i s back-loaded, it reduces
significantly the actuarial imbalances o f the RPPS-the                simulations indicate that the net present


  However, sensitivity analysis shows that the net present value o f savings would not be very different ifworkers
decided to retire earlier andtake the penalties.

                                                           12

value o f projected RPPS pension deficits inthe first 50 years i s reduced by roughlyone third, or
the equivalent o f about 90 percent o f2003 GDP.

36.     New civil servants hired after the reform may also be subject to the same benefit and
contribution ceiling imposed in the RGPS. However, if federal and subnational governments
decide to impose this ceiling, they will also have to offer a complementary pension fund for their
new employees and match employees' contributions. These complementary funds (examinedin
more detail in Annex 3) will generate a complementary benefit that will add to the main PAYG
benefit, to generate an overall expected replacement ratio of around 60 percent o f the final wage,
which is lower than the overly generous replacement ratio o f 100 percent granted today, and
more inline with average replacement ratios inthe OECD.

37.     Ifthe new complementary funds are implemented, the federal Government would face
some transition costs, as it would need to contribute to these funds and would lose some
contribution revenues duringthe accumulation phase. However, simulations (shown inAnnex 3)
indicate that the transition costs would be moderate, due to the fact that the contributions andthe
loss of revenues apply only to the share o f the wage bill above the ceiling-which       i s only 28
percent in the federal government and half this number in most states.               Moreover, the
Government would also have fiscal gains due to the imposition of the benefit ceiling. The short-
runfiscal gains would be modest, as they would be limitedto disability and survivor pensions,
but the long-run fiscal gains would be more significant. The simulations indicate average net
fiscal costs o f about 0.05 percent o f GDP per year inthe first two decades and average net fiscal
gains of about 0.25 percent of GDP per year inthe following decades.

38.     Constitutional Amendment No. 41 prescribes that the new complementary finds would
have to operate on a defined contribution basis, and the federal government i s finalizing a draft
law on the new complementary funds for federal civil servants that should be submitted to
Congress in 2005. The draft law prescribes that the new funds would be subject to the same
regulatory framework as all the closed pension funds in Brazil, and would be supervised by the
new autonomous supervision agency, PREVIC.               The funds created by the states and
municipalities would operate along similar lines. This would be a favorable outcome, as the
regulatory framework for pension funds inBrazil i s reasonable overall. However, the new funds
could be allowed to offer benefits such as annuities that would expose them to some risks, such
as longevity and investment risk, and indirectly expose the government to these risks.            To
mitigatethis riskthe Government plans to strengthen benefit andfundingrules (see below).

39.     During the first half o f 2004 the 11 percent contribution on retirees was legally
challenged, and the lawsuit was ultimatelyreferred to the Supreme Court. The groups suing the
Government argued that the contribution was an arbitrary and discriminatory tax without a
corresponding benefit.     The Government argued that public pensioners had not contributed
during most o f their working lives (RPPS contributions started being imposed only inthe early
1 9 9 0 ~RPPS pensions had remained on average much higher than RGPS pensions, and the 11
          ) ~
percent contribution was the only contribution o f this generation to the reform effort. InAugust
2004 the Supreme Court ruled that the 11contribution did not violate the Constitution, but also
determined that the exemption threshold had to be raised to the level o f the RGPS ceiling.
Although the rulingreduced the revenues from this reform measure, it was still regarded as being
supportive to the reform, and sent the signal that it would be possible to implement W h e r
reforms inthe future.

                                                 13

40.     In addition to Constitutional Amendment No. 41, the government has introduced new
accounting standards for RPPS regimes, requiringannual reporting o fpension assets andimplicit
pension liabilities. This measure may also contribute to the containment o f expenditures by
increasing the awareness o f subnational governments and legislators o fthe status o f their pension
schemes, so that better informed decisions can bemade inthe fiture.

Current Reforms to the Complementary Pension System

41.     The Government assigns an increasing importance to the complementary pension system,
inrecognition to the fact that past, current, and expected reforms to the two PAYGsystems will
involve reductions in average PAYG benefits and replacement ratios to more sustainable levels.
In2001, the regulatory framework for closed finds was substantially improved through the
approval o f Laws 108 and 109. The enactment o f these Laws has been followed by the issuance
o f several important resolutions by the inter-ministerial regulatory body, the Conselho de GestiYo
de Previdgncia Complementar-CGPC,           Among the several resolutions issued by the CGPC in
recent months, two have been particularly important, namely, Resolution 6 issued in October
2003 improving portability and vesting rules, and Resolution 13 issued in October 2004
strengtheningsubstantiallythe rules o f corporate governance inpensionfunds.

42.     The Government has also adopted measures designed to expand the coverage o f the
complementary system to a larger number o f workers. During 2004 the SPC authorized the first
funds organized by professional associations-fundos         instituidos. These finds operate on a
defined contribution basis, have to outsource their main activities, and the contributions by the
employer are voluntary. The Government expects these simpler rules o f operationto make these
funds attractive to a large number of participants.         The introduction o f an EET (Exempt
contributions, Exempt investment income, and Tax benefits) tax regime by Law 11053 in
December 2004 was also an important and positive step. This tax regime is in line with the tax
regime adopted inmost OECD countries, corrects previous tax distortions, and shouldalso make
voluntary contributions more attractive and expand coverage.

43.     The enactment o f Law Mp233 of December 2004 that establishes the new autonomous
supervision agency-PREVIC-is        another important development. PREVIC will take over the
supervisory functions o f the SPC and will operate with its own source o f revenues and stable
organic rules. The creation o f PREVIC will contribute to a more effective and stable private
pension system. PREVIC plans to address remaining gaps inthe regulatoryframework, such as the
fundingrules for defined benefit and hybriddefined contributionpension finds. This is an area of
regulation that needs strengthening, to avoid large actuarial imbalances and potential costs for the
Government, especially inrelationto the pensionfinds o f state owned enterprises, which tendto be
the largest. PREVIC also plans to build its supervisory capacity in the coming years and adopt a
modernapproach o f supervision basedonrisk, designedto preventproblems at an early stage.

                             D.     ReformsPlannedfor the Future
Improvements in PAYGAdministration

44.     The December 2003 reform has reduced the imbalances o f the pension system, but pension
deficits should start increasing again in the next decade, primarily due to the increasing
expenditures in the RGPS. The Government is aware of these trends and understands that the


                                                 14

Brazilian pension system needs further reforms. However, the Government also feels that it does
not have the political conditions to propose another major reform to the Brazilian society before
exhausting the possibilities for reducing pension deficits through improvements in the
administration o f the RPPS and the RGPS. This i s because there i s a widespread perception in
society that these deficits are largely due to numerous cases of inefficiency and fraud, routinely
reported bythe Brazilianpress.

45.     The federal and subnational governments have already been improving the administration
of RPPS schemes with technical and financial assistance from the Bank, and have been rewarded
by significant savings, particularly at the level o fBrazilian states.6 Improvingthe administration o f
the RGPS has proved a more difficult challenge, because o f its larger size andtechnical problems.
However, most o fthe irregular payments due to inefficiency andfraud that have beenreported refer
to the RGPS.

46.     The Government's plansto improve the RGPS administration includemeasuresdesigned to
enhance revenues and to reduce expenditures through the elimination o f inefficiencies and the
identification o f fraud. As part o f these efforts, a new Secretariat for Social Security Contributions,
the Secretaria de Receita Previdencidria-SRP            was created, with enhanced legal powers to stop
leakages in collection and address more effectively the large contribution arrears that have
accumulated inrecent years. The Government will also implement a new risk management system
based on Basle IIprinciples that i s designed to prevent fraud and abuse on the payment o f benefits
and should contribute to the containment of expenditures.                 As part o f the same effort, the
Government will also implement a program o frecertificationo f all pensioners, basedinitially inthe
comparison o f several databases and the identification o f irregularities in the payment o f benefits.
The results o fthis phasewill be usedfor a more detailed verification o firregularpayments.

Reforms to the Disability Scheme

47.     In addition to improvements in PAYG administration, the Government also plans to
implement a comprehensive reform to the disability scheme inthe near future, inresponse to the
unexpected increase in expenditures in recent years.              As mentioned before, disability-related
expenditures have increased by 0.6 percent o f GDP since 2000 and account for nearly half o f the
increase in RGPS expenditures during the same period. These expenditures reflect payment o f
three classes o f benefits: (i)     permanent disability pensions; (ii)  sicknesdpartial disability benefits;
and(iii) injurybenefits. The increase inexpenditures hasbeenparticularly pronounced inthe
         work
second class o fbenefits.

48.     Inorder to start addressing the increase indisability-related expenditures, the Government
has elaborated a new nation-wide program that includes the introduction o f minimum health and
safety standards at the workplace covering all workers anddesigned to reduce the number o fwork-
related accidents; the introduction o f a new information collection system designed to collect not
only information on work accidents, but also risk factors; and the introduction o f risk-based
contributions to the work injuryinsurance scheme.




6The Bank has two active projects supporting improvements in the administration o f state and municipal pension
systems. Annual savings generated by the state project have been estimated at BRL 170million per year.. A follow-
upproject for the states is being finalized.

                                                        15

49.      These important initiatives are expected to be implementedin2006, and should result in a
decliningnumber o f disability claims. At the same time, the Government is aware that the causes
of the recent increase in disability-related expenditures are not hlly understood, and that these
initiatives, although important, will not be sufficient to contain these expenditures.        The
Government understands that a comprehensive disability reform will probably need to include
changes in benefit design, measures to improve medical criteria for disability, the training o f
specialized doctors, and improvements in physical and professional rehabilitation.            The
Government plansto do a more complete diagnosis ofthe rules andprocedures inthe disability area
inthe comingmonths, inorder to prepareamorecomprehensive reformprogramin2006.

50.      Inthe longer-runthe Government will have to address the remaining imbalances inthe
pension system, especially in the RGPS, as neither the administrative reforms which will be
implemented in 2005 and 2006 nor the disability reforms which should be implementedin 2006
will be able to eliminate these deficits. This will require fkther parametric reforms to the RGPS.
Inthisoccasion,theRPPScouldbefbrtherharmonizedwiththeRGPS.



              IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

                                         A.     LinktoCAS
51.      The 2004-2007 CAS for Brazil, discussed by the Board o f Executive Directors on
December 9, 2003, organizes the Bank's partnership with Brazil according to three pillars -
equity, competitiveness, and sustainability. These three pillars are built on a fourth and basic
element-a     sound fiscal andmacroeconomic framework.' The Bank has been implementing four
programmatic DPL series corresponding broadly to these four policy objectives. O f the overall
annual lending to Brazil envisaged under the upper base case scenario in the CAS o f
approximately US$2 billion per year, a significant fraction amountingto about halfo f lendingin
the four year CAS period should consist o f programmatic DPL in these four areas, subject to
satisfactory reform progress within each.

52.      O f these four series, the Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan (PFRL) Series was launched
first, with PFRL-I approved in January 2001 and PFRL-II approved in June 2003.* The Human
Development series o f programmatic lending (corresponding to the equity pillar, but also with
strong links to competitiveness in the long run) was launched with the approval o f the Human
Development Programmatic Sector Reform Loang in February 2003. The Growth Program
(corresponding to the competitiveness pillar) was launched with the approval o f the First
Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth" in February 2004. Finally, the First
Programmatic Reform Loanfor Environmental Sustainability (corresponding to the sustainability
pillar) was approved inAugust 2004."

 53.     The 2004-2007 CAS indicates that the conditions for moving to the upper base case
 scenario include a declining debt to GDP ratio, full effectiveness o f the Fiscal Responsibility

Law, and enactment o f major social security reforms. The CAS also indicates that a major social
security reform contributing to a sound macroeconomic framework wouldjustify a programmatic
fiscal reform loan (Table 12, page 87 and Table 14, page 91). These conditions have been
comfortably met, as shown inSections IIand III.

54.     The CAS specifically refers to the proposed loan as ProgrammaticFiscalReform LoanID
(Pensions) in Annex B3 (page 227), reflecting the original intention to have one single
programmatic fiscal reform series, independently o f whether the reform focused on pensions or
not. Although the concept o f a cluster o f fiscal reform loans has been maintained, the proposed
loan would the first programmatic fiscal reform loan dedicated to social security reform. This
strategy i s preferable, because it enables a more efficient design o f the Bank's program of
assistance inthe fiscal area, and more clear links betweenindividual DPLs. The introduction o f
a programmatic fiscal reform loan series within the broad fiscal cluster but dedicated to pensions
i s strongly justified, because the pension system has been the single most important source o f
fiscal imbalances inBrazil. Moreover, the triggers inprogrammatic fiscal reform loans dedicated
to pensions would involve policy actions specific to the pension area, enabling much more clear
links betweenpensionreform steps and the related DPLs. The same approach would be followed
for programmatic fiscal reform loans supporting fiscal reforms outside the pension area.

55.     Therefore, the proposed loan represents a direct execution o f the spirit and the letter o f
the 2004-2007 CAS for Brazil, as it supports areform that not only contributes to the objective o f
a stable fiscal and macroeconomic framework, but also to the objective of a more equitable
Brazil. One modification is that the loan amount proposed i s larger than the indicative figure of
US$500 million included inthe CAS. However, this i s clearlyjustified given additional reform
progress made since the initial pension reform o f December 2003, along with the excellent track
record o f the government in fiscal and macroeconomic management. Since fiscal sustainability
continues to be Brazil's central economic challenge, and increased equity one o f its most
pressingsocial challenges, the actions supported by the proposed loan are o f utmost priority for
the country's future.

                      B.     Collaboration with the IMFand Other Donors
56.     World Bank collaboration with the IMF has been very close on all matters related to
macroeconomic management and stability. Brazil has recently expressed its intention not to
renew its Stand-by agreement with the IMF, which closed successfully on March 31, 2005, a
decision that was endorsed by the IMF management. Nonetheless, the IMF will continue to be
an important source o f views and analysis for the World Bank. Moreover, Bank and Fund staff
recently collaborated on the Joint Pilot Initiative on Public Investment, in which Brazil
participated. One outcome o f this initiative has been the IMF Board Paper prepared in
cooperation with staff from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.Another
outcome has been the approval o f an IDF Grant to improve the selection, appraisal, monitoring
and evaluation o f public investment projects by the Brazilian government, to be executed by the
Ministry o f Finance.

57.     Inthe area of social security, the Bank, the IMF, and the IDB have been coordinating
closely their efforts. The Bank has providedtechnical and financial support for the improvement
o f the administration o f the RPPS o f states and municipalities, has extended a PHRD grant that
will finance initial technical work in the area of disability reform, and is preparingan operation


                                                  17

to support the implementation o f disability reform and improvements in pension supervision.
The IDB has a project supporting the technological upgrading o f the RGPS, and the IMF will
provide technical assistance for the collection o f RGPS revenues and accumulated arrears, and
other aspects of the administration o f the RGPS. In other areas, collaboration with the IDB i s
also close, particularly ininfrastructure and the analysis o f the role o fpublic-private partnerships,
where the IDBhas been active.

                        C.     Relationshipwith Other Bank Operations
58.      The proposed operation is closely related to two sets of DPL operations in Brazil. The
first set, comprising two special operations supporting previous social security reforms, predates
the present programmatic series o f fiscal reform loans. The first o f these social security loans
(SSRL-I) supported Constitutional Amendment No. 20 which removed the benefit formula for
private sector workers from the constitutional text, introduced a benefit ceiling for private
workers, and introduced a ten-year vesting rule and minimum retirement age for civil servants,
among other measures.12 The second social security loan (SSRL-11), focused exclusively on
private sector pensions and supported the introduction of a new benefit formula, reducing
replacement ratios andproviding incentives for greater contributions. l3

59.      The second set o f loans has supported fiscal reforms outside the social security area. The
first of these, the Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan (FARL), also predated the present
programmatic ~eries.'~    This loan supported the restructuring through legislation o f the states'
public debts, as well as administrative reforms enabling the dismissal o f public-sector workers.
Following this loan, the Bank launched the PFRL series inits present form, with the first ofthese
loans supporting the adoption o f the Fiscal Responsibility Law and the federal multi-year budget
(Plano Plurianual or PPA),"       and the second supporting an initial tax reform and improved
public debt management arrangements inthe National Treasury.l6

60.      The proposed operation is also related to the Bank's program of technical assistance (TA)
lending within the Ministry o f Social Security. The Bank has currently two active TA loans to
the Ministry, supporting improvements inthe administration of the RPPS schemes o f states and
municipalities, with very satisfactory results, and a follow-up T A operation to the states i s being
finalized. The Bank i s also preparing a T A loan to support disability reform and the newly
created autonomous pension supervision agency, the PREVIC. The operation will help PREVIC
buildits supervisory capacity andadopt a risk-based, preventive approach to pensionsupervision.
Building PREVIC's supervisory capacity is deemed an essential component o f the Bank's
assistance, as the new agency will need to ensure the sound management o f a large volume o f
assets in the complementary pension system, and will also have to supervise the new funds that
will be created for civil servants at the federal and subnational levels of government.

61.      With this proposed loan, the Bank is introducing a new programmatic fiscal reform loan
series dedicated to pension reform, but within the broad cluster o f programmatic fiscal reform
loans. As mentioned before, a separate series for pensions is justified by the importance o f

pension reform for fiscal sustainability, the specificity o f pension reform issues, and their
technical and political complexity.       The importance o f pension reform can be appreciated
considering its impact in reducing the net present value o f future pension deficits and the
Government's overall debt, including both the implicit pension debt and the explicit debt. As
mentioned in Section 111, the December 2003 reform i s expected to reduce the net present value
o f future RPPS deficits by one third or about 90 percent o f 2003 GDP. Therefore, the reformhas
a greater impact on the stock o f total Government obligations (explicit and implicit) than any
other single fiscal reform possible today. Moreover, although the impact o f pension reforms i s
mostly felt inthe long-run, they also have an immediate and important effect: sovereign spreads
and the financing cost of the explicit public debt are reduced when markets observe a reform o f
social security, the single most important factor affecting public sector solvency inBrazil.

62.       The strategy o f having two programmatic fiscal reform loan series within the broad fiscal
reform cluster - one series dedicated to pensions and the other supporting fiscal reforms outside
the pension area       -ensures the internal coherence o f the Bank's overall assistance in the fiscal
area, while also enabling a much more clear design o f triggers and links between reforms and
operations. Whereas fiscal reforms in and outside the pension area have the common objective
o f ensuringlong-run fiscal sustainability, the triggers infiscal reform loans dedicated to pensions
need to focus on further policy actions in the pension area, given the technical specificity of
pension reform issues, as well as the greater political complexity o f pension reforms, which
makes the timing o f their approval and implementationmore difficult to predict.

63.       The overall architecture o f the PFRL cluster, including the earlier "pre-programmatic"
lending described above, the two formal programmatic fiscal reform loans, the proposed loan,
and expected future lending over the next two years is summarized schematically inTable 9 (the
fiscal program matrix in Annex 5 provides some additional detail). A further loan (PFRL-111)
focusing on public expenditure issues other than social security i s planned for FY06, assuming
further progress on expenditure reforms, while continued progress on the remaining social
security reform agenda would be covered byPFRL-SSIUI.

                                        D.      Lessons Learned
64.       The Bank has learned from its work in Brazil and other countries that pensionreforms are
technically and politically complex. In'Brazil, the degree of complexity i s particularly high due to
the existence o f two PAYG regimes, the RGPS and the RPPS, the large number o f states and
municipalities operating under the RPPS, andthe fact that pensionrights havebeenenshrined inthe


                                                   19

Constitution. To be effective, the Bank needs to maintain a close dialogue with policy makers at
the federal and statelevels andretaina solid understandingofthe issues. The Bankhasmaintained
a solid ESW program inBrazil that has provided the vehicle for policy dialogue with the Brazilian
authorities and the analytical basis for the evaluation o fpolicy lendingina complex area.

65.     A programmatic approach to support pension reform is very meaningful in Brazil. As
mentioned above, pension reforms are particularly complex inBrazil, because o f the existence o f
different regimes, and because pension reforms can only be introduced by Constitutional
Amendments approved by a three fifths majority in Congress. Well organized groups with vested
interests can easily block reform attempts, making it difficult or even unfeasible to reform the
RGPS andthe RPPS at once, or to attempt to address all problems ineither o fthe two regimes ina
single reform. Programmatic lending allows the requiredflexibility, by providing sequential loans
eachtime the Government succeedsto have approved a critical mass ofreformmeasures.

66.     Effective administration o f PAYG pension schemes i s essential for the successful
enforcement of reform measures. The Bank has provided three technical assistance (TA) loans
designedto strengthen the administration o f the RGPS, andthe RPPS o f states andmunicipalities.
The two loans provided for subnationals were well dimensioned and have produced satisfactory
results, while the TA loan for the RGPS was undersized and sufferedfrom several other problems.
At the present time, the IDB and the IMF are providing financial and technical assistance to the
Government in order to improve the administration o f the RGPS. Such burden sharing with the
IMFandthe IDBis welcome, giventhe magnitude ofthe problem, althoughthis also increasesthe
need for coordinationamong multilaterals.

67.     Past loans may have underestimated the risks presented by parts o f the pension system
that were not subject to meaningful reforms. For example, the Social Security Reform Loan II
approved inFYOO did not predict that flaws in the disability program would weaken the savings
producedby the 1999 reform. The lesson that has been learned is that disability is a complex
area that cannot be reformed by piecemeal measures. The Government is aware o f this problem
andplans to implement a comprehensive and coherent reform ofthe disability scheme in2006.

                                     E.      AnalyticalUnderpinnings
68.      The preparation o f the proposed operation has benefited from two comprehensive pieces
o f analytical work on the Brazilian pension system, conducted in 2001 and 2004.17 These two
analytical pieces provided an in-depth analysis o f the challenges in the pension system and an
important vehicle for policy dialogue with the Government. The second ESW was partly based
on informal policy notes submitted to the Government during 2003, when the RPPS reform was
being prepared and debated in Congress. These policy notes provided actuarial simulations of
different reform scenarios and suggestions based on reform experiences in other countries, and
formed the basis for a very useful dialogue with the Government duringthat period. Finally, the
proposed operation has also benefited from other analytical work in related areas, such as the
poverty assessments conducted in 1995 and 2001, which showedthe magnitude o f the regressive
income transfers caused by the RPPS scheme, and the needto reform the scheme inorder to open
more resources for better targeted social programs.'*

          V.      THE PROPOSEDPROGRAMMATIC FISCAL REFORMLOAN-

                                 SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM

                                  A.      OperationJustification
69.      The proposed loan is stronglyjustified for three main reasons. First, the loan supports the
third major effort to reform the pension system, which emerged inthe 1990s as the most single
important source o f fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances in Brazil.           Pension reforms are
essential for the long-run sustainability o f public finances at the, federal and, especially,
subnational levels o f government.       Therefore, they are essential to the stable fiscal and
macroeconomic framework that Brazil needs to design and implement its long-run development
program. Moreover, the RPPS has also been a source o f social inequities in a country with one
o f the most skewed income distributionsinthe world. The critical aspect o f pension reform for
the achievement o f sustained growth and the reduction in inequalities was recognized in the
CAS, which singled out the proposed operation as one o f the key operations in the Bank's
assistance strategy inthe 2004-2007 period.

70.      Second, pension reforms are particularly challenging and complex in Brazil, as they
usually require a Constitutional Amendment approved by a three fifths majority in Congress.
The December 2003 reform to the RPPS was introduced through a Constitutional Amendment,
but was still subsequently challenged, requiringultimately an examination by the Supreme Court
o f its legal basis and consistency with the Constitution's principles. A Supreme Court ruling in
August 2004 supported the reform, revealing an increased level o f awareness and understanding
of the whole society about the country's problems and challenges inthis area, and opening room
for hrtherneededreforms inthe future.

71.      Third, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to fiscal discipline and
macroeconomic stability, as indicated by the increase inprimary surpluses inthe past two years,
the reduction inthe ratio o f net public debt to GDP, the muchbetter management o f the domestic
public debt, and the dramatic improvement in all indicators o f external vulnerability. The need
to preserve macroeconomic stability inBrazil cannot be sufficiently emphasized, especially after
more than a decade o f instability and hyperinflation in the 1980s and the first half o f the 1990s
that disrupted economic growth and increased the levels o f poverty and income inequality. The
two central lessons that were learned from that period were that it i s impossible to implement a
meaninghl development program under volatile macroeconomic conditions, andthat inflation is
a tax that affects primarily the poor. Therefore, the strong fiscal performance demonstrated in
the past two years i s fully consistent with the objectives o f the CAS and the spirit o f the broad
fiscal reform program, andis also an integral part o fthe loan design.

                  B.     ProgrammaticFrameworkandOperationDescription
ThePension Reform Program and its Outcomes

72.      As shown inSection IV.C, the proposed loan forms part o f a cluster ofprogrammatic fiscal
reform loans that encompasses a comprehensive fiscal reform agenda, involving pension reforms
and fiscal reforms outside the pensionarea. The pension reforms supported bythe Bank's program
have included reforms inthe system for public and private workers, with the latter defined so as to
include reforms inthe voluntary pensionpillar as well. The fiscal reforms outside the pensionarea


                                                 21

have been classified under three broad areas, namely, fiscaVpublic expenditure management, debt
andrisk management, andtax policy and administration.

73.     As mentioned before, a special treatment for pension reform in the overall fiscal reform
program i s strongly justified, because the pension system became the major`single source o f fiscal
imbalances in the 1990s, and still accounts for about 40 percent o f the expenditures o f the
consolidated public sector. For this reason, the assessment o f the status o f the program focuses on
the outcomes o f its pension components, more specifically on the outcomes o f the 1998 and 1999
pension reforms supported by the first two social security reform loans. These early reforms
focused primarily on the RGPS, but the 1998 reform also contained some measures designed to
contain RPPS expenditures.

74.     Most pension reforms have a gradual effect on expendituresand deficits, because acquired
legal rights usually make it difficult to change the real value of the existing stock o f benefits in a
short period of time. Moreover, the initial conditions may be so adverse that even a strong reform
may not be able to eliminate the imbalances of the pension system. Insome cases, stopping the
growth o f expendituresand deficits i s a legitimate objective and a positive outcome. These factors
needto be taken into account inassessing the 1998 and 1999 reforms. Such assessmentmay need
to rely on intermediate indicators andcomparisons with counterfactual scenarios.

75.     The expenditures and deficits o fthe RPPS have beennearly stable since 1999 (Table 1l),
although at high levels relative to GDP. The 1998-1999 reforms had a modest contribution to
this outcome, because they were not focused on the RPPS, and contained few measures that
would produce immediate effects. These reforms are expected to produce a somewhat stronger
impact inthe long run, by approximately 1percent of GDPper year," but they were not expected
to address the large and increasing RPPS deficits, especially at the subnational level. The RPPS
imbalances were more effectively addressed by the December 2003 reform. In fact, the modest
improvement in 2004 can be attributed already to the latest reform, which contained measures
with a more immediate impact, such as the stricter rules for retirement and the 11 percent
contribution on public retirees.

                   Table 11: RRPSExDendituresandDeficits. 1997-2004 f% of GDP)
                                I    1997              1999              2001            2003           2004
 RPPS Expenditures                    4.3              4.5                4.7             4.7             4.6
 RPPS Deficits                       -3.5              -3.7               -4.0            -3.9            -3.8


76.     The 1998 and 1999 reforms had a stronger impact on the RGPS, particularly on the segment
o fthe system that was most reformed-the            length o f service rule for retirement. As shown inTable
12, expenditures with old age benefits related to the lengtho f service rule amounted to 2.4 percent
o f GDP in 1999, or 40 percent o f total expenditures, reflecting the fact that this was the main path
to retirement. The reforms have reduced these expenditures to 2.3 percent o f GDP and 32 percent
o ftotal expenditures infive years. As shown inTable 13, this outcome was achievedbyincreasing
the averageperiod o f contributionbefore retirement andby reducingthe average benefit. The 1998
and 1999 reforms are also projected to halve the long-run deficits of the RGPS, from 12 to 6
percent o f GDP, as notedinSection IU.


l9Actuarial projections o f the impact o f the 1998-1999 reforms o n the federal RPPS are presentedinthe report
 19641-BR,"Brazil: Critical Issues inSocial Security".

                                                          22

77.     The early reforms supported by the program have produced satisfactory outcomes in
critical areas, but they have not been able to prevent an increase in overall RGPS deficits,
because o f the large and unexpected increase inother expenditures, particularly disability-related
expenditures.       The second social security reform loan included some policy actions in the
disability area, but these actions were not based on an in-depth diagnosis o f the disability scheme
and did not form part of a well-articulated disability reform. The program also included some
measures to improvethe administration o f the RGPS, but these measures were not part o f a well-
articulated plan either. The Government i s fully aware o f these shortcomings and has taken
important initial steps to improve outcomes inthese critical areas, as noted in Section III.These
efforts are being supported by the Bank and other donors and incorporated into the Government's
program supported bythe Bank, as notedbelow.

Operation Description

78.      The proposed operation would support the strong fiscal and macroeconomic performance
o f the past two years-the      central theme in the programmatic fiscal series-as   well as a critical
mass o f pension policy actions already taken by the Government, designed to reduce further
pension imbalances that could lead to fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances and inequitable
social outcomes. In addition to the improvement in fiscal/macro performance, the proposed
operation would comprise three specific pension components, namely: (i)          The December 2003
reform to the RPPS, together with other policy actions designed to strengthentransparency and
discipline in RPPS administration; (ii) steps to address RGPS imbalances thorough well-
                                             Initial
articulated administrative reforms and through the approval o f a reform to the work injury
program; (iii)    Several important steps to strengthen the regulatory framework of the voluntary
private pension system and expand coverage. The key policy actions already taken inthese areas
are summarized inthe first column o f Table 14and elaborated further below.

79.       Strong Fiscal Performance. The Government has maintained a strong fiscal policy inthe
past two years, as judged by the increase in primary surplus to 3.9 and 4.6 percent o f GDP in
2003 and 2004, above budget and IMF targets. These surpluses have contributed to the decline
in net public debt to 51.8 percent of GDP and to the impressive improvement in the external
accounts. Debt management has also been conducted efficiently, as indicated by the sharp
reduction inthe share o f public debt linked to the exchange rate. This has been a very important
policy development, as the increase in public debt in 2002 was fbndamentally due to the large
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. The strong fiscal policy and the efficient conduct o f
monetary policy by the Central Bank enabled the Government to reduce inflation to single digits
while also securing a significant real depreciation o fthe currency that contributed to the dramatic
improvement in the external accounts.                These results are fully consistent with the central
objectives o f the fiscal program, namely, to provide sound macroeconomic foundations for the
implementation o f the Government's development program supported by the Bank.

80.       Reforms to the RPPS.           The main policy action supported by the proposed loan is the
December 2003 reform to the RPPS, introduced through Constitutional Amendment No. 41. As
shown in Section 111and Table 14, this reform includes several measures, including muchstricter
rules for retirement, new old age benefit and indexation formulas, new survivor benefit and
indexation formula, and an 11percent contribution on pension benefits above a threshold. The
reform has a moderate impact on the federal RPPS and a stronger impact on the subnational
schemes, due primarily to the immaturity of these schemes. The reform introduces particularly
stringent conditions on new civil servants and is projected to reduce the net present value of
future RPPS deficits by about one third, or the equivalent of 90 percent of 2003 GDP. The
reform also generates some combined savings inthe next decade relative to the base year.

Notes: (1) Triggers for the next operation are bolded.

81.     As mentionedbefore, the December 2003 reform also includes the possibility for federal
and subnational governments to impose the RGPS ceiling on future benefits, provided that they
create a complementary pension fund for the new civil servants subject to the ceiling. The
Ministryof Social Security has drafted a new law that creates complementary funds for federal
civil servants and submits these funds to a soundregulatory and supervisory framework. Among
other characteristics, the new funds would need to operate on a defined contribution basis, and
would be subject to the same regulatory framework as all pension funds, including Laws 108 and
 109 enacted in 2001, all secondary regulations, and supervision by the new autonomous agency,
the PREVIC. The draft law should be submitted to Congress in2005, and would ensure that the
new funds would play their expected role o f proving supplementary pensions without creating
futurecontingent liabilities for the Government.

82.     In addition to the December 2003 reform, the proposed loan would also support the
introduction of critical regulations, designed to improve the transparency and accountability o f
RPPS schemes. Ministerial Decree No. 916 has introduced the obligation for federal and
subnational governments to compute and disclose their implicit pension liabilities, while
Monetary Council Resolution 3244 has introduced the obligation to employ risk evaluation
methods in the management o f RPPS reserves, on the states and municipalities that have
accumulated suchreserves.



                                                         26

83.     Initial reform steps to reducefurther RGPS imbalances. As mentionedin Section III,     the
Government plans to exhaust the possibilities to reduce RGPS expenditures and deficits through
a well-articulated administrative reform, as well as reforms to the disability scheme, before
proposing to the Brazilian society and Congress another major parametric reform to the RGPS.
These reforms will not eliminate the actuarial imbalances o f the RGPS, but could produce
substantial savings if they are fblly implemented.          Moreover, they constitute essential
components o f a well-articulated strategy to implement further pensionreforms inBrazil.

84.     The proposed loan would support the policy actions that have already been taken by the
Government.      These would include the creation o f the new Secretariat for Social Security
Revenues, the initial implementation o f a risk management system based on Basle 11principles,
and the initiation of a comprehensive pensioner recertification program.        The Government
expects these initiatives to reduce RGPS deficits by more than a third ina period o ftwo years.

85.     The reform of the disability scheme i s a more complex challenge that has to be preceded
by an in-depth diagnosis. However, the Government has already taken some solid initial steps
that would be supported by the proposed loan. The most important i s the design and approval by
the CNPS (an inter-ministerial social security council) o f a National Program of Health and
Safety Standards at the workplace that addresses one o f the causes o f the increase in disability-
related expenditures and deficits, namely, the large number o f unreportedwork accidents, and the
under-financed work injuryprogram.

86.     Reforms to the Voluntay, Private Pension System.           The Government assigns an
increasing importance to the voluntary private pension pillar, due to the need to reduce pension
benefits in the two main regimes to sustainable levels. The proposed loan would support key
policy actions recently implemented and designed to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework and expand coverage to a larger segment o f the labor force. The mainpolicy action i s
the enactment o fPresidentialDecree MP 233 that creates a new autonomous pension supervision
agency. This Decree, and several important regulations issued in 2003 and 2004 - including
critical regulations on vesting, portability, and corporate governance  -  have demonstrated the
Government's commitment to a strong regulatory framework that prevents the emergence o f
imbalances and promotes an increase incoverage.

87.     The proposed loan would also support other important measures designed to promote an
expansion o f supplementary pension coverage. The enactment o f Law 11053 has introduced the
EET tax regime adopted in most OECD countries, and removed serious and lingering tax
distortions that penalized voluntary contributions. The introduction o f the first pension funds
sponsored by professional associations and operating under simpler rules i s another important
step that should also facilitate coverage andbenefit a largenumber o fworkers.

88.     The reforms supportedby the proposed loan constitute a critical mass o f important policy
actions that will generate significant benefits to the Brazilian economy and to Brazilian society
more generally. The December 2003 reform to the RPPS will arrest the growth o f pension
expenditures and deficits, especially at the level o f states and municipalities, which have
struggled to restore fiscal balance and have the responsibility to deliver basic services to the
population. The December 2003 reformwill also generate some savings relative to the base year
that can be used to finance better targeted social programs or essential public infrastructure, or
usedto build larger primary surpluses and reduce public debt. The administrative reforms to the

                                                 27

RGPS and initial policy actions in the disability area should contribute to a reduction in RGPS
deficits and generate similar benefits. The reforms to the complementary private pension system
will strengthen the regulatory framework and expand voluntary coverage, benefiting a larger
number o fworkers.

                                       C.     Possible FutureLoans
89.      Over the next three years one or two additional fiscal reform loans dedicated to pension
reform could be proposed, as a critical mass o f further pension reform actions or institutional
improvements i s implemented. The policy actions that are important to remove the imbalances
o f the pension system are identified inthe second column o f Table 14 and insome more detail in
the pension policy matrix in Annex 4. The Bank would also assess progress in meeting the
outcome indicators expected for 2006 (Table 15) before considering new loans. Finally, the
decision to move ahead with further loans would also depend on the continued implementation
o f a sound macroeconomic program, evidenced inter alia in robust primary fiscal surpluses and
furtherprogress inimprovingdebt indicators.

90.      As mentioned before, the government is initiating an administrative reform to the RGPS
and also plans to implement a comprehensive reform of the disability scheme, involving not only
reforms to the work injury program, but also comprehensive reforms to the main disability
scheme, including a redesign o f disability benefits, changes in medical criteria and certification,
and rehabilitation programs. The government expects these two reforms to be substantially
implemented during the second half o f 2005 and 2006, and to contribute to a significant
reduction in the RGPS deficit during this period. The government also believes that it has to
exhaust the possibility for reducing the RGPS deficit through these reforms before proposing
another major parametric reform to the Brazilian society.

91.      During 2005 and 2006 the draft law on the new complementary funds for federal civil
servants should be approved andthe funds should start operating. Some states andmunicipalities
may also create their funds during this period, probably following the federal government's
model. Implementinga sound regulatory framework for these complementary funds is a critical
policy action, as it would ensure the safe and effective management o f civil servant contributions
and assets, and adequate complementary pensions in the future.                       It would also prevent the
creation o f future contingent fiscal liabilities for the government.

92.      These policy actions could form the basis for another loan, as they would address critical
problems that were not well covered by the early and recent reforms, and that have contributed to
the recent increase in RGPS deficits. Other important policy actions that should be finalized in
the near future include the adoption by PREVIC of a risk-based supervision development plan
and the elaboration o f sound and detailed fundingregulations for the pension fund sector. This i s
a complex technical regulation that needs to be well elaborated, in order to remove the actuarial
imbalances that have beset the complementary pension system, and that have in many cases
affected the profits o f state-owned enterprises and deprivedthe budgeto fvaluable resources.2o

                                                        28

93.      It is possible that in the next three years the conditions will exist for implementing
another major parametric reform to the RGPS. Inthis occasion the government may also be able
to harmonize further the RPPS and the RGPS rules. These policy actions could form the basis
for a final policy loan focused on pension reform-if                these actions were implemented the
remaining imbalances would be substantially removed and the program would have achieved its
final objectives.

                             D.       ProgramGoals and ExpectedOutcomes


94.      The goals o f the program o f fiscal reform loans dedicated to pensions are described inthe
first column o f Table 15, the expected program outcomes in the next two years are identified in
the second column, and the contribution o f the program to CAS objectives are examined inthe
third column. The goals include adequate and sustainable pension benefits in both pension
regimes, expansion o f coverage, and protection o f lower income pensioners. At a minimum, the
program should arrest the growth o f pension expenditures and deficits, in order to avoid fiscal
imbalances and/or cuts in essential fiscal expenditures. The baseline objective o f the program
entails some reduction inpension deficits inorder to enable larger primary surpluses and further
decreases in public debt, and/or open room for other fiscal expenditures and/or allow some
reduction incontributions.

95.      The program should lead inter alia to an increase inthe average length o f service and the
average retirement age, a slower growth inthe number o f new pensioners, declining new average
benefits relative to the average existing benefits, stable or declining new disability claims, and a
substantial reduction inirregular benefits. These are indicators o fprogress that can be monitored
inrelatively short periods o ftime andthat revealwhether the programis ontrack.

96.     Finally, the program would make a significant contribution to the objectives set in the
2003 CAS, o f a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable Brazil. The program would contribute
to a sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic framework and ensure the basic conditions for the
successful implementation o f Brazil's development program and the Bank's assistance strategy.
The program would also make a more direct contribution to a more equitable Brazilbyprotecting
low income pensioners, imposing a greater adjustment on higher income pensioners, preventing
furtherdeficits andresultingcuts inessential fiscal programs, and openingroom for an expansion
inthese programs.


                               VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                                    A.     Povertyand Social Impacts
97.     The December 2003 reform will have a positive social impact, by contributing to poverty
alleviation and to a reduction inincome inequalities, especially the latter. Such a contribution to
positive social outcomes can be expected for three mainreasons. First, the reform does not affect
the specific components o f the pension system that provide income support to the poor. These
components include the minimum pension, the eligibility rules for participation in the rural
pensionprogram that i s tailored for poor rural workers, and the urban old age retirement program


                                                        30

that i s tailored for poor urbanworkers with short careers inthe formal sector. These benefits are
delivered through the RGPS systemthat was not the object o f Constitutional Amendment No. 41.

98.       Second, the reform affects precisely the regime that has produced the most inequitable
outcomes - the RPPS - without affecting the poor pensioners in the regime, as all the
components o f the December 2003 reform were designedto protect low income public retirees.
For instance, the new 11 percent contribution only applies to income above a threshold equal to
three times the average wage, and even if the'threshold declines to twice the average wage (as
expected) lower income public pensioners will still be exempted. The reduction in survivor
benefits will follow a similar rule. The reduction in benefits resulting from the new pension
calculation formula i s higher for people with steeper wage growth history, who tend to be well
educated high earners. Finally, the new and less generous benefit indexation rule will affect
relatively more retirees with longer life expectancies, which tend to be higher income retirees.

99.       Third, the reform will ensure fiscal and macroeconomic outcomes that are essential for
the fight against poverty and the reduction in inequalities. For one, the reform will arrest the
growth o fpension deficits andhelp preserve fiscal balance and low inflation. This i s an essential
outcome, as the experience in the 1980s and 1990s has shown that inflation i s a tax that affects
primarily the poor. Moreover, the reform will prevent cuts in essential programs that benefit
primarily the poor and reduce social inequities, such as education, health, better targeted social
assistance, or basic infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation). In fact, the reform i s expected to
produce some savings that, albeit moderate, may free additional resources for these programs.
The Government may also decide to channel any freed resources to increase the primary surplus
and reduce further the public debt. This option may not benefit immediately the poor, but will
open more room for a much needed expansion o f investment and higher growth rates. This will
not only allow an expansion o f formal employment, but will also open room for a real increase in
essential fiscal expenditures over time, both o fwhich will benefit the poor.

100.      Finally, it must be noted that, while these pension savings are being generated by a
reduction in the level o f benefits, it must be stressed that the pre-reform benefit levels in the
RPPS were excessively high, by international comparison and by comparison with RGPS
benefits. Finally, new civil servants hired after December 2003 will be more affected by the
reform, but will receive benefits that are more comparable with those provided by pension
systems inthe OECD countries.

                                        B.      Supervision
101.      Regular Bank missions will interact closely with staff o f the Ministryo f Social Security
and the Ministryo f Finance, to review government progress inimplementingthe December 2003
reform and ensuring that the expected savings materialize. This will also include reviewing
government progress in improving the administration o f the RGPS and the RPPS, and in
designing a coherent reform to the disability scheme. Bank missions will also review whether
the new complementary hnds for civil servants are subject to a sound regulatory framework
designed to ensure the efficient management o f pension assets. Bank staff will also need to
interact with PREVIC, given its responsibility for supervising all pension funds, including the
new complementary funds for civil servants.




                                                 31

                                       C.    FiduciaryAspects
102.    The World Bank finalized in 2002 a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) for Brazil, that was discussed with the Government and which has been used to draw
key conclusions on the country's public financial management (PFM) arrangements. Brazil has
well developed PFM arrangements (among the most robust in the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region), ensuring that Bank lending i s done in context o f acceptable oversight
arrangements. Notwithstandingsome desirable improvements that could be made (and which are
being tackled within the scope of the reforms launched to sustain the Government's focus to
improve and modemize public sector management), the Brazilian system o f public financial
management provides reliable information, contains adequate systems to manage and track the
receipt and use o f funds at national level, and provides a high level of fiscal transparency. In
particular, improved budget formats and enhanced internal controls to support managerial
decisions and external oversight; a new institutional setup for the government's audit function; as
well as the expansion o f SIAFI to increase its programmatic functionality, are all important
developments which took place after the delivery o f the CFAA. These conditions support any
DPL program. Inlight o f the adequate control framework assisting public finance operations, the
risk to bothBank and country's own funds i s low.

                               D.        DisbursementandAuditing
103.    Once the Bank notifies the Borrower o f the effectiveness o f the Loan Agreement, the
National Treasury of the Federative Republic o f Brazil will submit a withdrawal application
requesting the proceeds o f the loan to be deposited by the Bank into an account designated bythe
National Treasury, to be subsequently transferred to the country's official foreign exchange
reserves administered by the Central Bank o f Brazil. At the same time, an equivalent amount in
Brazilian Reais will be credited to the National Treasury's Single Account, thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. The National Treasury will then provide the Bank
with awritten confirmation ofthe deposit o fthe proceeds o fthe loan.

104.    The IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the Central Bank o f Brazil concluded that the Central
Bank does not present widespread vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding ofFund
resources. Inparticular, its audit i s conducted by an intemationally recognized audit firm, while its
internal audit fimction contributes effectively to the institution's intemal control systems.
Therefore, from a fiduciary point o f view, the control environment, procedures and regulations
governing the Central Bank's operations are generally adequate. Given that there i s adequate
knowledge about the soundness o f the country's public financial management system, additional
fiduciary arrangements(such as a dedicated Deposit Account) have not been deemednecessary.

                                   E.      EnvironmentalAspects
 105.   The proposed loan supports fiscal reforms with a focus on social security reforms. The
changes supported by the loan have a policy, regulatory or institutional dimension. The proposed
loan will provide general budgetary support as opposed to financing specific investments, andthe
fiscal policies addressed under the proposed loan are not likely to cause significant effects on the
country's environment, forests and other natural resources.




                                                  32

                                F.      RisksandRiskMitigation
106.    The major risks related to the December 2003 reform and the proposed loan include the
following: (i)  low wage and GDP growth affecting the projected savings; (ii)        continued high
growth o f disability benefits; (iii) Government contributions to the complementary pension
                                     high
funds o f civil servants; (iv) substantial retention of risk by the Government as the sponsor o f
complementary pension funds of civil servants ;(v) actuarial imbalances inthe pension funds of
public sector companies; (vi) retroactive changes to the December 2003 reform. These risks are
briefly assessedbelow.

107.    Low wage and GDP growth. Very low wage and GDP growth inthe future would affect
negatively the projected savings o f the reform because some o f the savings result fkom the
difference betweenprice and wage changes, i.e., they dependon real wage growth. However, the
risk that the projected savings from the reforms will not materialize due to the low GDP and
wage growth is low, as the assumptions used in the simulations are reasonable and even
conservative.

108.    High growth of disability benefits. There is a significant risk that disability benefits may
continue increasing in coming months, as the disability system has not been reformed yet. This
would partially offset the savings expected from the December 2003 reform, as it has happened
with the November 1999 reform.          In the medium- and long-runs this risk is moderate, as
disability reform is in the Government's agenda and the reform should start being implemented
in2006.

109.    High government contributions to the Complementary civil servant funds. At the time o f
writing, the draft law on the establishment of complementary funds for federal civil servants
included a reasonable ceiling on government contributions. However, there i s a risk, that these
limits may be changed or eliminated during the legislative negotiations.           The risk of fiscal
imbalances arising from high contributions i s limited, however, because the federal wage bill
amounts to less than 3 percent of GDP and the federal Government will contribute only for the
portion o fwage income above the threshold o f three times the average income. Inthe case o fthe
states the portion o f the wage bill above the threshold i s substantially smaller.

110.    Substantial risk retention by the government as the sponsor of complementary civil
sewant pensionfunds. The draft law on the new complementary funds does not contain specific
provisions preventing the fund to assume substantial risks or establishing reserves and other
safeguards to address these risks.     The absence o f specific provisions in these areas and the
absence o f adequate funding rules for pension plans inBrazil could result in fiscal liabilities for
the sponsoring federal and subnational governments.            However, the requirement for plan
approval by PREVIC would potentially mitigate such risks. Moreover, PREVIC is determined to
introduce new fundingrules following best intemational practice, which will significantly reduce
these risks.   Finally, there are ongoing discussions in the Government to introduce additional
restrictions inorder to limit further these risks.

111. Persistent actuarial imbalances in the pension funds of public sector companies. As
mentioned before, funding rules for pension funds are inadequate. As a result, pension funds
have frequently disclosed large actuarial imbalances that are ultimately covered by the sponsor.
Inthe case ofpublic sector companies, this has implieda smaller distribution ofprofits to the


                                                  33

budget. This risk is significant today, but is also expected to be addressed through the
introduction o f sound fundingrules for all pension funds.

112.    Retroactive changes to some of the measures of the December 2003 reform. At the time
of writing, a package o f changes to some o f the December 2003 reform measures was being
considered in Senate. The package proposes changes in the transition rules, changes in the
overall wage and benefit ceilings, and exemptions to the 11percent contribution for the disabled.
The proposed changes could weaken the projected short- and medium-term savings for the
federal government by up to 20 percent. However, some o f the proposals could have positive
savings effects inthe short- and medium-runs for subnational governments. Inthe long-run, the
proposed changes would weaken the projected savings, but this is also the time when major
savings of the December 2003 reform should be delivered. Overall, the risk of a major reversal
o f the December 2003 reform i s considered moderate, because the most radical changes are
unlikely to be approved by Senate (in part due to strong pressures by federal and state
governments), and because those that are likely to be passed will not weaken the projected
combined savings in a substantive way.

        TRANSLATION OF THE LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
                                     (NOT OFFICIAL)



                                                                     Brasflia, May 6,2005



Mr.James D.Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington, D C


Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:


1.      This letter of development policy discusses progress in the economic stability
program of the Brazilian Government, including progress in maintaining a stable fiscal
policy framework and reforming the social security system.         Brazil's social security
reforms are central components of the Government's overall fiscal reform program. We
believe that these reforms constitute important initiatives of the Brazilian Government to
be supported by the Bank under a programmatic development policy loan.


Fiscal Reformsand Macroeconomic Stability

2.      Since 1999 the Brazilian Government has maintained strict fiscal policies,
designed to correct the fiscal imbalances that accumulated at the federal and subnational
levels during the second half of the decade. These fiscal imbalances aggravated the
problems caused by a rigid exchange rate regime, and contributed to growing external
imbalances inthis period. The fiscal imbalances are indicated b y primary deficits inmost
years, overall deficits of 6 to 8 percent of GDP, and the substantial increase in the public
debt, from 30 to 50 percent of GDP between 1995 and 1999. The external imbalances are
reflected in the increase in current account deficits from 2.6 to 4.7 percent of GDP, and
the increase inexternal debt from about 20 to 45 percent o f GDP duringthe same period.

3.      The adoption of a strict fiscal policy framework since that year i s indicated by the
sharp turnaround in the primary surpluses of the public sector, from deficits in the mid-
1990s to surpluses exceeding 3 percent of GDP at the turn of the century. Even more
importantly, the Government implemented in the same period a number of critical
reforms designed to institutionalize fiscal discipline at the federal and subnational levels.



                                             35

These reforms included the restructuring of subnational debt subject to strict conditions
imposed on states and municipalities, the approval of the Law of Fiscal Responsibility
and the Law on Fiscal Crimes, and important social security reforms.

4.      These reforms producedmany positive effects at the turn of the century. The ratio
of public debt to GDP was stabilized in 2000, there was a recovery of economic activity
in the same year, inflation was kept at single digits despite a sharp currency devaluation
in 1999, and the current account deficits were reduced. However, these efforts proved
insufficient to address the hostile external environment in 2001 and 2002.

5.      Despite the Government's efforts to increase the primary surplus and the Central
Bank's efforts to tighten monetary policy, sovereign spreads in secondary markets
increased to levels above 2,500 basis points, and the currency depreciated sharply. The
currency depreciation in turn contributed to an increase in inflation to 15 percent p.a. and
to an increase in public debt to levels above 60 percent of GDP. This sharp increase in
the ratio of public debt to GDP was primarily due to the high share of public debt linked
to the exchange rate. The increase in interest rates caused by the tight monetary policy
also contributed to the increase in public debt, as a share of the debt i s linked to short-
term interest rates.

6.      The Lula Government addressed promptly the lack of confidence and the growing
instability by raising further primary surpluses to 4.3 and 4.6 of GDP in 2003 and 2004-
above the budgetary targets inthose two years. The Government has also built consensus
for long overdue structural reforms, including an important pension reform in 2003, and
the approval of two critical pieces of legislation, namely, the new Bankruptcy Law and
the Law of Public-Private Partnerships. The commitment to fiscal discipline and
macroeconomic stability that has been demonstrated by the Government have led to a
sharp improvement in market confidence, as indicated by a currency appreciation and a
sharpreductioninsovereign spreads to about 400 basis points.

7.      The adoption of sound economic policies has also been rewarded by a solid
improvement in the performance o f the Brazilian economy over the past two years. The
external performance has been remarkable, as indicatedby the sharp growth of exports in
2003 and 2004 (16 and 20 percent, respectively) and the generation of large trade and
current account surpluses in 2004-5.5      and 2 percent of GDP, respectively-the     largest
surpluses ever recorded in recent history. The growth of exports led to a sharp recovery
of economic activity, as indicated by the 5.3 percent GDP growth in 2004, the highest
growth rate since the early 1990s. Moreover, during 2004 private consumption and
investment grew at 4.7 and 7.4 percent, respectively, suggesting that the base of recovery
has broadened. The recovery of economic activity has been accompanied by a reduction
ininflation to one digit levels.

8.      The larger primary surpluses, the sharp recovery of exports and GDP, and the
currency appreciation have resulted in a dramatic improvement of all debt indicators.
The net public debt has declined to about 51 percent of GDP, whereas the improvement
of external debt indicators over the past two years has been even more impressive-the



                                              36

ratio of net external debt to GDP has declined from 36 to 22 percent of GDP, and the
ratio o f net external debt to exports has declined from 270 to 140 percent. Moreover, the
share of public domestic debt indexed to the exchange rate has declined from 37 to 6
percent. These indicators reveal an economy that i s less vulnerable and more resilient to
shocks.

9.       We will continue pursuingsound fiscal policies in 2005 and future years, aimed at
reducing further domestic and external debt ratios and the vulnerability o f the Brazilian
economy to external shocks. We are also committed to reduce the tax burden and
improve the quality of fiscal expenditures in the coming years, re-orienting expenditures
to priority programs such as education and health, social programs targeted at the poorest
segments of the population, and to urgently needed public infrastructure.          This i s a
challenge that needs to be constantly addressed, in order to ensure the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability, pave the way for sustained growth rates, and reduce the levels
of poverty and income inequality. Meeting this challenge will require further efforts to
reduce other current expenditures, including administration and pension expenditures.


The Importance of Social Security Reforms

10.      As you may know, Brazil has two main retirement regimes for workers in the
private and the public sectors of the economy: the RGPS (Regime Geral de Previdgncia
Social) for workers in the private sector, and the RPPS (Regime Prdprio de Previdgncia
Social) for public sector workers at the federal, state and municipal levels of government.
Both regimes operate on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis. In addition to these mandatory
public pension regimes, workers can contribute on a voluntary basis to complementary
private pension plans, which can be closed or open. Closed plans are sponsored by
employers or professional associations while open plans are managed by insurance
companies and other private financial providers. The assets of closed plans account for 17
percent of GDP, or the bulk of total private pension assets.

11.      Social security reforms play a central role inthe design of fiscal reforms inBrazil,
because both RGPS and RPPS pension expenditures grew significantly in the 1990s and
early 2000s, from about 4 percent of GDP at the start of the decade to almost 12 percent
of GDP inrecent years. These expenditures account for about 40 percent of total primary
expenditures of the consolidated public sector, and have generated increasing deficits,
amounting today for more than 5.5 percent of GDP.                Such increase in pension
expenditures and deficits was due to several factors, including non-sustainable eligibility
and benefit rules, the stabilization o f the currency in 1994, which led to an increase in the
average real value of benefits, and special programs such as the rural pension program.


Previous Social Security Reforms

 12.     The sharp increase in pension expenditures during the 1990s prompted the
Government to initiate pension reforms at the end of the decade. The first important step



                                               37

was taken in December 1998 through Constitutional amendment No. 20, which removed
the generous benefit formula from the Constitutional text, opening the way for further
reforms. It also introduced several specific changes, such as a benefit ceiling in the
RGPS indexed to inflation, the elimination of most special regimes, an increase in the
minimumage of retirement inthe RPPSto 60-55 for men andwomen respectively, with a
period o f transition, a minimum vesting period of 10 years to receive the higher RPPS
benefits, and the tightening of several other rules.

13.     The second important step took place in November 1999, involving a major
reform to the RGPS. This reform was centered in a new benefit formula labeled as the
Futor Previdencidrio that rewards years of contribution while also taking into
consideration life expectancy at retirement. The new formula will reduce future
replacement ratios, relative to the generous replacement ratio of 100 percent that had
been established by the 1988 Constitution, and also reduced significantly the large
original actuarial imbalances of the RGPS.


Current Social Security Reforms

TheDecember 2003 Reform to the RPPS

14.     Since 2003 the Government has focused its reform efforts in the RPPS, because
this regime was largely unaffected by the previous reforms, and because RPPS
expenditures amount to nearly half of total pension expenditures and three fourths of total
pension deficits, despite a much smaller number of beneficiaries-retired          federal, state
and municipal servants account for only 11 percent of Brazil's 26 million pensioners.
The disproportionately large expenditures and deficits in the RPPS are primarily due to
much higher benefits and replacement ratios, and also imply large regressive transfers
and inequities inthe pension system. Inaddition, RPPS expenditures and deficits without
reform were projectedto increase further inthe future, especially at the level of states and
municipalities, which have less mature systems than the federal government, and a much
higher proportion of female employees, especially teachers, who can retire earlier and
have a longer life expectancy.        Such an increase in projected expenditures would
aggravate the already tight fiscal situation of Brazilian states and municipalities.

 15.    The reform to the RPPS was achieved through Constitutional Amendment No. 41,
approved by Congress in December 2003.              The reform has introduced a number of
measures that reduce significantly projected deficits, especially at the level of states and
municipalities, while also increasing the degree of harmonization between the RGPS and
RPPS schemes, increasing equity and mobility between the private and public sectors.
The reform respects acquired rights and includes detailed transition rules. The list of
introduced measures includes the following:

    Stricter Rulesfor Retirement in the Public Sector. The introduction of penaltiesranging from
    3.5 to 5 percent of the wage base for each year of retirement prior to the normal retirement
    age of 60 for men and 55 for women; the abolition of proportional retirement provisions for
    those who did not have the right to retire from this programbefore the reform; the increase in


                                                 38

   the required years of service in the public sector from 10 to 20 years, and in the last position
   from 5 to 10years;

   New Benefit Formula. The change of the pensionbase, from the last wage to the average of
   80 percentof the highestrealwages after 1994;

   New Indexation Rule. The switch from wage to price indexation of benefits;

   Rules on Acquired Rights. The first two measures do not apply to workers who had already
   acquired the right to retire, under the old rules. The second and third measures do not apply
   to workers who meet the new stricter conditions for retirement.

   Survivor Pensions. A reduction in survivor's pensions-from        100 percent of the original
   pensionto 70 percentabove athresholdof 2,400 Reais per month;

   Imposition of Contributions on RPPS Pensioners. The introduction of a contribution rate of
    11 percent for pensioners, on the benefit portion above the threshold of 2,400 Reais per
    month;

   Imposition of Benefit Ceiling combined with Creation of Complementary Pension Funds. The
    introduction of a benefitlcontribution ceiling equal to the respective ceiling in the RGPS,
    provided that the employer (the federal, state, or municipal Government) creates a
   complementary definedcontribution pensionfund;

    Overall Wage and Benej2 Caps. Maximum wage and benefit levels were introduced, and
    defined by the salary of the respective leaders of the executive, judicial and legislative
    branchesof the federal and subnational governments;

    Minimum Subnational Contribution. The introduction of a minimum contribution of 11
    percentfor all active state andmunicipal civil servants.

16.     We would like to point out that one of the components of the reform-the
imposition of an 11 percent contribution on all beneficiaries-was            legally challenged
during the first half of 2004 and the legal suit had to be eventually judged by the
Brazilian Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruling of August 2004 established that this
measure was constitutional. We consider this ruling to be a landmark, reflecting an
increased awareness and understanding of the whole Brazilian society of the problems in
the social security system andthe need for reform.

17.     The evaluation of the fiscal effects of the reform under reasonable assumptions
shows that the combined measures o f Constitutional Amendment No. 41 should stabilize
the deficits in state and municipal schemes, and slowly reduce them over time in the
federal scheme. Therefore, the reform makes an important contribution to our objective
of maintaining fiscal and macroeconomic stability in the long-run, as well as the
objective of achieving greater social equity.

19.     We understand that the new complementary pension funds that may be introduced
by the federal and subnational Governments should provide a complementary benefit for
new public sector employees without imposing costs on the public finances, inaddition to


                                                  39

the direct contribution of federal and subnational Governments. Any additional costs
would contradict the objectives of the December 2003 reform. For this reason, we will
submit to Congress a Draft Law on the new complementary funds for new federal
employees that establishes that these funds will operate on a defined contribution basis-
in line with Constitutional Amendment No. 41-and        that these funds will be subject to
the same regulatory framework as all the other closed funds in Brazil, that is,
Complementary Laws 108 and 109, all CGPC resolutions, and supervision by the newly
created and autonomous supervision agency, the Superintend2ncia Nacional de
Previdgncia Complementar-PREVIC.

Reforms to the Complementary Pension System

20.     We assign a great importance to the complementary pension system, and have
made substantive efforts to improve the regulatory and supervisory framework for the
closed funds and to expand coverage. Complementary Laws 108 and 109 of 2001 have
provided a sound basic framework for the operations of these funds. The enactment of
these Laws has been followed by the introduction of several important resolutions by the
Conselho de Gestiio de Previdgncia Complementar-CGPC.           We would like to highlight
the importance of two resolutions recently issued, namely, CGPC resolution 6 issued in
October 2003 improving portability and vesting rules, and CGPC resolution 13
strengthening substantially the rules o f corporate governance by pensionfunds.

21.     In addition, to these rules, which are designed to improve the efficiency and
stability of the complementary pension system, we have also adopted measures designed
to expand the coverage of the complementary system to a larger number of workers.
During 2004 we authorized the first funds organized by professional associations-
fundos instituidos.     These funds operate on a defined contribution basis, have to
outsource their main activities, and the contributions by the employer are voluntary. We
expect that these simpler rules of operation will make these funds attractive to a large
number o f participants. The new tax regime for the closed funds introduced b y Law
 11053 o f August 2004, which exempts contributions and investment income and taxes
the final benefits, i s in line with the tax regime adopted in most OECD countries and
should also make voluntary contributions more attractive and expand coverage.

22.     The enactment of Law MP233 of December 2004 that establishes the new
autonomous supervision agency-the       PREVIC-is     an important and recent development,
that also demonstrates our commitment to a sound complementary pension system. The
PREVIC will take over the supervisory functions of the Secretaria de PrevidZncia
 Complementar-SPC-and          will operate with its own source of revenues and with stable
organic rules. The PREVIC will adopt modern techniques of supervision based on risk,
and its creation will ensure a much more effective and stable regulatory framework for
the closed pension fund system, which manages a large volume of assets.

Further Improvements Plannedfor the RGPS System

23.     We understand that the Brazilian social security system still suffers from
imbalances that need to be addressed, and that social security reform should be seen as an
ongoing process, not only inBrazil but also in most other countries. Inparticular, we are
aware that the RGPS reforms of 1998 and 1999 have reduced significantly the actuarial
imbalances of the system, but these imbalances have remained large. However, there are
other problems that have contributed to the increase inRGPS expenditures and deficits in
recent years, including deficiencies in the administration of the system, and a sharp
increase in disability-related benefits, including disability pensions (aposentadoria por
invalidez), worker injury benefits (beneficios acidentdrios) and, especially, sickness
benefits (auxilio-doenga). These disability-related benefits paid b y the RGPS have
increased by 0.5 percent of GDP since 2000 and account for nearly half of the increase in
total RGPS expenditures during the same period.

24.     We have been monitoring the financial and actuarial situation of the RGPS, and
have concluded that it i s essential to exhaust the possibilities for reducing its current and
planned expenditures and deficits through improvements in administration and careful
reforms to the disability scheme, before considering additional parametric reforms.

25.     We are introducing a number of important measures that are likely to strengthen
RGPS revenues and contain expenditures.           At the end of 2004 we created a new
Secretariat for Social Security Revenues, the Secretaria de Receita Previdencidria-
SRP. The SRP has been created with enhanced powers relative to the agency that was in
charge o f revenue collection, the Instituto Nacional de Previde^nciaSocial-INSS-and
will benefit from ongoing improvements in technological infrastructure. This should
allow SRP not only to remove leakages incollection, but also to address more effectively
the large contribution arrears that have accumulated inrecent years.

26.     We are also implementing a new risk management system that i s designed to
prevent and detect inefficiencies, fraud and abuse on the payment of benefits, and that
should contribute to the containment of expenditures.        As part of the same effort, we
have already started implementing a program of recertification of all pensioners, based
initially in the comparison of several databases and the identification of irregularities in
the payment of benefits. We expect this program alone, which will be substantially
implemented over the next few months, to allow us to eliminate many irregular payments
and reduce RGPS expenditures and deficits inthe next two years.

27.     In the area of disability, we are initiating a detailed analysis of our disability-
related expenditures and programs, in order to identify the major problems and prepare
the conditions for well-articulated reforms, designed to contain expenditures while also
improving the welfare o f Brazilian workers. We have already investigated some of the
causes of sickness and disability and found that many sickness and disability cases are
due to under-reported work-related injuries, resulting from the absence of adequate health
and safety standards at the workplace.




                                             41

28.     Inorder to addressthe problemof disability causedby work-related accidents, the
Ministries of Health, Labor, and Social Security have elaborated a comprehensive
program for safety at the workplace that was already approved by the National Council of
Social Security, the Conselho Nacional de Previdzncia Social -CNPS-and         that will be
launched over the coming months. The new program contains four major components,
namely: (i) the coordination of policies and actions by all the Ministries and Government
agencies; (ii)the introduction of minimum health and safety standards at the workplace,
designed to reduce the number of accidents and covering all workers; (iii)the
introduction of a common information collection system and a common database,
designed to collect not only information on actual work accidents, but also risk factors;
and (iv) the introduction of incentives for companies to invest inpreventive measures.

29.     One of the incentives for companies to invest in prevention measures involves a
new and innovative work injury program financed by risk-based contributions that should
be launched in early 2006. This program will measure the health risks in different
industries and enterprises based on the number of presumed work-related cases of
sickness and disability. The new system i s innovative because it does not rely on formal
reporting by the employer, but on the type of sickness. The contribution rates to the
worker injury program will be then linked to the observed hazard rates, penalizing
employers who do not provide proper working conditions and rewarding those who
invest inthe health and safety of their workers.

30.     We are aware that the recent growth of disability-related expenditures i s not only
due to the problem of work injuries, however. Although a full diagnosis of sickness and
disability programs needs to be completed, we believe that the reform of these programs
will probably need to be comprehensive, involving changes in the design of benefits,
medical criteria for certification of disability, training of specialized doctors, and
improved physical and professional rehabilitation programs. We plan to complete the
diagnosis of sickness and disability programs in 2005 and initiate further reforms in 2006.

Further Improvements Plannedfor the Complementary System

31.     We are also planning to continue strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework for the complementary system. One important area of regulation that needs to
be elaborated in greater detail and i s included in the Government's agenda involves the
funding rules for defined benefit and hybrid defined contribution plans. We plan to
review the experiences of other countries and identify best practice, before preparing
detailed regulations. We also expect that PREVIC will build its supervisory capacity
during 2005 and 2006, and change further its supervisory approach, from a compliance-
based to a modern risk-based approach, that identifies risks and corrects problems at an
early stage.

Request for FinancialAssistance

32.    The Government remains firmly committed to its program of reforms as outlined
above and would welcome World Bank financial assistance. We would appreciate the
prompt consideration of the Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan - Social Security Reform,
in support of the social security reform measures that have been already enacted and are
under implementation. We look forward to working together with the World Bank on
other proposedfuture loans as further progress inthese areas take place.

              THE GOVERNMENT'SPENSIONREFORMPROGRAM



Basic Description of the Brazilian Pension System

1.      Brazil has two main retirement regimes for legally employed workers in the private and
the public sectors of the formal economy: the RGPS (Regime Geral de PrevidCncia Social) for
workers in the private sector, and the RPPS (Regime Pr6prio de Previdgncia Social) for public
sector workers at the federal, state and municipal levels of government. Both regimes are
designed to operate on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis, where the contributions of current workers
finance the benefits of the covered elderly. However, both regimes have been in deficit, requiring
largeannualbudgetarytransfers from federal, state, andmunicipal Governments.

2.      Workers are legally required to participate in the formal retirement security regimes by
contributing to the RGPS or the RPPS, depending on their sector of employment. The actual
number of workers contributing to either of these two programs i s less than 40 percent of the
labor force, reflecting the relatively high degree of informality. This coverage ratio i s higher than
the average ratio in Latin America, but lower than ratios in the OECD and Central Europe.
However, coverage of the elderly i s much higher, amounting to about 85 percent of the
population above 65 years of age. This i s the highest coverage ratio of the elderly in Latin
America, and reflects the existence of special quasi-contributory programs, especially inthe rural
area.

3.      Inaddition to the mandatory publicpensionregimes, workers cancontribute on avoluntary
basis to complementary private pension plans, which can be either closed or open. Closed plans
are offered by employers or professional associations and managed by closed pension funds.
Open plans are offered by insurance companies and other private financial providers, andcomprise
both employer-basedandindividual plans. The assets of closed-endfunds account for 17 percent of
GDP, or the bulk of total pension assets, but the open funds have grown more rapidly in recent
years. The closed pension funds are supervised by the Secretariat of Complementary Pensions
(SPC) in the Ministry of Social Security.       Starting in July 2005, the pension funds will be
supervised by the newly created autonomous agency, the Superintendencia de PrevidCncia
Complementar. The open funds are supervised by the Insurance Supervisory Agency (SUSEP),
which has reportingobligations to the Ministry of Finance.

The Emergence of Imbalances inthe 1990s

4.       Pension expenditures increased significantly during the 199Os, from about 4 percent of
GDP in 1990to almost 12percent of GDP in 2004 (Figure 1). This outcome was due to increases
in expenditures inboth PAYG schemes. The increase in RPPS expenditures happened across all
three levels of government, but was initially more pronounced in the case of states and
municipalities, which were allowed to create new pension systems in the early 1990s. By 1992
pension expenditures in states and municipalities had reached the same levels of pension
expenditures in the federal government. Pension deficits were small in the early 1990s and even
decreased slightly during this period, when the federal and subnational Governments started
charging contributions on their employees. However, since 1993 deficits have increased in line
 with the increaseinexpenditures, reaching 5.5 percent of GDP inrecent years (Figure 1).

5.      The increase in pension expenditures was pronounced in the early 1990s, and was
primarily due to the 1988 Constitution, which increased benefits that were already generous and
relaxed further eligibility rules which were already liberal. For example, non-contributory rural
benefits and survivor pensions were nearly doubled, old age RGPS benefits were increased by
more generous past wage valorization rules, the large number of civil servants which were
contributing for the RGPS were transferred to the more generous RPPS regimes, and the
minimumlengthof contributions for women was reduced. Most of these generousprovisions had
a delayed effect on the expenditures, because ordinary laws regulating the new benefits were
introduced only a few years later. Finally, some of these generous provisions were retroactive to
1988, causing an immediate and large increase inexpenditures.

6.      As a result of this sharp increase in expenditures, Brazil has today disproportionately
large pension expenditures for its middle level of per capita income and relatively young
demographic structure. As shown in Figure 2, Brazil spends about 7 percent of GDP more than
the levels predicted by an international regression of pension spending against the old age
dependency ratio. The level of expenditures are excessive, even considering that a share of
RGPS expenditures is related to rural and urban pension programs that alleviate poverty and meet
valuable social objectives.

The 1998 and 1999 PensionReforms

7.      The sharp increase in pension expenditures and deficits in the 1990s contributed to an
overall increase in fiscal deficits and to a substantial increase in public debt, leading to a crisis at
the end of the decade. The crisis prompted the Government to launch a comprehensive program
of fiscal reforms, including pension reforms. The first important step was taken in December
 1998 through Constitutional amendment No. 20, which removed the generous benefit formula
from the Constitutional text, opening the way for further reforms. It also introduced several
specific changes, such as a benefit ceiling in the RGPS indexed to inflation, the elimination of
most special regimes, a minimum age of retirement in the RPPS (60-55 for men and women
respectively) with a period of transition, a minimumvesting period of 10 years to receive higher
RPPSbenefits, and the tightening of several other rules.


                                                   46

8.       The second important step took place inNovember 1999, involvinga major reform to the
RGPS. This reform was centered in a new benefit formula called the Futor Previdenci6rio that
resembles the notional defined contribution (NDC) schemes introduced in Sweden, Poland, and
Latvia. The new formula rewards years of contribution and will also result in a decline in
replacement ratios relative to the previous replacement ratio of 100 percent. The 1998 and 1999
reforms are also projected to reduce the long-run RGPS deficits by half-from      12 to 5-6 percent
of GDP in 2050, as shown inTable 1.

9.       RGPS expenditures and deficits increased by 1.2 percent of GDP between 1999 and
2004, but this increase does not reflect a failure of the 1998-1999 reforms. As shown inFigure3
and Figure 4, the reforms have had a positive impact in the average years of contribution, and
since 2001 on the average benefit as well. The 1998 and 1999 reforms impacted primarily
workers retiring under the length of service (LOS) rule, which account for the largest share of old
age pension expenditures. Workers can also retire under the age rule of 65/60 (60/55 in the rural
areas) but this i s largely a redistributional program and these retirees receive in most cases the
minimumpension.

10.      As shown in Table 2 and Table 3, the savings of the reform are also reflected in the
modest increase in old age benefits, and most particularly in the decrease inLOS benefits relative
to GDP, which resulted in a decline in the share of LOS benefits in total RGPS benefits from 40
to 33 percent. Roughly half of the increase in RGPS expenditures since 1999 has been due to
increases in disability-related expenditures that were not predicted at the time of the reform.
Other factors include the real increase in minimum wages affecting the level of minimum
pensions and social assistancebenefits. Therefore, these expenditures mask the savings produced
by the RGPS reforms. The increase in disability-related expenditures has been large and
unexpected, and has resulted from flaws in the system of disability benefits that have become
apparent inrecent years, and that will be examined inmore detail below.

Current Pension Reforms

TheRationalefor the December 2003 Reform to the RPPS

11.      The third important step took place in December 2003, through Constitutional
amendment No. 41, and involved a reform to the RPPS. The importance assigned by the Lula
Government to an RPPS reform was strongly justified for at least three reasons. First, although
the RGPS remained actuarially imbalanced, it had been reformed in the late 1990s, and such
reforms had already entailed a significant reduction in benefits and replacement ratios. Second,
since 1999 the federal and subnational Governments had been making an enormous effort to



                                                48

generate primary surpluses in order to restore fiscal equilibrium and open room for urgent
expenditures in education, health, basic infrastructure, and targeted social assistance, but pension
expenditures and deficits remained large and continued to increase, imposing an increasing
burden on the public finances. Third, the much more generous RPPS benefits implied large
regressive transfers and social inequities in the pension system, contributing to Brazil's extreme
income inequalities.

12.      The burden imposed by the RPPS system on the public finances i s illustrated in Tables 4
and 5. As shown in Table 4, between the late 1990s and the early 2000s the federal and
subnational governments increased the average primary surplus from 0.4 to 2.9 percent of GDP,
while their combined RPPS deficits increased from 3.6 to 4 percent of GDP. These contrasting
trends implied increasing limits on other essential fiscal expenditures and the imposition of an
increasing tax burden on the economy.

13.      The federal government made the greatest contribution to the generation of primary
surpluses in this period, but the states also made strenuous efforts to adjust their finances, and
these efforts can be better appreciated by examining further their expenditures and revenues. As
shown inTable 5, duringthe early 2000s the subnationals made a strong effort to comply with the
60 percent limit on the ratio of personnel expenditures to own revenues (personnel expenditures
also include pensions) that had been imposed as a condition for the restructuring of their debts,
and by the Law of Fiscal Responsibility. However, the rapidly maturing pension systems
generatedincreasing numbers of pensioners, which forced subnationals to contain severely wages
and the numbers of active personnel.        This situation, reflected in the increase in pension
expenditures in personnel expenditures, implied that wages had to be frozen, sometimes to very
low levels, and/or that subnationals had to sacrifice the delivery of essential services to the
population. By 2003, the fiscal situation of subnational governments had reached a critical
situation, with most state governors pressing the federal government for a reformto the RPPS.

 14.     The political debate during 2003 did not include discussions about the long-run actuarial
situation of the RPPS, possibly because of the lack of accurate and publicly available information
about the state and municipal systems. However, these simulations would simply reinforce the
rationale for reform. As shown in Figure 5, RPPS deficits would continue increasing in the
absence of reform, due primarily to growing imbalances in the RPPS of subnationals, which are
much less mature relative to the federal RPPS, and therefore, will experience a significant
decrease in support ratios. The simulations indicate that the RPPS deficits would be similar or
even larger than those projected for the RGPS, producing even greater strains on the public
finances, especially the finances of subnational governments (subnational pension systems are
 examined inmore detail below).

 15.     The inequities produced by the Brazilian pension system also became more apparent
 during the early 2000s, and constituted another argument for the RPPS reform. As shown in
 Table 6, these inequities are clearly revealed by the disproportion between the numbers of
 beneficiaries and the volumes of expenditures. While the beneficiaries in the combined RPPS
 schemes of the federal, states and municipal governments account for only 13 percent of total
 beneficiaries, they are responsible for 42 percent of total pension expenditures and 72 percent of
 total pension deficits. The disproportionately large expenditures and deficits in the regime for
 civil servants are primarily due to much higher average benefits, as shown inTable 6.

 16.     The regressiveness of RPPS subsidies can also be illustrated by the ratio of deficits to
 beneficiaries. As shown in Figure 6, this ratio in the federal RPPS is 20 times higher than the
 equivalent ratio in the RGPS. The degree of regressivenessis even worse considering the higher

average life expectancy of WPS pensioners, leading them to receive higher benefits for a longer
period of time. This only amplifies the extreme income inequalities inBrazil.

17.     The much lower benefits in the RGPS reflect in part the redistributive elements of the
system such as the minimumpension, especially the minimumpension in the non-contributory
rural scheme. Rural old age retirement benefits can be considered as non-contributory, because
they are not linked to contribution history, although the RGPS receives some contributions from
the sales of produce. As shown in Table 7, the RGPS scheme delivers the minimumpension to
12 million pensioners or about 60 percent of the total number of RGPS pensioners.
Approximately 6.7 million of these pensioners or more than half of the pensioners receiving the
minimumpayment live in rural areas. This program contributed significantly to the reduction in
rural poverty during the 1990s. If the rural program was excluded, the RGPS deficit would be
reduced to roughly one fourth of its 2003 level, but the levels of rural poverty would increase
substantially.

The Componentsof the December 2003 Reform

18.      The RPPS reform was first submitted to Congress in April 2003, and approved in
December 2003 through Constitutional Amendment No. 41. The reform includes stricter rules
for retirement in the public sector, less generous benefit and indexation formulas, less generous
survivor pensions, the possibility for imposing an overall benefit ceiling subject to the creation of
a complementary pension fund, overall wage and benefit caps on current pensioners, and the
imposition of an 11 percent contribution on all public sector retirees. The components of the
December 2003 reform are briefly explained in Box 1.

19.      The reform introduces particularly stringent conditions for new civil servants hiredafter
its approval, and implies a partial harmonization of the PAYG systems for private and public
sector workers. The reform also has a significant impact on the large numbers of workers who
had not acquired the right to retire and have not complied with the eligibility rules. These
workers will have to either postpone retirement or retire early facing heavy penalties. Current
pensioners, workers who have already acquired the right to retire, or are in conditions to comply
with the new eligibility rules, will contribute to the reform effort by paying the new contribution
of 11percent above the threshold. The reform will not affect military personnel, the police and
firefighters.

             Box 1:MainComponentsof the December 2003 Reformto the RPPS
1) Stricter Rules for Retirement in the Public Sector. The introduction of penalties ranging
from 3.5 to 5 percent of the wage base for each year of retirement prior to the normal retirement
age of 60 for men and 55 for women; the abolition of proportional retirement provisions for those
who did not have the right to retire from this program before the reform; the increase in the
required years of service in the public sector from 10 to 20 years, and in the last position from 5
to 10years.
2) New Benefit Formula.The change of the pension base, from the last wage to the average of
80 percent of the highest real wages after 1994;
3) New IndexationRule.The switchfromwage to price indexationof benefits;
4) Rules on Acquired Rights. Measures (1)-(3) do not apply to workers who had already
acquired the right to retire, under the old mles. Measures (2)-(3) do not apply to workers who
meet the new stricter conditions for retirementdescribed in (1).
5) Survivor Pensions. A reduction in survivor's pensions-from           100 percent of the original
pension to 70 percent above a threshold of 2,400 Reais per month;
6) Imposition of Contributions/Taxon RPPS Pensioners. The introduction of a contribution
rate of 11percent for pensioners, on the benefit portion above the threshold of 2,400 Reais per
month;
7) Imposition of Benefit Ceilingcombined with Creation of Complementary PensionFunds.
The introduction of a benefitkontribution ceiling equal to the respective ceiling in the RGPS,
provided that the employer (the federal, state, or municipal Government) creates a
complementary defined contribution pension fund;
8) Overall Wage and Benefit Caps. Maximum wage and benefit levels were introduced, and
defined by the salary of the respective leaders of the executive, judicial and legislative branches
of the federal and subnational governments;
9) Minimum Subnational Contribution. The introduction of a minimum contribution of 11
percent for all active state and municipal civil servants;
 10)RGPS Ceiling. The RGPS contributionhenefit ceiling was raised to 2,400 Reais per month.

20.     The impact of the 2003 reform was evaluated separately for the federal and subnational
pension regimes. As there i s no detailed data on most state and municipal regimes, the
simulations for subnationals were basedon the detailed database of the state of Minas Gerais.

21.     The use of the database of one state to derive projections for all subnationals involves
invariably some mistakes that need to be taken into account. However, the simulations based on
Minas Gerais data should capture well the impact of the reform on all subnationals because of
important common characteristics. First, Minas Gerais i s a large state that accounts for 10percent
of Brazil's GDP and has a per capita income very close to the national average. Second, all
subnational pension schemes are immature relative to the federal scheme, as indicated by
significantly higher support ratios and lower dependency and survivor ratios (Table 8).        The
Minas Gerais system is more mature (or less immature) than most other states, as shown in Table
9, but the Minas Gerais individual database was adjusted to the average subnational support and
dependency ratios shown in Table 8. Third, the share of public employment not affected by the
reform i s much lower in the case of subnationals (e.g. police, firemen) than in the case of the
federal government (e.g. military). Fourth, the occupational structure of state employment is
similar across states, with a predominance of female education and health workers, and the
average age does not differ too much.

22.     The basic macroeconomic assumptions employed in the simulations are shown in Table
10. Real GDP growth is assumedto increase gradually from 4 to 4.5 percent p.a. in the first two
decades, and to decline gradually to about 3.5 percent p.a. thereafter. Iwas also assumedthat the
growth of public sector employment at the federal and subnational levels will follow the growth
of Brazil's population. Since the share of public employment in total employment in Brazil i s
lower than the average of OECD countries,' this assumption should be regarded as reasonable, or
even conservative. Real wage growth i s assumedto follow productivity growth.

23.     RPPS deficits are projected to increase at all levels of government in the absence of
reform, but the increase would be much more pronounced in the case of subnationals. As shown
in Figure 7, the increase in federal deficits would be moderate-from      2 to 3 percent of GDP by
the year 2075, but the subnational deficits would increase much more-from          similar levels to
about 6 percent of GDP in the same period. One reason for the larger deficits projected for
subnationals, especially in the first decades, i s the immaturity of state and municipal pension
systems. As shown in Tables 8 and 9, subnationals have much higher support ratios and much
lower dependency and survivor ratios, indicating that subnational pension schemes will suffer a
much more pronounced increase inthe ratio of beneficiaries to active contributors inthe future.

24.     Another explanation for the different projected deficits i s the much higher proportion of
female workers in the states and municipalities (mostly teachers and doctors). For example, 78
percent of all employees in Minas Gerais are women, compared to 44 percent at the federal
government. Female employees become eligible for retirement up to 5 years younger having
worked 5 years less. Furthermore, their life expectancy at retirement i s about 7 years longer.
Therefore, subnational pension systems produce new beneficiaries at a greater frequency and
have to pay benefits for longer periods. Teachers, who constitute around 60 percent of all
employees, also become eligible for benefits up to 5 years longer, which results inup to 10years
of additive reduction for female teachers. This adds further to staff turnover and to higher
incidence of retirement.

 The assumptions include a flattening of the age-earnings curve for civil servants at older ages (instead of
the decline), which results in a gradual and moderate increase in the consolidated public sector wage bill by
about 0.4 percent of GDP inthe first 2 decades.

25.      The estimated impact of the December reform relative to the pre-reform scenario is
shown in Figure 8, with each of the reform measures shown separately for the federal and
subnational pension systems. The December 2003 reform has clearly a stronger impact on the
subnational systems for two main reasons. First, the share of employees not affected by the
reform i s much larger at the federal government. For example, the military represent 39 percent
of active workers in the executive branch of the federal government, while policemen and
firefighters (also excluded from the reform) constitute a much smaller share of the executive
branch of the states (only 13 percent in the case of Minas Gerais). Second, many of the specific
reform measures affect more strongly subnational civil servants. For example, given the shorter
careers of female teachers, the measures that increase vesting period requirements and retirement
age shouldaffect states and municipalities to a larger extent.

26.       As shown in Figure 8, most of the savings in the short-run come from the reduction in
survivor pensions, due especially to the price indexation of newly awarded survivor benefits. This
effect will be felt both at the federal and subnational schemes. Another significant source of
short-run savings, especially at the subnational level, will be the stricter retirement conditions.
Given the harshness of penalties for early retirement, the simulations assume that workers will
postpone retirement. However, sensitivity analysis shows that the net present value of savings
would not be very different if workers decided to retire earlier and take the penalties. Finally, the
contributions imposed on pensioners will produce some immediate revenues and short-run
savings as well.

27.       The simulations based on Minas Gerais data may actually underestimate the revenues
from the 11percent contribution, as only 10percent of the wage bill inMinas Gerais i s above the
threshold of 2,500 Reais. Lower income states inthe North, Northeast, and Central regions of the
country have a similar share, but the higher income states inthe Southeastand the South probably
have higher shares, suggesting that this component may have a stronger impact on revenues and
 deficit^.^

28.       The two main sources of savings in the long-run will be the new benefit formula and the
price indexation of benefits. It i s important to note that estimated savings from these measures
depend on the assumptions about real wage growth over the simulation period. The assumptions
are reasonable and even conservative, considering Brazil's present level of per capita income.
However, growth performance could prove disappointing, in which case, the effect of these
measures on future deficits will be weaker. The other reform measures were not simulated due to
the lack of detailed data or lack of information about key parameters. For example, measures 8
and 9 in Box 1were not simulated due to the lack of detailed information, although they are not
considered to be quantitatively important. Simulations of measure7 are shown inAnnex 3.

29.       The impact of the December 2003 reform i s also shown in Figure 9, indicating that the
reform should improve slightly RRPS deficits in the short-run and stabilize them in the long-run.
The deficits of subnational schemes will increase in the medium-run, before reversing this trend
in 2030, when new entrants start to retire. The simulations also indicate that the December 2003
reform may decrease the net present value of RPPS pension deficits for the first 50 years by about
one third, or the equivalent of 90 percent of 2003 GDP. This i s the result of a reduction of 63
percent of 2003 GDP for subnational governments and 27 percent of 2003 GDP for the federal
government.

30.       Inaddition to ConstitutionalamendmentNo.41, the government has also introducednew
accounting standards for RPPS regimes, requiringannual reporting of pension assets and implicit
pension liabilities. This measure may also contribute to the containment of expenditures by
increasing the awareness of state and local governments and legislators about the fiscal status of
their pension schemes, so that better informed decisions can be made inthe future. Separate set of
regulations specify minimumactuarial standards for calculating this implicit pension debt.



  The revenues generated by the 11percent contribution will depend on the share of the wage bill above the
threshold. The share is 28 percent for the federal government, and averages 11percent for 9 low income
states in the North, Northeast and Central parts of the country. Minas Gerais' share i s 10 percent, despite a
higher per capita income than those states, indicating that wage differences of civil servants across states
are smaller than wage differences in the private sector, probably due to similar occupations and educational
levels. The share of the wage bill above the threshold is probably higher in richer states, although the
difference should not be large for the same reasons.

ReformsPlannedfor the Future

Improvements in PAYGAdministration

31.      The December 2003 reform has reduced the imbalances of the pension system, but
pension expenditures and deficits should start increasing again in the next decade, primarily due
to the increasing expenditures in the RGPS when most of the transition effects of 1999 reform
will be over, as shown in Figure 10. The Government i s aware of these expected developments
and understands that the Brazilian pension system needs further reforms.                However, the
Government also feels that it does not have the political conditions to propose another major
pension reform to the Brazilian society before exhausting the,possibilities for reducing the
pension deficit through improvements in the administration of both the RPPS and the RGPS.
This i s because there i s an widespread perception in society that these deficits are largely due to
numerous cases of fraud and theft, routinely reported by the Brazilian press.

32.      The federal and subnational Governments have already been implementing programs of
improvement in the administration of RPPS schemes. These programs have been supported by
technical assistance loans from the Bank and have been rewarded by significant savings,
particularly at the level of Brazilian states? Improving the administration of the RGPS has
proved a more difficult challenge, because of its larger size and technical problems. However,
most of the cases of fraud and abuse that have been reportedrefer to the RGPS.

33.      The Government plans to improve the RGPS administration include measures designed
to enhance revenues and measures designed to reduce expenditures through the elimination of
inefficiencies and the identification of fraud. As part of these efforts, a new Secretariat for Social
Security Contributions, the Secretaria de Receitu Previdencidriu (SRP) was created. The SRP
will have enhanced legal powers relative to the agency that was in charge of revenue collection,
the Instituto Nucional de PrevidZncia Social (INSS) and will benefit from ongoing improvements
in technological infrastructure.     This should allow the SRP not only to remove leakages in


  The Bank has two active projects supporting improvements in the administration of state and municipal
pension systems. Savings achieved under the state project have been estimated at about 170 million Reais
per year. A follow-up project for the states i s being finalized.

collection, but also to address more effectively the large contribution arrears that have
accumulated in recent years. The Government i s also considering merging the newly created
SRP with the Secretariat for Tax Revenues, the Secretaria da Receitu Federal (SRF) at the
Ministry of Finance. This unification of tax and contribution collections has yielded positive
results in many countries, and could translate into a further increaseinrevenues as well.

34.      The Government will also implement a new risk management system that i s designed to
prevent and detect inefficiencies, fraud and abuse on the payment of benefits, and that should
contribute to the containment of expenditures. As part of the same effort, it has already started
implementing a program of recertification of all pensioners, based initially in the comparison of
several databases and the identification of irregularities in the payment of benefits. This program
alone, which will be implemented over the next few months, will allow the Government to
eliminate many irregular payments and reduce RGPSdeficits inthe next two years.

35.      Finally, the Government plans to clarify the rules governing the eligibility to rural
pension benefits.  Current rules do not allow for a clear distinction between urban and rural
population as well as between small agricultural enterprises versus self-sufficient farmers who are
treated differently under the social security law. The clarification of the rules among other things
should reduce benefit arbitrage.

Reforms to the Disability Scheme

36.      In addition to improvements in PAYG administration, the Government also plans to
implement a comprehensive reformto the disability scheme in the near future, in response to the
sharp increase in expenditures in recent years.           As mentioned before, disability-related
expenditures have increased by 0.6 percent of GDP since 2000 and account for nearly half of the
increase in RGPS expenditures during the same period. These expenditures reflect payment of
three classes of benefits: (1) disability pensions; (2) sickness benefits; and (3) work injury
benefits. The fast increase in the number of new disability claims suggests that disability-related
expenditures may continue driving total RGPS expenditures in coming years, and constitute a
serious source of fiscal imbalances.




                                                  58

37.     As shown in Figure 11, the number of new disability-relatedbenefits has increased at an
alarming pace since 2001, driven primarily by the increase in the number of new sickness
benefits. This has resulted in a sharp increase in the share of new disability-related benefits in
total new RGPS benefits, from less than 40 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2004. The share of
sickness benefits in the total number of RGPS benefits (related to the stock of beneficiaries) has
increased at a slower pace-from    18.5 to 21 percent-because   sickness benefits are still provided
for much shorter average periods than disability pensions. However, this is changing, because the
average duration of these benefits has increased.

38.      The trends that are emerging are worrisome. As shown in the bottom part of Figure 11,
total RGPS pension expenditures (excluding social assistance) have increased from 5.7 to 7
percent of GDP since 2000, and almost half of this increase was due to the increase in disability-
related expenditures.    Therefore, disability-related expenditures explain a good part of the
increase in RGPS pension expenditures after the 1999 reform that was expected to curb the future
growth of RGPS expenditures. Moreover, the increasing numbers and durations of new sickness
benefits indicate that these are becoming de facto disability pensions that may continue adding
permanent pressure to total RGPS expenditures.

39.      In order to start addressing the increase in disability-related expenditures, the
Government has elaborated a program of health and safety standards in the workplace. This
program has beenjointly elaborated by the Ministries of Health, Labor, and Social Security, and
has been approved by the National Council of Social Security, the Conselho Nacional de
Previdzncia Social -CNPS. The new program contains four major components, namely: (i)            the
coordination of policies and actions by all the Ministries and Government agencies; (ii)         the
introduction of minimumhealth and safety standards at the workplace, covering all workers, and
designed to reduce the number of work-related accidents; (iii)     the introduction of a common
information collection system and a common database, designed to collect not only information
on actual work accidents, but also risk factors; and (iv) the introduction of incentives for
companies to invest inpreventive measures.

40.      This new program would seem to affect only the worker injury program, which accounts
for only 17 percent of total disability-related expenditures. However, the Government believes
that the program may have a stronger impact than suggested by the relatively small share of
worker injury expenditures. This belief i s grounded on the knowledge that safety standards in the
workplace are low, and on initial research indicating that a significant portion of disability and
sickness claims are actually due to accidents inthe workplace that are not properly reported.

41.      One of the innovations of the program i s the elaboration of a new sickness classification
system that does not rely on formal reporting by the employer, but on the type of sickness and its
relation to work-related accidents, determined from statistical methods. The system will produce
industry andcompany-level information on the frequency of sickness and disability claims caused
by work-related accidents. This information will then be used for the development of risk scoring
systems and risk-based contributions to the work injury insurance program, penalizingcompanies
with higher frequency of accidents, and rewarding companies which invest resources in the
improvement of health and safety standards inthe workplace.

42.       These important initiatives are expectedto be implementedin 2006, and should result in
better safety standards at the work place and a decliningnumber of disability and sickness claims.
At the same time, the Government is aware that the causes of the recent increase in disability-
related expenditures are not fully understood, and that these initiatives, although important, will
not be sufficient to maintain these expenditures under control. The Government understandsthat
a comprehensive disability reform will probably include measures to improve medical criteria for
disability, the training of specialized doctors, and improvements in physical and professional
rehabilitation.    The Government plans to do a more complete diagnosis of the rules and
procedures in the disability area inthe coming months, in order to prepare a more comprehensive
reform program, and has requested Bank assistance in this area. The initial analytical work
would be financed by a PHRD grant attached to the next proposed policy loan,5 while the
implementation of disability reform would be supported by a proposed technical assistance loan
under preparation.

Further Reforms Expected In the Longer-Run

43.       In the longer-run the Government will have to address the remaining imbalances in the
pension system, especially in the RGPS, as neither the administrative reforms which will be
implemented in the coming months nor the disability reforms which should be implemented in
2006 will be able to eliminate these deficits. This will require further parametric reforms to the
RGPS. Inthis occasion, the RPPS couldbe further harmonized with the RGPS.




 The Government is aware of the comprehensive disability reform implemented inthe Netherlands inthe
early 199Os, believes that this reform experience i s very relevant to the Braziliancase, and has indicated
that it plans to employ Dutch consultants under the PHRD grant.

                                            ANNEX 3

          COMPLEMENTARY PENSIONFUNDS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS


1.      The December 2003 reform opens the possibility for the federal and subnational
governments to impose a ceiling on future benefits equal to the RGPS ceiling, provided that the
respective government creates a complementary pension fund for civil servants affected by this
ceiling. The Constitutional amendment indicates that these complementary funds would operate
on a definedcontributionbasis, but does not provide many additional details.

2.       The Ministry of Social Security has drafted a new law on the establishment of
complementary funds for federal civil servants, to be submitted to Congress in 2005. The draft
law foresees the establishment of a fund for federal civil servants of the executive branch only.
However, it provides for the possibility that the judiciary and legislative braches also establish
their own funds, or join the executive branch fund. The draft law also allows state and municipal
governments to enroll their employees in the federal fund. This provision was introduced to
prevent small states and municipalities from creating small and inefficient funds.

3.      The draft law subjects the new complementary fund to the regulatory framework
applicable to private sector closed funds (Law 109 and all secondary regulations), PREVIC
supervision, and specific provisions contained in Law 108, applicable to closed pension funds
established by the governments of the federation, states, municipalities (including their
autonomous entities), and government-owned enterprises.

4.       The draft law requires the new complementary fund to have financial and administrative
autonomy with assets completely segregated from the assets of the sponsor. The draft law
addresses properly the provision in Constitutional amendment No. 41 that these funds should
have a public nature. This i s achieved by requiring increased cost efficiency, transparency and
public scrutiny of the fund's operations through publication in the official gazette-the      Di6rio
Oficial da Uniiio-f   its annual reports, including accounting, actuarial and financial audits.

5.       The draft law requires the new complementary fund to be defined contribution, in line
with Constitutional amendment No. 41. This implies that a system of individual accounts will be
established with balances invested in capital market instruments and earning market rates of
return. However, no limitations are imposed on the benefits that the fund will be able to provide.
Inprinciple, the new fund could provide internally disability and death benefits, as well as fixed
annuities in the retirement phase. This would expose the fund to morbidity, death, investment,
and longevity risks. (The draft law encourages but does not impose the contracting of insurance
from insurance companies). The draft law does not specify in detail what would be the pre-
conditions for offering these benefits internally. The associatedrisks would need to be addressed
by the expected introduction of sound funding rules for all closed funds, and by PREVIC, during
the approval of the benefit plan (see below).

6.       Figure 1 shows the expected financial implications of the establishment of
complementary fund for all federal civil servants, including those employed by the executive,
legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government. The analysis assumes a maximum
Government contribution of 6 percent of the insured wage and no risk retention by the sponsor,
arising from the presence of defined benefit elements in the plan. It i s also assumed that all




                                                  62

eligible employees hired after the establishment of the plan will become the members of the plan
and all employees hiredbefore will chooseto abstain from participation.

7.      The transition costs of the Federal Government consist of two components. First, the
Government will stop receiving the 11percent contribution on the share of the wage bill above
the RGPS ceiling. Second, the Government will also have to pay matching contributions equal to
6 percent of the same portion of the wage bill. Given the assumption that only new employees
will participate in the plan, these combined costs will increase for 35 years, until all employees
earning wages above the ceiling are covered by the plan. At that stage, the costs will stabilize at
about 0.15 percent of GDP.

8.       The savings of the Federal Government will come from decreased PAYG disability,
survivor and old age benefit levels, as they will be limited by the RGPS ceiling. These savings
will increase gradually in the first two decades and will acceleratethereafter, due to the increase
inthe number of workers retiringunder the new systemand subject to the benefit ceiling. The net
costs for the Government in the first two decades will be positive but moderate, peaking at 0.06
percent of GDP in 2023. Net costs will decline after that year, turning into surpluses from 2030
on. Net savings will peak at 0.26 percent of GDP by 2060 after which they will remain constant.
The new system generates net savings on a present value basis, equivalent to about 8 percent of
GDP, over the simulation horizon covering 70 years.

9.       The analysis assumes that no financial liabilities will be assumed by the sponsor. As
previously mentioned, the draft law does not specify in detail the solvency standards to be applied
to products involvingretention of morbidity, death, longevity, and investment risks. Despite this
concern, the risk of the new complementary fund for federal civil servants becoming a source of
substantial financial liability for the Government i s mitigated by the fact that: (i)the
Government's contribution i s limited to a maximum ratio of 1:1, and the draft law states that the
sponsor can at most contribute 6 percent of the insured wage; (ii)  PREVIC will need to approve
the pension plan, including the types of benefits and the specific provisioning and funding rules;
(iii) planstoimplementsoundfundingrulesfollowingbestinternationalpracticeforall

pension funds; and (iv) discussions are taking place within the Federal Government on ways to
limit further sponsor riskby only authorizing the pension fundto offer retirementproducts that do
not expose itself to risks, such as income draw downs and participating annuities, and requiring
the fundto buy fixed annuities from licensed insurance companies.

                                       FUNDRELATIONS NOTE


1.       On March 21, 2005, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the tenth and final review o f Brazil's performance under an SDR 27.4 billion (about
USS41.75 billion) Stand-By Arrangement that was approved in September 2002 and later
augmented and extended in December 2003.            Total drawings under the Stand-By Arrangement
amounted to SDR 17.2 billion (about US26.23 billion). Completion o f the tenth review made
available an amount equivalent to SDR 910 million (about US$1.39 billion) in addition to the
SDR 9.3 billion (about US$14.13 billion) that was previously made available under the
arrangement but was not drawn. However, Brazil did not draw under the arrangement after
September 2003.

2.      Following the Executive Board's completion o f the tenth and final review o f the Stand-by
arrangement, Ms.Anne 0.Kmeger, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, indicated
that Brazil's performance under the Stand-ByArrangement hadbeen strong, and all performance
criteria for the tenth and final review had been met. The impressive track record o f program
implementation, together with the continued pursuito f sound macroeconomic policies and steady
progress with structural reforms paid off, with GDP growth reaching 5.2 percent in2004 - the
highest in ten years.         The recovery had been aided by a strong export and investment
performance. The export performance had also led to a record current account surplus o f almost
2 percent o f GDP. The sustained highprimary surpluses had allowed the government to steadily
reduce its debt burden, and Brazil's vulnerabilities had continued to decline as a result o f these
strong policies. The structure o f public debt had also steadily improved, with the share o f
exchange-rate linkeddebt falling considerably.

3.       Ms. Krueger finalized the assessment of Brazil's conditions indicating that continued
progress on the structural reform agenda would be key to further enhancing Brazil's growth
potential and reducing poverty and inequality. Substantial structural advances in 2004 included
the enactment of bankruptcy, public-private partnerships, and judicial reform laws. The
government's agenda for 2005 includes important tax reforms and measures to strengthen the
business environment. The current context provides a favorable opportunity to advance other
priority reforms, including measures to promote financial intermediation, increase budget
flexibility, address remaining imbalances inthe pension system, reduce labor market informality
and reducebarriers to doing business.

4.       On February 28, 2005, Minister o f Finance Antonio Palocci sent and disclosed an official
letter to President Luis Inhcio Lula da Silva assessing the performance o f the Brazilian economy
under the IMF Stand-byarrangement, and requesting the President's authorization to not renew
the agreement with the IMF. Minister Palocci indicated that the agreement was no longer
necessary, because the Brazilian economy had become much less vulnerable to external shocks
and changes in market sentiment, and because the government continued to have a firm
commitment to sound fiscal policies, that should be reflected ina continuing decrease inthe ratio
o f public debt to GDP and a reduction inthe tax burden as well.'


 The statement of the Chairman of the IMFBoard and the letter o f Minister Palocci to President Lula are disclosed
inthe website ofthe Brazilian Ministry ofFinance: www.fazenda.gov.br.

5.     Mr. Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director of the IMF, expressed full support for the
Government's decision, indicating that this decision reflected the impressive results, generally
ahead o f expectations, o f Brazil's macroeconomic stabilization and reform policies that were
supported by the Stand-by arrangement. Mr.Rat0 added that the Brazilian Government and the
staff and management o f the IMF looked forward to continuing with the close and coo erative
policy dialogue through the usual channels o f surveillance andpost-program monitoring.i?
