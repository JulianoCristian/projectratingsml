1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The loan was appraised between October 2004 and April 2005, during the first half of the
first Lula Administration (2003-2006). At the time, the Government was making
concerted efforts to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal and macroeconomic stability
and gain credibility internationally. The credibility problem was reflected in a depreciated
exchange rate, large borrowing spreads and low ratings of sovereign debt issues.

The Government's fiscal program included large primary surpluses and improvements in
debt management designed to reduce the high and rising ratio of public debt to GDP and
ensure debt sustainability. The most important structural reform entailed a reform to the
pension system for civil servants at the federal, state and municipal levels of government
­ the RPPS. Although the number of participants in the RPPS (5 million) was smaller
than the number of participants in the national pension scheme for private sector workers,
or the RGPS (43 million), the expenditures in the civil servant schemes were almost as
large, reflecting loose eligibility criteria and much higher average pension benefits.

The RPPS reform proposal was submitted to the Brazilian Congress in April 2003 and
approved in December 2003.           One element of the reform (the special 11 percent
contribution imposed on all public sector pensioners) was challenged on constitutional
grounds in early 2004, but in September 2004 the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that this
measure did not violate the Constitution. The Bank waited for the Supreme Court ruling
and proceeded with loan appraisal after the favorable ruling was issued.

On June 6, 2005, the Bank Board approved the Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan ­
Social Security Reform to Brazil (Loan 7299-BR), which became effective on April 11,
2006. Although two previous special adjustment loans supported pension reform efforts
in 1998 and 1999, the loan was the first programmatic development policy loan (DPL)
supporting pension reform in Brazil, and initiated a separate programmatic series under
the broader umbrella of programmatic fiscal reform loans.

This programmatic social security reform loan series was launched with three main
objectives. They were: 1) to stabilize, and if possible, reduce pension expenditures and
deficits to open fiscal space for other development programs; 2) to move towards
harmonization of national and civil servant pension schemes in order to improve labor
mobility between public and private sectors of the economy, and 3) to continue to
provide adequate pension benefits for the Brazilian population, while improving their
sustainability.

The first loan in the series focused on the reform of the federal, state and municipal civil
servant pension schemes but has also supported some administrative improvements in the
RGPS as well as some measures designed to strengthen the voluntary and complementary


                                                1

private pension system. The first loan was expected to be followed by the second loan
which would mainly focus on the reform of the RGPS.

At the time of ICR writing, the RGPS reform was still under debate in a forum created by
President Lula in January of 2007. There is no indication that a major reform to the
RGPS will take place in the second Lula administration. Moreover, even if a reform
proposal is submitted to Congress, the Government is unlikely to borrow, given the sharp
improvement in Brazil's external accounts, the high levels of foreign reserves, and the
strong appreciation of the Brazilian Real.

Given the significantly diminished prospects of the second loan, the regional VPU has
decided to complete the ICR for the first operation only. Therefore, for the purpose of
loan evaluation, this ICR will focus only on the subset of key indicators of program
outcomes which could be attributed to the first loan rather than on those of the entire
program as envisaged at the time of its approval.

Namely, the key indicators of the achievement of the three main program objectives
examined in this ICR are: (1) evidence of improved performance of the RPPS after the
December 2003 reform, including financial performance, continued adequacy of benefits
and a movement towards harmonization with RGPS; (2) evidence of improved financial
performance of the RGPS, in those specific areas supported by the loan; (3) evidence of
the increasing role of voluntary and complementary private pensions in providing
adequate retirement income, measured in terms of higher coverage, increasing pension
assets and improvements in safety of private voluntary pension arrangements.

Finally, the ICR will also provide an overview of the improvement in Brazil's overall
fiscal and macroeconomic performance, as the pension reform supported by the loan was
taking place in the context of broader fiscal reforms which were supported in the Bank's
assistance program, as reflected in the 2004-2007 Country Assistance Strategy.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

This loan primarily supported the December 2003 reform to the civil service pension
schemes (federal, state and municipal) encompassing over 5 million people. The main
reform measures included stricter retirement eligibility rules, less generous old age
benefit formula and indexation rules, reduction of net pensions for higher income
recipients, and a possibility of limiting income insured by RPPS by creating
complementary pension funds for high earners.

The loan also supported overall fiscal and macroeconomic stabilization achievements;
administrative measures in the RGPS scheme geared to improve revenue collection,
eliminate irregular payments and to restrain the growth of sickness and disability
expenditures with emphasis on disability related to work injuries; and improvements to
the regulation and supervision of the voluntary private pension system.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

As mentioned earlier, this ICR does not attempt to evaluate the whole programmatic loan
series. Rather, it is aimed at evaluating one single tranche loan, which was approved on
June 02, 2005 for the amount of US$658.3 million and became effective on April 16,
2006.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The main component of the loan supported the approval of Constitutional Amendment
Nº41 and related Supreme Court ruling, both of which had already occurred before
signing of this loan. The implementation of most of the new constitutional provisions was
relatively clear-cut as it did not require major changes in institutional structures or
procedures.

The only important measure of the 2003 reform that had not been implemented at the
time of loan approval and remains to be fully implemented at drafting of this ICR, is the
introduction of a ceiling on civil servant contributions and benefits. Constitutional
Amendment Nº41 of December 2003 has given federal and sub-national governments the
option to introduce such a ceiling, if they also offer a complementary pension fund,
providing a possibility to insure the wage above the ceiling through such a mechanism.
This will require that additional laws on complementary funds are passed at the federal,
state and municipal levels.

The Federal Government took some time to finalize the draft law, due to the need to build
consensus across government agencies, and sub-national governments were not prepared
to draft this legislature before the Federal Government did so. However, at drafting of
this ICR, the Federal Government had already submitted a draft law to the national
Congress, and a similar draft law had also been submitted by the state of Rio Grande do
Sul to the state's legislature.

The implementation of remaining policy actions supported by the loan was of an
administrative and supervisory nature and remained mostly under Government control. It
proceeded smoothly as planned.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The implementation of the loan was monitored and evaluated in a variety of ways. Both
the Social Insurance and Planning Ministries periodically issue electronic bulletins that
allow close monitoring of pension system performance. This reporting has grown even
more detailed and timely over the period of loan implementation.


                                             3

The Bank also sent a team of senior experts in June of 2006 to discuss the outcomes of
the reform with Government officials. Although not required by Bank procedures, the
mission produced a detailed midterm review report documenting the progress towards
achievement of program outcomes and meeting of the triggers for the next operation.
Finally, loan supervision also benefited from additional analytical work on the Brazilian
pension system which was undertaken during the loan implementation period, as well as
from the preparation and supervision of three TA loans designed to improve the
administration of state and municipal pension systems1.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

As mentioned earlier, although options to reform the RGPS are still being debated, a
major reform is not expected to take place during the remainder of the second Lula
administration (2007-2010). Moreover, even if a reform eventually takes place, the
Federal Government is unlikely to borrow from the Bank due to the sharp improvement
in Brazil's external accounts, the increase in the level of foreign reserves to more than
US$170 billion, and the reduction in the net external debt to negligible levels.2

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The main objectives of the loan remain extremely relevant to the country's current
development agenda and the Bank's assistance strategy.                   Moreover, while Brazil's
macroeconomic situation has improved dramatically since the loan was approved by the
Board, the country is still struggling to improve its growth performance and to address a
history of social inequities. Success in achieving these objectives will require further
efforts to restructure fiscal expenditures and allocate more resources to well-targeted
social programs and other necessary public expenditures such as education, health, and
infrastructure.

The objectives of the loan also remain relevant for the achievement of the Bank's
strategic objectives, as the three pillars identified in the 2004-2007 Brazil Country
Assistance Strategy (equity, competitiveness and sustainability), rest on a sound fiscal

(approved 07/25/2002, active at the time of writing); State Pension Reform TAL II (approved 02/13/2007,
awaiting signing at the time of writing).

2At the same time, the Bank has been providing assistance to individual Brazilian states, and the assistance
program may include DPLs providing support to fiscal and pension reform at the state level.

and macroeconomic framework, and the reforms supported by the loan contribute to this
objective.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

This section assesses the outcomes of the policy actions supported by the loan. It starts
by presenting the indicators of overall improvement in the country's fiscal and
macroeconomic performance. The outcomes of the reform of civil servant pension
schemes (the RPPS) are examined next, as this was the main component of the loan. This
is followed by an assessment of the outcomes of the specific policy actions designed to
improve the national pension scheme (the RGPS) and the outcomes of measures designed
to strengthen the voluntary and complementary private pension system.

Improvement in Brazil's overall fiscal and macroeconomic performance

During the period of loan implementation, the administration demonstrated a strong
commitment to fiscal and macroeconomic stability, as indicated by the average primary
fiscal surpluses of 4.1% in 2003-06, above the original target of 3.25% of GDP (see
Table 1). The net public debt fell in the same period from 52.4% to 44.9% of GDP, and
the share of the FX-denominated debt declined, reducing the government's exposure to
currency risk.

The improvements in the external accounts were even more impressive, as indicated by
the generation of successive trade and current account surpluses and the sharp decline in
the ratio of gross external debt to GDP, from 39 percent in 2003 to 16 percent in 2006,
and the decline in the ratio of external debt to exports, from 294 percent to 126 percent in
the same period. The improvement in the credibility of Brazil's macroeconomic policies
is reflected in the dramatic decline in borrowing spreads to about 190 basis points and the
increase in ratings on sovereign issues to one notch below investment grade.

The combination of strong fiscal policy, the Central Bank's commitment to lower
inflation targets, and the appreciation of the Real contributed to a reduction in consumer
price inflation from 9.3 percent in 2003 to 3.1 percent in 2006, its lowest level since the
exchange-rate crisis of 1999 as shown in Table 2. GDP growth picked up recently, as
indicated by the 3.7 percent growth in 2006 and 4.5 percent growth expected for 2007.
Recent data also indicate a significant improvement in poverty and inequality ratios ­ the
poverty ratio declined from 38 percent in 2002 to 29 percent in 2006 and the Gini
coefficient declined from 0.587 in 2002 to 0.566 in 2005. Overall, all indicators show a
stable macroeconomic environment, conducive to more growth and improvements in
social outcomes.

Assessment of the Outcomes of the RPPS Reform

Pension systems typically respond very slowly to reform measures, because changes in
pension rules and parameters need to respect acquired rights. For this reason, it is
difficult to assess the outcomes of a pension reform after only a few years have passed.
However, available indicators for the first three years of implementation (2004-2006)



                                                  6

suggest that the 2003 reform is already having a positive impact, and that the civil servant
pension system is moving in a positive direction.

This section assesses the impact of the 2003 reform by examining a number of key
indicators, including: (i) the revenues, expenditures, and balances of the federal and state
schemes; (ii) intermediate indicators such as the average retirement age, the average
length of the contribution period, the flows of new civil servant retirees, and changes in
benefit levels and their distribution as well as survivor pension spending.

As shown in Table 3, the financial performance of the RPPS is improving, both relative
to the counterfactual (of no reform) and to the base year (2003). Throughout the three
years following the reform, the combined federal and state RRPS pension expenditures
have decreased and revenue has increased by similar amounts resulting in cash deficit
decreasing from 3.52% of GDP in 2003 to 3.22% of GDP in 20063. This is in line with
actuarial projections performed during the loan preparation4.

Figure 1 shows that the deficit in 2005 and 2006 was about 0.2% of GDP below the
estimate for no-reform scenario and right on target for the reform scenario. The slight
increase in expenditures in 2006 was due to accelerated wage growth in the public sector



3Under this definition of cash deficit the notional employer contribution is not taken into account.

4A new methodology for GDP calculations has been introduced in Brazil in 2007, raising GDP estimates
for the last few years by around 10%. The discrepancies in the projection numbers quoted in loan
documents and ICR are due to this fact.

5Municipalities are excluded due to the absence of current data. Together they constitute around 7% to 9%
of total RRPS expenditures and deficits.

This marked improvement in RRPS financial flows can be explained by examining some
intermediate indicators6, the most important of which seem to be related to delayed
retirement. As shown in Figure 2, the average retirement age of federal civil servants has
increased by about 3 years, due to the stricter retirement conditions, and has stabilized at
this higher level. The average career length has also increased, with the proportion of
federal civil servants retiring under the regular retirement conditions aposentadoria
integral increasing from 30%-50% before the reform to 75% in the first eight months of
2007 as shown in Figure 3. This increase has occurred at the expense of disability and
"proportional" retirement, both of which imply shorter careers. Finally, the decision to
delay retirement is also manifesting itself in lower numbers of new retirees. Table 4
shows that the average annual flow of new retirees from federal RPPS has declined after
the reform.

Changes in benefit levels of old age and disability pensions are harder to attribute to a
specific cause as indexation rules, wage growth and demographic effects all intermingle
in these statistics. However, there is a clearly discernable downward trend in the ratio of
average benefit to average wage as shown in Figure 4. A more pronounced temporary
decrease in benefits in 2002-2004 is most likely attributable to many premature
retirements resulting in lower pensions, which tends to occur with any significant pension
reform.

Even though the benefits are declining, their levels remain adequate for all income groups
as demonstrated in Figure 5. The gross income distribution of pensioners remains very
close to that of active employees. Moreover, even for the lowest paid civil servants both
wages and pensions remain comfortably above the minimum wage of 380 Brazilian reais.
As expected, the reform has affected the richest segment of pensioner population the
most with the net spending share on 25% civil servants with highest pension income in
federal executive branch falling from around 57% to 49% in five years to September
2007.

The benefits of RPPS are still more generous compared to those in RGPS but the system
has markedly moved towards the goal of harmonization between the two pension regimes.
Some important RPPS parameters have been brought in line with those of RGPS
including definition of wage base and indexation rules. Even though subsidies, calculated
as pension deficit per pensioner, are still 15 times higher in RPPS the difference has
decreased remarkably over the last few years8.



8Notional employer contribution is taken into account for the purpose of calculating subsidy per pensioner
in RPPS.

Finally, the overall net spending on survivor pensions (gross pensions minus newly
introduced pension contributions) also has likely declined although the amount of the
decline is hard to measure as survivor contributions are not reported separately in pension
statistics. However, gross expenditures on survivor pensions in 2006 in the federal RPPS
remained at 0.7% of GDP which is the level comparable to the level observed before the
2003 reform. This suggests that net survivor spending has likely declined in proportion to
GDP.

Assessment of the Outcomes of Specific Policy Actions in the RGPS

Contrary to the positive trends in the RPPS, the overall financial performance of the
RGPS has continued to deteriorate as shown in Table 5. Total spending has increased
from 6.5% of GDP in 2003 to 7.8% of GDP in 2006, while deficits have increased from
1.8% to 2.5% in the same period. These numbers indicate that the RGPS will need a
major reform in the future, as discussed and acknowledged in the loan document. At the
same time, it is also important to highlight the fact that the specific policy areas supported
by this loan are performing satisfactorily.

The specific policy actions in the RGPS supported by the loan included: (i)
improvements in the institutional framework for contribution collection, aimed at
increasing revenues; (ii) full implementation of a re-certification program designed to
eliminate irregular benefits; (iii) several policy and administrative measures designed to
curb the growth of disability-related benefits, especially those linked to work injuries.

Revenue Collection. Contribution revenues have increased dramatically from a relatively
stable level of 4.8% of GDP until 2004 to 5.0% of GDP in 2005 and 5.3% of GDP in
2006. Doubtless, this is at least partially due to the overall positive performance of the
economy, but the sharp increase in revenues also corresponds in timing to the creation in
2005 of a new Secretariat for Social Security Revenues in the Ministry of Social Security,
which was further strengthened in 2007 by its merger with the Secretariat for Tax
Collection in the Ministry of Finance (the new Secretariat has been labeled the Super
Secretariat).

Recertification Program.         Another policy area supported by the loan was the re-
certification program that has aimed to audit all RGPS benefits in payment. The program
has already been completed with a total of 17.2 million records checked. It has resulted in



9The numbers include social assistance payments for elderly and disabled.




                                                 11

0.5% of benefits being discontinued due to irregularities, with another 0.25% of benefits
pending further investigation. The number of regular termination of benefits due to death
has also increased slightly suggesting that the overall effect of the program might have
been higher due to fraud deterrence. The estimated savings amount to 0.5 ­ 1 billion
Reais annually, which is equivalent to about 0.02-0.04% of GDP. The savings generated
by the program may not be significant relative to the overall size of the deficit, but the
program has had an important demonstration effect, showing the Brazilian public that
administrative improvements have a limited scope in ensuring the financial health of
RGPS and that further parametric reforms may be needed.

Containment of Disability-related Benefits. Finally, the last set of policy actions
supported by the loan aimed to arrest the explosive growth of disability and sickness
expenditures observed until 2004. The loan has supported the approval of the National
Program of Health and Safety at the Workplace; the introduction of a system of risk-
related contributions to occupational hazard insurance; other policy measures designed to
reduce excessive sickness benefits; and administrative measures designed to improve the
concession of these benefits.

Since loan approval, the Government has made substantial progress in introducing new
legislation in this area, as indicated by the Congressional approval of Law Nº11.430 in
2007 that introduces a system of risk-based contributions for employers, and the
introduction of    Medida Provisória Nº1.291 that changes the formula for sickness
benefits. The government has also implemented important administrative reforms
designed to change sickness and disability certification criteria. This includes the hiring
of 3,000 new social security doctors to replace part time private doctors, and the
introduction of stricter benefit concession procedures.

These actions have contributed to a marked improvement in the sickness benefit program.
Figure 6 shows that the number of sickness benefits has stopped growing and even
decreased compared to the peak of November 2005. The benefit numbers initially
dropped sharply followed by a bounce in the second half of 2006. This was expected as
the clogging of the system has been reduced making the process of applying for benefits
much easier and drawing in new applications. However, the first nine months of 2007
show that the number of benefits has stabilized at the lower level.

The disability program has also experienced a marked improvement. Given the long term
nature of the benefit the inertia of the system compared to sickness program is much
greater. Therefore, the growth in the number of benefits is analyzed here instead of the
absolute number of benefits. Figure 7 clearly demonstrates that the growth in number of
benefits has been halted both in general disability program as well as that of the disability
related to work injuries.

Assessment of Outcomes of Policy Actions in the Voluntary System

As indicated in the loan document, the pension reforms implemented since the late 1990s
are slowly reducing pension benefits in both national and civil servant pension schemes
and increasing the importance of the voluntary private system. The loan supported a


                                                                                  13

number of policy measures designed to expand the coverage of voluntary schemes, both
closed and open, through the introduction of the EET or TEE tax treatments adopted in
most OECD countries, the introduction of plans sponsored by associations, and stricter
funding rules for defined benefit schemes to continue with overall adequate benefits.

As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the number of participants in open and closed schemes has
increased by about 3 million since 2003, and the volume of pension assets has grown as
well. Coverage in the voluntary system in Brazil is still low (compared to a labor force of
about 90 million people), but the trends in this area look promising.

Most of the open plans operate on a defined contribution basis and the new participants in
closed schemes have also been shifted to defined contribution plans. However, most of
the assets in the closed system relate to defined benefit plans, and several of these plans
seemed to be under-funded during loan appraisal. For this reason, the loan supported the
pension supervision's plan to draft new and stricter funding rules for defined benefit
plans, which effectively occurred through the issue of Resolution 18 of the Committee for
Complementary Pensions (CGPC) in March 2006.

Finally, in July 2007 the Government submitted a draft Law to Congress laying out the
legal structure and operating rules underlying new complementary funds for new civil
servants affected by the 2003 reform (draft law of Sept 6, 2007). The model proposed by
the draft Law is based on the Thrift Savings Plan for federal civil servants in the US. It is
a solid construction that insulates asset management from political pressures and protects
the savings of plan participants. One state (Rio Grande do Sul) has already submitted a
very similar draft to its legislature, suggesting that other states may follow a similar
model.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
    Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the loan is rated satisfactory. The quality at entry was rated
satisfactory by the QAG report with areas of "Strategic relevance and approach" and


                                                   14

"Structural, financial and macroeconomic aspects" earning highly satisfactory ratings.
The objectives of the loan set at the time of its approval still remain extremely relevant.
The program was largely implemented as planned and the foreseen program outcomes are
being achieved.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Policy actions supported by the loan had a positive social impact by reducing inequality
and increasing a perception of fairness in the pension system. Reduction in inequality
resulted from aiming to achieve fiscal savings by targeting civil servants in general (e.g.
federal RPPS employees earn 5 times more than RGPS average) and high earning civil
servants in particular. As was mentioned before, the share of net spending for 25% civil
servants with highest pension income in federal executive branch has decreased from
57% to 49% during the last five years, in part due to the newly introduced 11%
contribution rate for higher income pensioners.

Also, one of the measures supported by the loan, was to start utilizing the life-time
average wage rather than last wage in calculating benefit amounts for civil servants. This
measure tends to substantially favor civil servants with relatively flat wage histories, who
disproportionately tend to be lower paid employees in general and women in particular.

In the RGPS, some savings were also achieved by eliminating many fraudulent payments
widely perceived to be the main cause of fiscal imbalances in the pension system.
Although the savings from the elimination of such payments were relatively small, the
program strongly increased the perception of pension system fairness.

More generally, the measures supported by the loan have already started contributing to
better macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes that are essential to the fight against poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Bank's assistance in pensions has not only included this DPL but also TA loans
specifically geared towards improving the administration of state and municipal pension
systems. These loans have had a more direct impact on institutional development than the
DPL.

However, the technical work undertaken during the appraisal and supervision of this DPL
also contributed to capacity building by stimulating pension policy discussions with
Government officials. For example, the Bank brought in the former head of pension
supervision of the Netherlands who provided important insights in the formulation of
risk-based funding rules for defined benefit schemes. Another well-known Dutch expert
on disability pensions provided a report on the Brazilian disability and sickness benefit
programs that constituted the basis for a fruitful dialogue with the Government. Finally,
the Bank team also brought a top official of the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees
in the US that explained details of the TSP model to Government officials. The policy


                                            15

dialogue during loan supervision contributed to the drafting of new legislation on
complementary funds for new civil servants.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops: N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Low

The loan document discussed six potential risks to the development outcome including a)
low wage and GDP growth negatively affecting projected savings; b) continued high
growth of disability benefits; c) high government contributions to the complementary
fund; d) risk retention by the government in complementary funds; e) persistent actuarial
imbalances in the pension funds of public sector companies; f) retroactive changes to
2003 reform.

This risk assessment was rated satisfactory by QAG. The developments between the
approval of the loan and the time of writing this ICR have not increased and in many
cases significantly diminished these risks. No additional risks have become apparent
during this period.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Satisfactory

The loan was underpinned by strong analytical work containing actuarial simulations
presented in Annex 2 of the main loan document. The expectations of these projections
have been confirmed by recent data as demonstrated in section 3.2 of this document. The
Bank took further steps to ensure quality and tried to minimize the risk of a reform
reversal by only initiating preparation of the loan after the December 2003 reform was
upheld by the Supreme Court ruling in September 2004. During the appraisal of the loan
the Bank also exhibited sensitivity to the Government's request to avoid excessive
visibility that could have undermined the reform effort.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory

The implementation of the loan was well monitored. The Bank continued the policy
dialogue in July 2005 (right after Board approval) and brought two experts to Brasília on
that occasion ­ a Dutch expert on disability and a US expert on complementary pension
funds, responding to request from the authorities, and addressing critical technical issues
relevant to the reform supported by the loan.



                                            16

In June 2006 a Bank team visited Brazil to discuss preliminary reform outcomes with the
authorities. Although not required by Bank procedures, the mission has produced a
midterm review report (attached). During the period of implementation the ESW report
on pensions was initiated at Government's request which have further investigated the
state of both national and civil servant pension systems. After sharing the draft report
with the Government the Bank received a letter from the Minister of Finance praising the
report.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank Performance is rated satisfactory as the loan had a satisfactory rating at
entry (confirmed by QAG) and was adequately supervised. Moreover, the supervision of
the loan generated a comprehensive mid-term review, was accompanied by the provision
of technical assistance in key areas, and was also complemented by a report providing
extensive benchmarking exercises elaborated in response to a Government request.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance is rated satisfactory as it displayed strong ownership of the
program by instituting major policy changes through Constitutional Amendments
requiring three fifths majority and obtaining favorable Supreme Court ruling, both of
which ensure extremely low prospects for the reversal of reforms.

Moreover, the Government has continued implementing policy actions foreseen as
triggers for the second programmatic loan including: commitment to fiscal and
macroeconomic stability; the creation of the Super-secretariat for joint tax and
contribution revenue collection; submission to Parliament of the law on complementary
funds; and the carrying out of further legal and administrative reforms in the area of
disability pensions. Additional reforms in RGPS also continue to be debated in the forum.

Finally, the Government has also remained open to dialogue and is extremely helpful in
providing data and insights to help in the monitoring and evaluation of this loan.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: N/A

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory, discussed in 5.2 (a)

6. Lessons Learned

Pension reform is a complex technical and political process and needs a strong local
ownership as well as appropriate respect of outsiders to the country's political
sensitivities. Over the last decade of World Bank involvement in Brazil's pension policy


                                             17

dialogue the Government requested technical support but asked the Bank to maintain a
discrete public role. The Bank has done this during the preparation of this loan and the
elaboration of the ESW prepared on the Government's request. Acknowledging this, the
ESW received an award from the LCR region as best practice in dealing with sensitive
topics.

Follow-up pension reforms may not take place within the expected timeframe due to
political resistance. The second reform in the program is still under discussion in the
Government but may not take place during this administration. The Bank must be
prepared to accept this reality. In this regard, doing the ICR for the first loan only was an
appropriate decision.

Annex 2. Beneficiary Survey Results: N/A

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

We consider the reform supported by the loan has brought positive outcomes, since the
deficit of the public servant pension schemes remained stable along the period 2003-2006.
This is a result of incentives created to postpone retirement (increase of retirement ages
according to evidence above), changes in the RPPS financing structures (with alignment
of contribution rates between public servants and private sector workers), as well as
institutional changes (streamlining executive agencies in States and municipalities and
introducing the possibility of supplementary pension scheme). Hence, we think the report
above documents adequately the recent experience and the results of the policies
supported by the structural loan. We also think that the cooperation with the Bank was
positive, with an additional mention to the technical support provided regarding disability
benefits. That assistance allowed us to acquire a global view and redesign some policies
and administrative procedures in the light of good international practices.
