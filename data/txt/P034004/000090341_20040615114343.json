satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            satisfactory, and the Bank and borrower performance were\n            both satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that\n            designing comprehensive projects that require elaborate\n            policy frameworks and complex institutional arrangements\n            should be avoided at all costs in post-conflict situations,\n            as it sets the project against unrealistic targets from the\n            start. The Bank should take a longer perspective and a more\n            incremental approach to its engagement in post-conflict\n            situations especially when designing projects that aim at\n            introducing sector reforms in a fragmented policy\n            environment lacking political consensus. Bank teams\n            preparing projects in post-conflict environments should\n            undertake a thorough analysis of the prevailing governance\n            structure in the concerned sector including a close review\n            of the institutional absorptive capacity and the\n            decision-making processes leading to the adoption of major\n            policy reform initiatives. In the event that one public\n            entity assumes all responsibility for procurement\n            arrangements in post-conflict environments (as the case of\n            Council for development and Reconstruction in Lebanon), the\n            Bank should ensure the transfer of procurement capacity to\n            the relevant line ministries. The Bank should ensure\n            in-country supervision for most projects, especially if they\n            are complex in post-conflict environments. Revisions in\n            project objectives and components should be invoked at an\n            early stage of the project's life without unnecessary\n            delay should the conditions for successful implementation\n            prove to be beyond the executing agencies'\n            institutional capacity. The Bank should consider very early\n            on the issue of sustainability and the challenge of\n            integrating the project staff into the regular staffing\n            structure of the relevant line ministry. The Bank should\n            capitalize on unintended lags in loan effectiveness to\n            strengthen the quality of baseline data initially collected\n            for overall impact evaluation at the end of the project cycle."}, "docdt": "2004-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
