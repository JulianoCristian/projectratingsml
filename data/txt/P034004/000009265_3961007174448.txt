MIEMORANDUM AND RECOMM"DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE 113RD TO TH  EXECUJTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the followimg memorandum and recommeion on a proposed
loan to the Lebanese Republic for the equivalent of US$35.7 million to help finance a project for
health sector rehabilitation. The loan will be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.
2.    Background. Lebanon's population was estimated at 3.9 million in 1992, with an additional
300,000 Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and a large, yet indeterminate, mumber of Syrian workers.
The annal population growth rate is estimated at 2.2 percent, and the total fertlity rate at 3.2,
among the lowest in the region. In spite of the war, the health status of the population remains one
of the highest in the Region, as shown by the Infant Mortality Rate of 40 per 1,000 live births (as
compared to 65 per 1,0 in Egypt and 44 per 1,000 in Jordan) and a Life Expectancy at Birth of 67
years (59 in Egypt and 66 in Jordan). However, there are large variations between population groups
and geographical areas. These indicators could also be better, given the amount of total expenditure
for health per capita (US$79), which is fairly high for the region. The country is undergoing an
epidemiological transition; while infectious diseases are still common, chronic and degenerative
diseases and health problems related to social instability, including violent crimes and suicide, are
increasing, not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This transition has implications for the type
and mix of health services needed. Preventive and public health activities have to evolve to respond
to new patterns of disease and will need to be complemented by more complex cinical services
including essential inpatient care.
3.    The sector's institutional and policy framework is weak. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has
the primary responsibility for the adnistration and development of the health sector, including
policy formulation, plannng, and monitoring of public and private services and programs at the
national and local levels. However, MOH's organizational structure, management capabilities and
administrative procedures are inadequate; some of the key managerial positions in the Ministry are
still vacant; there is a shortage of essential office equpment. In December 1993, MOH prepared a
brief policy paper entitled "National Strategy for Health" which was the first autempt since the end of
the war to define Government policies in the sector. Following up on the National Health Strategy
document, a Letter of Sectoral Policy will be discussed and agreed upon during loan negotiations.
The key elements of the sectoral policy are: (i) improving primary health care through the
introduction of a comprehensive package of curative and preventive services to be delivered by all
public health facilities and participating Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs); (ii) improving
secondary care in the public sector by strengthening hospital management and service delivery
capabilities; (iii) improving health financing by initiating system-wide studies of alternative health
financing options, including proposals for a gradual reallocation of the health budget to better reflect
health priorities as stated in Govermment policy; and (iv) establishing MOH's capability to implement
these strategies. The Government and the Bank will review annually progress achieved by the
Government in implementing its health sector reform policies, using the monitoring indicators which
have been developed for the proposed project.
4.    The providers of health services in Lebanon are private practitioners and hospitals, local and
international NGOs, and the Goverment. Health services are financed by insurance companies,



users, the Government and, to a lesser degree, by NGOs. Other players in the health sector include
professional associations (e.g., private hospitals and physician associations), university faculties, and
scientific societies. Health sector development has been largely unregulated since 1975 because of the
Govermment's lack of resources and weak institutioinal capacity during and in the aftermath of the
war.
5.    With respect to outpatient services, there is an array of service providers, and the poor have
fairly satisfactory access to both pti.lic and private (i.e., NGO-operated) facilities. Although quality
of services varies considerably from one provider to another, overall there is a lack of preventive
care. As for hospital services, over 90 percent of hospital beds are operated by the private sector.
Excessive emphasis is placed on specialized care (concentrated in the Beirut area) and high
technology, which are expensive and contribute little to improving general health conditions in the
country. The poor - an estimated 30 percent of the population - are entirely dependent on the small
network of public hosp-es which, at present, offer only a limited range of services, of generally poor
quality. There is no effective referral system between the various levels of service delivery.
6.    In 1992, total expenditure for health was approxinately US$301 million, or 5.4 percent of
GDP - a large figure for the region. During the war, MOH became increasingly less able to provide
adequate services to the uninsured population - currently, an estimated 44 percent of the total
population - and began purchasing services frem the private sector. A disproportionate share (75-80
percent) of MOH's recurrent budget is now allocated to reimbursement of private hospital costs for
uninsured patients. The MOH has no control over these expenditures and there are indications that
most private hospitals are overcharging for their services. Furthermore, these subsidies are lagely
used for high-cost interventions at the expense of esse,ntial services and public health programs.
7.    Project Objectives. The long-term objective of the project is to improve the country's health
conditions through better allocation and use of resources in the public and private sectors. The short
to medm-tetm  objectives are: (i) to enable MOH to effectively perform management and
administrative functions that are critical to fiuther development in the sector; and (ii) to respond to
ummet health needs of poor populaton groups which rely on public services, particularly general
hospitls and selected health centers. The project is fully consistent with the national health policy, as
expressed in a Letter of Sectoral Policy issued by MOH during project preparation.
8.    Project Description. The project will follow a two-pronged approach: Part A will assist the
Government in developing and implementing its sector strategy by supporting the establishment of
regulaory, planning, and coordination capabilities in MOH. Part B will support the rehabilton of
selected health facilities, giving particular attention to improving the availability of essential public
health and clinical services to underserved population groups.
9.    Part A: Institutional Component. This component of the project will:
Restore essential administraive and managerial functions of MOH. The project will assist the
staff of MOH in: (i) reviewing the administrative stucture and procedures of MOH; (ii)
developing and establishing a national information system; (iii) strengtheng the manageent
of health centers; and (iv) strengthening the management of public hospitals;
-2 -



Re-establish planning and normative functions in the sector. The project will assist the staff
of MOH in: (i) establishing a carte sanitaire (a functional analysis of the health system
network) of the country; and (ii) planning for further development of health services; and
lmgrove health care financing. The project will assist the staff of MOH in: (i) containing
costs of MOH expenditure for private services; and (ii) preparing a plan for reform in health
sector fincing by undertaking five studies, namely a review and evaluation of the allocation
of MOH expenditures, a review of existing cost recovery mechanisms at public facilities, a
national household survey on the consumption of health care, a feasibility study of the
establishment of HMOs, and a review of the alternative scenarios for health care financing..
10.   Part B: Improving Health Care Delivery. This component of the project will support the
rehabilitation of buildings and equipment at selectee primary health care facilities - 10 public health
centers and 20 health centers operated by NGOs - and at 6 public general hospitals providing
secondary health care. All project facilities already exist and remained operational throughout the
war; therefore, there will be no expansion of the current health care delivery system.
Public health centers. The 10 public health centers have been selected for their location in
underserved areas and their large population coverage, their past and current performance, the
availability of sufficient staff and the existence of the basic physical facilities that are required
to perform a full range of essential health services. A standard package of essential public
health and clinical services (including health education) has been developed and will be
delivered at each center. The project will also provide the necessary civil works, equipment
and furniture, vehicles and medical supplies to bring the 10 centers up to standard.
Private health centers. The MOH has recognized the need for collaboration between
government and private health center networks and has recendy approved a model contractual
agreement with some of the main NGOs involved in the sector. The project will provide the
additional equipment, training, and operational support needed to implement MOH/NGO
contractual agreements on a pilot basis in 20 health centers run by leading NGOs. The
centers have been selected on the basis of well-defined criteria that include complementarity
with the public network of health centers with regard to population coverage, satisfactory
performance, adequate staffing, buildings, cost recovery mechanisms and, to a lesser extent,
equipment.
Frontline referral hospitals. Support for a limited network of public hospitals is needed to
ensure the provision of essential services to the poor and uninsured in areas of the country
where satisfactory services are not available through the private sector. Public hospitals are
already serving the uninsured poor who would benefit from an increase in the quality of care
in these facilities. There is an unmet demand for services in these facilities and utilization -
already significant - is expected to increase as a result of the proposed rehabilitation. The six
hospitals have been selected for their importance as referral facilities, the need for
rehabilitation, and the complementarity with other donors' programs. They all maintained
their operations during the war and are adequately staffed. However, as with public health
centers, the quality and range of services delivered have significantly diminished with the
progressive deterioration of buildings and equipment. The project will provide the necessary
civil works, equipment and furniture, vehicles, and technical assistance to rehabilitate the
buildings and equipment at the six hospitals.

11.   ProJect Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at IL80,602 million
(US$48.1 million equivalent) of which LL39,207 million (US$23.4 million equivalent) or 49 percent
of the total project cost, is the foreign exchange component. The proposed loan of US$35.7 million
equivalent will finance about 74 percent of the total project cost. The project will finance local costs
in the amount of US$12.29 million to help the Government fund technical assistance and other
institutional development activities, as well as part of the incremental costs generated by the project
(on a declining basis). The Government will finance US$12.42 million equivalent. Project costs and
financing are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule
B. The timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Lebanon are
provided in Schedules C and D. respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13604, dated
December 1, 1994, is attached.
12.   Project Inplementation. The MOH will be the executing agency for the project. However,
the procurement of all goods and services will be handled on behalf of MOH by the Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which has experience in project implementation. Within
MOH, the General Director of Health will have responsibility for the project. A Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) has been established within MOH to coordinate and monitor the project, in close
collaboration with the concerned divisions of MOH and with other govermnent agencies involved,
including CDR. The PCU will be headed by a full time Project Manager who would be responsible
for day to day implementation of the project, under the general supervision of the General Director of
Health. The PCU will be staffed with an accountant, a computer expert, a civil works engineer, a
procurement specialist and the necessary support staff. A Joint Committee CDR/MOH will
periodically review all procurement activities under the project.
13.   Project Sustainability. Project sustainability will largely depend on: (i) Government
ownership; (ii) demand from stakeholders including beneficiaries; (iii) domestic institutional capability
to operate and manage the output; (iv) financial affordability; and (v) advancing sectoral development
towards a more efficient and effective system. All of these determinants are either present or are
being developed by the project. The final year's real incremental costs are a reasonable indication of
the project's long-term budgetary requirements. Assuming that MOH recurrent expenditures could
remain at 4.9 percent of the Government's operating budget (excluding debt servicing), MOH's
budget would have to increase by 4.6 percent to cover the projeet's incremental recurrent costs and
would then represent 5.1 percent of government spending. Such an increase should be easily met
given the importance accorded by the Government to the health sector. The probability of a project's
sustainability is increased if it furthers sectoral development towards greater efficiency and
effectiveness, e.g., increases the Government's ability to do "more with less". In this regard, the
project will assist in two ways: first, by establishing task forces which encourage dialogue between
different sector players to find solutions; and second, by introducing necessary tools and establishing
systems to begin addressing the problems of inefficient use of resources (e.g., resulting from duplicate
and false billing). Data collection systems and the development of a carte sanitaire will assist the
Government in strategic sector planning by making it possible to identify medical and geographic
priorities for investment.
14.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. As there are not any recently
completed projects in Lebanon, lessons learned from previous experience cannot be applied in this
case.
-4 -



15.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank approved the Emergency Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) in March 1993, designed to finance high priority components of the
Government's National Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP). The proposed Health Sector
Rehabilitation Project will support the health sector component of the program; it will assist the
Government in the institutional development of MOH. as well as in the rehabilitation of selected
public hospitals and health centers, and will be in line with the Bank's assistance strategy in Lebanon,
which was presented to the Board in June 1994 (Report 1305-LE), and focuses on: (i) helping to
rebuild and strengthen a public administration that would focus on establishing an enabling
envirownent for private sector activity: (ii) rehabilitating selected physical infrastructure in close
coordination with private sector initiatives; and (iii) helping the Govenmment to address social needs
and to invest in human resources development.
16.   Agreements Reached During Negotiations. During negotiations, the Government agreed
that:
(a) MOH will submit to the Bank for comments, a health services development plan, and
endorse the plan, by June 30. 1997.
(b) MOH will submit to the Bank a detailed plan for the implementation of the
recommendations of the five studies on health sector financing reform which will be
carried out under the project, by December 31, 1997.
(c) MOH will establish by December 31, 1997, an intersectoral committee to monitor
implementation of the recommendations made by the five studies, consisting of
representatives of MOH, the other ministries involvej in the provision and financing of
health services, the Ministry of Finance, the main health insurance companies (public and
private), the existing HMOs, and the main providers of health care.
(d) MOH will carry out and furnish to the Bank for review and comments, an evaluation of
the quality and quantity of the essential services provided at the 20 health centers
operated by NGOs under contractual agreements with MOH, by June 30, 1997.
(e) MOH will allocate the necessary recurrent budget, on an annual basis, for all operation
and maintenance of project facilities and will submit to the Bank for its review and
comments, details on these allocations, no later than April 15, each year until the
completion of the project.
(f) MOH will maintain the PCU for the duration of the project, with staffing, functions and
authority agreed on with the Bank.
(g) The Govermnent will retain for the duration of the project the Joint Conmnittee
MOHICDR, with functions and authority agreed on with the Bank.
(h) MOH will incorporate in its regular budget the additional staff positions provided under
the project to strengthen the ministry, in accordance with a schedule agreed on between
the Borrower and the Bank.
5-



(i) The Government will open and maintain a special account for the project, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
(j) The Government will provide the jlank, within six months of the end of each fiscal year
of the Govermnent, with an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against
a certified statement of expenditures.
(k) MOH will furnish the Bank with semi-annual reports on the implementation of the
project.
(I) MOH will carry out monittoring and evaluation of the project, in accordance with the
indicators and schedule agreed on with the Bank.
(m) The Government will undertake with the Bank a mid-term review of the project.
17.   Poverty Category. The project is included in the Program of Targeted Interventions since
the population of project beneficiaries .iias a significantly larger proportion of poor people than the
country's population as a whole. The main beneficiaries of the investment component of the project
are the uninsured, consisting of approximately 45 percent of the population as a whole, including the
poor, which make up approximately 30 percent of the population. The project is self-targeting as the
majority of public hospitals and public health centers are used almost exclusively by the poor and
approximately 60 percent of those using the NGO-operated health centers are poor.
18.   Environmental Aspects. The project will not have significant environmental impact and,
therefore, an environmental assessment is not needed. The rehabilitation of the six hospitals under
the project will include the provision of disposal systems for both medical and sanitary waste.
19.   Program Objective Categories. The Program Objective Categories are Human Resource
Development and Poverty Reduction.
20.   Participatory Approach. The institutional strengthening component of the project will be
carried out by several task forces to be established within MOH involving a wide range of
institutional stakeholders. These task forces will include: (i) existing MOH staff; (ii) contract staff to
be recruited specifically for the project, who will be gradually incorporated in MOH's regular staffing
structure; (iii) individuals and institutions, such as NGOs, universities and professional associations
that have a particular expertise, play a key role in the area concerned, or will participate in the work
of the task forces on an advisory basis; and (iv) local and international consultants. All participating
institutions [(iii) above] have been identified and most of them were closely involved in project
preparation.
21.   The investment component of the project will support selected NGOs, on a pilot basis, in
delivering a package of essential services. A draft agreement between MOH and the NGOs
concerned was prepared during project preparation and reviewed by the Bank. The NGOs would be
committed to increasing their preventive and public health services, and expanding outreach
programs. Through the project, MOH will provide the additional equipment, training and operational
support they need to expand these services.
- 6 -



22.   Project Benefits.  Part A of the project will initiate tasks that are critical to the development
of the health sector and enable the identification of area :or further investment; it will help restore
the role of the Government in the sector. Part B of the project will improve the delivery of essential
public health and clinical services to an estimated 750,000 people who live in the inmnediate
catchment areas of the health centers to be rehabilitated and will constitute the first step towards
closer collaboration between MOH and the other providers of health services, mainly NGOs.
Rehabilitation of the public hospitals will provide enhanced inpatient services to the population living
in underserved areas that cover about half of the country. Through this rehabilitation, the project will
also establish the basis for an effective referral system.
23.   Risks. The main risk relates to the limited institutional capacity of the implementing agency,
MOH, combined with its lack of familiarity with the Bank's procedures in general. Consequently,
Bank staff will need to play a mnore active role than usual in supervision of the project. During
itnplementation, the project will provide technical assistance and training to establish a project and
generally strengthen MOH's capacity. All procurement activities will be handled by CDR on behaif
of MOH. The CDR is familiar with the Bank's guidelines and procedures as well as with the
implementation of externally assisted projects in general. Moreover, the project scope has been kept
as simple as possible, given the magnitude of the needs and complexity of the health sector situation.
24.   A second risk is the possibility that political changes may jeopardize Government commitment
to essential policies, such as the shift of priorities and resources toward the delivery of essential
services, and the use of private rather than government health care providers. However, such a
reversal in policy, although not impossible, would go against the views expressed by most parties
concerned, both within and outside of the Government.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
