The\n            short- to medium-term objectives are: 1) to enable the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) to effectively perform management\n            and administrative functions that are critical to further\n            development in the sector; and 2) to respond to unmet health\n            needs of poor population groups who rely on public services,\n            particularly selected health centers and general hospitals.\n            The key elements of the sectoral policy are: 1) improving\n            primary health care thorough the introduction of a\n            comprehensive package of curative and preventive services to\n            be delivered by all public health facilities and\n            participating NGOs; 2) improving secondary care in the\n            public sector by strengthening hospital management and\n            service delivery capability; 3) improving health financing\n            by initiating system-wide studies of alternative health\n            financing options, including proposals for a gradual\n            reallocation of the health budget to better reflect health\n            priorities as stated in Government policy; and 4)\n            establishing MOH's capability to implement these strategies."}, "docdt": "1994-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
