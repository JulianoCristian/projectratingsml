The dam, 485 feet\n            high and about 9,000 feet long at its crest, will be flanked\n            by two auxiliary embankments on the left abutment.\n            Altogether, the three embankments will contain about 180\n            million cubic yards of fill materials. The embankments are\n            designed to impound 11.1 MAF of water which would provide\n            initially 9.3 MAF of live storage. Two spillways with a\n            combined discharge capacity of 1,670,000 cusecs will be\n            provided at the left abutment to handle a flood inflow of\n            2,127,000 cusecs, over twice the largest flood on record to\n            date. Four tunnels, each 45 feet in diameter at the upstream\n            end, are planned in the right abutment to divert the flow of\n            the river during construction. Three tunnels will be\n            designed to serve subsequently as power intakes and be\n            equipped in such a way that each will be able to supply four\n            generating units. The fourth tunnel is designed as a\n            permanent irrigation water release outlet."}, "docdt": "1968-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
