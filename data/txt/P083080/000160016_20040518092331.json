      the United Republic of Tanzania. The SEDP aims to: (1)\n            increase the proportion of the relevant age group completing\n            secondary education, (2) improve learning outcomes of\n            students, especially among girls, and (3) enable the public\n            administration to manage secondary education more\n            effectively. In order to expand enrollments with equity. The\n            SEDP includes measures to: (a) make more efficient use of\n            resources, (b) provide development grants to schools and\n            communities mainly in underserved areas, (c) expand teacher\n            supply, (d) lower household costs for secondary education\n            and expand the scholarship program for students from poor\n            families, and (e) enhance the partnership with the\n            non-government sector. The program for quality improvement\n            includes: (a) curricula and examinations reforms, (b)\n            provision of textbooks and teaching materials through\n            capitation grants to schools, and (c) quality improvements\n            in pre-service teacher training together with establishment\n            of a system for professional in-service teacher development.\n            The SEDP also includes institutional reforms and capacity\n            building at central, region, district, and school levels for\n            more efficient operation of the secondary education system.\n            Three tranches of US$50 million each will be disbursed after\n            the agreed actions for tranche release are successfully completed."}, "docdt": "2004-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
