Education\n            Development Program (SEDP) Project in Tanzania were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included:   government ownership and strong\n            political support is essential for program implementation.\n            Involvement of all stakeholders from conception, development\n            and implementation of reforms is also critical to enhance\n            ownership of the reforms at all levels. Communities have a\n            vested interest in education of their children and when\n            given an opportunity, are willing and able to play their\n            part in implementation of education reforms. However, demand\n            from the communities may pressurize the Government to expand\n            even beyond available resources. There is need to pay more\n            attention to developing capacity and ensuring that all the\n            necessary structures are in place if successful\n            implementation of education reforms are to be efficient and\n            cost effective. There was inadequate capacity building\n            during the SEDP launching of implementers at various levels\n            such as for: administrators, school heads, school boards,\n            who in some cases are still not established in some schools,\n            and teachers. Capacity building at all levels, is therefore,\n            indispensable to implementation of reforms and should be\n            ongoing and financed adequately. Decentralization, is a good\n            model for development, because of its ability to\n            institutionalize participation of more stakeholders, and\n            increased accountability. However, its success hinges on\n            adequate communication and development of the requisite\n            capacity of all actors at all levels. This seems to have\n            worked well for the implementation of SEDP, especially given\n            that the decentralization was taking place within the\n            overall decentralization policy of the Government."}, "docdt": "2008-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
