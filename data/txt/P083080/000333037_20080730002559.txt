1.   Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Since the mid 1990s Tanzania has made substantial progress in implementing structural
reforms and its economy today is largely becoming market oriented. However, it does not
have an adequate qualified and trained work force for effective diversification of
production and export bases for economic growth. Poverty remains a concern for
Tanzania with income levels still among the lowest in Africa. The Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) prepared in 2000 emphasized priority sectors of primary
education, primary health care, agricultural research and extension, rural roads, the
judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction for Poverty
(NSGRP) approved in 2005; aims at: (i) reducing income poverty particularly in rural
areas; (ii) improving quality of life and social wellbeing; and (iii) strengthening
governance and accountability.

Achievement of the Government's development goals would depend on a better-educated
workforce. Specifically, the NSGRP calls for increased transition rates from primary to
secondary education from 23 percent in 2004 to 50 percent in 2010. For many years the
Government showed commitment to improve its education sector as indicated in the
Education and Training Policy (ETP) of 1995 which emphasized liberalization of the
provision of education. Based on the ETP, in 2001, the Government formulated an
overall Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP). The Plan stipulated the vision and
objectives of education, and defined institutional arrangements for its implementation.
This included a structure to enhance coordination and dialogue among the key
stakeholders including Development Partners and the Non-State Actors through the Basic
Education Development Committee (BEDC), for primary and secondary education;
Technical and Higher Education Development Committee (THEDC); and the Vocational
and Folk Education Development Committee (VFED).

As part of the phase one of implementation of the ESDP, the Primary Education
Development Program (PEDP) was formulated in collaboration with Development
Partners and the Bank. An IDA Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr.3570-TA) amounting
US$ 150 million, and a Dutch Grant amount of US$ 50 million disbursed through three
tranches, supported the PEDP. The Credit and Grant became effective on February 1,
2002, and closed on October 31, 2004. Reforms in primary education lifted the Gross
Enrollment Ratio (GER) from 78 percent in 2000 to almost 114 percent in 2007. The
secondary school GER however, was among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa at just
nine percent of the relevant age group. In linkage with the PEDP and the ESDP, the
Government launched the Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP) in mid
2004 to reform secondary education. SEDP was planned to start with phase one
implementation covering the period between 2004 and 2009.




                                         1

Previous analysis of the sector was carried out for the ESDP and for the Secondary
Education Master Plan (SEMP) 2001-2005, supported by Development Partners. A
further comprehensive review of secondary education including specific studies on
teacher demand and supply, costs and financing, curriculum, textbooks, examinations,
administration and management of secondary education was undertaken for the SEDP
design. The analyses revealed that: (i) Tanzania had the lowest secondary GERs in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA); (ii) transition rates from primary to secondary were low compared
to other countries in the region; (iii) secondary enrollment ratios were low for all
population groups, but especially for low-income youth and students in rural areas; and
(iv) few Government schools were established, and inadequate incentives existed to
establish non-Government schools in rural communities where households are unable to
pay the school fees required.

A policy shift in the early 80s emphasizing community and private sector participation
was effective in coping with some of the excess demand for secondary education. It was
apparent however, that because of the high cost of private education, establishment of
community schools with Government support would be the most viable means of
increasing secondary enrolments particularly for the underserved areas. Support from the
Government would include paying salaries for all teachers and staff, provision of
development and capitation grants for school construction, purchase of textbooks, and
learning materials respectively for the schools. Other recurrent costs would be borne by
schools from tuition fees.

School fees introduced in secondary education in the late 1980s, and other contributions
from parents which are estimated to be 35-40 percent of the total Government costs per
student, were prohibitive for many households, given the low household income level of
Tanzania. This depressed the overall demand for secondary education.

The introduction of free primary education in 2001 caused a bulge in primary
enrollments, and the increasing number of primary school leavers created mounting
pressure for places in secondary schools. Government therefore, needed to transform the
secondary education system into a mass system catering to a much larger and more
diverse group of students.

The quality of secondary education was low as reflected in examination results (2000-
2003) where half of all examinees achieved Division IV which ranges from 26 points to
33 points (5 Ds plus 2 Cs to as low as 2Ds) and is the lowest pass level requiring only a
minimum of a "D" pass in two subjects. The passes did not require a pass in either
mathematics or sciences. Girls under-performed, particularly in mathematics and the
transition rate for girls from lower to upper secondary was only 23 percent, compared
with 33 percent for boys.

Low student achievements in the lower secondary education cycle stemmed from among
other things: an overloaded curriculum which was not sufficiently outcomes based; a
shortage of qualified teachers, insufficient in-service upgrading and continuous



                                           2

professional development of teachers; a shortage of teaching and learning resources and
an inefficient application of resources for learning.

All Government secondary schools were supervised directly by the zonal inspectors
under the MoEVT. School administrators had authority over school level decisions but
little flexibility in the use of Government budgetary resources. Greater effectiveness
required a review of the regulatory framework and some degree of devolution of power,
with new roles defined for regions, districts, School Boards and school heads for
improved delivery of secondary education services.


1.2 Original PDO and Key Indicators

The long term aim of the SEDP is to build a productive and adoptable labor force and
supplying better quality students for the post-secondary education and training system.
Specifically, the objectives of the SEDP are to: (i) increase the proportion of the relevant
age group completing lower and upper secondary education, especially underserved
groups who are now getting better opportunities to complete primary education through
the PEDP; (ii) improve learning outcomes of students, especially girls, and at the lower
secondary level; and (iii) enable the public administration to manage secondary education
more effectively, through the devolution of authority to lower levels, and strengthening of
management capacities. The access and equity objective were to be achieved through
using existing resources more efficiently, assisting poor communities to build and expand
facilities, expanding teacher outputs, reducing the costs of secondary education at
household level, providing scholarships to poor students and collaborate with non-
Government schools. The quality objective was to be pursued through reforms in
curricula, textbook provision, examinations and professional development of teachers.
Improved service delivery included measures for decentralization and institutional
capacity building at central, district, and school levels respectively.

In order to support the Government of Tanzania in achieving these objectives, IDA
financed the SEDP through a Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. No.3915- TA) of SDR
82.7 (US$ 123.6 million) and a Grant (No. H093) of SDR17.7 (US$ 26.4 million). The
Credit and Grant became effective in September 2004, and closed in December 2007.

The Structural Adjustment Credit Lending instrument was chosen because IDA used a
similar instrument in supporting the PEDP. This was successful in carrying out
fundamental reforms to expand school access; education quality; and school retention in
primary education in Tanzania. It also provided the flexibility that is required when
implementing reforms of wider scope in terms of content, and programs of national
coverage. It was possible to use the IDA support flexibly for both recurrent and
development costs focusing on key priorities of the program. The instrument also enabled
the Bank to support the policy and institutional changes necessary to address system-wide
issues, focusing on priorities and appropriate resource allocation in secondary education
while helping the Government to build the base towards a sustainable system for
providing quality secondary education.

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification.

The PDO or key indicators were not revised during implementation.

1.4 The Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

There were three key policy reforms aimed at improving: (i) access and equity; (ii)
educational achievements, and (iii) service management and delivery. Measures adopted
for these policy reforms include the following:

Improving Access and Equity
· Reducing teaching costs per student by increasing the ratio through lowering Pupil to
    PTR from the then 21:1 in 2003 to a maximum of 30:1 in 2009, and better utilization
    of learning resources, school infrastructure and consolidation of the curriculum.
· Assisting communities to build schools, and providing incentives for non-
    Government schools to increase their enrollments further, through provision of
    development grants to qualifying non-government schools and streamlining
    procedures for registration.
· Lowering the costs of education at household level by reducing tuition fees in
    Government day schools from Tsh. 40,000 to Tsh. 20,000; elimination of other
    constraints to enrolments, and provision of fee subsidies to the Government day
    schools.
· Providing meals to Government boarding schools to improve attendance.
· Expanding scholarships for children from poorer households.
· Introducing innovative schemes to produce qualified teachers more quickly, and
    support their practice more effectively through improvement in conditions of service
    and opportunities for professional development.
· Expanding distance learning programs for those who cannot access formal secondary
    education, through development of quality teaching materials and support from local
    tutors.

Improving Educational Achievements
· Reforming the curricula, including concentration on fewer, updated subject content
    with more focus on defined learning outcomes, and to make the curriculum more
    relevant to students' life, work and future training requirements.
· Carrying out comprehensive examinations reforms, coupled with improved school-
    based monitoring and assessment.
· Stimulating a market for textbooks and improve their quality through incentives for
    private book publishers and sellers, and strengthening of the evaluation and approval
    systems and rigorous standards.
· Enhancing practical pre-service teacher training and provision of opportunities for
    continuous professional development of school administrators and teachers; and
· Paying attention to HIV/AIDS and other cross-cutting issues by assessment of the
    currently HIV/AIDS programs and integration of HIV/AIDS information into the
    curriculum for schools and Teacher Training Colleges.




                                            4

Improving Service Management and Delivery
· Revising Regulatory Framework which would include streamlining the procedures
    for registering non-Government schools.
· Carryout decentralization within the ongoing Public and Local Government Reforms
    by devolving major administrative and management functions to lower levels of the
    system. This would include student admission and placement, and teacher recruitment
    and deployment. The process would strengthen the role of communities in the
    management and administration of the schools at the local level.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

None of the policy areas was revised during implementation of the SEDP.

1.6 Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in the implementation of the program except the
extension of the closing date of the Credit from June 30, 2007 to December 31, 2007.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    Program Performance

As a result of the implementation of the SEDP, significant progress has been made in the
implementation of the policies adopted by Government albeit with varying results as will
be discussed in this report. The number of schools increased tremendously and so did
enrolments which exceeded what was planned. Capitation and development grants were
disbursed to schools for the purchase of learning and teaching materials, and school and
classroom construction as detailed under the Access and Equity paragraph below.
Implementation however, faced many challenges which Government continues to
address. The expansion of secondary education surpassed the targets that had been set in
the medium growth and high growth scenarios. This put pressure on the resources
available and the teachers needed to maintain the PTR at 30:1 as targeted in the SEDP.
The PTR has been rising from 21:1 in 2003, to 31:1 in 2006, and 38:1 in 2007 in
Government secondary schools. These challenges continue to affect implementation of
the SEDP and Government's efforts to resolve them continue. In this regard, while the
objectives of increasing access were met beyond expectation, the objectives on quality
still have to be realized as the program continues to be implemented.

The achievements realized in the program therefore, reflect a strong and continuing
commitment of the URT to the policy reforms it adopted in improving provision of
secondary education. This can be measured by Government's commitment to for
instance, allocating resources to the program and continued implementation of the
reforms initiated through the SEDP, as well as its performance in meeting all the
conditions for Tranche Releases as summarized below.

Access and Equity: The Government adopted strategies to enhance access which
included provision of development grants for construction of new schools and expansion
of the existing schools; provision of scholarships to qualified students from very poor
households; reduced day school fees including Government provision of fees subsidy to
day schools. Policies and guidelines for implementation were also provided. As a result
of these strategies, Government schools increased from 828 in 2004 to 2,806 in 2007
particularly for the underserved rural and urban as well as difficult and hard to reach
areas. Much of the increase was in the community areas where day schools to serve the
underserved areas have been established. The increase was in addition to the 101
Government boarding schools established a couple of years back spread over different


                                                  7

regions.    Private schools also increased from 463 to 679 during the same period as
shown in Figure 1. This presents an increase of 170 percent. Construction has included
provision of libraries, laboratories, ablution blocks and in some places hostels to improve
girls' enrolments and retention. A total of 70 schools, were rehabilitated and expanded to
enroll "A" level students.

The Government issued the Development Grant (Construction) Monitoring and
Evaluation Guidelines to all schools to guide construction activities and ensure quality of
infrastructure. Nevertheless, supervision and monitoring was in some cases inadequate
resulting into infrastructure whose quality is below the expected standards. During the
Education Sector Review of 2007, it was noted that technical aspects of construction and
maintenance should be adhered to by schools and other levels of supervision. Delays in
approving school construction at the municipal level and disbursement of development
grants has in some cases delayed construction. For instance in 2005/2006, a total of 1,569
out of a target of 1,914 schools were constructed. Similarly, during the same period a
total of 908 teachers' houses out of a target of 957 were constructed. Construction is
ongoing in most new schools adding one facility after the other as funds become
available following annual budgetary allocations. It will take a few more years before all
the needed facilities are in place in the newly established schools.

The increase in school infrastructure accompanied by better utilization, the reduction of
tuition fees from Tsh. 40,000 to Tsh. 20,000 adopted in January 2005, the increased
scholarships to children from poorer households and provision of meals in boarding
schools have led to an increase in student enrolment. Up to 23,873 students (5 percent of
enrolment) benefited from scholarships in 2005/06, and 34,012 students in 2006/07 and
51,220 in 2007/08. According to the LDP, a total number of 48,000 students were
targeted to benefit from the scholarships during the phase one implementation of the
SEDP (2004-2009). The target has been surpassed given the increasing demand for
scholarships at household levels.

Government also expanded and strengthened the Open Distance Learning (ODL) to
enable out-of-school youths to enroll in secondary education through 43 study centers
which were established during 2005/06. A total of 13,000 students were enrolled against
an initial target of 10,000 students. The Institute of Adult Education (IAE) reviewed the
syllabi for the 7 subjects (English, Kiswahili, History, Geography, Mathematics, Civics,
and Biology). In addition, regional resident tutors and head office staff were trained in
effective management and operationalization of the ODL.

The number of students with disabilities has remained low and was 902 (0.09 percent)
comprising 568 boys and 334 girls in 2007. The majority of these (608 comprising 393
boys and 215 girls) are physically impaired. The SEDP did not specify the target to be
achieved for students with disabilities.

Figure 2 shows that enrolment in Government and non-Government schools has been
increasing from 432,599 in 2004 to 1,020,510 in 2007, an increase of 136 percent. The
largest increase was in the Government schools where enrolments increased by 213
percent from 264,888 to 829,094 over the same period. The figure shows that girls'
enrolments have been increasing since 2004 albeit below that of boys with the girl/boy
ratio increasing from 86.0 percent in 2004 to 88.7 percent in 2006, and falling (by 0.8
percent) to 87.9 percent in 2007. These statistics suggest that the objective of increasing
girls in the system is being achieved.

The GER for overall secondary education increased from 9.4 percent in 2004 to 22.1
percent in 2007, while the NER increased from 5.9 percent to 20.6 percent over the same
period. The GER and NER are much lower at upper secondary (Form 5-6) but increased
from a GER of 2.1 percent in 2004 to 3.7 in 2007, and a NER of 0.5 percent to 0.9
percent during the same period. The overall secondary education GER for girls was 13.7
percent (12.6 percent NER) in 2006; and 20.3 percent (19.6 percent NER) in 2007. The
GER for boys was 16.0 percent in 2006 and 23.9 percent in 2007. The figures indicate
that there is good progress in increasing girls' enrollment given the expansion of schools
within communities and provision of girls' hostels in some places.

The Basic Education Statistics in Tanzania (BEST) shows that dropout out rate was
reduced from 7.2 percent in 2004/05 to 4.4 percent in 2006/07, signifying better
retention.             The key identified reasons for dropout in 2006 has been truancy (62.6


                                                  9

percent), lack of school needs (7.2 percent) and pregnancy (8 percent). This implies that
there are still barriers inhibiting some students from completing the full secondary school
cycle. The truancy issue is mostly related to poverty at some household levels leading
students to leave school for other activities that could help them generate an income.

Learning Outcomes: Strategies adopted included review of the curriculum, provision of
learning and teaching materials through provision of capitation grants, provision of
trained teachers and developing them further through in-service training, and increased
school inspection.

Review of Curriculum: The revision of the curriculum for the mainland by the TIE,
involved rationalizing the number of subjects and combinations offered in schools, and
addressed teacher - subject workloads. Analytical skills were made more market demand
oriented. The revised curriculum now emphasizes the development of competences as
opposed to the previous curriculum which emphasized acquisition of content. The
curriculum was also revised to incorporate cross-cutting issues such as HIV/AIDS,
gender and environmental issues. Circular No. 1 of April 2006, provided guidelines to
education staff at regional, district and school levels on the implementation of the new
curriculum.




                                                 10

The new curriculum now contains seven core subjects instead of the previous 13. The
subjects (with periods per week indicated in brackets) include: Civics (2); History (2),
Kiswahili (3), English Language (5), Biology (3), Mathematics (3), Physics/Engineering
Science (3/3), and Chemistry (3). In addition, students in Form 1 and 2 can take one
more subject out of six different option subjects. New syllabi have been developed for the
core subjects and were introduced in 2005. First examinations based on the new syllabi
will be in October 2008. The curriculum for Forms 5 and 6 were not reviewed as part of
this exercise. The curriculum review has streamlined the content to reduce overlaps
within and across different subjects and making it more competence based. Learner based
teaching has been adopted in the curriculum. These revisions have helped to among other
things, reduce the teacher load in schools with adequate staffing.

Supply of Textbooks: To ensure that schools are not supplied with sub-standard
textbooks the EMAC, made up of MoEVT officials, the private sector entities in the book
production industry and academics was created. Its function is to approve educational
materials used in schools and teachers' colleges so as to ascertain suitability, relevance,
quality and durability. The EMAC provides lists of approved text books to schools for
guidance.

As part of the reforms and condition for the second tranche, the policy on "Publishing of
TIE Secondary School Text Books by Private Publishing" culminating in the "Legal
Agreement for Publishing Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE) Secondary School
Textbooks by Private Publishing ­ Secondary Education Development Program (2004-
2009)" was adopted by the Government. This required the private sector publishers to
play a bigger role in providing textbooks to schools. TIE was to disengage from
publishing new textbook titles and transfer its right of publishing of the existing titles to
private publishers. The objective was to improve the supply of textbooks to schools. This
has gone very well and the Government has developed the capacity in the private sector
in book publishing. This has reduced delays in provision of textbooks to the schools and
has strengthened Public Private Partnership (PPP) in textbook production and supply.

Through SEDP implementation it has been possible for schools to purchase textbooks
which were previously supplied from the central level. Capitation grants for purchasing
textbooks and other learning materials have been disbursed to schools resulting into an
increase in the amount of financial resources at school levels and flow of textbooks
(including for mathematics and sciences) as well as teaching and learning materials.
However, although overall budgetary allocations for secondary education have been
increasing, the resources have not been adequate enough to provide the targeted Tsh.
25,000 capitation grants per student due to the enrollment expansion. For instance, the
actual disbursed capitation grants for school year 2006 were only Tsh. 16,960 (68
percent) for a projected enrollment of 336,000 students out of a budget allocation of Tsh.
8.404 billion. During the same year a total of 250 million shillings of capitation grants
was disbursed to 104 qualifying non-Government schools at an average of Tsh. 5,700
only per student. If provision of less capitation grants continues it implies that school
level supply of textbooks and teaching materials will be affected and therefore, contribute
to poor quality of education.



                                           11

Training and Provision of Teachers: The provision of adequate trained teachers is
critical to improving the quality of education. Government adopted three strategies for
increasing the number of teachers. The first strategy was to increase enrolments in
teacher training colleges for: (i) diploma level teachers; and to (ii) establish an open and
distance teacher education program to upgrade diploma level teachers to degree level
through distance learning courses offered by the Open University of Tanzania (OUT);
and (iii) converting Ching'ombe Teacher Training College and Mkwawa High School to
Constituent Education Colleges under the University of Dar es Salaam in August 2005 in
order to increase training of degree level teachers. The second strategy was to create
licensed teachers who are allowed to acquire degrees through distance learning organized
by the OUT in the process of teaching. There has however, been some criticism from the
public indicating that the orientation period of one month is inadequate to prepare
teachers for adequate classroom teaching. The third strategy was to decentralize the
function of teacher deployment to the district level. The Borrower developed the
Mechanisms for Posting Teacher to Public Secondary Schools for Education
Development Plan (2004-2009) which provides guidance to improve teacher deployment
and management.

Each year new candidates are selected for pre-service training. During the period
2006/07, a total of 4,390 Form 6 graduates joined diploma in education training. In
addition, Government completed the induction and posting of 6,990 students to
secondary schools after awards of licenses to teach in the system.

An evaluation of the performance of licensed teacher has not been done. However,
assessment and feedback on their performance is provided by heads of secondary
schools, school inspectors, and MoEVT officials who visit licensed teachers to assess
them in the field. Based on the assessment, overall performance of the licensed teachers
is rated satisfactory. The feedback has helped the MoEVT to review from time to time the
one month training package offered to the newly recruited licensed teachers.

Figure 3 shows that enrolments for Diploma level teachers have been increasing for both
Government and Non-government colleges. Enrolment of diploma level teachers for
secondary education increased from 4693 in 2003, to 7,411 in 2006, and decreased to
5,959 in 2007. Discussions with the MoEVT confirmed that recruitment of diploma level
candidates will increase again as from July 2008. For the SEDP to achieve its intended
PTR of 30:1 there will be need to increase enrolment of teacher trainees at diploma and
degree levels significantly for several years to come. The Government has also carried
out a major in-service training program. As a result, the number of teachers on in-service
training increased from 520 in 2003 to 7,661 in 2006.

Through training and recruitment of new teachers the number of teachers in the system
has grown significantly. The secondary education teaching force increased from 16,399
in 2003 to 29,858 in 2007. Specifically in 2005, Government recruited 3,094 new
teachers who included 610 degree level graduates and 2,484 diploma holders. In 2006 a
total of 4,200 teachers were recruited and they included 3,700 diploma and 500 degree



                                          12

level respectively. A further 3,488 licensed teachers who had completed A level were
also recruited in 2006. As result of these efforts the total teaching staff for secondary
education in 2007 comprised 4,981 graduate teachers and 19,259 Diploma teachers as
illustrated in Annex 9.

Because of the continued expansion of student enrolment, this addition of teachers to the
system did not reduce the PTR but increased it from 20:1 in 2003 to 31:1 in 2006. The
Government has however, been continuing to train and recruit new teachers. During the
period 2006/07, Government recruited 6,000 licensed teachers and 500 degree holders,
3,070 Diploma holders and 250 retirees. Nevertheless, the PTR continued to increase
further from 31:1 in 2006 to 38:1 in 2007 in Government schools and 34:1 for the
secondary system as indicated in Annex 8.

The Government put in place some incentives for teacher retention such as adoption and
implementation of programs designed to foster continuous development of professional
skills for teachers including teacher upgrading upon completion of in-service training,
and construction of teachers' houses. A total of 1,908 teachers' houses were constructed
in FY 2005/06 and 2006/07.

The share of the teacher education budget compared to other sub-sectors has been falling
from 2.4 percent in 2004 to 1.1 percent in 2006 and increased again to 1.8 percent in
2007.     If the situation continues it could affect the quality of training because most
textbooks and reference materials are outdated in colleges. The Government has
formulated the Teacher Development and Management Strategy (TDMS) expected to be
launched in FY 2008/09. Implementation of this strategy should help to address some of


                                          13

these issues focusing on better quality of the trainees and the teacher trainers and overall
teacher development and management.

Learning Outcomes and Examinations: Impact of the curriculum reforms and efforts at
improving learning outcomes have at this stage not had a significant impact on
examination results. Implementation of the new curriculum started in 2005 and the first
candidates to write examinations based on the new competence based curriculum will sit
in October 2008. Any expected impact on examination results at this stage will be as a
result of other inputs into the learning process like trained teachers and increased learning
and teaching material. The impact so far has been limited given the short period of
implementation of the SEDP. It was anticipated during the preparation that the indicator
on improved learning outcomes which is more related to PDO (ii) would be long term
and would not be totally realized during the life of the Credit and Grant. However,
examination results have been used as a proxy to measure achievements of the PDO.

Form 2 examination results have indicated that the percentage of students who pass have
increased from 66.6 percent in 2004 to 73.6 percent in 2006. There has been a decrease in
the percentage of those failing the Certificate of Secondary Education Examination
(CSEE). Failure rates dropped from 12.0 percent in 2003 to 8.5 percent in 2004 at the
start of the SEDP and to 10.7 percent in 2005 and 10.9 percent in 2006. The percentage
of those attaining Division between I-III has been fluctuating between 39.39 percent in
2004, and 44.1 percent in 2006 having been 47.23 percent in 2003 before implementation
of the SEDP. The majority of students continue to attain Division IV which increased
from 50 percent in 2003 to 53.4 percent in 2006. The statistics also show that the highest
failure rates and least number attaining Grades I-III are in some of the community
schools. Provision of inputs (such as teachers), and learning and teaching materials
associated with other quality improvement interventions is yet to be strengthened. Girls
still perform less than boys overall, particularly in co-education schools. However, they
have tended to perform better than boys in the Seminary schools as well as none ­co-
education boarding schools. Recent A level examination results (May 2008) have
indicated that girls have been leading (during this period) with higher scores than boys in
some subjects including science.

Overall, progress is being made in reforming examinations through the National
Examination Council of Tanzania (NECTA). A small sample of teachers has been trained
in item writing which was piloted in the schools. Plans are underway to prepare a pool of
15 examiners and markers per subject for the new curriculum subjects. A significant
improvement has been the creation of the Comprehensive Examination Management
Information System which will allow candidates to register and access national
examination results on line.

The NECTA faces a number of challenges. The first being that human and financial
resources need to be increased to ensure enough capacity to manage: (i) examinations
given the increased enrollment expansion; and (ii) the demands of the new curriculum.
NECTA's resources come from Government subvention and fees paid by candidates set




                                           14

with the approval of the MoEVT to make them affordable to all candidates4. The second
challenge is high staff turnover as a result of low salaries. A review of salaries has been
agreed to but has yet to be implemented within the context of broader implementation of
the Public Service Reforms.

An overall assessment framework based on the new curriculum has been developed and
will start to be implemented in FY 2008/09. Guidelines have also been developed for
strengthening school based continuous monitoring and assessment of learning
achievements which should contribute 50 percent of the final student assessment.
However, implementation of the guidelines has not been adequately monitored yet to
determine its impact and reliability particularly in private schools. Nevertheless,
prospects of the reforms being implemented by NECTA are going as planned and likely
to produce the desired outcomes with continued implementation.

School Inspection: Efforts have been made to strengthen the capacity of the inspectorate
system for better service delivery including professional support to teachers. This has
been done through supply of computers, photocopiers, printers and vehicles to the zonal
inspectorate offices. School inspectors have also been trained to enable them support
teachers in implementing the new curriculum. However, the inspectorate system, which is
essential for quality enhancement, is under staffed with inadequate resources to carry out
its work effectively. During the period 2006/07, there were only 141 inspectors for the
3,000 secondary schools and 55 Teacher Training Colleges. According to inspection
requirements, a school should be inspected at least once biannually. However, during the
period 2006/07 only 26 percent of the targeted schools were inspected. Although
inspection of schools is decentralized to the zonal level, the increase in the number of
secondary schools since the inception of the SEDP has created a serious challenge to the
inspectorate system in view of the increased number of schools, current level of staffing,
and budgetary allocations to adequately deliver its mandated services. There are plans to
enhance school site supervision by empowering school heads through capacity building
so that the inspectorate only supervises a sample of the schools. In addition to this, the
Government plans to strengthen the inspectorate through recruitment of more inspectors,
provision of additional resources, transport and office equipment and training.

Improved Service Management and Delivery: The Government has been aiming at
improving administration and management of secondary education more effectively,
through devolution of authority to lower levels and strengthening of management
capacities. This was done as part of the Local Government Reform Program. Some
management roles have been devolved to the region, district and school levels, with
increased participation of the community through the creation of school management
boards appointed within the region and other local levels with approval by the Regional
Education Officer (REO).




4UNICEF has also supported training and orientation activities and development of guidelines for school
based monitoring and assessment based on the new curriculum.




                                               15

Training of these key players at different levels was necessary for effective
implementation of the SEDP and is ongoing. This will require sustained efforts and more
resources. A total of 708 school administrators particularly the newly appointed heads
were trained in school management by Agency for the Development of Educational
Management (ADEM) in 2006/07. Training was also offered to 1,351 out of 1,540
targeted school management teams comprising heads of schools, senior academic and
discipline staff, school maintenance teams, and school accountants. Some training has
also been provided to officers at the MoEVT level. In some cases, induction of new
school heads has not been adequate. Lack of office facilities and equipment has also
placed serious limitations in the ability of the school administration to manage education
sufficiently.

School management boards have been set up and they have been effective in mobilizing
additional resources from the communities and through their cooperation in participating
in school affairs. This emphasizes the importance which the communities have placed on
secondary education. Some new schools have however, not yet established such boards
and this had placed a burden on school heads.

The level of supervision and support provided by Councils to the schools, has been in
some cases, inadequate due to capacity constraints. Overall, there is need to strengthen
further the systems and structures at this level particularly in a situation where inspectors
are not able to provide regular support needed at the school level. The appointment of
District Secondary Education Coordinators (DSEC) in 2006 was in this regard, an
important step in improving administration at the district level to strengthen school
support system.


Major Factors Affecting Implementation

The achievements realized in the implementation of the SEDP are a result of many
factors which include the following:

Commitment at the high political level: There was political commitment and support to
the SEDP and education in general at the highest Government level, which has remained
high. The ownership and commitment of other stakeholders, and particularly the
communities, politicians/parliamentarians, and private providers have also remained
strong because of the realization of the importance of secondary education to the
development of Tanzania. The policies adopted at preparation have remained in place and
mechanisms for smooth implementation are being jointly reviewed through BEDC
consultations and the joint sector reviews.

The Government continues to provide resources for the development and capitation
grants which have now been integrated in the annual budgetary allocation system to
ensure that each year the government budget includes these grants. In FY 2007/08 for
example, Government allocated Tsh. 27,564,981,900 which should be sufficient and
closer to the Tsh. 25,000 target per pupil as stated in the LDP. As noted in Table 1 below,




                                           16

budgetary allocations to secondary education have also been increasing from 10.1 percent
in 2003/04 to 15.7 percent in 2007/08.

The period 2007/08 to 2008/09 is going to be critical since this will be the end of the first
phase of implementation of the phase one SEDP. It will be a period through which
planning for phase II should be started as indicated in the ESDP Framework

Program Planning and Implementation: The SEDP is part of ESDP implementation and
is technically sound. The program was based on a careful analysis of enrollment targets,
teacher demand and financial requirements for the sector as a whole. The technical design
of the program was done by Government and vetted through Government's thematic
technical working groups on school access, education quality, financing and resources,
and institutional arrangements. The implementation arrangements, including coordination
of different actors involved in the sector were built on experiences from the on-going
PEDP, as revised and modified to take into account lessons learned.

The objectives were consistent with the PRS as well as the current NSGRP in which the
education sector has been given priority. This continued to be within the context of
Government's comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) focusing on higher growth, poverty reduction and institutional
reforms to improve governance and service delivery.

Critical risks were mapped and considered as moderate. These were financial
management, procurement, implementation capacity, availability of teachers and
affordability of parents to pay school fees. Measures to minimize the impact of these
risks were considered and adopted and continue to be implemented.

As part of the conditions for tranche releases and implementation of the key reforms,
Government issued all the necessary guidelines and manuals necessary for the smooth
and effective implementation of the SEDP at all levels as indicated in Annex 7.

Regular Dialogue with the Bank and other Development Partners: There was regular
dialogue and support from the World Bank through implementation support missions
which highlighted areas that needed to be addressed in order to keep the program on
course. Four such missions were organized between 2005 and 2007. The Country team
which included other partners also provided continued support to Government. There
have been joint discussions of SEDP implementation including Actions for IDA tranche
releases, as well as other sub-sectors through the BEDC. In addition to this, Government
ensured that other partners supported its reform framework and participated in joint
annual reviews of the program through the Joint Annual Education Reviews (JAER) and
other levels of consultations.

Improved Education Management Information System (EMIS): As part of the
implementation of the SEDP the EMIS was strengthened and was able to provide
information necessary for improving implementation of the program. Further




                                           17

strengthening of the EMIS is in progress using consultancy services of an international
consultant supported by UNESCO.

Participation of Communities at the school level: Decentralization and devolution of
authority of education decision from the center was done in accordance with the ongoing
public and Local Government reforms. Within this context major administrative and
management functions have been devolved to lower levels of the system. This includes
student admission and placement, and teacher recruitment and deployment. The process
also strengthened the role of communities in the management and administration of the
schools and resource mobilization at the local level.

Resource Limitations: Total resources allocation for secondary education and the overall
education sector has been increasing in the recent years. However, the allocation has not
been adequate to match the increased enrolments of students which have exceeded the
high growth scenario. Two Bank missions drew attention to Government on the need to
control enrolment growth in line with available resources. Furthermore, the Situation
Analysis and the Public Expenditure Review carried out for the 2006 Joint Annual
Education Review (JAER), emphasized the need for increased resources for the sector
including secondary education. Another analysis for the 2007 JAER was carried out by
Government hired consultants on Resources Allocation and Challenges of Education in
Tanzania (2007). The analysis has indicated financial gaps at the different levels of the
education system emphasizing the need for further increased resources to the overall
sector which has been expanding at all levels including primary, secondary and higher
education.

Capacity: Strengthening of capacities at different levels of implementation is ongoing
albeit at different paces, and more still needs to be done.


    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

At the start of the SEDP, the MoEVT faced a range of challenges in developing and
utilizing a robust EMIS, with varying data quality and weak verification processes.
Analytical work was also underdeveloped, and the potentials of the EMIS to facilitate
informed planning and policy-making within MoEVT was not sufficiently realized. The
SEDP- M&E framework was designed to complement broader management reforms
within MoEVT. The SEDP- M&E framework itself focused on both short-term reform
imperatives and longer term program outcomes, while adopting a pragmatic position on
the type and quality of data available from the EMIS. The EMIS was strengthened
through needs assessment, system design, and capacity building. The net result has been
that the EMIS is now able to produce timely statistical information and analysis of the
data continues to improve. The extent to which the data is comprehensively being used
for policy and decision making is however, still to be strengthened and an expert from
UNESCO in collaboration with Development Partners is helping the Government in this
aspect.




                                            18

An important element of the M&E framework has been through the JAER combining
both internal and external expertise. Two such reviews were held with the Government
jointly with other Development Partners including CSOs active in the sector. The first
one was conducted in February 2006, but was general to the education as a whole and did
not provide an in-depth focus on the SEDP because it had been under implementation for
only one year by then. The second JAER was held in October 2007, and a third one is
scheduled for October 2008. Joint Aide-memoires of the two JAERs included actions for
all subsectors including secondary education. In addition to the reviews, the Government
also produced an Annual Performance Report for the period July 2005 and June 2006, as
well as July 2006 to June 2007. Importantly, joint dialogue led by the MoEVT involving
Development Partners and CSOs has been carried out on a continuous basis through the
BEDC to monitor implementation of the SEDP as well as the PEDP. Furthermore, the
MoEVT produces BEST annually which helps to monitor implementation progress.

In addition to these monitoring initiatives by the Government, the Bank team provided
implementation support to the program, monitored implementation progress and
achievement of the Development Objectives using the agreed development indicators in
the results framework and the Development Financing Agreement. The results of this
monitoring were recorded through the periodic Implementation Status Reports of the
Program.


    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

Phase one of the Government's SEDP has been designed to be implemented from mid
2004 to 2009. Resources from the Bank supporting the program for the first phase were
provided through the Structural Adjustment Loant and Grant Lending which closed in
December 2007, well before the implementation of the first phase of SEDP was
completed.    Support by other partners including the African Development Bank is
provided mostly through Budget support modalities.         However, analysis (Resource
Allocation and Challenges of Education Reforms in Tanzania ­ 2007) carried out recently
by a    Government consultant indicate that more external support continues to be
necessary, given the size of the program and the likelihood to expand even further given
the increasing high demand for secondary education. The Borrower has expressed interest
for further IDA support to help to stabilize the SEDP implementation and achievements
being made.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

In assessing the outcomes of the SEDP it is important to note that its first phase is for the
periods 2004 ­ 2009, while the Bank Credit and Grant was for the first three years only.
Therefore, some of the outcomes have not been realized yet particularly those related to
improvement of learning outcomes which are longer term objectives as recognized during
preparation of the program.




                                          19

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives have remained relevant and consistent with the countries own poverty
reduction program - the NSGRP, the Bank's CAS and the Joint Assistance Strategy for
the URT (FY2007-2010). Secondary education remains vital for sustainable economic
development of the country, and continues to have great social and personal benefits
crucial for the modernization and development of society as a whole and for poverty
reduction.

As part of the conditions for tranche releases and in order to enforce implementation of
the SEDP policy reforms, Government issued all the necessary guidelines and manuals
necessary for the smooth and effective implementation of the SEDP at all levels. A list of
these is provided in Annex 4.

The MoEVT through the different levels of the BEDC has been very instrumental in
issuing policy guidelines, coordinating implementation and monitoring, and providing
leadership in coordinating Development Partners and CSOs active in education and other
stakeholders.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Policy Reforms to Improve Access and Equity: Significant progress has been made in
implementing the reforms to improve access and equity which is linked to the first
objective. All reforms associated with increasing enrolments were implemented. The net
result was a rapid increase in enrolments. To this extent the objective of improving access
was reached. The increases in both GER and NER described above are evidence of this.
In spite of the GER increase to 22.1 percent in 2007, the GER is still low compared to
other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa which has a GER average of 30 percent.

The transition rate from primary to secondary education increased from 30 percent in
2003 to 49 percent in 2005, and 67 percent in 2006. The transition data available in BEST
is not gender disaggregated. However, other sources of information in the MoEVT
indicate gender parity transition is almost being achieved in the transition from primary
to secondary education. Nevertheless, girls tend to be dropping out more than boys.
Furthermore, given the PEDP achievements, a backlog of aspiring Form 1 students is
already being created in spite of the increased expansion of secondary education.

Students who passed in Form 2 examinations increased from 66.6 percent (56.8 percent
girls and 75.7 percent for boys) in 2004, to 76.3 percent (68.9 percent for girls and 83.3
percent for boys) in 2006. These pass rates show that some students may not be able to
complete full secondary school cycle. Passing Form 2 examinations is a requirement for
students to join Form III. This policy is currently under review by the MoEVT to ensure
improved completion rates in secondary education.




                                           20

According to the LDP, the target was to support 48,000 students through scholarships
from the lowest income households during implementation of the first phase (2004-2009)
of the SEDP. The target has been achieved with a total of 51,220 students benefitting
from the scholarship program by 2007/08. However, given the increasing demand for
scholarship provision, more resources will still be needed to improve the access objective
for students from very poor households.

Government has also streamlined the registration of private schools whose assessments
are now carried by Zonal Inspectors. Based on the assessment, registration is endorsed by
the Chief Education Officer at the MOEVT. Furthermore, the ongoing overall
privatization reform has created a better environment for increased private sector
participation in education including establishment and registration of schools, and other
private institutions. The registration process is no longer bureaucratic so long as the
standards for registration are met. The streamlined procedures resulted into increased
number of non-Government schools from 463 in 2004 to 690 in 2007.

The Government has initiated innovative schemes to produce qualified teachers more
quickly, and support their practice more effectively through improvement in conditions of
service and opportunities for professional development. This increased the number of
both diploma and degree teachers in the system. However, the PTR target of 30:1 was
exceeded as enrolments continued to grow reaching 34:1 in 2007. The curriculum review
which has been implemented has helped to reduce the teaching loads for teachers.
Nevertheless, the impact will be more felt once the targeted PTR level of 30:1 is achieved
particularly in remote areas which have teacher shortage due to (i) lack of housing; and
(ii) few teachers in such subjects as science, mathematics, Kiswahili and English
Languages. The result so far has been that teacher production still falls behind enrolments
resulting in a higher PTR than targeted. The challenge of provision and retention of
teachers needs to be addressed through more training, better management and
deployment but it is a process which will take more years to stabilize.

Reforms to Improve Educational Achievement: It is difficult to assess comprehensively
the achievement of this particular Objective. It was realized during preparation of the
project that minimal impact of this reform would be expected during a short period of the
SEDP implementation. This is because, reforms related to education achievements, take
long time to be attained. In addition, the use of examination results as an indicator to
measure educational achievement is not sufficient to measure learning outcomes. More
appropriate indicators to measure education achievements and not just examination
results will be needed to determine the impact of these reforms. This would include the
school based assessment being developed by NECTA, and carrying out other specific
assessment studies.




                                          21

As noted earlier the impact of examination results has not been significant enough. An
improvement has however, been noted in pass rates at the Form 2 level, but there has
been little impact at CSEE level given the short period of the SEDP implementation.

Reforms related to improving education achievement have been implemented. Reforms
of curricula, including concentration on fewer updated subject content with more focus
on defined learning outcomes, and to make the curriculum more relevant to students' life,
work and future training requirements, have also been implemented. A comprehensive
examinations reform, coupled with improved school-based monitoring and assessment is
still ongoing. The impact of these reforms on student performance will be tested at the
end of the 2008 school year, this being the first year the students taking the new
curriculum will sit for their examinations. Examination framework based on the revised
curriculum has been established. Reforms on textbook provision have successfully been
implemented with textbooks now being locally available on the market. Reforms related
to pre-service teacher training and provision of opportunities for continuous professional
development of school administrators and teachers are being implemented towards
quality enhancement of learning. Much has therefore been achieved in terms of process
which should in the long term, have an impact on educational achievement.

Reforms in Service Management and Delivery:                Decentralization of education
management to the lower levels has been implemented in accordance with the ongoing
Public and Local Government Reforms. Within this context, major administrative and
management functions are being devolved to strengthen lower levels of the system.
Strengthening the role of communities in management of schools through School Boards
has contributed to the expansion and improvement of management of secondary
education. However, this process is still ongoing as some new schools have still not
established their Boards. The decentralization of teacher recruitment and deployment has
not been very effective primarily because of the shortage of teachers, and insufficient
incentives particularly for remote areas.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
Based on the above observations, the overall outcome rating is satisfactory because while
there have been challenges in the implementation of the SEDP, a lot of progress has also
been achieved, particularly in the areas of expansion of access to both lower and upper
secondary education. Furthermore, various reforms have been introduced and continue to
be implemented to strengthen access, quality, and management of secondary education.
Education quality improvement measures have been initiated and adopted through
provision of capitation grants directly to schools. This has enabled schools to purchase
textbooks and learning materials. Before the SEDP launch, supply of these materials was
centralized. More teachers have been trained and hired, to ensure increased number and




                                          22

improved quality of teachers. The initiative of Government in formulating the TDMS in
order to address teacher issues should be commended.           Reforms to improve the
curriculum and examinations and overall assessment of learning have been initiated and
continue to be implemented. Management of the secondary system through
decentralization to the lower levels of the system continues to be implemented. Overall
the Government has continued to increase budgetary allocations to secondary education
in each year since 2004.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

It is too early at this stage to measure what impact the implementation of the SEDP is
having on poverty alleviation and social development. There have however, been notable
changes in both the GER and NER for girls which have increased. There has also been an
improvement on the girl/boy ratios since the implementation of the SEDP. Importantly,
measures to improve access to secondary education in the underserved areas have been
initiated. Equity measures are being implemented to ensure children from poor
households have access to secondary education. The assumption here is that having a
population educated at this level will in the medium and long term have an impact on
poverty with increased social development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Government has invested in a number of interventions to develop the capacity that is
needed for the smooth and efficient implementation of the SEDP. These include
decentralization of education administration and management which should lead to
further institutional improvement, strengthening of pre-service and in-service training of
teachers, capacity building of school heads and their deputies, management teams
including school boards, school inspectors and DSEC.         Some equipment including
vehicles have been supplied at different levels. Partnership has also been established
between MoEVT and the OUT for pre-service and in-service training of teachers
particularly the licensed teachers through distance education. PPP has been enhanced in
provision of textbooks and learning materials through private publishers. The capacity of
communities in financial management and procurement at schools is being improved.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
None were noted as a result of the implementation of the SEDP

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops


A formal beneficiary survey was not conducted. But discussions with some beneficiaries
during field visits suggested that both communities and students appreciated the
expansion of secondary education in spite of the challenges faced by the program.




                                          23

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The risks which were identified during preparation of the program have remained as risks
to the Development Outcome.
The risk to development outcome is moderate for the following reasons:

Institutional:   Government ownership and commitment to the SEDP has been
maintained. The ownership and commitment of other stakeholders, and particularly the
communities and supporting education institutions (such as TIE, ADEM, NECTA, and
Universities, Private Publishers) have also remained strong. The policies adopted at
preparation have remained in place and mechanisms for smooth implementation are
being reviewed through the BEDC and the JAER. However, it is important that capacity
building continue to be enhanced at all levels to ensure sustainability in implementing the
reforms.

Plans currently under discussion for decentralization of secondary education to the PMO-
RALG are on one hand, likely to put a risk to the outcomes so far attained in the short to
medium term because of capacity constraints. This is because of the amount of services
of various sectors that are being decentralized to local Government in an environment
where capacity constraints at local levels may pose some challenges. On the other hand,
this should provide an opportunity for Government to strengthen local capacities in the
long term, for increased decentralization.

Financial: The sustainable financing of the SEDP needs to be considered in the context
of the financing of the education sector as a whole, given the linkages and inter-
dependence between the sub-sectors. The ability of Government to adequately finance
education reforms will depend on its ability to mobilize public resources taking into
account of other competing priorities as well as the growth of the economy.

Table 1 show that the percentage of the national budget for education increased from 10.1
percent in 2003/04 but has not changed significantly between 2004/05 and 2006/07 at an
average of 18.3 percent. The allocation for 2008/09 is also 18 percent. Primary education
received the biggest share of these resources followed by higher education with
secondary education as third. A positive trend has been the increase in the development
budgets for secondary education whose percentage of the education budget increased
from 3.5 percent in 2003/04 to 39.7 percent in 2007/08 compared to primary education
which changed from 79.6 percent to 13.1 percent over the same period.

Source: Resource Allocation and Challenges of Education Reform 2007(Government Report Prepared for
the 2007 Joint Education Review).

Funding to teacher education has been rather erratic in spite of the importance of teacher
development. The situation needs to be improved to ensure that the SEDP outcomes are
not at risk. A further risk associated with teachers will be the ability of the Government to
meet the increased emoluments budget as more trained teachers join the system.

Budgetary allocations for secondary education have been increasing throughout since the
beginning of the SEDP implementation. However, given the high increasing rates of
student enrollments the rate of funding has not been sufficient enough to cater for the
expansion. The request of a partial waiver of Condition 1 for the release of the third
Tranche is evidence of this. The Resource Allocation and Challenges of Education
Reform (2007) analysis indicates that the funding gap for implementing the whole
education program is expected to increase from Tsh. 1,593 billion in 2007/08, to Tsh.
2,403 billion by 2014/15. The financing gaps for basic education (primary, secondary) is
estimated to rise from Tsh. 298 billion in 2007/08 to Tsh. 655 billion in 2014/15. The
gaps are going to be difficult to close given the estimated economic growth of 7.5 percent
over the next 5 years. It is not likely that a significant increase in allocations to education
will take place unless there is a radical shift in financing priorities. In this regard, the
Government needs to ensure that the SEDP expansion is within the available human and
financial resources if quality is to improve.




                                               25

Communities have shown commitment and have been contributing resources for SEDP
implementation. The amounts contributed both in cash and in kind, have varied
depending on the economic background of the communities, but have not been quantified
nationally. This makes it difficult to estimate this contribution for planning purposes.

Development partners also provide support to education mostly through General Budget
Support. NGOs that work directly with some communities have also been providing
some support at those levels. The contribution of these NGOs is not yet captured and
quantified making it difficult to determine its impact on the financing gap.

Although allocations to secondary education have been increasing annually as shown in
the MTEF for 2007/08 to 2009/10; adequate financing remains a challenge to the
implementation of the SEDP given the continuing demand to increase access, and the
need to enhance quality.

Political: Tanzania remains politically stable and issues of governance are being
adequately addressed. The achievement made so far are therefore, likely to be sustained
in such an environment.

Social: Poverty, affects most of the households in rural areas where the majority of the
people live. Therefore Government subventions for education inputs will continue to be
necessary. Poverty also contributes to drop out from school. Therefore, unless poverty is
alleviated the gains realized in enrolments will be eroded through drop out of students.
Drop out has been more in some of the poor and nomadic communities. Nevertheless, the
increase in enrolment since 2003 has been accompanied with a decrease in drop-out rate
from 3.7 percent to 2.1 percent in 2006. The major cause of drop-out has been identified
as truancy which makes up on average 63.2 percent of the drop outs. Truancy is mostly a
poverty related issue.

Lack of employment opportunities, which are concentrated in urban areas, can also lead
to decreased interest in education in rural and the underserved areas. Opportunities for
further and higher education for the secondary graduates are also limited as evidenced by
the low transition rates to further education and training (2.5 percent). This can create a
disincentive for continued investment in secondary education at the household level and
may result in reduced participation and contribution to education in general by
communities.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank intervention in financing the SEDP was in response to agreed priorities among
all stakeholders, and consistent with Tanzania's development goals as stipulated in the


                                           26

NSGRP, ESDP, and the CAS. Preparation and design of the program was done in close
collaboration with Government which took the lead and had full ownership of the process
and outcomes. The process also involved Development Partners and CSOs and different
actors at different levels of the education system.

The stated Objectives, and the Key Indicators, were not well aligned in the Bank
document.      One stated objective is completion of secondary education.         However,
completion rates neither for Form 4 nor Form 6 are among the Indicators. Instead, GER
has been adopted as the indicator. Although the GER has a relationship with Completion,
it is not a sufficient indicator.

Obviously, the short duration of three years of implementation constrains the magnitude
of outcomes that can reasonably be expected. Even though SEDP is financed through
budget support, lack of sufficient alignment of the Objectives/Indicators could have been
avoided by: (i) stating the objectives in a more modest and short term statement; and (ii)
aligning the indicators to the objective and monitor the completion rate, as well as
assessing the learning achievement of students in the Languages and mathematics.

The choice of the lending instrument was appropriate for this type of operation as it gave
the Borrower the flexibility to allocate resources in response to the needs during
implementation of the program. The instrument also enabled disbursements to be made
after the specific tranche conditions were met by the Borrower. The Tranche release
conditions were critical in ensuring that the Borrower put in place all the necessary
policies and guidelines necessary for the smooth implementation of the program. The
PDO was designed to address issues of enrolment, equity, quality and relevance, and
management of the education system, with a view to ensuring that secondary education
addresses the long term human resource base necessary for the economic development of
Tanzania.

The Bank released the Tranches at the appropriate time when the conditions for the
release were met. It also provided technical inputs to help the Government meet the
Tranche conditions. The Bank also agreed to the extension of the Credit for six months in
order to ensure that the PDO of the program was achieved.

(b) Quality of Supervision
     Rating: Satisfactory
Because of the nature of the program and given the ongoing harmonization of Joint Aid
modalities in Tanzania, supervision was done jointly at joint annual reviews. In all two
such joint reviews were done at different years during the life of the Credit and Grant and
included Aide-memoires approved jointly by Higher Levels of Government (Prime-
Minister), Development Partners (Heads of Agencies) and representatives from the
CSOs. Continuous monitoring was also accomplished through joint dialogue conducted
through the ESDP- BEDC consultations held regularly with Government, Development
Partners including the Bank and CSOs active in education. This included monitoring of
implementation progress of PEDP and SEDP and other levels of education based on
different Government information and reports, as well as reports from non-state actors.



                                            27

In addition, the Bank team regularly provided implementation support to the Borrower to
ensure that the Borrower was on track with Agreed Actions particularly those related to
the release of Tranches. Four IDA implementation support missions were undertaken and
Aide Memoires agreed upon. The ISR was updated five times in accordance with Bank
internal requirements.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
 Rating:
Based on the factors noted above the overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The Borrower demonstrated a strong commitment to improving the human resource base
necessary for economic development through the expanded and equitable provision of
quality secondary education with active participation of all the key stakeholders and
particularly the communities. Government also developed and adopted policies and
instruments that were necessary for smooth implementation. It increased resources to the
SEDP in line with the conditions for Tranche releases. A significant achievement has
been the Government's efforts to empower the communities in the implementation of the
program as part of its power devolution process. The Government also demonstrated
leadership in coordinating Development Partners and other key actors during preparation
and implementation of the SEDP.

However, the Government faced some challenges in implementation of the program.
Government took long time in preparing its reports for conditions for the release of the
second and third tranche which inevitably delayed disbursement of funding particularly
the second and third tranches. Disbursement of the third tranche was completed by
August 2007 which was two months beyond the original closing date of June 30, 2007.
Limited resources in the national budget also made it difficult for Government to provide
the necessary resources to meet the funding target for capitation grants of Tsh. 25,000 as
stipulated in the LDP. Capacity constraints at lower levels also affected implementation
of the program. However, the appointment of the DSECs was timely and important to
strengthen implementation of the SEDP.

While efforts were taken to address risks to the implementation of the program, the
mitigation measures are still to be further strengthened to match the increased
enrollments. The provision of teachers has for instance, lagged behind the requirements
as compared to the enrollment increases. In relation to this, the Government has been
innovative by initiating the TDMS which was not part of the SEDP design. However,
finalization of the strategy for implementation was only completed in April 2008.




                                          28

There have been delays in establishing School Boards in some new schools which are
critical in the decentralization of education to the school levels. Furthermore, grants to
the qualifying 104 non-Government schools were only disbursed for the first time in the
2007 school year, while for the Government schools disbursements started to be provided
in the beginning of the SEDP implementation in 2005 school year.

More attention should have been given to the quality of the infrastructure that is being put
up in the schools. As noted earlier in this report, the quality of some of the infrastructure
is poor and could in future result in high costs in rehabilitation and maintenance. Most of
the infrastructure has not been completed, and there is no plan of when it will be
completed although the infrastructure is already in use even before construction is fully
completed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Implementation of the SEDP has been undertaken by a number of institutions and
departments. These are the MoEVT and all its departments, MoFEA and its Sub-
Treasuries, PMO-RALG, Regions, Districts, Wards and the School Boards and
communities at the school level. Other agencies that have played a critical role are the
TIE, NECTA, ADEM, Universities and other public and private institutions including the
media.

All these entities within the constraints of resources and capacity have each played their
part in the implementation of the SEDP. The MoEVT provided the leadership that was
required in the implementation of the program through development of policies,
establishment and enforcement of rules and regulation necessary for the reforms and
implementation. It has also coordinated the activities and inputs of its key departments
such as Policy and Planning, Secondary Education, the Inspectorate, Teacher Education.
It also coordinated the stakeholders, particularly Development Partners and CSOs
throughout the design and implementation process. The MoFEA continue to increase
budget allocation needed for the implementation of the program through the MoEVT, and
directly to schools through the MoEFA Sub-Treasures in the regions. The PMO-RALG
which is responsible for implementing the overall decentralization policy, contributed to
the decentralization of the secondary education at the regional and district and
community levels of the system.

The TIE has been responsible for the review of the curriculum and in organizing training
of teachers in the use of this new curriculum. The work is still ongoing. NECTA has been
responsible for reviewing the whole examination and assessment system for primary and
secondary education and progress has been recorded in this area.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Because of the foregoing the performance of the overall performance of the Borrower is
rated Satisfactory. While there are still some challenges to be faced, a lot is being
achieved in the process of implementing the Phase I SEDP ­ 2004-2009, due to
commitment and leadership provided by the Borrower. Furthermore, there is high
commitment by the Borrower to continue financing the SEDP beyond the phase one. The
program is fully mainstreamed in Government budgeting processes and MTEF.

There is however, a need for the Borrower to review the expansion of secondary
enrolments to ensure that it is in line with the available human and financial resources in
order to avoid likely deterioration of quality.

6. Lessons Learned

The achievements made on enrolments have clearly been encouraging and the
commitment of Government and all critical stakeholders has made this possible. In spite
of these achievements, there are still some challenges that provide lessons based on the
experiences of the SEDP:

(i) Ownership of Programs and Involvement of Stakeholders:                      Government
ownership and strong political support is essential for program implementation.
Involvement of all stakeholders from conception, development and implementation of
reforms is also critical to enhance ownership of the reforms at all levels. Communities
have a vested interest in education of their children and when given an opportunity, are
willing and able to play their part in implementation of education reforms. However,
demand from the communities may pressurize the Government to expand even beyond
available resources.

The private sector is an important collaborator in the development of secondary education
and Government should facilitate its work. The successes realized in the supply of
textbooks by the private publishers, and expansion of schools initiated by NGOs can to
some extent, be attributed to this.

(ii) Educational Planning and Financing: Education needs to be planned more
comprehensively as a system recognizing the inter-dependence and linkages among its
sub-sectors (primary, secondary and higher education) and that its development should be
holistic. Government initiative in formulating the ETP as well as the ESDP framework in
the previous years helped to link the PEDP, SEDP and other levels of education. The
Government is in the process of reviewing the ETP and the ESDP which should help to
strengthen further, resource allocations across the different levels of the sector. This will
also help to avoid any likely pressure as happened in this case where successes of the
PEDP is putting pressure on the SEDP and the SEDP puts pressure on teacher education
and soon on higher education.




                                           30

Education reforms should be based on sustainable financing or be programmed in line
with the available resources in order to ensure full achievement of the intended outcomes
and their sustainability. The Government faces a challenge of mobilizing resources for
the SEDP to ensure sustainability and that the intended quality of secondary education is
not compromised. Government therefore, needs to examine further the expansion trend
across the education sub-sectors and come up with realistic projections of the resources
required to successfully implement the SEDP, PEDP and other levels of education over a
longer period as initiated already through the recent Government analysis "Resources
Allocation and Challenges of Education Reforms in Tanzania (2007)". This will require
the public to be well informed to understand well the expansion trend of education and
implications.

(iii) Increased Enrolment and Quality: Experience from education reforms in many
African countries involving increased access to education shows that quality has suffered
in the process and that it takes a long time to get the balance correct. Government
therefore, needs to have a long term commitment to current education reforms and a clear
strategy for improving both access and quality and improved learning outcomes across all
the education sub-sectors.

The use of both formal and non-formal approaches is important in an expanding system
of education to reach more people much more conveniently. Through the SEDP, distance
education is being used to reach secondary education students who could not attend
formal system of education in schools. The distance education approach is also being
used to train teachers at school level (through the OUT) instead of sending them to full
time studies at colleges and universities.

(iv) Implementation Capacity: There is need to pay more attention to developing
capacity and ensuring that all the necessary structures are in place if successful
implementation of education reforms are to be efficient and cost effective. There was
inadequate capacity building during the SEDP launching of implementers at various
levels such as for: administrators, school heads, school boards, who in some cases are
still not established in some schools, and teachers. Capacity building at all levels, is
therefore, indispensable to implementation of reforms and should be ongoing and
financed adequately.

(v) Decentralization of Reforms: Decentralization, is a good model for development,
because of its ability to institutionalize participation of more stakeholders, and increased
accountability. However, its success hinges on adequate communication and
development of the requisite capacity of all actors at all levels. This seems to have
worked well for the implementation of SEDP, especially given that the decentralization
was taking place within the overall decentralization policy of the Government.

(vi) Monitoring and Evaluation: Robust monitoring and evaluation including periodic
analytical work is essential to keep a program on track, and ensure that implementation is
in line with available human and financial resources. The expansion of enrolments far




                                            31

exceeded the targets set due to increasing demand for secondary education from the
public. This resulted in inadequate provision of resources for SEDP implementation.

It is also important to ensure that the PDO indicators are appropriate to the PDO itself.
The program objectives include completion, and learning achievement, but neither
completion indicators nor learning, outcomes are among the indicators specified except
levels of performance in relation to the national examination results. But examination
results are also not appropriate to measure learning outcomes. This makes it difficult to
determine within a short implementation period whether the Government's stated
objectives are being achieved.

(vii) Lending Instrument: The Structural Adjustment Lending instrument (similar to
the current Program Development Lending) was effective for disbursing large amount of
money within a short period and helps to promote ownership of reforms by Government.
The IDA Credit and Grant amounting to US$ 150 million were disbursed and used in a
period of three years something that would most likely not have been possible with
project type investment lending.     The conditions for Tranche releases also assisted
Government to be adequately prepared for effective implementation of the respective
policy reforms. The lending instrument also helped Government to be flexible as the
Credit and Grant were mainstreamed in the Government budgeting system for both
recurrent and development expenditures.

      SECONDARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (SEDP)
                IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)

1.0     INTRODUCTION
This is an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) about Secondary Education
Development Progamme (SEDP) prepared by the Government of Tanzania in line with
the agreed Development Financing Agreement (DFA) between the Government and the
World Bank. The report comprises of an assessment of programme objectives,
components, implementation experience which include quality at entry, financing,
borrowers and financiers performance, factors affecting implementation and outcomes as
well as lessons learnt. The report also draws key lessons learnt for future World Bank and
Government operations.

2.0     PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES
The SEDP is the second outcome of the Education Sector Development Programme
(ESDP-1999) after PEDP (2002-2006). The programme outlined the framework for
achieving greater access to secondary education while simultaneously tackling equity,
quality, cross cutting and management issues at secondary level. More specifically, the
objectives of SEDP are geared to improve access, equity, quality, management reforms
and education management system.

3.0     PROGRAMME COMPONENTS
The SEDP is comprised of five strategic components as follows:

Improvement of Access: The goal was to reach 50% of cohort participation and
transition rate from primary to secondary education by 2010 through optimum utilization
of teachers, Teacher Training College tutors, and physical facilities; expansion of school
facilities especially in underserved areas; support to the non-government sector;
expansion of `A' level; expansion of Open and Distance Learning (ODL); reduction of
dropout, repetition, and failure rates at all levels; and improving, affordability by
reducing of household education costs.

Improvement of Equity: The goal was to ensure equity of participation in underserved
areas by geographical locations, gender and income inequalities through allocating more
resources in education to underserved areas; providing scholarships to pupils from poor
families; improvement of retention and performance of girls; improvement of facilities in
schools having children with disabilities; improvement of education provision for the
marginalized social groups; and reduction of school fees for day school students.

Improvement of Quality: The overall aim was to raise the pass rate of Div. I-III from
36% (2004) to 70% (2009) through in-service courses for up-grading and continuous
professional development of teachers; improving entry qualifications of candidates for
diploma and degree teacher training; curriculum review; improvement of school



                                             36

libraries; provision of capitation grant for teaching and learning materials and other
charges; improvement of examination structure, type and quality; expansion of
production of Diploma and Degree teachers. Also the programme aimed at enhancing
awareness on HIV and AIDS, gender and environment through sensitization and
education.

Management Reforms: The overall goal was to increase efficiency and responsiveness
in the operation of secondary education. This was to be achieved through devolution of
authority and responsibilities to lower levels of management. The principal goal was to
make sure that the Ministry becomes more efficient in executing its core functions of
policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation, providing regulatory framework,
coordination and optimization of resource use.

Improvement of Education Management System: This was to be achieved through
strengthening the inspectorate and support mechanisms; improving access to and use of
EMIS; management capacity building at all levels; communication and publicity of the
plan; and strengthening monitoring and evaluation.

4.0     FINANCING
Implementation of the programme started in 2004/05 using Government, the World Bank
Credit and Grant, contribution through General Budget Support by other Development
Partners, Local Government, Community contributions, other stakeholders including
Non-Government Organizations and individual donors. Funds of the Credit of US$ 123.3
million and a Grant of USD$ 26.4 million from the World Bank to support SEDP were
fully disbursed through three tranches between 2004 and 2007.

5.0     QUALITY AT ENTRY
The expansion of secondary education in Tanzania was inevitable as it is a strategy for
sustainable economic and social development of the country and realization of the
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) targets and the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is also in line with Education and
Training Policy (ETP) 1995, Education and Training Sector Development Programme
(ESDP) 2001, and Tanzania Development Vision 2025.

In 2004, the Government decided to put concerted efforts to expand secondary education
in order to meet the public high demand for this level of education and address the
resulting expanded enrolment and increased pass rate in Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) resulting from the achievements of implementation of the phase
one PEDP (2002-2006). Consequently, SEDP was launched in mid 2004.

SEDP implementation borrowed heavily from experiences on PEDP implementation.
Guidelines on key areas of the programme were prepared and disseminated to key
implementers. Funds for development and capitation grants were sent out to schools by
January, 2005 (beginning of school year) to support communities in constructing new
schools and additional classrooms, teacher houses and other school facilities.

6.0     IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS

The current implementation of the SEDP for phase one covers the period 2004-2009.
Progress of implementation of the SEDP during this phase has led into the achievements
described below:

Improvement of Access: Since its inception, achievements of SEDP included increased
enrolment in secondary education. Enrolment at the O level (Form 1- 4) increased from
401,598 (girls189, 198) in 2004 to 967,087 (girls 455,671) in 2007 which is an increase
of 565,489 students equivalent to 141%. Enrolment in A level (Form 5- 6) increased from
31,001(girls 10,765) in 2004 to 53,423 (girls 21,643) in 2007 which is an increase of 72%
whereas girls increased by 101%. The total enrollment in Form 1-6s increased from
432,599 (girls 199,963) in 2004 to 1,020,510 (girls 477,314) in 2007 which is an increase
of 587,911 students (by 136%) whereas girls increased by 139%.

Enrolment at ODL was targeted to be 10,000. In total 12,914 (increase by 258%) learners
were enrolled. Enrolment of students with special learning needs increased from 449 in
2004 to 922 in 2007. GER increased from 9.4% in 2004 to 22.1% in 2007, while NER
increased from 5.9% in 2004 to 20.6% in 2007. Transition rate from Primary to
secondary level also increased from 36.1% in 2004 to 67.5% in 2006 while the number of
secondary schools increased from 1,291 (Government 828 and 463 Non-Government) in
2004 to 3485 (Government 2806, and 679 Non-Government) in 2007.

Regarding construction of school buildings, the target for the first four years of the
programme was to construct 6,151 classrooms, 9,437 teachers' houses, 742 toilet holes,
22 hostels, 2,401 laboratories, 910 libraries, 158 dormitories, 680 administration blocks,
666 assembly halls and 48 ablution blocks. A total of 6,595 (107%) classrooms, 3,237
(34%) teachers' houses, 9,229 (1,244%) toilet holes, 69 (314%) hostels, 331 (14%)
laboratories, 49(05%) libraries, 86 (54%) dormitories, 308 (45%) administration blocks, 7
(1%) assembly halls and 23 (48%) ablution blocks were constructed.

Supervision of construction work was conducted accordingly. Communities were
mobilized and contributed cash, building materials and participated physically in
constructing school buildings which led to surpassing some of the targets. The increased
number of school facilities had positive effect on the teaching and learning processes. For
instance, the initiative taken in construction of classrooms increased space for primary
school leavers who passed the PSLE. Generally, all regions managed to enroll in Form I
at least 75 percent of standard 7 leavers who passed the PSLE by 2007.

Due to the increase in enrolment of secondary school students, the Government recruited
additional teachers adding the total number of secondary school teachers from 18747 in
2004 to 23,658 in 2007. In 2006 for instance, the Government employed 4,200 (3,700
were diploma level and 500 were degree level teachers) new secondary school teachers.
The Government Target is to have a Teacher Pupil Ratio (TPR) of 1:30 in secondary
schools by 2009. However, the growth of enrollment keeps on increasing compared to




                                          38

levels of teacher availability. Therefore, while the TPR was 1:23 in 2004, it increased to
the level of 1: 31 in 2006 and 1:38 in 2007.

Despite these achievements, the MoEVT continues to experience a number of challenges
in the course of implementation, notably: the necessary infrastructures to meet the
increasing public demand for secondary education as well as absorbing almost 100% of
pupils passing PSLE into secondary schools; training adequate numbers of qualifies
teachers to match with the increasing secondary education enrollments both for O and A
levels.

In order to address the challenges, the Government decided to update the strategies and
targets of SEDP to meet the emerging public secondary education demand and fulfill its
commitment to the people.

Generally, overall performance in Improvement of Access component was highly
satisfactory. The Transition Rate from Primary to Secondary in 2006/07 was 67% which
is well above the set target of 50% by 2009 as indicated in the SEDP.

Improvement of Equity: With regard to the provision of scholarship grant and fee-
subsidy, the target was to provide scholarship to 48,000 students from poor families. A
total of 41,211 (98%) students were supported with the scholarship between 2005 to
present time. Identification of the recipients for scholarship grant was conducted by
Councils in collaboration with communities in accordance with scholarship guidelines
issued to schools, communities and councils in 2004. The Government also reduced
school fees by 50% from Tsh. 40,000 to Tsh. 20,000 for day schools starting from the
2005 school year. A total of 417,712 students in day schools have benefited from the fees
reduction and the Government disbursed fee-subsidy to the day schools to compensate
the reduced fees amounts. A total of 63,508 students studying in boarding Government
secondary schools were supplied with meals. Implementation of policies for scholarship,
reduced school fees for day schools and provision of subsidy grants to schools have
contributed to retention of students at schools and improvement of operational activities
at school level. Efforts have also been made to improve retention and performance of
secondary school girls in science subjects. A total of 1912 secondary school girls
attended "Girls' Science Camp", which aimed at building their confidence and interest to
learn science and mathematics.

In order to enhance inclusive education through Special Needs Education, equipment,
teaching and learning materials for pupils with disabilities were provided to schools and
Teacher Training colleges. One secondary school teacher, and one tutor for teacher
training, pursued degree level training on special needs education in Uganda. Secondary
schools with disabled students were rehabilitated and facilities improved to create
friendly environment for students with special learning needs. The schools included
Pugu, Jangwani, Njombe, Moshi, Moshi Technical, Mpwapwa, Lugalo, Iringa, Kazima
and Korogwe.       Overall, general performance in equity improvement in secondary
education has been satisfactory.




                                           39

Improvement of Quality
Capitation Grants: The plan was to provide Capitation Grants (CG) for purchasing
teaching and learning materials for Government and qualified Non-Government
secondary schools at the rate of Tsh. 25,000 and Tsh. 10,000 respectively.        However,
given the increased enrollments resources were inadequate causing the CG disbursed to
be less than the targeted amount. Never the less, the grants disbursed to schools have
helped to improve the availability of teaching and learning materials in secondary
schools. The target is to reach a book ratio of 1:1. This target has not yet been reached
and will require sustained provision of CG.

Inspection Services: Each school is expected to be inspected once in every two years.
About 38% of Government and non-government schools were inspected in FY 2005/06
and 26.4% in FY 2006/07. The schools were also given professional support. Inspectors
of schools also carried out special inspection in 1,084 schools in 2006/07, to ascertain
fulfillment of registration requirements of new schools. In addition, 8 School Inspectors
from Headquarter conducted monitoring at 8 Zonal offices.

A total of 1,437 School Inspectors attended training on syllabus analysis, school
management and orientation on inspectorate activities so as to avail themselves with
capacity needed on school management, improved curriculum management and
participatory teaching approach. A total of 8 vehicles were procured and distributed to
zonal offices to strengthen inspection services to different schools and colleges.

Curriculum Review: Revision of Secondary Education Curriculum was conducted
whereby secondary education curriculum was reviewed to be more competence based. In
addition, cross-cutting issues (gender, HIV/AIDS, environment) were integrated in the
curriculum and guidelines on the integration were developed and distributed to secondary
schools. Teacher Education curriculum for diploma in education level was reviewed so as
to match with the reviewed secondary education curriculum. All syllabuses for different
subjects at different education levels were reviewed.

Teacher Development: Secondary education teachers are supposed to have a diploma or
degree level teaching qualifications. In order to ensure more teachers are available for the
expanding enrollments, enrolment for Pre-service teacher education diploma programme
has been expanded from 2189 in 2004 to 7,821 in 2006 new trained teachers. This is an
increase of 5,632 (257%). In addition, one secondary school and one diploma teachers'
college have been converted into constituent colleges of University of Dar es Salaam in
order to increase the production of graduate teachers to match with expanded enrolment
in secondary education. Since low performance of students in mathematics and sciences
has been one of the identified issues in the SEDP, there is great emphasis in the training
of mathematics and science teachers.

In addition to pre-service training, in-service training has also been going on through
school based short seminars for various professional development aspects and



                                           40

improvement of pedagogical skills. In-service training has also included upgrading
courses at Teacher Training Colleges, as well as through distance learning offered by the
Open University of Tanzania. Training of teachers has helped to raise motivation of
teachers and has improved teaching competences. ICT in education is also being
introduced and many teachers are becoming computer literate.

The Teacher Development and Management Strategy (TDMS) aimed at improving
teacher development has been finalized for implementation. The intention of the strategy
is to minimize compartmentalization of teacher education by linking the various levels of
education in teacher development and management.

Library facilities: While availability of library facilities in schools is important in
enhancing learning, very few libraries have been established in the new schools. This
remains one of the big challenges in improving the learning environment in schools. .

Despite efforts to improve quality of education, the performance of students in national
examinations is still low. This is due to the fact that, performance is a result of many
factors and the fruits of the inputs cannot be realized in a short time. It is expected that
quality will be improved after a longer period of the SEDP implementation particularly
beyond the Phase one period (2004-2009) combined with increased inputs.

Management Reforms: A total of 450 newly appointed Heads of Schools in 2006/07
were trained at the Agency for the Development of Educational Management (ADEM) on
School Management and Administration. Training was also offered to 1351 out of 1540
targeted members of School Management Teams (SMT) which comprised Heads of
Schools, Senior Academic Masters/Mistresses, Discipline Master/Mistresses, Production
and Maintenance Teachers; and the School Accountants. The training offered skills in
general school management, financial management and accountability, curriculum and
instructional administration, life skills and HIV and AIDS education. A total of 3,800
key SEDP actors were also trained in SEDP reforms in relation to their roles at different
levels. The assessment of the training indicated that it was relevant to their roles.

A total of 7 motor vehicles were purchased and distributed to 5 secondary schools namely
Msalato, Songea Girls, Kibiti, Ifakara, Nangwa and 2 for MOEVT headquarters for
coordinating SEDP activities. Offices at different management levels have been retooled
for effective and efficient implementation of SEDP activities.

In relation to decentralization by devolution, School Board members are appointed at
regional level; there is more involvement of school boards in the management of school
funds; District Secondary Education Coordinators (DSEC) have been appointed and
posted to districts; and transfer of students across day schools is being done at regional
levels. In addition, circular letter empowering REOs to regulate establishment of teachers
in schools in their respective regions was issued to the relevant levels, supervision of
examinations and selection of form one students are carried out at regional level; and
supervision of construction of community secondary schools is carried out by the districts




                                           41

based on construction standards provided centrally by the MoEVT. Management reforms
are therefore progressing satisfactorily.

Improvement of Education Management System: The MoEVT prepared, and
distributed Information Education and Communication (IEC) materials to create
awareness of the public on SEDP implementation strategies. Copies of ESDP and SEDP
Newsletters, brochures, as well as posters were prepared and distributed to education
stakeholders. Other media of communication used to enhance awareness was conducted
through radio and television programs to inform the public about the SEDP.

Access to and use of Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) is being
improved through different ways. Computer laboratories were established at Teacher
Training Colleges in order to make student teachers graduating from these colleges
computer-literate. Furthermore, a new user friendly data base (MYSQL HHP web based
program) was developed, data collection forms for secondary schools were reviewed to
capture information on children with special needs by sex and grade, orphans by grade
and attrition of teachers by causes addressing the impact of HIV and AIDS in the
education sector. In addition, training on computer fundamentals and data base
management was conducted to 291 Regional and District Education Officers from 21
regions, 121 districts and 14 MOEVT Officials. Data analysis, interpretation and report
writing was also conducted to 13 MOEVT Officials.

Joint review of the education sector held in 2006 and 2007 covered all education
subsectors including secondary education. Challenges identified were and are being
implemented accordingly. Generally, the status of implementation of the education
management system component is rated satisfactory.

7.0    BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
The Government has satisfactorily made good progress in the implementation of SEDP as
required and agreed upon. SEDP implementation guidelines were made, circulars issued,
monitoring and supervision of SEDP implementation at schools were done accordingly.
The Government has also been very committed by ensuring that recurrent and
development budgetary allocations for secondary education are increased.

Coordination capacity of the Directorate of Secondary Education for effective SEDP
implementation was enhanced. In addition, appointment of DSECs was done and their
functions and responsibilities were clearly stipulated. Decentralization of powers to lower
levels in line with the Public Sector as well as the Local Government Reform
Programmes was also operationalized. The Government decided to update the strategies
and targets of SEDP to meet the emerging public secondary education demand and fulfill
its commitment to the people.

MOEVT prepared annual action plans and progress reports on the basis of approved
Government budget and overall implementation progress of the SEDP. In addition,
MOEVT in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs




                                          42

implemented agreed actions and prepared progress reports for the various tranche
releases on the basis of the DFA signed between the Government and the World Bank.

A strong political will, an excellent public support, and community participation have
enabled good performance in expanding access and capacity building at various levels.
More inputs for quality enhancement are however essential.

In improving implementation and management of SEDP, the Basic Education
Development Committee (BEDC) and its Task Force met several times to discuss
different issues and progress of the overall sector including SEDP implementation. The
ESDP framework which includes the BEDC, provides a useful structure conducive for
enhanced dialogue involving representatives from the Government, Development
Partners (DPs) and the Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).

The BEDC and Education sector dialogue were operational during the implementation of
the Programme. SEDP guidelines were prepared using contributions from the various
BEDC - Technical Working Groups (TWG) during the beginning of the programme. DPs
and CSOs were actively involved during the design of the SEDP, and continue to be
involved in the process of its implementation through dialogue at various levels such as
through the BEDC, and the joint sector reviews.

8.0    FINANCIER'S PERFORMANCE
The financier fulfilled its obligation by releasing three trenches as agreed. The Financier
also participated fully in the Programme process activities such as dialogue, reviews and
provision of valuable inputs and guidance whenever necessary.

9.0    FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
A number of challenges are being experienced in the implementation process of the
SEDP. These include the following:

       · Absorbing the increasing number of pupils passing the PSLE into secondary
            schools and ensuring completion of secondary education cycle;

       · Training adequate number of teachers to match the expanding student
            enrolment and retaining them especially in the rural areas and in the A level
            schools;

       · Expanding support to Non-Government schools;

       · Providing scholarship grants to the growing number of needy pupils;

     · Improving the pass rate at `O' and `A' levels;

     · Providing care and support to education staff and students affected and
        infected with HIV and AIDS and addressing other cross-cutting issues like
        environmental degradation, gender and drug abuse;

     · Mobilizing financial resources to ensure that SEDP Financing Gap is bridged,
        flows are predictable and funding is optimized for selected priorities;

     · Improving operational effectiveness and efficiency of provision of secondary
        education through implementing Government policy of Decentralization by
        Devolution; and

     · Increasing the number of secondary school places for pupils with special
        learning needs.

10.0 LESSONS LEARNT

     During the programme preparation and implementation of the following lessons
     were learnt:

     · Involvement of key stakeholders in programme design with continued
        dialogue during implementation has a great impact on the performance of the
        programme activities.

     · Capacity building and Training of the key implementers at the initial stage of
        the programme is vital for effective implementation and realization of the
        intended outcomes.

     · Political will and commitment of the Government has greater influence on the
        Borrowers performance.

     · Non-government organizations complement the Government efforts in the
        provision of secondary education.

     · Increased community awareness that resulted into its higher participation in
        construction of community secondary schools, had greater impact in the
        access improvement to secondary education.
