Development Program\n            Project discusses potential negative environmental impacts\n            and proposes measures to mitigate them. Expected adverse\n            environmental impacts include: Poor planning may result in\n            poor choice of school location, which ultimately will lead\n            to land degradation and soil erosion, water (surface and\n            ground) contamination, degradation of natural habitats and\n            wetland ecosystems. During construction, poor performance of\n            civil works contractors may leads to unsuccessful\n            incorporation of mitigation measures. Poor implementation of\n            the maintenance plan during operational phases of the public\n            service infrastructure/school may be caused by lack of\n            funds, negligence of staff, or failure to monitor. Adverse\n            social impacts may arise from the absence of a participatory\n            process involving local communities when the government\n            prepares their school development plans; exclusion of\n            vulnerable groups due to barriers to access derived from\n            stigmatization, acute poverty, discrimination, and lack of\n            participation in the planning process; and land acquisition\n            resulting in involuntary resettlement, and impacts on people\n            and property."}, "docdt": "2004-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
