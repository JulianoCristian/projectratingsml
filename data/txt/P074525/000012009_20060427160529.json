Developing a Guarantee Facility at a regional scale is\n            the first for IDA. The Facility - which aims at fostering\n            small and medium-scale infrastructure projects that are\n            being developed in the WAEMU - is expected to set the\n            framework for future private sector infrastructure\n            developments in the region. The note reviews and explains\n            the Facility, developed in partnership by IDA, the\n            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and Agence\n            Franqaise de Developpement (AD), which provides a menu of\n            guarantee structures using streamlined procedures for small-\n            and medium-scale infrastructure projects. The Guarantee\n            Facility has been developed as a component of a broader\n            project, whose goal is to develop capital markets in the\n            region and mobilize public and private financing for the\n            region's infrastructure. The wider scope of the West\n            African Capital Market Development project also comprises a\n            technical assistance component, and a line of credit to help\n            achieve project objectives."}, "docdt": "2005-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
