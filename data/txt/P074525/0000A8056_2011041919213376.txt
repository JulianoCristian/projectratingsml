                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The principal objective of the proposed project is, through its three components (the Line of Credit, the Guarantee Facility and the Technical Assistance and
                         Institutional Support Component), to develop the capital markets in the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) region, and mobilize public and
                         private financing for the region's infrastructure development. The project is expected to contribute to the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
                         countries' efforts to achieve sustainable regional economic growth through the provision of efficient, region-wide infrastructure services and greater financial
                         market integration.

                         improved from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory thanks to the implementation of a set of measures recommended by the previous supervision mission. Procurement ratings
                         remain satisfactory.

                         1. The LOC: Delays incurred in the implementation of this component during the first 2 years of the project are still affecting its level of execution. Thanks to the adoption of bold
                         correcting measures regarding procurement and to a tighter supervision of both beneficiaries and project implementing unit the situation has substantially improved. To date all
                         benchmarks set-up after project restructuring have been met. As of November 2010, 7 projects out of 12 submitted to the Bank have been reviewed and approved. The five others
                         are at the final stage of the review process: the environmental and social assessment. Disbursement rate is 43% which amounts to US$ 39 million. According to BOAD resources of
                         this line of credit have contributed among other things to the construction of 1300 km of interstate roads, the upgrade of the physical infrastructure of the port of Lomé, the
                         establishment of the power interconnection lines between Cote d'Ivoire and Mali.
                         2. The TA Component:
                         2.1 BOAD: The objective of this component was to assist BOAD improve its operations and strengthen its institutional capacity paving the way to the rating of the institution.
                         Completion of rating process for BOAD by midterm review was one of the provisions of the credit agreement. Because of delays in the recruitment of the rating consultant and delays
                         in the implementation of its recommendations this legal commitment was not met at midterm. However thanks to implementation of other reforms under this sub-component, BOAD
                         enjoys a modern assets/liability management system. As a result, the institution was able to raise substantial capital in the regional financial and has achieved the following
                         performance between 2008 and 2009: 125% increase in overall commitment in project finance, 43% increase in net profit.
                         2.2 CREPMF, BRVM and WAEMU Commission: This sub-component has made substantial progress. Planned activities related to reform of guarantee system, introduction of rating,
                         establishment of a housing finance market, tax harmonization and the review of financial markets fees etc. were undertaken. As a result, markets institutions have gained efficiency.
                         The regulator performs adequate supervision of market activities, based on OICS evaluation, and the stock exchange is now profitable for the third FY in a row since its inception in
                         1998. More brokers have been licensed thus increasing market competition. Market capitalization has increased by 6.5 % in 2010 to reach FCFA 3 541,7 billion after a 13.5%
                         decrease in 2009 due impact of the financial crisis on companies in rubber and oil sector.
                         The mission noted however that some other key activities are experiencing significant delays and require over next year a renewed attention in order to be completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The TA component: It was agreed that project implementation should focus on activities than can be completed and closed by end of 2011. To that end beneficiaries and UCP have
                         been asked to resubmit a focused work program reflecting this requirement and including a clear timeline for each activity and a detailed budget.
                         The mission has approved the proposition by BOAD to include complementary activities related to the housing finance market or the BOAD/Equity entity. Reallocation of undisbursed
                         funds committed for activities related to CREMF (provided by AFD and managed by BOAD) should allow funding of these complementary activities.
                         As expected the project coordinator has left the project in September 2010 and is yet to be replaced. The mission has recommended that a high level BOAD staff (at least at director
                         level) be selected for this position.
                         The LOC component: The mission has highlighted the need to strengthen the PCU and beneficiaries capacity on social and environmental assessment. This will contribute to speed-
                         up the review for approval of projects submitted by beneficiaries for funding and the supervision of ongoing projects.
                         To ensure full disbursement of the line of credit before project closes, the mission and BOA have set the following targets for minimal quarterly disbursement:
                         i)        US $ 20 million, March 31, 2011
