1. Country and Sector Background
Main Issues
Over the last decade, the governments of the WAEMU countries have intensified their efforts to integrate their
fragmented economic and financial activities so that they can compete in the region and in the global environment as
one strong force The governments have envisioned creation of one common market, based on the free circulation of
people, goods, services, and capital with a common external tariff structure and commercial policies A number of
regional financial institutions have key roles to play in the attainement of this vision Two FSAP (Senegal and Cote
d'lvoire), a bond market strudy by IFC and a report on Capital market activities in by a ad'hoc UEMOA steering
committee highlihted several obstacles that these institutions face
(i)     Weak institltional capacitj'
In previous IDA financed operations, long term resources were provided to BOAD to finance its operations. While
BOAD has developed a good knowledge of market, clientele, and economic conditions, its performance has been
hampered by a lack of concessional funds to maintain and grow the public sector portfolio, an inadequate foreign
exchange regime to allow for hedging against foreign exchange risks as well as the aging of and insufficient training
of its staff The institutionial capacity issues include poor personnel planning and poor quality of internal auditing,
accounting, infomiation systems, procedures, and risk management. Finally BOAD does not have in place
appropriate environmental and social safeguard policies and guidelines Other UEMOA institutions (BRVM,
UEMOA Commission, and Consezi r6gionaI) also face similar institutional challenges
(ii)    Lack of referentce rates
One of the problems for private-sector firmis wishing to raise long-term capital in the regional bond market is that the



2
PID
market does not have a reliable benchmark yield against which bonds and other long-term assets can be rationally
priced Further, none of the memiiber country governments presently qualify as a benchmark issuer
The absence of reliable long-term reference rates is one of the fundamental problems in developing a more viable
corporate bond market in the region This was confirmed in interviews with both investors and issuers As in every
capital market, intermediaries take into account the prevailing general interest rate level, and the demand and supply
situation in the market According to local intermediaries, the coupoin rates of a bond issue are negotiated and
determined with reference to various exogenous and endogenous factors, such as, the Central Bank's discount rate,
commercial banks' prime lending rates, the level of market liquidity. the coupon rate of the most recent issue, the
sizes and names of issues in the pipeline, prices of seasoned bonds on the secondary market, and the quality of an
issue guarantor. The seasoned bonds that are most frequently referred to are BOAD bonds
At the same time, it appears extremely difficult to single out one government among the member country
governments as the issuer of benchmark issues that would form a reasonably useful long-term reference rates under
current circumstances The reasons for this include (i) the government of a member country is unlikely to assume the
responsibility for providing the market with a regular, sizable and stable supply of bonds of high quality and uniforimi
characteristics for the rest of the union members; (and in) it may prove difficult to reach a consensus among the
member countries on which government is financially and administratively most credible as the benchmark issuer
(0ii    Lack of long-ternt capital
Access to long-term capital in the region is hindered by limited capacity and inadequate knowledge of capital
markets/private investment activities among financial institutionis As of December 2000 bank credit stood at CFAF
3,033 billion of which only 4 percent (129 billion) was long-term (10 years or more)
Local commercial institutions have limited options in expanding their capacity since there are very few listed
financial instrumenits to sustain long-tenn resource mobilization. Both investors and institutions plan for short-term
goals and refrain from venturing into capital markets to raise long-term capital for their investment purposes. Hence,
most commercial banks deal only through traditional trade finanice activities in the region and have not been able to
introduce sophisticated financial products and services such as structured finance and syndicated loans in order to tap
into larger and cost effective financial activities The average financial depth (M2)/GDP in the region is below
25percent, as compared to 55percent in South Africa, signifying a shallow financial system, investors and consumers
are totally dependent on the local commercial banks to save or invest their limited financial assets Since most
deposits (51 percent as of December 2000) are sight or short-term  deposits below six months, there is an acute
shortage of long-term resources
The microfinance sector is characterized by a growing number of institutions but falls short in regulatory discipline
due, inter-alia, to lack of adequate supervision under the Ministries of Economy and Finance. Savings banks and
postal systems are week and lack technical investment expertise Insurance companies and social security schemes
suffer from a lack of autonomy and also lack capital markets investment know-how to understand the risk-return
relationships. At the sub-regional level, BOAD is the largest provider of medium- and long-tern financing It is the
primary non-sovereign debt issuing institutioni, and the de facto reference issuer in the regional financial market
The absence of an efficient mechanism for mobilizing medium and long term resoirces affects the development of
the private sector Local finns go to foreign lending institutions to compensate for this gap In addition, foreign
institutions are looking for local partners with some expertise in private investment and capital markets to handle
their portfolios Even an institution, such as BOAD has traditionally focused its financing to the public sector Until
recently, its procedures, organization, and in particular, its staff were more suited for public sector activities
However, since the early nineties with the CFAF devaluation in 1994, BOAD has been devoting more and more of
its operations to the private sector, to keep up with the changmig economic environment of its memilbers.
(iv)    Projectfitantcinigfor infrastructure is male (lifficult by the perception of high risk
Investment needs in basic infrastructure over the next five years in WAEMU countries are estimated at about US$2
billion Over the last decade, in an effort to set the stage for an increased level of private investments, most WAEMU
countries have embarked on far-reaching reforms, such as liberalization of infrastructure sectors, privatization of



3
PID
public enterprises and development of cross-border initiatives in transport, energy, telecom and water sectors
Despite this progress on the policy front in key areas, the UEMOA region is perceived as "high risk-high
transactions cost" by the private sector
The negative perception has emerged from repeated political instability in some countries and from the region's long
track record of a history of mixed policy performance subject to setbacks or delayed implementation Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) in WAEMU countries did increase six fold over the past decade because of the execution of the
privatization programs in C6te d'lvoire and Senegal However, this trend was short-lived, and following the political
crisis in C6te d'lvoire, FDI dropped by more than 40percent in West Africa and has remained depressed ever since
Despite the setbacks, WAEMU countries continue to implement reforsm aimed at increasing private investment to
improve and expand access and quality of infrastructure services However, fragile political conditions, specially in
C6te d'lvoire, and fear of political reversal have made it much harder to attract technically sound and experienced
investors.
The recent global events (terrorist attacks, political crisis in Cote d'lvoire, fall of Enron and Argentina crisis, its
contagion effect on other Latin American countries etc ) have further increased risk aversion of the private sector
towards emerginig markets worldwide These events have translated into substantial reduction in capital available
from private commercial lenders to support infrastructure in emerging markets. A number of strategic investors in the
wake of the Argentina and Enron crisis have also reconsidered their project portfolio with a view to reduce emerging
market exposure and dispel investors' fears  Furthermore, there is reduced availability of private political risk
insurance for emerging market projects becatise of losses incurred by the industry in 2001 and 2002
(v)     Inadequate enforcement of legal and regulatoryframework
Though WAEMU countries have been proactive in adopting appropriate legal and regulatory policies in order to
improve the business climate for foreign investors, the progress made on paper has had a poor track record in
implementation All of them have adopted theOrganisation poulr l'Harn-onisation dii Droit des Affaires en Afnique
(OHADA) business law which was set up by a treaty signed in October 1975, by the WAEMU Council of Ministries,
with the aim of promoting regional integration and economic growth through harmonization of business laws. While
OHADA provides an adequate legal framework for investors in the region, most aspects of the law remain unknown
in the investors and the legal community The laws on corporate bankruptcy and collateral realization appear a
positive step forvard, but the lack of sufficient competent legal professionals and widespread corruption constitute a
challenge Countries will have to overcome this challenge, possibly aided by the requirement for good governance
under the NEPAD initiative
Financial sector regulations in the zone, while generally adequate, is not systematically enforced The maturity
transfonnation ratio allowed for commercial banks, set at 25percent, is rarely enforcecZoTiheil regional
appears to be the sole regulator of the capital market in the region Although the extent of the power to supervise the
market given tcfonsed regional seems to be adequate, the instittition appears to lack adequate resources and
capacity to perform its functions and exercise its powers effectively. It still lacks financial independence and is
mainly funded through BCEAO. The problem lies principally with the experience and training 'ivntW
regional and its staff, and the structure of tUbrnseul itself For instanice, there is no full-time executive which
critical decison making power at Conseil's headquarters and thus decisions appear to take longer than usual Even the
regional stock exchange, BRVM, is not a self regulatory organization and plays no oversight role Both issuers and
investors are currently laden with time consuming procedures, high cost of bonds issuance and trading system, and
mandatory guarantee requiremenits
(vi)   Iiialeqllate h/arnmonizationt of tav policies
Taxation of income eaniied from investments in the region currently differ from one cotuntry to another This
encompasses taxes on dividend income, bond income and deductibility of inter-company dividend. While the
WAEMU authorities are aware of the desirability of tax harmonization across the region, a common understanding
of capital market activities exist among the key players.
2. Governments Strategy



4
PID
Many reforms have been implemented at a regional level A new regional banking law was adopted in 1989, the
regional Banking Commission was established in 1990, and a new regional insurance code was Lntroduced
Commercial banks were restructured in most of the UEMOA. The insurance sector was also restructured, with the
privatization of the major companies A new regional stock market was established with the creation of the BRVM in
Abidjan with unit in each of the member countries With these basic reforms in place, the Authorities are now
focusing on1 deepening the financial sector by improving capital market activities In this context the Counsel of
Ministers of UEMOA establissed a steering committee for capital market activities which drafted an action plan for
jump starting stock and bond market in the zone The action plan calls for, among other things, further strengthening
of key institutions that interact in the capital market such as BOAG3,il regional BCEAO, BRVM, the
UEMOA Commission and brokerage firms, and further improving the legal and regulatory environment In addition,
attention is also directed toward the establishment of a fast, reliable payment system supported by an ongoing IDA
credit
2. Objectives
The principal objectives of the proposed West African Capital Markets Development Project (the Project) are to (a)
contribute to the development of the capital market in the eight member countries, (b) support key institutions in the
regional financial market to improve their institutional capacity to provide increased access to medium and long-term
commuiercial financing on an ongoing basis, and (c) mobilize public and private financing for the region's
infrastructure development The project will therefore contribute to the West Afi-ica Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) countries' efforts to achieve sustainable regional economic growth and poverty reduction through
provision of efficient, region-wide infrastructure services and greater financial market integration WAEMU, among
other institutions, is intended to be one of the building blocks of the New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD) in West Africa. The 8 WAEMUJ countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali,
Niger, Senegal, and Togo) share the same currency (the CFA franc), the same central bank - (anque Centrale des
Etats de I'Afrique de 1'OuiesiBCEAO), the same development bal&nq-ue (OQuest-Africaine de
Developpement - BOAD), and implement coordinated economic and monetary policies As a regional development
bank, BOAD is expected to play a key role in mobilizing financing for investment requirements, and to support
deepening of financial markets
The Project's objective will be achieved through (i) reinforcing BOAD's capacity to finance its lending in the
regional capital market in a more sustainable manner partly by establishing BOAD bonds as market reference, and
strengthening of the existing capacity of the key capital market policymakers and regulatons Conseil regional,
BOAD, Bourse Rcgionale des Valeurs Mobilires(BRVM), and WAEMU Commission to facilitate capital raising
activities in the regional capital market, to capitalize on the results of previous operations, (n) providing medium
and long-tenn finance for a broad spectrum of public infrastructure projects which will contribute to regional
integration among the eight resource poor WAEMU countries; and (iii) providing risk mitigation instruments to
catalyze an increased volume of affordable longer-term  commercial financing of small and medium-sized
infrastructure
3. Rationale for Bank's Involvement
The Bank is seen by both the local counterparts, market participants, and the donor community as having credibility
in the development area and particularly in the financing and promotion of regional integration and poverty reduction
programs in Africa The Bank has already invested much in support of BOAD's efforts in the past and for the
reforms to be sustainable, institutional building must be a systematic and continual process The value added of the
Bank support consists of (i) Provision of technical expertise and experience in financial sector operations for which
IDA has recently developed a strategy; (n) ability to mobilize or leverage other donors contributions and (hi) ability
to provide a wide range of flexible and tailored instruments with a joint IDA/MIGA facility to mitigate risks
especially in tough regional and worldwide conditions and thus to support the spectrum (from very small to
medium-sized) of infrastructure investments in the region.

4. Description
The project will have three major components that contribute to the development of a unified financial market in the
WAEMU region In addition, the project will assist in strengthening project management, environmental and social
impact assessment, procurement, financial management capacity to ensure effective project implementation, as well
as assure the effective information disseminationi and communication throughout the project The following
summarizes the three component
Technical Assistance . This component is intended to build up institutional capacity of key players in the regional
financial market (BOAD, Conseil Regional, BCEAO, BRVm the UEMOA Commission ) and to design and
coordinate actions to be undertaken to develop the regional capital market It would strengthen their internal
capacities in specific areas where weaknesses have been identified, namely in management of assets/liabilities,
project supervision and monitoring, human resource managemiient and planning, internal management, and regulatory
framework, environmental and social assessment in order to give these institutions, tools to manage, in a satisfactory
manner capital market activities and development, foreign exchange risk, internal audits, risk management, etc.
IDA Line of Credit The IDA line of Credit will be used to promote economic integration among WAEMU countries
by providing the needed long term resources to fund selected "n1tegrating and environmentally sound" public
projects The line of credit will finance only the foreign currency portion of those projects with a high impact on
regional integration. Project selection and appraisal criteria will be the same as those used by the World Bank. Given
UEMOA's current financial policy under which projects are financed essentially out of financial market resources
commercially available in the region, the proposed IDA funding will be allocated primarily to the public sector
components of selected investnment projects that will require some preferential and/or long-term financing
The IDA/MIGA Guaranteefacilily The objective of the proposed IDA Guarantee Facility is to help catalyze private
investments in small and medium-sized infrastructire and privatization projects in the WAEMU member countries
by mitigating critical government performance risks, which cuLTently constrain investor's interest BOAD would
support the Facility by (i) marketing the facility, (n) identifyiing sub-projects, and (iii) assisting IDA/MIGA in the
preparation, appraisal and supervision of sub-projects that require political risk mitigation. It is also expected that
during the implementation of the Guarantee And in so doing, It is envisaged that the institutional capacity of BOAD
will be increased, thereby enabling it to support private infrastructure projects effectively In addition, the Guarantee
Facility would seek to reduce delays. and lower cost of access to thcse instruments for relatively small projects, and
accelerate identification and processing of such projects
5. Financing

6. Implementation
The final implementaion arrangement will depend on the project financing structure that will be discussed and agreed
on during the April 22-23 meeting with all the beneficiaries. Two alternatives scenarios have been developed by the
team .
The first scenario is that BOAD is the only borrower from IDA and will channel resources to other beneficiary
institutions The second alternative is to have on one side BOAD borrow from IDA for the Line of Credit and its own
Technical Assistance, and on the other side, BCEAO borrow from IDA the residual amount for the Technical
Assistance to channel the fund to the other beneficiaries such as Conseil Regional, UEMOA Commission and BRVM
No matter what alternative is retained, the project implemnation arrangement will evolve around the following
structure



6
PID
The project will be implemented by a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) under the overall supervision of
BCEAO and/or Conseil regional The PIC will be responsible for. (a) coordinating the implementation of the various
components of the project in accordance with sound financial management practices, including procurement,
disbursement, accounting and auditing of accounts, and (b) monitoring the implementation of the project and
furnishing reports to the BCEAO, BOAD,Conseil regional and WAEMU Commission, BRVM as well as to IDA on
progress made in project
The PIC would consist of a Project Coordinator (Chairman of the PIC) and the four Project Managers wxho would be
responsible for the managemenit of the various project activities in their respective institutions The Project Managers
will be located in each of the project beneficiaries which are BCEAO, BO11sedl regionaz BRVM and the
WAEMU Commission The Project Coordinator may be drawn from BCE90;sed regional or BOAD staff
depending on his/lher ability to effectively lead the implementation of a multi-activity project
The project will be implemented over a five year period from  2004 to 2009 The PIC will be required to meet
regularly, at least once every three months, to assess progress made in the project and agree on the implementation
plan for the following quarter as well as review other implementation issues including budgeting, supervision reports,
and financial management matters The operating expenses of the PIC and project managers will be covered by the
project, with the exception of logistical expenses (i e , office, office equipment, electricity and water, which are to be
covered by each institution). The salaries of persons working on the project would follow salary scale of their
institutions in order to avoid disparities and facilitate the retention of personnel after project completion
Specifically in BOAD, adequate staff would be assigned to specific functions, such as financial management and
accounting, procuremenlt, environmental and social impact assessment, project supervision and monitoring, guarantees
and risk insurance The key personnel assigned to these functions would be trained and would receive adequate
support to enable them to assume full responsibility for those functions during project implementation and within the
institution even after the project's completion
For the IDA & MIGA Guarantee, a special unit within BOAD will assist in the initial screening of project
documentation and data collection. The unit will liaise IDA, MIGA and clients and will benefit from staff seconded by
the World Bank Group as part of a capacity building exercise BOAD's strong relationships with the Bank Group since
its inception, its experience in project preparation and evaluation, and its physical presence in each of the eight
WAEMU countries makes BOAD well suited to market risk mitigation instruments to the private investors,
commercial lenders and the host governments BOAD will be initially expected to be involved in the following tasks
(i) marketing and promoting the facility, (n) identifying and screening sub-projects; and (ii) assisting in the processing
of sub-projects It is proposed that BOAD offices throughout the region, in consultation with local and foreign
commercial lenders, potential investors, and host governments would respond to inquiries from private sponsors or
identify investmiienlt projects requiring mitigation against sovereign risks.
7. Sustainability
UEMOA contries can only develop if there is a sound economic policy framework in place (includinig
macro-stability), effective support for the private sector through strengthieninig of capacity of key actors
in the capital market and basic infrastructure promotinig integrationi and economic growth The project
stIpports these two conditionis. It provides technical assistance to promote teh regional capital market, it
will provide partial risk guarantee to promote private investment in te region and teh liie of credit will be
used to finanice public ifinastructure
While contributing to develop a stable economic and policy frinaework by strengthiening capacity of key
palyers in the regioanl capital market, the reforms supported by the project require a stable policy and
and economic framework to sustainable in the long run It is this interaction that will contribtite to the
long run sustaiiabilty of both.

8. Lessons learned from past operations in the countrv/sector
Technical assistance, credit lines and guarantee projects often take more time to develop than is originally estimated
and therefore more time should be allowed for consenisus-buildinig and learning from previous shortcomings In
particular the project has identified the following key lessons learned
*   Simplicity in project design will be key to respond to client's needs quicle design of project
components should be kept as simple as possible and should be based on well targeted objectives, well
defined actions plans with timetables for implementation, and clear evaluation criteria with monitorable
indicators The scope of the program should be realistic and take into account a realistic assessment of their
capacity and compatibility, not only withiin the political realities but also within the institutional absorptive
capacity of the agencies that are the main beneficiaries of the project to implement the project Towards this
purpose, the design of the Project allows for some flexibility to respond to the changing conditions in the
WAEMU     institutional and political during implementation  To avoid cumbersomile addition of new
personnel, no new units or institutionis will be created, the project will rely on strengthening existing
structures that have the required capacity and the capability to implement the activities For the guarantee
facility, BOAD would act as a third-party intermediary between IDA and the private sector with an
understanding that satisfactory due-diligence would be undertaken by IDA and that the sub-projects will
meet the IDA's environmental and social safeguard policies
*   Stakeholders involvement during project preparation and implementation is a key to achieve the
development objectives. The main lesson learned from the last IDA three lines of credit to BOAD is that
participatory approach is crucial for adequate preparation as well as for a regular review on project's
progress Only with active partnerships, identification of corrective measures during project implementation
could be achieved. Therefore the project is being prepared with full participation of key monetary
authorities to ensure proper allocation and coordination of project activities among the beneficiaries by
matching individual institutional needs This process also requires that the Bank monitors the progress and
conducts appropriate due-diligence on the sub-projects to be financed under the credit to ensure the quality
and the focus of the impact indicators set in the project To this effect, all sub-projects under the guarantee
facility will be reviewed as necessary by Bank staff and the guarantee would be approved by the RVP
before it Is issued.
*    Local expertise is a key to enhance borrower's ownership of the projec4nother lesson learnt is that
local ownership of the project leads to more effective reform programs Local ownership usually increases
if there is local participation in the project design In order to encourage borrower's commitment, wherever
possible, the procurement of goods and services, including consultants, will encourage local participation
This process has already been incorporated; the project concept document for this project has been prepared
with assistance and input from BOAD senior management who have been instrumental in identifying the
scope and content of the project
*   Development of a demand survey for the target markeffhe main lessons learned from reviewing six
guarantees/insurance facilities are that these facilities should be prepared based on a project survey of the
target market, including the private sector and the governments to obtain clear indications of demand for the
instruments offered  Reviewers have recommended wherever possible to use an existing institution,
provided it has the needed capability to undertake the project It has also been proposed that the Bank
should keep tighter control of the quality of the sub-projects and the due diligence process, including
enforcement of our safeguards policies The facility component of the proposed Project is being structured
to incorporate the lessons learnt The design of the proposed project seeks to address these three concerns
The provision of the Guarantee Facility relies on the demand survey (see Annex VI) and strong indication
of interest, which will be reconfirmed before negotiations The Facility also relies upon a regional
development bank - BOAD, rather than setting up of a new institution to administer the facility, BOAD
would act as a third-party intermediary between IDA and the private sector with an understanding that
satisfactory due-diligence would be undertaken by IDA and that the sub-projects will meet the IDA's
environmental and social safeguard policies Last, btit not least, all sub-projects will be reviewed as
necessary by Bank staff and the guarantee would be approved by the RVP before it is issued

9. Environment Aspects (including any public consultation)
Issues  : Projects to be financed under the line of credit will be subject to the same environmental criteria
and screening as the World Bank financed projects Because BOAD environmental capacity is weak or inexistent,
technical assistance will be provided under the project to build such a capacity to a level consistent withi World Bank
standards During project implementation, the team would seek to ensure that all BOAD projects (and not only those
that we use) be environmentally screened using criteria that the World Bank uses.
