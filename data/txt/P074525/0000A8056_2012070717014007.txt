                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The principal objective of the proposed project is, through its three components (the Line of Credit, the Guarantee Facility and the Technical Assistance and Institutional
                         Support Component), to develop the capital markets in the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) region, and mobilize public and private financing for the
                         region's infrastructure development. The project is expected to contribute to the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries' efforts to achieve
                         sustainable regional economic growth through the provision of efficient, region-wide infrastructure services and greater financial market integration.

                         Overall, the project has met and even exceeded most its targets after it underwent a level II restructuring in June 2008 to overcome shortcomings due its complexity and although the
                         crisis in Cote d'Ivoire had affected the Abidjan based regional stock exchange (BRVM) and the market regulator (CREPMF). The project disbursement rate has now reached over

                         96%. It is expected to fully disburse during the grace period. The FM and procurement ratings remain satisfactory due to the implementation of a set of measures recommended by
                         previous supervision missions.

                         The major shortcomings of the project were its complexity and design, particularly the choice of the guarantee facility and the number of stakeholders involved in the project.

                         The initial project had three components: (i) a technical assistance component (IDA finances US$6.4 millions, CIDA finances CAD3.1millions and AFD finances Euros 7millions); (ii)
                         an IDA funded Line of Credit Component (US$89 million) for the financing of road sub-projects; and (iii) a Guarantee Facility (total amount of US$227.25 million of which IDA US$70
                         million, MIGA US$70 million and AFD US$87.25 million).

                         The guarantee facility was designed to use BOAD as intermediary in the region to identify and process private infrastructure projects in need of risk mitigation instruments to be
                         provided by IDA, MIGA and AFD, using their own balance sheet. Two years after project effectiveness, no guarantee had been issued. Almost from the time of effectiveness, the
                         guarantee facility was plagued by problems. A QER questioned the choice of BOAD to house this facility and the analysis of the demand for guarantees. Experience had shown that
                         BOAD did not have the capacity to market the facility and to analyze the requests for guarantees.

                         Also, the project had too many stakeholders. Four donors, [(IDA, MIGA, Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)] are
                         involved in the project. Although the West African Development Bank (BOAD) is the Borrower, there are five beneficiaries of the Project: BOAD, the regulator of the regional capital
                         market (Conseil Régional de l’Epargne Publique et des Marchés Financiers-CREPMF), the regional stock exchange (Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières- BRVM) and the
                         WAEMU Commission. The DCA between the IDA and BOAD was signed on April 24, 2004 and became effective on July 29, 2005, more than one year later, due to the complexity of
                         the project and the need for the eight countries to ratify the documents. Also, There was a cross-conditionally between the development credit agreement and the guarantee facility
                         agreement; the latter had to be ratified by the eight Parliaments with a legal opinion from the eight Supreme Courts, before the whole project could become effective. An amendment
                         to the guarantee facility agreement was signed by the eight ministers of finance that would enable the guarantee facility agreement to be ratified by only four of the member countries
                         for effectiveness.

                         As a result of the above-mentioned issues the project underwent a level II restructuring in June 2008 consisting of (i) canceling the guarantee facility; and (ii) expanding the eligibility
                         criteria of the LOC under to include other infrastructure projects in addition to roads and raise the total cost of sub projects to be eligible under the line of credit (it was initially limited
                         to US$15million). The restructured project consists of (i) the technical assistance component; and (ii) the IDA Line of Credit (US$ 89 million) for the financing of regional infrastructure
                         sub-projects. The Project implementation gained momentum and its performance has drastically improved.

                         Two indicators are used to capture the PDO of the restructured project: (i) the number of companies issuing bond in the regional market), and (ii) increase in the number of
                         companies listed in the Abidjan based regional stock exchange.

                         The first indicator was exceeded. It demonstrated that over 50 companies and all but 1 of the 8 WAEMU countries are now raising funds in the capital market by issuing bond.
                         Although the second indicator is below the target (net number of companies listed in the stock market, has only increased by one from the baseline), the exchange has become more
                         regional as companies from other countries have been listed. Also market capitalization increased over the years despite the 2008 financial crisis. The main reason for the
                         underperformance is the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire which caused the stock exchange to close and relocate to Bamako (Mali) and the market regulator to relocate to Lome.
                         All intermediate indicators have been met or exceeded, all of which are related to the achievement of the PDO and project outcome i.e. development of the capital market and

                         mobilization of financing for project finance. Below is a summary of the project achievements per component which aim at strengthening key regional capital markets institutions (7%
                         of the project) and proving a line of credit to the West African development Bank to finance regional infrastructure projects (93% of the project).

                         I. The TA Component (IDA US$7m and CIDA US$2m)
                         1.1 TA to West African Development Bank (BOAD): The objective of this component wasto assist BOAD improve its operations and strengthen its institutional capacity paving the
                         way to its rating. Due to the project support, BOAD has become a stronger development finance institution that extends now public as well as private project finance loan and TA to
                         member countries. It has become a benchmark issuer in the regional market as no single country was able to play that role. The project assisted BOAD to implement many reforms
                         including (i) adoption of a modern assets/liability management system, (iii) Reforms its liquidity managements system to increase predictability and efficiency; (iii) a better human
                         resources planning and management, (iv) creation and staffing of a safeguard unit, (iv) the adoption of the international accounting standard (IFRS) and (v) bringing stakeholders with
                         good standing/credit rating in its capital. BOAD has now become a more profitable and a more efficient institution.

                         The obtention of the credit rating will help bring market discipline, help the progress achieved to be maintained and be sustainable. The key issue is how to ensure that BOAD will be
                         able to raise more capital in markets to face growing demands from member countries and the private sector. Also BOAD is now engaged into new initiatives such as developing a
                         housing refinancing facility, PPPs (playing and advisory role to its member countries). Although the project has given BOAD tools to be more effective, some of these initiatives might
                         require technical assistance.

                         1.2 CREPMF, BRVM and WAEMU Commission: This sub-component has completed all its planned activities, and have taken on new challenges that have emerged from the Cote
                         d'Ivoire crisis including helping the market regulator and the stock exchange after the crisis to relocate back to Abidjan. Major structural reforms implemented include (i) reform of the
                         guarantee system and the introduction of a disclosure and a rating system (ii) harmonization of tax on financial products across the 8 countries, (iii) the revision and simplification of
                         the capital market markets fees structure etc. As a result, markets institutions have gained efficiency. The regulator performs adequate supervision of market activities, based on
                         evaluations conducted by the International Association for Securities Commissions (IASC). Also, the stock exchange has become profitable for the fist time in 2009 since its inception
                         in 1998. More brokers have been licensed thus increasing market competition. Regional cooperation led to the cross listing of enterprises in the WEAMU exchange, the Lagos
                         (Nigeria) Stock Exchange and the Ghana stock exchanges. The project has therefore contributed to the market move toward cost effectiveness as its institutions have become
                         profitable. The full cost effectiveness now lie on the sustainability of these developments/progress and on the ability of these institutions to sustain new investment to make keep
                         pace with the increasing size o of the market as the new SME compartment will be open and OTC window will be affective.

                         II. The Line of Credit (LOC) (IDAUS$89m)

                         Delays incurred in the implementation of this component during the first 4 years have been reduced and all sub projects funded under the LOC have are now being implemented. The
                         disbursement rate on the LOC has now reached 95% (from 2% in FY09, 23.5% in FY10 and 66% in FY11). Resources of the Line of Credit have contributed to the construction of
                         1,031km of interstate roads (8 projects), the upgrade of the physical infrastructure of the port of Lome which a regional port that serves also Niger, Burkina and Mali. These projects
                         were selected based on their regional dimension and their ERRs that exceed 12%. These projects have a total cost of US$506 million (financed by BOAD for US$156million of which
                         the US$89million LOC and resource raised in the market for US$67million), and other donors for US$346million. The LOC was used as leverage by BOAD by a ratio of 1 to 2 and for
                         resources from other donors and BOAD combined by a ratio of 1 to 6.
