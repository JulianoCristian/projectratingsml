To this end, one of its components supports the\n            development of a strategy towards an integrated transport\n            sector, backed by the Roads Sector Environmental and Social\n            Management Framework Study, which assesses global\n            environmental, and social conditions as related to road\n            construction. This environmental management plan (EMP)\n            reviews the study, and accordingly, identifies mitigation\n            measures, applicable to the West Africa countries - Benin,\n            Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali,\n            Niger, Senegal, and Togo - to minimize environmental\n            adversity as a result of road construction. Mainly, this EMP\n            endorses the Framework Study recommendations, and\n            incorporates measures as follows. The West African\n            Development Bank will establish environmental and social\n            guidelines, provide technical assistance (TA), and ensure\n            mechanisms to enforce environmental protection regulations.\n            Specifically, regarding the roads sector, and following\n            public awareness campaigns, member states should adopt\n            directives for inclusion of precautionary clauses in road\n            construction contracts that include water and soil pollution\n            control, noise abatement, waste management control, and\n            traffic safety measures. Additionally, environmental\n            training should be provided to transport service personnel,\n            executing agencies staff, and nongovernmental organizations,\n            including on environmental monitoring, and the conduct of\n            internal and mid-term evaluation of road construction practices."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
