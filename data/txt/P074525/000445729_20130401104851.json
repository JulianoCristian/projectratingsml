West Africa Economic and\n            Monetary Union (WAEMU) Capital Market Development Project\n            for Africa were as follows: overall outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory; borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. The principal\n            objective of the project was to develop the capital markets\n            in the WAEMU region, and mobilize public and private\n            financing for the region infrastructure development. The\n            project is expected to contribute to the WAEMU countries\n            efforts to achieve sustainable regional economic growth\n            through the provision of efficient, region wide\n            infrastructure services and greater financial market\n            integration. There were some important project lessons\n            learned: (i) well-identified pipeline of projects and\n            actions is critical for effectively establishing a guarantee\n            facility; (ii) guarantee facilities require the\n            identification of strong and capacitated intermediaries\n            prior to the commencement of operations; (iii) effectiveness\n            conditions should be realistic; (iv) multi-donor operations\n            require clear and efficient implementation arrangements; (v)\n            the implementation of project activities co-financed by\n            different donors created practical; and (vi) project\n            supervision requires close oversight, and active\n            decision-making from management in light of early warning signs."}, "docdt": "2013-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
