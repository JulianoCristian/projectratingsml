The objectives of the project were to: (a) augment\n            power supplies to the capital; (b) improve the reliability\n            of transmission and reduce system losses; (c) reduce\n            environmental pollution from power generation; (d) move\n            towards more efficient use of existing assets in the power\n            supply system; (e) identify economic opportunities for\n            improving the quality of coal use in power generation; and,\n            (f) effect a program of administrative, financial and\n            operational improvements in DESU. Bank\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) a sound financial\n            health is a key element to the success of a utility; (b) the\n            need for energy conservation on the customer State\n            Electricity Board (SEB) side and demand management by the\n            utility through the adoption of appropriate tariffs and\n            tariff structure at SEBs and through end-use efficiencies;\n            e) project preparation, with all its components, should be\n            completed in detail well ahead of loan negotiations; and (f)\n            failure by reputed local manufacturers to deliver critical\n            equipment on time has caused the project long delays."}, "docdt": "1996-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
