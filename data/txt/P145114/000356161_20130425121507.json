{"cdata!": "The Quality of Decentralized Service\n            Delivery Support Development Policy Operation Program\n            development objective for Rwanda is to support the\n            Government to clarify institutional roles and\n            responsibilities for decentralized service delivery and to\n            enhance public transparency, fiduciary accountability, and\n            local government capacity for improved access to quality\n            services. The design of this operation has benefited from\n            close collaboration with the Government, development\n            partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various\n            stakeholders. This operation builds on the decentralization\n            and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing\n            World Bank operations. It targets key medium term challenges\n            to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan\n            citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen\n            participation and ownership of the development process, the\n            Government has identified the decentralization process as\n            the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The\n            Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances\n            and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through\n            this operation will help the Government maintain public\n            expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are\n            relevant for poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of\n            financial resources may also reduce the Government's\n            ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will\n            help the Government maintain momentum in important reform\n            areas such as capacity building, public financial management\n            (PFM) and social accountability."}, "docdt": "2013-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
