with a moderate risk to development\n            outcome. The performances by both the Bank and the Borrower\n            were highly satisfactory. There was no restructuring or any\n            other significant changes to this project. There are a\n            number of lessons to learn from this operation, especially\n            from the context to design and implementation. The following\n            six lessons learned from the project are as follows: (1)\n            Difficult context and circumstances provided opportunities\n            for stakeholders to cooperate and think \u0091outside the box\u0092 on\n            what is politically feasible. (2) Understanding the\n            political economy context of the operation was critical:\n            This operation demonstrates the need to understand and\n            navigate the political economy context. The Bank had to\n            understand and respond to the political sensitivities\n            surrounding the UN report and consequent withdrawal of\n            general budget support. At the same time it had to maintain\n            entry points for dialogue with the Government and keep DPs\n            on board by supporting an area of governance that most DPs\n            and stakeholders will not oppose but will concur. (3)\n            Leveraging cooperation within the World Bank to ensure\n            timely client responsiveness: The operation was prepared in\n            record time of about 12 weeks from concept to Board\n            approval. (4) Government commitment and leadership was a\n            critical success factor. (5) Setting demanding targets with\n            flexibility. The Operation used well-defined and precise\n            metrics to assess enhancements in the framework on\n            decentralized service delivery, subnational capacity and\n            participation, and the indicators were applied with high\n            requirements on the Government\u0092s actions and commitment. (6)\n            Strategic choice of DPO to keep the door open for engagement\n            on governance: The difficult circumstances under which the\n            Bank had to make a quick decision on which financing\n            instrument to use are informative. With the collapse of the\n            space for dialogue under general budget support, there was\n            an urgent need to keep the dialogue going; the choice was\n            between having a DPO or no operation on governance."}, "docdt": "2014-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
